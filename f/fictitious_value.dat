40|$|Elasticity {{theory is}} an {{important}} component of continuum mechanics and has had widely spread applications in science and engineering. Material interfaces are ubiquity in nature and man-made devices, and often give rise to discontinuous coefficients in the governing elasticity equations. In this work, the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method is developed to address elasticity interface problems. Linear elasticity theory for both isotropic homogeneous and inhomogeneous media is employed. In our approach, Lamé's parameters can have jumps across the interface and are allowed to be position dependent in modeling isotropic inhomogeneous material. Both strong discontinuity, i. e., discontinuous solution, and weak discontinuity, namely, discontinuous derivatives of the solution, are considered in the present study. In the proposed method, <b>fictitious</b> <b>values</b> are utilized so that the standard central finite different schemes can be employed regardless of the interface. Interface jump conditions are enforced on the interface, which in turn, accurately determines <b>fictitious</b> <b>values.</b> We design new MIB schemes to account for complex interface geometries. In particular, the cross derivatives in the elasticity equations are difficult to handle for complex interface geometries. We propose secondary <b>fictitious</b> <b>values</b> and construct geometry based interpolation schemes to overcome this difficulty. Numerous analytical examples are used to validate the accuracy, convergence and robustness of the present MIB method for elasticity interface problems with both small and large curvatures, strong and weak discontinuities, and constant and variable coefficients. Numerical tests indicate second order accuracy in both L_∞ and L_ 2 norms. Comment: 27 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for accurately describing arbitrary-shaped free boundaries in single-grid finite-difference schemes for elastodynamics, in a time-domain velocity-stress framework. The basic idea is as follows: <b>fictitious</b> <b>values</b> {{of the solution}} are built in vacuum, and injected into the numerical integration scheme near boundaries. The most original feature of this method {{is the way in}} which these <b>fictitious</b> <b>values</b> are calculated. They are based on boundary conditions and compatibility conditions satisfied by the successive spatial derivatives of the solution, up to a given order that depends on the spatial accuracy of the integration scheme adopted. Since the work is mostly done during the preprocessing step, the extra computational cost is negligible. Stress-free conditions can be designed at any arbitrary order without any numerical instability, as numerically checked. Using 10 grid nodes per minimal S-wavelength with a propagation distance of 50 wavelengths yields highly accurate results. With 5 grid nodes per minimal S-wavelength, the solution is less accurate but still acceptable. A subcell resolution of the boundary inside the Cartesian meshing is obtained, and the spurious diffractions induced by staircase descriptions of boundaries are avoided. Contrary to what occurs with the vacuum method, the quality of the numerical solution obtained with this method is almost independent of the angle between the free boundary and the Cartesian meshing.

40|$|Elastic {{materials}} are ubiquitous {{in nature and}} indispensable components in man-made devices and equipments. When a device or equipment involves composite or multiple elastic materials, elasticity interface problems come into play. The solution of three dimensional (3 D) elasticity interface problems is significantly more difficult than that of elliptic counterparts due to the coupled vector components and cross derivatives in the governing elasticity equation. This work introduces the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method for solving 3 D elasticity interface problems. The proposed MIB method utilizes <b>fictitious</b> <b>values</b> on irregular grid points near the material interface to replace function values in the discretization so that the elasticity equation can be discretized using the standard finite difference schemes {{as if there were}} no material interface. The interface jump conditions are rigorously enforced on the intersecting points between the interface and the mesh lines. Such an enforcement determines the <b>fictitious</b> <b>values.</b> A number of new technique are developed to construct efficient MIB schemes for dealing with cross derivative in coupled governing equations. The proposed method is extensively validated over both weak and strong discontinuity of the solution, both piecewise constant and position-dependent material parameters, both smooth and nonsmooth interface geometries, and both small and large contrasts in the Poisson's ratio and shear modulus across the interface. Numerical experiments indicate that the present MIB method is of second order convergence in both L_∞ and L_ 2 error norms. Comment: 40 pages, 23 page...|$|R

Governments have spent trillions of taxpayer dollars propping up the banking system in order to avoid systemic financial collapse. Significant public policy questions are being raised about the sustainability of the monetarist macroeconomic paradigm and the dogmatic neoliberal faith in financial deregulation. Media discourses have included open criticism of the finance sector. However, the right of private banks to create money through the issuance of credit and the generation of <b>fictitious</b> <b>values</b> through the securitisation of anticipated future revenue remain peripheral to policy debate, even though they {{lie at the heart of}} the recent crises. Although Marx provided the seminal critique of capitalism’s internal contradictions, his work on credit-money and financial accumulation processes were never fully developed. However, the more recent work of Hyman Minsky emphasises the role of credit systems in financial markets’ endogenous tendency toward crisis.

6000|$|One of {{the treasures}} I {{had managed to}} {{preserve}} in my sojourn with these children of nature, who were always anxious to become possessors of my belongings, was a small prettily fashioned metal match-box, opening with a spring. Remembering that Kua-ko, among others, had looked at this trifle with covetous eyes--the covetous {{way in which they}} all looked at it had given it a <b>fictitious</b> <b>value</b> in my own--I tried to bribe him with the offer of it to accompany me to my favourite haunt. The brave young hunter refused again and again; but on each occasion he offered to perform some other service or to give me something in exchange for the box. At last I told him that I would give it to the first person who should accompany me, and fearing that someone would be found valiant enough to win the prize, he at length plucked up a spirit, and on the next day, seeing me going out for a walk, he all at once offered to go with me. He cunningly tried to get the box before starting--his cunning, poor youth, was not very deep! I told him that the forest we were about to visit abounded with plants and birds unlike any I had seen elsewhere, that I wished to learn their names and everything about them, and that when I had got the required information the box would be his--not sooner. Finally we started, he, as usual, armed with his zabatana, with which, I imagined, he would procure more game than usually fell to his little poisoned arrows. When we reached the wood I {{could see that he was}} ill at ease: nothing would persuade him to go into the deeper parts; and even where it was very open and light he was constantly gazing into bushes and shadowy places, as if expecting to see some frightful creature lying in wait for him. This behaviour might have had a disquieting effect on me had I not been thoroughly convinced that his fears were purely superstitious and that there could be no dangerous animal in a spot I was accustomed to walk in every day. My plan was to ramble about with an unconcerned air, occasionally pointing out an uncommon tree or shrub or vine, or calling his attention to a distant bird-cry and asking the bird's name, in the hope that the mysterious voice would make itself heard and that he would be able to give me some explanation of it. But for upwards of two hours we moved about, hearing nothing except the usual bird voices, and during all that time he never stirred a yard from my side nor made an attempt to capture anything. At length we sat down under a tree, in an open spot close to the border of the wood. He sat down very reluctantly, and seemed more troubled in his mind than ever, keeping his eyes continually roving about, while he listened intently to every sound. The sounds were not few, owing to the abundance of animal and especially of bird life in this favoured spot. I began to question my companion as to some of the cries we heard. There were notes and cries familiar to me as the crowing of the cock--parrot screams and yelping of toucans, the distant wailing calls of maam and duraquara; and shrill laughter-like notes of the large tree-climber as it passed from tree to tree; the quick whistle of cotingas; and strange throbbing and thrilling sounds, as of pygmies beating on metallic drums, of the skulking pitta-thrushes; and with these mingled other notes less well known. One came from the treetops, where it was perpetually wandering amid the foliage a low note, repeated at intervals of a few seconds, so thin and mournful and full of mystery that I half expected to hear that it proceeded from the restless ghost of some dead bird. But no; he only said it was uttered by a [...] "little bird"--too little presumably to have a name. From the foliage of a neighbouring tree came a few tinkling chirps, as of a small mandolin, two or three strings of which had been carelessly struck by the player. He said that it came from a small green frog that lived in trees; and in this way my rude Indian--vexed perhaps at being asked such trivial questions--brushed away the pretty fantasies my mind had woven in the woodland solitude. For I often listened to this tinkling music, and it had suggested the idea that the place was frequented by a tribe of fairy-like troubadour monkeys, and that if I could only be quick-sighted enough I might one day be able to detect the minstrel sitting, in a green tunic perhaps, cross-legged on some high, swaying bough, carelessly touching his mandolin, suspended from his neck by a yellow ribbon.|$|E

This paper presents an efficient and robust load flow algorithm for application to transmission and distribution networks. In order to face keen competition in market, the coordinated operation between transmission and distribution systems is required.

40|$|David Hume {{comes at}} the end of a long and venerable {{tradition}} of monetary analysis harking back to Aristotle (see Vickers 1959). It is not too much of a distortion of the historical record to maintain that after Hume’s essays on the subject, money faded into the background of economic theory until the writings of Knud Wicksell, Irving Fisher and John Maynard Keynes in the first half of the twentieth century. This claim is not meant to imply that no one wrote about money during the second half of the eighteenth century, or throughout the nineteenth century. Many did, producing numerous treatises on banking, currency, and credit. But money was no longer the point of departure for economic theory as found in the many Principles texts produced with great regularity from James Steuart to Alfred Marshall. 1 As John Stuart Mill characteristically remarked in his Principles of Political Economy, there is no “more insignificant thing, in the economy of society, than money ” (Mill 1965 [1848], 3 : 506). Hume’s essay “Of Money ” commences with its denigration: “Money is not, properly speaking, one of the subjects of commerce ” (Hume 1985 u [1752 c], 281).

40|$|Dynamic {{relaxation}} is an {{iterative method}} to solve nonlinear systems of equations, which is frequently used for form finding {{and analysis of}} structures that undergo large displacements. It {{is based on the}} solution of a fictitious dynamic problem where the vibrations of the structure are traced by means of a time integration scheme until a static equilibrium is reached. <b>Fictitious</b> <b>values</b> are used for the mass and damping parameters. Heuristic rules exist to determine these values {{in such a way that}} the time integration procedure converges rapidly without becoming unstable. Central to these heuristic rules is the assumption that the highest convergence rate is achieved when the ratio of the highest and lowest eigenfrequency of the structure is minimal. This short communication shows that all eigenfrequencies become identical when a fictitious mass matrix proportional to the stiffness matrix is used. If, in addition, specific values are used for the fictitious damping parameters and the time integration step, the dynamic relaxation method becomes completely equivalent to the Newton-Raphson method. The Newton-Raphson method can therefore be regarded as a specific form of dynamic relaxation. This insight may help to interpret and improve nonlinear solvers based on dynamic relaxation and/or the Newton-Raphson method. status: accepte...|$|R

Concentrations are bounded by the worst credible circumstances within a normal aircraft pesticide spraying. It is assumed that spherical spray droplets are transported by a two dimensional parametric representation of a spray-engulfing aircraft wing-tip vortex pair. Two distinctive flow regions were considered for the spray-vortex dynamics. The first occurs {{in the vicinity of the}} vortex pair center where pesticide evaporation/ condensation, advection/convection were the predominant mass transfer processes. The second occurs away from the vortex center where anisotropic dispersion, droplet gravitational settling and decaying vortex-induced motion effects are represented by a physically consistent atmospheric transport model. The solution parameters were determined in a heuristic manner by association to physical entities known to influence the spray drift. Particular cases of the equations closely resembled previously published expressions of the specialized literature. For validation purposes, canopy and ground deposit measurements from an aircraft spraying field experiment were relatively compared to predicted values of airborne concentrations. The correlation with field trials pesticide drift measurements improved as the distance from the direct aircraft flight line increased. The proposed method explained from 24 % to 69 % of the canopy deposit data variability and from 58 % to 79 % of the trials ground deposit data. However, <b>fictitious</b> <b>values</b> were always obtained near the direct aircraft swath, which were removed by means of a filter function.

40|$|Inaugurated in 1997, the Frank Gehry {{designed}} Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, {{gave rise}} to the term Bilbao Effect to describe the economic transformation of a city effected through regeneration and gentrification. The commodification of culture and new landmark iconic signature buildings by starchitects that ‘house’ this culture, have become the primary features of the processes of the Bilbao Effect in post-industrial cities. In a globally competitive neoliberal economy the state and corporate sector desire to be ‘seen’ commissioning and inhabiting these iconic buildings as a reflection of their financial status and aspirations; this is <b>fictitious</b> <b>value</b> creation based on the adage of speculate to accumulate.

40|$|The {{research}} {{showed that}} there is only a poor relation between second order bending moment magnification via Euler buckling and the actual geometrically nonlinear behaviour of arches. The better approach for the second order effect is to think of additional bending moments caused by imperfections and by the imaginary second order loading. The additional bending moments due to the second order effect are determined by the deformations and the horizontal thrust. The amplitude of the geometrical imperfection in the analyses is applied conform eurocode 2. Analysis showed the high sensitivity of arches to imperfections. The amplitude of the imperfection is a <b>fictitious</b> <b>value</b> to use in structural analysis. It incorporates deviations due to execution tolerances and material non-homogeneity. Due to time constraints, the derivation of the formula could not be investigated. However, it has a large influence on bending moments. Accounting for physical nonlinear behaviour is realistic and beneficial. The stiffness of concrete cross-sections varies depending on the internal forces it is exposed to. Bending moment peaks will lead to cracking. The resulting lower bending stiffness reduces the peak value. In this introducing analysis, the stiffness is applied according to M-N-? theory in which the initial uncracked stiffness and the lowest elastic stiffness (just before yielding is reached). A full physical nonlinear analysis, including the reinforcement and nonlinear stress-strain relations, will provide more detailed results. The three dimensional model, including the physical and geometrical nonlinear behaviour, is the best representation of the point supported structure. It can be optimized by modelling the spreading of the tandem axle load through the foamed concrete more accurately. The most accurate and elaborate model will lead to the most detailed results, when modelled well. However, these models require much time. Computational time increases as equilibrium between loading, deformations and stiffnesses has to be found iteratively for each load combination separately. Furthermore, judging the large amount of output data in an elaborate model is time consuming as well. In practice, modelling all physical mechanisms as detailed as possible is considered with respect to uncertainties like the spread in soil data, accuracy of loads and deviations of material properties. These considerations might lead to the use of far more straightforward models in engineering. Nevertheless, for further research, it is good to know whether the three dimensional, physically and geometrically nonlinear model will lead to lower or higher internal forces compared to the more elementary models.

40|$|The Welfare Quality multi-criteria {{evaluation}} (WQ-ME) model aggregates {{scores of}} single welfare measures into an overall assessment for {{the level of}} animal welfare in dairy herds. It assigns herds to 4 welfare classes: unacceptable, acceptable, enhanced, or excellent. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the relative importance of single welfare measures for WQ-ME classification of a selected sample of Dutch dairy herds. Seven trained observers quantified 63 welfare measures of the Welfare Quality protocol in 183 loose housed- and 13 tethered Dutch dairy herds (herd size: 10 to 211 cows). First, values of welfare measures were compared among the 4 welfare classes, using Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-squared tests. Second, observed values of single welfare measures were replaced with a <b>fictitious</b> <b>value,</b> which was the median value of herds classified in the next highest class, to see if improvement of a single measure would enable a herd to reach a higher class. Sixteen herds were classified as unacceptable, 85 as acceptable, 78 as enhanced, and none as excellent. Classification could not be calculated for 17 herds because data were missing (15 herds) or data were deemed invalid because the stockperson disturbed behavioral observations (2 herds). Herds classified as unacceptable showed significantly more very lean cows, more severely lame cows, and more often an insufficient number of drinkers than herds classified as acceptable. Herds classified as acceptable showed significantly more cows with high somatic cell count, with lesions, that could not be approached closer than 1 m, colliding with components of the stall while lying down, and lying outside the lying area, and showed fewer cows with diarrhea, more often had an insufficient number of drinkers, and scored lower for the descriptors “relaxed” and “happy” than herds classified as enhanced. Increasing the number of drinkers and reducing the percentage of cows colliding with components of the stall while lying down were the changes most effective in allowing herds classified as unacceptable and acceptable, respectively, to reach a higher class. The WQ-ME model was not very sensitive to improving single measures of good health. We concluded that a limited number of welfare measures had a strong influence on classification of dairy herds. Classification of herds based on the WQ-ME model in its current form might lead to a focus on improving these specific measures and divert attention from improving other welfare measures.

40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{proposed}} {{which allows the}} theoretical stress concentration factor at a rounded notch tip to be assessed from the <b>fictitious</b> stress <b>value</b> arising {{at the tip of}} the corresponding pointed V-notch. Such a stress value suffices to be determined by a finite element analysis carried out using a mesh pattern with a constant average element size, d, strictly related to the actual root radius, , and the opening angle, 2 , of the radiused notch. The relevant expression linking d to  and 2  is obtained in closed form and the accuracy of the proposed method is discussed versus the results of a number of FE analyses carried out on notched plates under tension. Eventually, the possibility of using the peak stress directly as a strength parameter is explored, and an example related to the fatigue strength of welded joints is provided to support this idea...|$|R
40|$|Until now the fictitious play {{approach}} to optimization {{has only been}} demonstrated on a dynamic traffic routing problem; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} apply this method to other problems in order to demonstrate its effectiveness as a heuristic optimization method. We used the large scale situational awareness simulation developed for the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) on “Low-Energy Electronic Design for Mobile Platforms ” to test the fictitious play approach, since we already possessed bench mark solutions from a simulated annealing approach previously applied. We found that the fictitious play approach yielded similar solutions to simulated annealing and required comparable computational effort, while they both outperformed pure random search. This demonstrates the effectiveness of a fictitious play {{approach to}} optimization for the large scale situational awareness simulation, providing additional evidence as to <b>fictitious</b> play’s <b>value</b> as an optimization heuristic.

It is confirmed that there exist a true critical density which characterizes {{the onset of}} the yield stress, and two fictitious critical densities which characterize the scaling laws of rheological properties.

It is noteworthy that the critical scaling law for frictionless jamming transition seems to be still valid even for frictional jamming despite using <b>fictitious</b> critical density <b>values.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{critically}} analyses {{the role}} of communication and media systems in contemporary financial markets. New communication technologies have {{played a central role}} in the increased velocity, volume and scale of financial market activity since the 1970 s. Theoretically, the research developed an analytical framework emphasising intersubjective codifications and reflexive communication processes. This was used to transcode political economic and cultural economic perspectives on financial investment and accumulation. The framework revised neo-Marxist accounts of contradictions in capital accumulation circuits and spatio-temporal fixes by integrating an account of the symbolic ontology of monetary forms and <b>fictitious</b> <b>value.</b> The framework also integrated the Minskian account of how feedback loops endogenous to the market generate financial instability by explaining the reflexive communicative processes involved. The notions of intersubjective codifications and communicative reflexivity were also used to conceptualise social systems boundaries, and to develop the argument that financial system autopoiesis could be operationalised in terms of investor sensitivity to self-referential signals generated by their own trading activity. Empirically, the research provided both a quantitative and qualitative account of how institutional investors prioritise and utilise different forms of media and information in their trading decisions. The study included surveys and interviews of traders and analysts at financial institutions operating in New Zealand and included observations of trading activity at Deutsche Bank, ANZ and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The data generated were used to empirically explore the proposition that communication processes are not merely representative, but constitutive of financial reality. The findings highlighted functional differences between publicly accessible media and professional institutional networks and between market information and reflexive, meta-information. Institutional channels were found to be vital for the validation of trading frames and discerning market flows. These findings of differential functions complicate several recent analyses of financial media that suggest they have a potentially powerful effect on investors. The findings confirmed that reflexive communication processes are constitutive role in shaping market reality and in the formation of fictitious capital values. The evidence of self-referential validation of trading frames suggested the neoclassical account of informational efficiency in market is not sustainable. Moreover, the evidence of communicative reflexivity supported the contention that the financial system has an autopoietic tendency. However, there was also evidence of the continuing significance of referent conditions in the industrial economy and policy. This showed that trading decisions were not based solely on self-referential noise precluded a radical claim of systemic closure. Nevertheless, the recent evidence of crises and the repercussions for governments and the lifeworld suggests that the global financial system’s imperative to expand and accelerate accumulation imposes significant risks/costs on other systems that are not subject to democratic accountability. Indeed, the findings also suggested that non-institutional investors relying of public media trade at a significant disadvantage, significantly undermining neoliberal claims that the increased availability of financial information systems and publicly-accessible trading platforms has facilitated financial democratisation...|$|E
40|$|Globally, around {{one-third of}} the edible parts of {{perishable}} food products is wasted every year. Adequate logistics management of the food supply chain is of importance. Inventory control of processed fresh food with a best-before or use-by date deals with the questions how much to order and how often, and how to review the inventory position. For perishable products, there exists a trade-off between desired product-availability and waste. A high order quantity or frequent ordering may result in high product-availability but also waste. A small order quantity or less frequent ordering results in lower inventory levels, but may cause out-of-stock. For the inventory control of a perishable product the age-distribution of the items should be considered. This is influenced by order picking at a food producer or warehouse, or consumer behaviour at a supermarket, picking First In First Out (FIFO), where first the oldest items are used, or Last In First Out (LIFO), where first the freshest items of the product are used. This thesis investigates periodic review order policies for a food producer and a retailer for a perishable product with a fixed lifetime and a non-stationary demand. For a food producer {{as well as a}} retailer, it is not always economically feasible to reorder in every period. For planning purposes it is desirable to set the timing of the orders in advance. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to better decision making regarding inventory control in the food supply chain from food producer to supermarket, in the trade-off between product-availability and waste. Methods are designed to generate practical order policies using commercial solvers for business rather than custom made solution procedures, where at least the timing of ordering or production is set beforehand. The practical inventory control problems discussed in this thesis are characterised by a perishable product with a fixed lifetime, non-stationary stochastic demand, a single-echelon production/inventory situation in a finite time horizon. The product has a service level requirement to ensure a certain product-availability. The decision problems deal with fixed setup or ordering cost, holding cost and disposal cost for wasted items. The age-distribution of the items in stock is considered in specific theoretical Stochastic Programming (SP) problems that deal with the service level requirement as a chance constraint or fill rate constraint. The studied problems vary in planning characteristics. Fluctuations in demand combined with fixed setup or ordering costs imply that regular production or ordering is probably not optimal. This situation requires a strategy to deal with the fluctuations. In inventory literature, non-stationary demand for a perishable product with a fixed lifetime is hardly studied, and consequently also strategies to deal with it are little investigated. In this thesis, methods have been designed to generate practical order policies using commercial solvers, where at least the timing of ordering or production is set beforehand. The practical order policies have been benchmarked with custom made solution procedures. The developed practical policies are applicable in the practice of fresh food producers and in retail organisations, on the level of the store, {{as well as on the}} level of the distribution centre. An interesting conclusion is that the policies with fixed order timing are hardly more costly than the investigated policy with flexible order timing. The fixed order timing increases the ease of planning.   The studied cost functions in the models comprise disposal cost for which the value of the disposal cost in the experiments was varied. The results show that in the models with fixed order timing and corresponding order-up-to levels, increasing the disposal cost can reduce the percentage of waste, maintaining the service level. In setting a (<b>fictitious)</b> <b>value</b> for the disposal cost, one can steer the percentage of waste in determining the order policy, and thus contribute to better decision making in the food supply chain from food producer to supermarket in the trade-off between product-availability and waste...|$|E
40|$|The South African Revenue Service {{has since}} 2009 {{introduced}} “reference pricing” {{as a tool}} to detect undervaluation of customs values of imported clothing and textiles. The term “reference pricing” is not defined in the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 which is the legislation that governs the importation of goods into the Republic of South Africa. The mandate of the South African Revenue Service, amongst others, is to facilitate legitimate trade. By applying the reference pricing guidelines the South African Revenue Service will target all importers who declare customs values which are less than the reference price for a targeted tariff heading associated with an item of clothing or textile. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 is clear in that the transaction value which is the price paid or payable for the imported goods shall be the value used for customs duty purposes. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 also requires that the interpretation of the sections 65, 66 and 67 of the said Act shall be subject to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Valuation Agreement). Part I of the Valuation Agreement deals with the rules for customs valuation. Article 17 of part 1 allows for customs administrations to satisfy themselves as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes. The Technical Committee on Customs Valuation of the World Trade Organisation decided the following in so far as Article 17 of the aforesaid agreement is concerned: “ 1. When a declaration has been presented and where the customs administration has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of this declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, [...] ” It would appear that the South African Revenue Service is using reference prices {{as a tool to}} support its reason for doubting the truth or accuracy of the declared customs values. The indiscriminate use of reference pricing, it is submitted, affects legitimate trade adversely. This treatise provides an understanding of how the customs value should be determined in terms of the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 and the Valuation Agreement. It then provides a background to reference pricing and how reference pricing will be used to detect undervalued imports of clothing and textiles, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using reference pricing and a comparative analysis of the approach adopted by the Mexican Tax Administration Service in so far as the use of reference pricing is concerned. It was established that the reference price cannot replace the customs value of an imported clothing item as the customs value is based on the price actually paid or payable for it and not on some arbitrary or <b>fictitious</b> <b>value.</b> The reference price can only be used as a tool to identify importers that are possibly undervaluing the customs values. The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages of using reference pricing. The treatise further provides a background to the use of a valuation database as a risk assessment tool and compares this to the use of reference pricing. The use of reference pricing and its impact on trade facilitation is then discussed as well as whether the use of reference pricing is consistent with the risk management principles as discussed in the World Customs Organisation Risk Management Guide. It was established that the South African Revenue Service has not disclosed the basis of arriving at the reference price per tariff heading that it targets and the use of reference pricing is not sanctioned by any international guideline or agreement. It was also established that the use of reference pricing targets compliant importers unnecessarily and this practice goes against the principles of trade facilitation. The use of reference pricing can be used as a tool to detect undervalued imports of clothing but should not be used as a basis to stop every consignment of clothing simply because the customs value declared is less than the reference price. It should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather enhanced further with the recommendations provided. In the final analysis, recommendations are provided which seek to enhance the reference pricing mechanism and to further identify and exclude compliant importers and limit the use of reference pricing to target non-compliant importers who undervalue the customs value of imported clothing and textile items...|$|E
5000|$|The {{result of}} the {{difficulties}} in explaining economic value and its sources is that value becomes something of a mystery, and that how the attribution of value really occurs is no longer clear. The three relationships mentioned become mixed up, and are confused with each other, in commercial and economic discourse, {{and it appears that}} things and assets acquire an independent power to create value, even although value is a human attribution. Marx refers to this as commodity fetishism or thingification (Verdinglichung or reification) which culminates in what he calls <b>fictitious</b> capital. <b>Value</b> then seems to appear spontaneously out of trading activity. He regards this perception as an inevitable effect of commercial practice, since it involves the circumstance that objects acquire a value which exists independently of the valuer, a value [...] "set by the state of the market" [...] which individuals normally cannot change and must adjust to. The end result is that value theory is banished from economics as a useless metaphysics, surviving only in the form of assumptions made about price behaviour. Because money-prices offer convenient quantifiable and generally applicable units of economic value, no further inquiry into value is deemed necessary.|$|R
