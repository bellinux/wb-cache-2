The enemy flies in a defensive circle, that means they are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle. By pulling his aircraft right around, his curve radius must be smaller, but if <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>that,</b> his target disappears in most cases below his wings. So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, noting that it [...] "turns the complex into something easy and obvious". Shearman and Pearson felt that the character of Sara Bangs was [...] "treated as an object by the episode", and that Carter's script [...] "takes a very real issue and trivialises it" [...] by presenting such an [...] "open and shut case". However, they noted that the episode was [...] "very well acted", and was [...] "clearly well intentioned". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B+, noting that it [...] "tries some interesting things with the Millennium template". VanDerWerff felt {{that several of the}} episode's scenes [...] "are as horrifying as anything I've seen on TV", adding that [...] "they accomplish much of this through the mere power of suggestion". However, he also noted that the character of Joe Bangs was too simplistic, claiming that he is [...] "so damned blatant about what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> it eventually stops being horrifying and becomes preposterous". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 2.5 out of 5, finding that its focus on legal issues and counselling [...] "fragments the tone and atmosphere" [...] built by previous episodes. However, Gibron felt that [...] "Carter's script handles the horrifying subject very well".|$|E
500|$|According to the Birmingham Mail end-of-season review, [...] "for most of {{the season}} no other midfielder could {{challenge}} [...] in terms of energy, tackles, clearances or blocks", and he was a close second to 16-goal striker Clayton Donaldson as their player of the season. Nevertheless, he lost his starting spot to new signing Maikel Kieftenbeld, and Rowett thought that his anxiety to regain his place in the team made him try too hard when coming on as a substitute. After a strong performance in the League Cup against Premier League Aston Villa, Davis started and played well in two consecutive away wins, but his next start did not come until mid-March. Away to Wolverhampton Wanderers, he came close to scoring the winning goal and, according to Rowett, [...] "controlled the match with his physicality. He gets about the place, he holds people off and comes out with the ball. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> really, really well." [...] The club promptly took up their option for a further year on his contract, and Rowett said they were considering an extension until 2018. Davis scored his first goal of the season in the penultimate match, a [...] "brilliant half-volley {{from the edge of the}} area" [...] after the ball was not fully cleared by the defence, to secure a draw at home to Middlesbrough. Although he started a third fewer Championship matches than in 2014–15, he established himself in the team towards the end of the season because of what the Birmingham Mail viewed as the stability he gave to the side.|$|E

2500|$|In Hinduism, more {{particularly}} the Dharmaśāstras, Karma is a principle in which [...] "cause and effect are as inseparably linked {{in the moral}} sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad action leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past deeds". [...] Thus {{it is important to}} understand that karma does not go away, one must either reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of his past actions. [...] The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states, [...] "According as a man acts and according as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful. He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that person consists of desires. An as is his desire so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> he will reap". [...] The doctrine of karma dates from ancient times and besides the above author is mentioned in the Gautama dharma-sutra, Shatapatha Brahmana, Kathaaka-grhya-sutra, Chandogya Upanishad, Markandeya Purana and many others.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Essay" [...] was {{composed}} {{at a time}} when the prestige of Rymer and neo-Aristotelianism in England was already declining, and though Wesley expressed some admiration for Rapin and Le Bossu, he is by no means docile under their authority. Whatever the weight of authority, he says, [...] "I see no cause why Poetry should not be brought to the Test , as well as Divinity...." [...] As to the sacred example of Homer, who based his great epic on mythology, Wesley remarks, [...] "But this [...] being now antiquated, I cannot think we are oblig'd superstitiously to follow his Example, any more than to make Horses speak, as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> of Achilles." [...] To the question of the formidable Boileau, [...] "What Pleasure can it be to hear the howlings of repining Lucifer?" [...] our critic responds flippantly,"I think 'tis easier to answer than to find out what shew of Reason he had for asking it, or why Lucifer mayn't howl as pleasantly as either Cerberus, or Knoeladus." [...] Without hesitation or apology he takes issue with Rapin's conception of Decorum in the epic. But Wesley is empiricist as well as rationalist, and the judgment of authority can be upset by appeal to the court of experience. To Balzac's suggestion that, to avoid difficult and local proper names in poetry, generalized terms be used, such as Ill-luck for the Fates and the Foul Fiend for Lucifer, our critic replies with jaunty irony, [...] "... and whether this wou'd not sound extremely Heroical, I leave any Man to judge", and thus he dismisses the matter. Similarly, when Rapin objects to Tasso's mingling of lyric softness in the majesty of the epic, Wesley points out sharply that no man of taste will part with the fine scenes of tender love in Tasso, Dryden, Ovid, Ariosto, and Spenser [...] "for the sake of a fancied Regularity." [...] He had set out to defend the Biblical epic, the Christian epic, and the propriety of Christian machines in epic, and no rules or authority could deter him. As good an example as any of his independence of mind can be seen In a note on Bk. I, apropos of the poet's use of obsolete words (Life of Our Blessed Lord, 1697, p.27): It may be in vicious imitation of Milton and Spenser, he says in effect, but I have a fondness for old words, they please my ear, and that is all the reason I can give for employing them.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi asked Rabbi Ishmael {{the son of}} Rabbi Jose if he {{had learned}} from his father the actual meaning of [...] "And on the seventh day God {{finished}} the work that He had been doing" [...] (for surely God finished God's work on the sixth day, not the Sabbath). He compared it to a man striking a hammer on an anvil, raising it by day and bringing it down immediately after nightfall. (In the second between raising the hammer and bringing it down, night began. Thus, he taught that God finished God's work {{right at the end}} of the sixth day, so that in that very moment the Sabbath began.) Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that mortal humans, who do not know exactly what time it is, must add from the profane to the sacred to avoid working in the sacred time; but God knows time precisely, can enter the Sabbath by a hair's breadth. Genibah and the Rabbis discussed [...] Genibah compared it to a king who made a bridal chamber, which he plastered, painted, and adorned, so that all that the bridal chamber lacked was a bride to enter it. Similarly, just then, the world lacked the Sabbath. (Thus by means of instituting the Sabbath itself, God completed God's work, and humanity's world, on the seventh day.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who made a ring that lacked only a signet. Similarly, the world lacked the Sabbath. And the Midrash taught that this is one of the texts that they changed for King Ptolemy (as they could not expect him to understand these explanations), making [...] read, [...] "And He finished on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh." [...] King Ptolemy (or others say, a philosopher) asked the elders in Rome how many days it took God to create the world. The elders replied that it took God six days. He replied that since then, Gehenna has been burning for the wicked. Reading the words [...] "His work" [...] in [...] Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon that with neither labor nor toil did God create the world, yet [...] says, [...] "He rested [...] [...] [...] from all His work." [...] He explained that [...] states it that way to punish the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with labor, and to give a good reward to the righteous who uphold the world, which was created with toil. Reading the words [...] "Because that in it He rested from all His work which God created to make," [...] in [...] the Midrash taught that what was created on the Sabbath, after God rested, was tranquility, ease, peace, and quiet. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Nehorai that as long as the hands of their Master were working on them, they went on expanding; but when the hands of their Master rested, rest was afforded to them, and thus God gave rest to the world on the seventh day. Rabbi Abba taught that when a mortal king takes his army to their quarters, he does not distribute largesse (rather, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> only before the troops go into battle), and when he distributes largesse, he does not order a halt. But God ordered a halt and distributed largesse, as [...] says, [...] "And He rested [...] [...] [...] and He blessed." [...] (Not only did God afford humanity a day of rest, but God also gave humanity the gift of a sacred day.) ...|$|E
