25|$|One toponym {{with a good}} {{claim to}} {{derivation}} from the saint's name is Chadkirk Chapel in Romiley, Greater Manchester, which {{dates back to the}} 14th century– although the site is much older, possibly dating back to the 7th century when it is believed St Chad visited to bless the well there. Cameron points out that -kirk toponyms more frequently incorporate the name of the dedicatee, rather than the patron, so there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that Chadkirk really was dedicated to St Chad in the Middle Ages.

25|$|August Weismann was {{responsible}} for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program because the old need to remove themselves from the theatre {{to make room for}} the next generation, sustaining the turnover that is necessary for evolution. This theory again has much intuitive appeal, but it suffers from having a teleological or goal-driven explanation. In other words, a purpose for ageing has been identified, but not a mechanism by which that purpose could be achieved. Ageing may have this advantage for the long-term health of the community; but that doesn't explain how individuals would acquire the genes that make them get old and die, or why individuals that had ageing genes would be more successful than other individuals lacking such genes. (In fact, there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> to think that the opposite is true: ageing decreases individual fitness.) Weismann later abandoned his theory.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} Iron Age, Orkney {{was part of}} the Pictish kingdom, and {{although}} the archaeological remains from this period are less impressive there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> to suppose the fertile soils and rich seas of Orkney provided the Picts with a comfortable living. The Dalriadic Gaels began to influence the islands towards the close of the Pictish era, perhaps principally through the role of Celtic missionaries, as evidenced by several islands bearing the epithet [...] "Papa" [...] in commemoration of these preachers. However, before the Gaelic presence could establish itself the Picts were gradually dispossessed by the Norsemen from the late 8th century onwards. The nature of this transition is controversial, and theories range from peaceful integration to enslavement and genocide.|$|E
500|$|On 29 October, as {{the marchers}} walked from Luton to St Albans, {{the plight of}} Jarrow {{was the subject of}} exchanges in the House of Commons between Wilkinson and Baldwin.

[...] Wilkinson replied that the apparent decrease in Jarrow's unemployment figures arose from the amalgamation of the figures of Jarrow with those of a neighbouring town, and did not represent an increase in employment. She asked Baldwin whether he would break with tradition and meet a deputation of the marchers; the prime minister declined.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Jackson was {{contacted}} by Ric Birch of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) to mix sound for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney. Jackson felt that his skills {{would be put}} to best use as organiser and audio director rather than as one man behind a mixing console. He put together a team of audio professionals {{as well as an}} equipment design composed of digital nodes linked with optic fibre to transport digital audio around the largest venues without attenuation or ground hum. To wire the spectacle which played to 110,000 people in attendance and some 3billion distant viewers around the world, redundant systems were connected throughout so that a single failure point could not halt the show. To complete the assignment, Jackson said one of the main factors was working within budget, which was not unlimited as it had been with Streisand. He served as audio director for the opening ceremony on 15 September and the closing ceremony on 1 October. Before the event, he told a reporter, [...] "I have a well rehearsed crew in place and there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> to expect it to go well." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{gigantic}} {{proportions of}} A. fragillimus have been debated by paleontologists. Carpenter {{has argued that}} there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> to take Cope at his word, noting that the paleontologist's reputation was at stake. The discovery {{took place during the}} Bone Wars, and Cope's rival Marsh, who was [...] "ever ready to humiliate" [...] Cope, never called the claims into question. Marsh was known to have employed spies to monitor Cope's discoveries, and may have even had confirmation of the enormous size of the Amphicoelias fragillimus bones. Paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and C.C. Mook in 1921, as well as John S. McIntosh in 1998, also accepted Cope's data without question in published reviews. Other paleontologists have been more critical. In an analysis of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the publication and interpretation of A. fragillimus, Woodruff and Foster (2015) concluded that its size has been over-estimated and that modern palaeontologists were accepting Cope's interpretation without due scepticism. They note that no comparably gigantic sauropod fossils have been discovered in the Morrison Formation or elsewhere, that 19th century palaeontologists - including Cope himself - paid no attention to the size of A. fragillimus (even when it may have substantiated Cope's Rule of size increase in animal lineages over time), and that typographical errors in his measurements - such as reporting vertebral measurements in meters rather than millimeters - undermine their reliability. They concluded that the super-gigantic A. fragillimus is a 'highly unlikely' creature based on unquestioning interpretation of Cope's report.|$|E

2500|$|During his {{remaining}} years, Leopold spent {{a fair amount}} of his time trying to help Nannerl at a distance, as her new marriage situation, involving five apparently ill-educated stepchildren, was apparently not easy. According to Halliwell, Nannerl depended on Leopold in many ways: he did [...] "shopping [...] the engagement of servants. ... He relayed news from Salzburg, Munich, and Vienna to divert her, did his best to organize the maintenance of her fortepiano, paid for Wolfgang's music to be copied and arranged for her to receive it; collected musicians together when she had visited him so that she could play it with most of the parts; [...]. tried to look after her health; and encouraged her to stand up to her husband when he was being unreasonable." [...] Following Leopold's death in 1787, Nannerl had to do without this support, and Halliwell asserts that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that Leopold's death was devastating" [...] to her.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nicholas Mikhailovich joined the war effort with the formal title of aide-de-camp general, which was an honorific post. He {{had not been in}} active service for a decade and was not given a field command. Instead, he was sent to the southwest front facing the armies of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Stationed in Kiev in August 1914, he moved later to Rovno. He did not interfere with military matters but was assigned to make visits to hospitals. Within just a few days, at the end of August 1914, 6,000 wounded soldiers passed through Rovno alone. Nicholas was horrified by the slaughter [...] "I have seen such suffering, such abnegation", [...] he wrote, [...] "that my heart has stopped, suffocated by the horrible spectacle of human suffering". His work with the army had a profound impact. [...] "The suffering of the injured tears my heart," [...] he wrote. Daily he visited the hospitals and [...] "the masses of wounded". He remained in this position until his hospital visits became less necessary in 1915. However, this experience left him embittered: [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> to become socialist after these massacres", he said. After the terrible Russian defeat in East Prussia in the Battle of Tannenberg, the Grande Duke prophetically wrote [...] "in all Russian military disasters comes a gigantic uprising, which would bring to an end many monarchies and the triumph of international socialism".|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} is often asked, how {{the cab and}} omnibus proprietors take to these innovations. Of course not very kindly, but experience shows that these individuals are more frightened than hurt. At first {{there is a little}} loss of revenue to the cabmen, but in the end the result is no worse, as people get educated to riding everywhere, and cabs get a fair share. The railways were said to have struck a death-blow at the ordinary vehicle traffic, but such did not prove to be true, and, wherever tramways have opened there has been no decrease in the numbers of cabs - Leicester for instance. Since the company have been running per timetable, the bus proprietors {{have done the same thing}} along St. Ann's Well-road, and with good result. For the comfort of the shareholders of the company, it may be stated that the directors will no doubt pay in July (with the interim dividend paid in February), a dividend at the rate of six per cent per annum. When this is taken into full consideration - that is to say, when all the difficulties are duly allowed for, and it is remembered that only a portion of the line is as yet opened - the result is most satisfactory. Indeed all the shares are now quoted at two per cent premium with few vendors. As to the character of the company, I think it is not undue flattery to say that it is efficiently and economically managed as the staff is limited to the mere necessary officials, and the directorate is small. Considering the rail employed is one that is sure to result in great saving to the shareholders, seeing that there will be little or no cost of repairs, and taking into consideration also the fact that the tramway route is populous, and the working expenses small, there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> to prophecy success to the company [...] [...] [...] As far as we can make out the estimated weekly receipts of the Tramway Company amount to about £350, and in Whit week we believe as much as £430 was taken, for which upwards of 50,000 people were carried. Taking £350 as the average weekly receipts gives a total of over £17,000 in a year, which is a very large sum indeed for the present branch of tramway service in a town of such proportions as Nottingham [...] [...] [...] There are 212 cabs in the town, so that estimating the earnings at but £2 per week there is a total of £424 weekly, or £20,000 a year. Taking the above as a very moderate estimate, and making a little allowance for omnibuses, 'carriers' carts, , it is fair to suppose that at least £40,000 a year is spent in Nottingham for passenger traffic.|$|E
