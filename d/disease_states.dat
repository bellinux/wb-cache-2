5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or <b>disease</b> <b>states</b> with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many <b>disease</b> <b>states,</b> several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
40|$|In {{applications}} such as gene therapy and drug design, a key goal is to convert the <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> of diseased objects from an undesirable state into a desirable one. Such conversions may be achieved by changing the values of some attributes of the objects. For example, in gene therapy one may convert cancerous cells to normal ones by changing some genes 2 ̆ 7 expression level from low to high or from high to low. In this paper, we define the <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> conversion problem as the discovery of <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> converters; a <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> converter is a small set of attribute value changes that may change an object 2 ̆ 7 s <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> from undesirable into desirable. We consider two variants of this problem: personalized <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> converter mining mines <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> converters for a given individual patient with a given disease, and universal <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> converter mining mines <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> converters for all samples with a given disease. We propose a DSCMiner algorithm to discover small and highly effective <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> converters. Since real-life medical experiments on living diseased instances are expensive and time consuming, we use classifiers trained from the datasets of given diseases to evaluate the quality of discovered converter sets. The effectiveness of a <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> converter {{is measured by the}} percentage of objects that are successfully converted from undesirable state into desirable state as deemed by state-of-the-art classifiers. We use experiments {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} our algorithm and to show its effectiveness. We also discuss possible research directions for extensions and improvements. We note that the <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> conversion problem also has applications in customer retention, criminal rehabilitation, and company turn-around, where the goal is to convert class membership of objects whose class is an undesirable class.

5|$|CPAs {{have been}} {{implemented}} {{for the management of}} a plethora of chronic <b>disease</b> <b>states,</b> including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous thromboembolism in outpatient clinics, and in the oncology setting, including the management of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also be relevant to cancer and other <b>disease</b> <b>states,</b> influencing prognosis and therapeutic response. The changes in EFS expression and post-translational modification {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in Table 2.|$|E
5|$|Various {{specific}} cases of animal testing have drawn attention, including both instances of beneficial scientific research, and instances of alleged ethical violations by those performing the tests. The fundamental properties of muscle physiology were determined with work done using frog muscles (including the force generating mechanism of all muscle, the length-tension relationship, and the force-velocity curve), and frogs {{are still the}} preferred model organism due to the long survival of muscles in vitro {{and the possibility of}} isolating intact single-fiber preparations (not possible in other organisms). Modern physical therapy and the understanding and treatment of muscular disorders is based on this work and subsequent work in mice (often engineered to express <b>disease</b> <b>states</b> such as muscular dystrophy).

40|$|Methods {{to obtain}} nucleic acid ligands that photocrosslink to target {{molecules}} {{associated with a}} <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> are provided. The methods presented are variations on the photoSELEX methods for obtaining nucleic acid ligands. In one method, a candidate mixture of photocrosslinkable nucleic acids is contacted with a biological substance obtained from a source associated with a <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> suspected of containing a target molecule to form nucleic acid-target molecule complexes, the complexes are irradiated to form crosslinked complexes, the photocrosslinked complexes are partitioned from {{the remainder of the}} candidate mixture; and the nucleic acid ligands that photocrosslink to molecule are retained. These nucleic acids are then contacted with a second biological substance of the same type as the first, but obtained from a source not associated with a <b>disease</b> <b>state.</b> This removes nucleic acids with affinity to molecules that are not associated with the <b>disease</b> <b>state.</b> In another method, photocrosslinkable nucleic acids are not incorporated in the initial candidate mixture, but rather are incorporated in an enriched candidate mixture obtained by contacting a biological substance associated with a <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> containing a target molecule to form nucleic acid-target molecule complexes, partitioning the complexes away from the candidate mixture.
