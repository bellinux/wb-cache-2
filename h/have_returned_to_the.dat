Progress M-43 was deorbited after Progress M1-5 docked successfully.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Badami Chalukyan temples {{featured}} in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its importance and wider use. Recently however, scholars <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> modern Karnataka region {{to focus on}} a longer chronology, investigating a larger geographical area, making detailed studies of epigraphs and giving more importance to individual monuments dating from the 11th through 13th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|They {{meet with}} the Valtian ambassador, Chancellor Alrik (Mickey Cottrell), who is uninterested in the {{marriage}} and wants to pursue trade agreements. With the arrangements made, Picard visits Kamala to say goodbye; she tells him that she has permanently bonded with him instead of Alrik. Kamala explains that he has changed her for the better, and will continue in her duty for her people to marry Alrik. At the wedding ceremony, Picard escorts Kamala {{down the aisle and}} watches as she marries another. After the newlyweds <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planet, Picard says goodbye to Briam in the transporter room. When asked how he resisted Kamala, the expression on Picard's face reveals how much of a struggle it has been and how much he feels he has lost.|$|E
5|$|Western {{burrowing}} owls {{were originally}} {{listed as a}} species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year. A 1992–93 survey reported little to no breeding burrowing owls {{in most of the}} western counties in the Bay Area, leaving only Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano counties as remnants of a once large breeding range. Bald eagles were once common in the Bay Area, but habitat destruction and thinning of eggs from DDT poisoning reduced the California state population to 35 nesting pairs. Bald eagles disappeared from the Bay Area in 1915, and only began returning in recent years. In the 1980s an effort to re-introduce the species to the area began with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group and the San Francisco Zoo importing birds and eggs from Vancouver Island and northeastern California, and there are now nineteen nesting couples in eight of the Bay Area's nine counties. Other once absent species that <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bay Area include Swainson’s hawk, white tailed kite, and the osprey.|$|E

5|$|While the WRO {{continues}} {{to fight the}} remnants of Deepground, Vincent transforms into Chaos {{in a desperate attempt}} to defeat Omega Weiss. Shelke dives inside Omega to find Lucrecia's Protomateria, and upon finding it, she gives it to Vincent, also telling him that his survival made Lucrecia happy. Vincent then takes control of Chaos and battles Omega. Omega sprouts wings and tries to ascend from the planet, but Vincent manages to destroy it, disappearing in the process. A week later, he is seen visiting Lucrecia's crystalline tomb in the Crystal Cave. He states that both Chaos and Omega <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Planet, and he thanks Lucrecia for being the reason he survived. He is then found by Shelke outside the cave, and she tells him that everyone else is waiting for him.|$|E

Mermet's successor as Aveneau's assistant was Father Jean-Baptiste Chardon, who arrived there in 1705 and succeeded Father Aveneau in 1711.|$|E
25|$|In the North, {{woodcock}} {{begin to}} shift southward before {{ice and snow}} seal off their ground-based food supply. Cold fronts may prompt heavy southerly flights in autumn. Most woodcock start to migrate in October, with the major push from mid-October to early November. Most individuals arrive on the wintering range by mid-December. The birds head north again in February. Most <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern breeding range by mid-March to mid-April.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, a refractive cornea is only useful out of water; in water, {{there is}} little difference in refractive index between the vitreous fluid and the surrounding water. Hence creatures that <b>have</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water – penguins and seals, for example – lose their highly curved cornea and return to lens-based vision. An alternative solution, borne by some divers, {{is to have a}} very strongly focusing cornea.|$|E
