5|$|Pigeonhole sort, {{counting}} sort, radix sort, and Van Emde Boas tree sorting {{all work}} best when the key size is small; for large enough keys, they become slower than comparison sorting algorithms. However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number of items (or equivalently when the number of items is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that take advantage of the parallelism inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E
5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed dysphonia, an impairment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
5|$|Fine {{reckoned}} Lasker {{paid little}} attention to the openings, but Capablanca thought Lasker knew the openings very well but disagreed with a lot of contemporary opening analysis. In fact before the 1894 world title match, Lasker studied the openings thoroughly, especially Steinitz's favorite lines. He played primarily e4 openings, particularly the Ruy Lopez. He opened with 1.d4 relatively rarely, although his d4 games had a higher winning percentage than his e4 ones. With the Black pieces, he mainly answered 1.e4 with the French Defense and 1.d4 with the Queen's Gambit. Lasker also used the Sicilian Defense fairly often. In Capablanca's opinion, no player surpassed Lasker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> assess a position quickly and accurately, in terms of who had the better prospects of winning and what strategy each side should adopt. Capablanca also wrote that Lasker was so adaptable that he played in no definite style, and that he was both a tenacious defender and a very efficient finisher of his own attacks.|$|E

25|$|In {{studying}} adolescent development, adolescence can {{be defined}} biologically, as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> think abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially, as a period of preparation for adult roles. Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass, as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. Cognitive advances encompass both increment in knowledge and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in neuroscience or bio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure {{and its effects on}} cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions. Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status. Some scientists have questioned the universality of adolescence as a developmental phase, and argue that traits often considered typical of adolescents are not inherent.|$|E
25|$|AOS and {{expressive}} aphasia (also known as Broca's aphasia) are commonly mistaken {{as the same}} disorder mainly because they often occur together in patients. Although both disorders present with symptoms such as a difficulty producing sounds due to damage in the language parts of the brain, {{they are not the}} same. The main difference between these disorders lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> comprehend spoken language; patients with apraxia are able to fully comprehend speech, while patients with aphasia are not always fully able to comprehend others' speech.|$|E
25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} shown to have an effect on children's socialization skills. In particular, some research suggests that children of more sensitive caregivers have high levels of effortful (i.e. emotional and behavioural) control. Such control is proposed to have been fostered from the infancy stage when the a sensitive mother's quick and appropriate responses to the baby's distress teaches the baby to adjust his/her arousal. This speedy regulation of arousal is then adapted into childhood resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> regulate emotion and behaviour well.|$|E
