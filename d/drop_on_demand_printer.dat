40|$|Ink-jet {{printing}} is {{a precise}} and versatile technique that accurately deposits small volumes of solutions (pico litres) in specific locations. Recently inkjet printing has attracted increasing {{attention in the}} pharmaceutical industry because {{of its ability to}} deliver low adjustable doses, variable drug release profiles and drug combinations suitable for the paradigm of personalised medicines. The significant growth in the aging population and the {{rise in the number of}} patients suffering from multiple chronic diseases are the key drivers. The current traditional tablet compression methods are largely limited in terms of flexibility and complexity of dosage form. There is a need for new innovative technologies that can produce bespoke medicines in a relatively cheap and efficient manner at the point of care. 3 D inkjet printing (3 DIJP) provides a platform with the potential to address the above need. This thesis investigates the capability of 3 DIJP as a tool for manufacturing solid dosage forms. In chapter 3, a piezoelectric <b>drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> <b>printer</b> was used. The chapter focuses on two solvent based inkjet printing methods. In the first solvent based method, excipients including hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and Eudragit RL were investigated for printability. PVP (K 10) which showed the best printability behaviour was loaded with digoxin or carbamazepine (CBZ) and printed to obtain films. In the second solvent based method, a solution containing CBZ dissolved in a mixture of of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and with poly(caprolactone dimethyl acrylate) (PCLDMA) was printed and polymerised in situ using ultraviolet light to form films. The printed drug loaded films were investigated using time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF SIMS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning microscopy (DSC). PVP formulations were homogeneous, with no evidence of crystallisation PEGDA/PCLDA/CBZAFM images showed a clear phase separation at the micron scale and no drug was detected at the surface. In this chapter, the production of adjustable doses was also evaluatedusing UV-VIS spectrophotometry. In chapters 4 and 5, a solvent-free hot-melt 3 D inkjet printing method suitable for manufacturing solid dosage forms was developed. Excipients including beeswax, carnuba wax, gelucire 44 / 14 and trimyristin were examined for printability. Beeswax a naturally derived and FDA approved material showed the best printability behaviour and was selected as the drug carrier.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the viability of utilising piezoelectric drop on demand printing as a tool for the deposition of proteins for the rapid prototyping of biological sensors. The work has focussed on several main aspects; the effect of printing parameters on drop characteristics, the effect of printing parameters on protein survivability, the influence of surface characteristics on the drop formation at the surface of the sensor, and the electrochemical properties of the sensors after printing. The main objective {{of this study was to}} derive a method for the rapid prototyping of sensors using the piezoelectric <b>drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> <b>printer.</b> The first section details the influence of waveform amplitude on the characteristics of the printed drop including droplet weight and volume. It was established that proteins were suitable for printing in both a Phosphate buffered saline solution and a sugar based carrier solution as supplied by AET. Protein survivability experiments suggested that there was some loss of activity during the printing process which required further investigation. Research into the effect of printing parameters on the viability of proteins, specifically Glucose Oxidase (GOX) has been categorised according to protein structure and protein conformation. No damage was found to occur to either protein conformation or structure after analysis of the samples using light scattering, analytical centrifugation and circular dichroism after printing at 40, 60 and 80 V. Further analysis revealed that there was a loss of mass of protein after the printing process compared to a non printed sample. Surface analysis was employed to quantify the effect of the surface of the electrodes on the drop behaviour after printing through a piezoelectric drop on demand printhead. Proteins were printed onto different carbon surfaces for comparison in different holding solutions and the surfaces analysed for both the drop behaviour when wet and the form and size of the dried enzyme on the carbon surface. Printed samples were observed to spread best with surfactant present in the solution and some evidence of a 'coffee staining effect' was encountered. Further optimisation of the surfactant percentage and the drying conditions ameliorated these effects to produce optimal drying of the solution both on the surface and after drying. An electrochemical technique was also employed to optimise the number of units of enzyme deposited using the printing technique and to ensure that the current response required was achievable and repeatable. After optimisation, it was possible to demonstrate that the 3 unit sample provided a current response with an R 2 value greater than 0. 99, therefore demonstrating reproducible linearity in the current response. This therefore demonstrated that piezoelectric drop on demand printing techniques could be used for the rapid prototyping of biosensors, especially for use in the glucose sensing market.

40|$|AbstractResults are {{reported}} {{for the first time}} on the possibility and cause of polymer degradation in a full commercial inkjet printer. The behaviour of three linear poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples, having Mw 90, 310 and 468  kDa respectively, in a continuous inkjet (CIJ) Domino A-Series+ printer is investigated and compared with earlier reported results for two experimental <b>drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> (DOD) <b>printers,</b> a Dimatix DMP- 2800 and a Microfab single nozzle glass capillary. Despite all three printheads having equivalent strain rate at the nozzle tip (ε) no degradation is observed within the CIJ head alone whereas single pass degradation is observed in both DOD printheads. This can be attributed to a consequence of a number of factors including the slightly greater nozzle diameter, and different nozzle geometry, which includes cone angle and nozzle cylinder length, for CIJ, the different mode of drop generation or the higher polymer concentration investigated. It should also be noted that the flow through the CIJ nozzle is continuous, where it is pulsed in the case of DOD. The calculated maximum strain rates are similar, but in DOD it is being periodically ramped up and switched off. The main source of polymer degradation in CIJ printing through a CIJ Domino A-Series+ printer is found to be the continuous recycling of ink through the pump resulting in mechano-chemical polymer degradation. Molecular weight degradation proceeds by random scission, and is obtained at the lower shear rates experience as a consequence of the longer residence time due to mechano-chemical damage in the pump. These results have significance in the total design of inkjet systems for the delivery of high molecular weight polymers and materials sensitive to mechano-chemical degradation and highlight the need for careful consideration when moving from laboratory based print tools to full scale application...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{demonstrate}} the possibility of ejecting liquid metals using <b>drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> printing technology. The plan was to make transducers for operation in the 100 MHz frequency range and to use these transducers to demonstrate the ability to eject drops of liquid metals such as gallium. Two transducers were made by indium bonding piezoelectric lithium niobate to quartz buffer rods. The lithium niobate plates were thinned by mechanical polishing to a thickness of 37 microns for operation at 100 MHz. Hemispherical lenses were polished in the {{opposite ends of the}} buffer rods. The lenses, which focus the sound waves in the liquid metal, had an F-number equals 1. A mechanical housing was made to hold the transducers and to allow precise control over the liquid level above the lens. We started by demonstrating the ability to eject <b>drops</b> of water <b>on</b> <b>demand.</b> The <b>drops</b> of water had a diameter of 15 microns which corresponds to the wavelength of the sound wave in the water. A videotape of this ejection was made. We then used a mixture of Gallium and Indium (used to lower the melting temperature of the Gallium) to demonstrate the ejection of liquid metal drops. This proved to be difficult because of the oxide skin which forms {{on the surface of the}} liquid. In some instances, we were able to eject metal drops, however, this was not consistent and reproducible. An experiment was set up at NASA-Lewis to stabilize the process of <b>drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> liquid metal ejection.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Investigations on the {{application}} of self-assembled monolayers (SAM) to indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) thin film transistors (TFT) for fabrication and channel modification are presented. The back channel of IGZO thin film transistors can be modified by the absorption of self-assembled monolayers. The electrical properties of the IGZO exposed back channel are sensitive to surface chemistries and can be tailored using SAMs. Chemistry at the back channel interface alters device performance. The back channel surface sensitivities {{can be used in}} applications for chemical sensing TFTs. IGZO TFTs with and without octadecyl phosphonic acid applied to the back channel with varied channel thicknesses (10 - 50 nm) were examined. TFT parameters, such as, turn-on voltage, hysteresis, mobility, subthreshold swing, and current on/off ratio were evaluated by current-voltage electrical measurements. The use of electrohydrodynamic ink jet (EHDP) printing as non-contact method for patterning etch resists with sub- 10 μm features was demonstrated for fabrication of IGZO TFTs. EHDP uses an electric field to generate ink droplets that can be smaller than the nozzle diameter. EHDP was used for depositing a self-assembled monolayer, n-hexyl phosphonic acid (HPA), and photoresist, SU 8, as etch resists for patterning the IGZO TFT channel. <b>Drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> printing is accomplished by overlapping of discrete droplets to form the desired feature. The optimal ink formulations and EHDP parameters were determined for each ink. Parameters were optimized for producing the smallest, uniform printed features. Bottom gate IGZO TFTs were fabricated by plasma sputtering IGZO onto a SiO₂/Si substrate. The IGZO TFT channels were patterned by printing HPA or SU 8 ink as the etch resist, and using HCl as the etch solution.

Yet there is one obvious problem with existing spotting technologies: to avoid cross contamination among different spotting fluids, the dispensing unit has to be changed or cleaned after each spotting process. The underlying idea of i-doT is to allow direct sampling through micro drill holes {{at the bottom of}} a well plate. Capillary pressure in the micro hole is higher than the pressure of the water column above, thereby preventing any leakage of the sample. By applying a short pressure pulse onto a well a small amount of liquid separates at the well's nozzle. In an experimental setup very small droplets with volumes of about one nanoliter were printed. By applying a pressure pulse of 10 to 15 psi for a duration of 500 ns to 1 ms, using nozzle diameters of 50 to 125 µm, spot diameters between 150 and 200 µm were achieved. Therefore this system is capable of printing up to 20. 000 spots of up to 384 different samples onto one glass slide (25 x 75 mm).

A checkpoint dial-a-ride transit system combines characteristics both of traditional fixed route transit and of advanced door-to-door dial-a-ride service. It resembles fixed route operations because some users have to walk to and from at a finite number of stops located on a corridor and always visited. The checkpoint dial-a-ride system also resembles a door-to-door service because some users are picked up and <b>dropped</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> at another finite number of special stops, called deviated stops or checkpoints, located near their trip ends. Such checkpoints are the main elements of a route deviation bus operations, which accepts user demands and, by communicating with a central control unit, makes the bus deviate from its regular route to serve the off-fixed-line request and then return on the regular route. Route deviation bus systems has been proposed and applied in several countries in order to enhance effectiveness of urban transit during off-peak periods, as well-suited service for small cities or as part of a larger integrated transit system.

The present work describes the use of a needle-less stem cell injector with the Immediate <b>Drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>Demand</b> Technology (I-DOT) for cell injection in vitro. Methods: Mesenchymal stromal cells from human bone marrow were labeled with ethynyl-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 2 days and then were re-suspended. With the use of I-DOT, the cells were applied to type 1 collagen matrices or pig bladder tissue specimens with or without mucosa at different levels of energy. The collagen matrices were analyzed after 4 h and 5 days; bladder tissue specimens were analyzed 4 h after cell implantation. A 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide test (MTT) assay was performed immediately after cell application to the collagen matrices. Histological analysis with the use of frozen sections and immunofluorescence was used to localize EdU-labeled cells. Results: A considerable number of cells were detected by use of the MTT assay for collagen matrices. In the collagen matrix, the mean measured depth immediately after application ranged between 210 µm and 489 µm, 220 µm and 270 µm for entire bladder specimens, and 230 µm and 370 µm for bladder without mucosa. Cells survived for up to 5 days in the collagen matrix in both bladder specimens. Conclusions: Cells can survive during I-DOT application, which suggests that the I-DOT device may be a potentially suitable technology for needle-less cell application onto tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) methodology with the <b>Drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>Demand</b> (DoD) inkjet printing (IJP) technology has been successfully employed to develop a Solution Deposition Planarization (SDP) method. We have used nanocrystalline yttrium oxide (Y 2 O 3) to decrease the roughness of technical metallic substrates by filling the surface imperfections and thus avoiding costly polishing steps. This alternative process represents an outstanding methodology to reduce the final cost of the second-generation coated conductors manufacturing. Two Y 2 O 3 metalorganic precursor ink formulations were successfully developed and tested to obtain surfaces as smooth as possible with adequate mechanical properties to hold the internal stress developed during {{the growth of the}} subsequent layers. By using these inks as precursors for IJP and after a proper tuning of the rheological and wetting parameters, we firstly obtained centimeter length uniform 100 nm-thick SDP-Y 2 O 3 films on unpolished stainless-steel substrate from Bruker HTS. The scalability of the roll to roll (R 2 R) -IJP process to 100 m is then demonstrated on metallic substrates as well. A complete characterization of the prepared SDP-Y 2 O 3 inkjet-printed layers was carried out using optical microscopy, FIB-SEM (Focus Ion Beam coupled to Scanning Electron Microscopy), XRD (X-ray Diffraction), AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy), reflectometry and nanoindentation techniques. Then, the morphology, thickness, crystallinity and mechanical properties were evaluated, together with the surface roughness in order to assess the resulting layer planarity. The impact of planarity was additionally studied via growth of biaxially textured buffer layers as well as further functional layers. 1. 1 µm-thick YSZ layers with in-plane textures better than the stainless steel (SS) polished reference were successfully deposited on top of 100 nm SDP-Y 2 O 3 films yielding 50 % of Ic in contrast to the standard SS reference...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of an {{electronic medical record}} system in any large organization is as complex a task as {{the design of the}} system. During implementation, it is necessary that health care providers using the electronic system are able to communicate with colleagues who are continuing to work with the paper record. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, is well along the path to implementing an electronic medical record system. One of the key issues addressed has been the need for the electronic system to integrate with the paper record. This need to function in the dual electronic/paper environment has placed new <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> <b>printers,</b> required revision of some paper forms, and required the electronic system to create facsimilies of paper record forms. In addition, new security issues have been raised. Dual paper/electronic environment issues are an important challenge in the {{implementation of}} an electronic medical record...|$|R
40|$|Lanthanum Strontium Cobalt oxide (LSC) {{is a mixed}} ionic-electronic {{conductor}} (MIEC) ceramic {{suited for}} use as cathode material in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs). Extensive research is conducted on producing the cathode in the SOFC as a thin film to reduce operating temperatures and alleviate disadvantageous properties like high thermal expansion coefficient (TEC). One way of producing thin films is through ink-jet printing. Ink-jet printing is a cheap, simple and precise manufacturing method that produces less waste than other deposition methods. It is therefore of interest to explore the feasibility of producing LSC thin films this way. This thesis investigates the possibility of making a stable ceramic ink based on LSC. An LSC powder with the stoichiometry (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2) 0. 995 CoO 3 was used, produced by CerPoTech AS through spray pyrolysis. The powder was suspended in ten different liquid systems, five based on alpha-Terpineol, Isopropanol and PVP and five based on Ethylene Glycol, Distilled Water and Dolapix CE 64. All inks were characterised to find their particle size distribution, density, viscosity and surface tension. Particle size distribution data gathered over two days were {{used to evaluate the}} stability of the inks. The fluid properties were used to evaluate the jettability of the inks by means of the Z-parameter (Ohnesorge reciprocal), the Capillary-Weber parameter space defined by Nallan et al. (2014), and the Weber-Reynolds parameter space as defined by Derby (2003, 2010, 2011, 2015). Five out of the ten inks were printed onto paper as black squares of different transparency in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 layers using an Epson WorkForce WF- 2630 commercial office <b>printer</b> with piezoelectric <b>drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> (dod) inkjet technology. The one- and ten-layered squares were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy. The alpha-Terpineol based suspensions showed good stability against agglomeration and sedimentation over a two day period and an accurate deposition of a locally coherent film of LSC-powder was achieved through printing of a 50 wt% isopropanol suspension with a solid content of 19. 3 wt%...|$|R
40|$|The {{handling}} and dosing of cells {{is the most}} critical step in the microfabrication of cell-based assay systems for screening and toxicity testing applications. The use of robotic workstations for liquid handling has increased enormously over the last decades, {{in order to meet}} the requirements for high accuracy and high throughput of current bioanalytics. However, dispensing small volumes of cell suspensions up to the single cell level is still a great challenge. The Fraunhofer IPA developed the immediate <b>drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> technology (I-DOT) to overcome the challenge of dispensing cells in a small volume precisely and with low shear stress. It is a fast and flexible non-contact liquid handling system enabling dispensing liquids without the risk of cross-contamination down to a precise volume in the nanoliter range. Liquid is dispensed from a special source plate with a nozzle at the bottom. The small diameter keeps the liquid due to capillary forces inside the well and prevents leaking under normal pressure. To release a defined amount of liquid a short compressed air pulse is given through a quick release valve into the well, exceeding the capillary pressure in the nozzle. Droplets with a defined volume can be spotted directly onto plates or other cell culture devices. We present a study on the performance and biological impact of this technology by applying viable mammalian cells. The cell line MCF- 7, primary skin cells and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were tested for viability, adherence capability, apoptosis induction and proliferative capacity after printing with the I-DOT. Since stem cells are more sensitive to stress compared to cell lines and primary cells, hMSCs were analyzed for their adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity after printing. For all cell types tested, viability after dispensing was comparable to the control, all cells had a viability > 80 %. I-DOT application did not affect hMSCs in undergoing adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. I-DOT is an automated dispensing platform which can be easily integrated into automated work stations. It enables the user to apply accurate cells without detrimental fluorochrome tagging and shows promising potential for single cell and non-invasive stem cell application, 3 D-bioprinting and biomarker screening...|$|R
40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} of electrode using copper nanoparticle ink is presented. Electrode was printed on a flexible glass epoxy composite substrate using <b>drop</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> piezoelectric dispenser and was sintered at 200 °C in N 2 gas condition. The printed electrodes {{were made with}} various widths and thicknesses. Surface morphology of electrode was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Reliable dimensions for printed electronics were found from this study. 	Single-crystalline silicon solar cells were tested under four-point bending to find the feasibility of directly integrating them onto a carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminate. These solar cells {{were not able to}} withstand 0. 2 % strain. On the other hand, thin-film amorphous silicon solar cells were subjected to flexural fatigue loadings. The current density-voltage curves were analyzed at different cycles, and there was no noticeable degradation on its performance up to 100 cycles. A multifunctional composite laminate which can harvest and store solar energy was fabricated using printed electrodes. The integrated printed circuit board (PCB) was co-cured with a carbon/epoxy composite laminate by the vacuum bag molding process in an autoclave; an amorphous silicon solar cell and a thin-film solid state lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery were adhesively joined and electrically connected to a thin flexible PCB; and then the passive components such as resistors and diodes were electrically connected to the printed circuit board by silver pasting. Since a thin-film solid state Li-ion battery was not able to withstand tensile strain above 0. 4 %, thin Li-ion polymer batteries were tested under various mechanical loadings and environmental conditions to find the feasibility of using the polymer batteries for our multifunctional purpose. It was found that the Li-ion polymer batteries were stable under pressure and tensile loading without any noticeable degradation on its charge and discharge performances. Also, the active materials did not decompose at 80 °C, and the battery was performing well under low temperature of - 27 °C. Lastly, the batteries were embedded inside a carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminate to characterize their performance under fatigue loading. Finally, an intense pulsed light (IPL) was used to sinter printed silver nanoink patterns. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to find grain size of printed silver nanoink patterns. From these analyses it was confirmed that IPL is able to adequately sinter silver nanoink patterns for printed electronics without degradation of the substrates in less than 30 ms...|$|R
