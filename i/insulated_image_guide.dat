40|$|The {{millimeter}} wave, especially above 100 GHz, and the submillimeter wave {{frequency spectrum}} offers {{the possibility for}} narrow-beam, high-resolution antennas which are critical for high definition radars required for space debris tracking, airport ground avoidance radars, and missile tracking. In addition, the frequency which most atmospheric constituents may be detected lie {{in this part of}} the frequency spectrum. Therefore, the development of electronic components for millimeter/submillimeter wave passive sensors is required for environmental monitoring of the Earth's atmosphere. Typical microwave transmission lines such as microstrip and coplanar waveguide rely on two or more electrical conductors to concentrate and guide the electromagnetic energy. Unfortunately, the surface resistance of the conductors increases as the square root of frequency. In addition, the circuit dimensions must be decreased with increasing frequency to maintain a single mode transmission line which further increases the conductor loss. An alternative family of transmission lines are formed from two or more insulating materials and rely on the differences in the permittivities between the two materials to guide the wave. No metal conductors are required although some dielectric waveguides do utilize a metallic ground plane to facilitate the interconnections of active electrical elements or to reduce the transmission line size. Examples of such transmission lines are <b>image</b> <b>guides,</b> <b>insulated</b> <b>image</b> <b>guides,</b> trapped <b>image</b> <b>guides,</b> ridge guide, and layered ridge dielectric waveguide (LRDW). Although most dielectric waveguides have dimensions on the order of lambda to provide sufficient field confinement, the LRDW has been shown to provide good field confinement for electrically small lines. This offers an advantage in circuit integration. It has been shown that a periodic array of metallic strips placed either along or on top of a dielectric waveguide forms an effective radiator. This antenna is easy to fabricate and there is good background of microstrip type antenna design information in the literature. This paper reports the development of the first frequency scanning antenna fed by a LRDW...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: Biopsy of palpable breast masses can be {{performed}} manually by palpation guidance or under imaging guidance. Based on retrospective studies, <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy is considered more accurate than palpation guided breast biopsy; however, these techniques have not been compared prospectively. We conducted this prospective study to verify the superiority and determine the size of beneficial effect of <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy over palpation guided biopsy. Methods: Over a period of 18 months, 36 patients each with palpable breast masses were randomized into palpation <b>guided</b> and <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> breast biopsy arms. Ultrasound was used for image guidance in 33 patients and mammographic (stereotactic) guidance in three patients. All biopsies were performed using 14 gauge automated core biopsy needles. Inconclusive, suspicious or imaging-histologic discordant biopsies were repeated. Results: Malignancy was found in 30 of 36 women in palpation guided biopsy arm and 27 of 36 women in <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy arm. Palpation guided biopsy had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 46. 7, 100, 100, 27. 3 per cent, respectively, for diagnosing breast cancer. Nineteen of 36 women (52. 8 %) required repeat biopsy because of inadequate samples (7 of 19), suspicious findings (2 of 19) or imaging-histologic discordance (10 of 19). On repeat biopsy, malignancy was found in all cases of imaging-histologic discordance. <b>Image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy had 96. 3 per cent sensitivity and 100 per cent specificity. There was no case of inadequate sample or imaging-histologic discordance with <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> biopsy.

40|$|Parallel Optical Data Links (PODLs) {{have the}} {{potential}} to solve interconnection bottlenecks which are currently being experienced in high-speed communication and information processing systems. Such links often require a large number of channels and two-dimensional arrays of active optoelectronic devices are being developed.

The cytologic results were divided into four categories (inconclusive, benign, suspicious and malignant. Pathologic results were also divided into two categories (benign, malignant) and additional statistical analysis was conducted to find te cut-off point between benign and malignant cytologic results.

40|$|International audienceA {{wide variety}} of three {{dimensional}} (3 D) measurement systems that can extract shape information's with sub millimetric accuracy {{is available in the}} industry. However, they generally are of macroscopic size and measuring on confined areas is not feasible. To miniaturize such systems, the step proposed is the integration of flexible <b>image</b> <b>guides</b> combined with compact optical probes. This miniaturization process is tested on an active stereoscopic measurement system. In the projection channel of the system, a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) generates structured binary patterns from an incoherent white light source and injects them into a first <b>image</b> <b>guide.</b> Then, a compact optical system projects the pattern on the measurement area. The same configuration principle is applied to the acquisition channel and allows the capture of the measurement area through a second <b>image</b> <b>guide</b> and finally to a digital camera. In this miniaturized system, <b>image</b> <b>guides</b> have lower resolution than in standard imaging devices. Indeed they are equivalent of 70 k pixels devices to compare to the almost 800 k pixels of the DMD and camera. That implies lower axial and lateral resolutions and consequently the shape reconstruction method must be carefully chosen. In this paper, several reconstruction strategies such as tuning the projected patterns frequency and also phase-shfit versus gray code based methods were compared considering the best axial resolution criteria. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology {{is the first}} line of diagnostic procedure in diagnosing lung malignancies and confirming metastasis. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out in pathology department of P. D. U. Medical College & hospital. Data of 58 patients who underwent <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> FNAC between August 2015 to July 2016 was obtained. All the cases were referred to Pathology department for guided FNAC from the TB & Chest department. <b>Image</b> <b>guided</b> (USG/CT) FNAC was carried out as an outpatient procedure after explaining all the risks and benefits and taking informed consent from each patient. FNAC was performed by 22 - 24 gauge needle attached to a 10 ml syringe for superficial masses and a 9 -cm, 20 - 22 gauge spinal needle for deep-seated masses. The spread glass material was immediately fixed in 95 % alcohol for H&E staining. Few slides with material were kept air dried, which were used for MGG staining. The lesions were divided into benign/inflammatory, malignant and unsatisfactory categories. Results: Total 58 cases were studied in which <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> FNAC was done for lung lesion. There were total 13 benign/inflammatory cases against 42 malignant cases. 3 cases were unsatisfactory so they were excluded. In present study predominantly male patients were affected.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} our project is to develop an <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> system for the medialization laryngoplasty. One of the {{fundamental}} challenges in our system is to accurately register the preoperative 3 D CT data to the intraoperative 3 D surfaces of the patient. In this paper, we will present a combined surface and fiducial based registration method to register the preoperative 3 D CT data to the intraoperative surface of larynx. To accurately model the exposed surface area, an active illumination based stereo vision technique {{is used for the}} surface reconstruction. To register the point clouds from the intraoperative stage to the preoperative 3 D CT data, a shape priori based ICP method is proposed to quickly register the two surfaces. The proposed approach is capable of tracking the fiducial markers and reconstructing the surface of larynx with no damage to the anatomical structure. Although, the proposed method is specifically designed for the <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> laryngoplasty, it can be applied to other <b>image</b> <b>guided</b> surgical areas.
