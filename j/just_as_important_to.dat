25|$|The {{independent}} architectural {{language of}} Enric Miralles {{can be difficult}} to classify in terms of contemporary architecture. It is influenced by Spanish architects, such as Alejandro de la Sota, José Antonio Coderch and Josep Maria Jujol, and also from international greats such as Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and Alvar Aalto and the Russian Constructivist movement of the early 20th century. The freely formed buildings utilising massive building materials and steel, develop from their relationship with the environment and connect themselves to it. The form is constructed using often unusual materials which are generally left with natural surfaces. Form and material interpret the place, traditions and history in a personal and poetic art, as his critics attest. From the starting point of the townscape or landscape he would design a building in its totality, down to the details of the furnishing and the exterior installations. Therefore, the execution of the details was <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the communication of meaning as the main form.

2500|$|Though not {{as obvious}} as the car's radical styling, the new chassis was <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the Sting Ray's success.

The latter might ordinarily imply a choppier ride, but the altered weight distribution partly compensated for it. Less weight on the front wheels also meant easier steering, and with some 80 additional pounds on the rear wheels, the Sting Ray offered improved traction. Stopping power improved, too. Four-wheel cast-iron 11-inch drum brakes remained standard but were now wider, {{for an increase in}} effective braking area. Sintered-metallic linings, segmented for cooling, were again optional. So were finned aluminum drums, which not only provided faster heat dissipation (and thus better fade resistance) but less unsprung weight. Power assist was available with both brake packages.

Most posters, Maus summarised, feared that the band's appeal would become essentially limited to a cult following; [...] "dissent, along the lines that the fans would always have the Pet Shop Boys, no matter what happened commercially, was scarce and ineffectual". Noting the fact that Pet Shop Boys [...] "began their career with hits", Maus made the point that this early success was valued by fans: the band's [...] "large audiences" [...] were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> [...] "many fans" [...] as the making of [...] "distinctive music that individual fans loved".|$|E

He eventually put his own sound into a Bing Crosby song, [...] "It's Been a Long, Long Time," [...] which was a number one single in 1945. During a post-recording session talk, Crosby suggested that Paul try building his own recording studio so he could produce the sound he wanted.

Recently, the advent of an increasingly long list of commercial tests has raised the real possibility of introducing standardized centrally validated testing methods, and using them to bring laboratories up to a similarly uniform level. Unfortunately, they have also had the effect of seeming to make specialist virologists unnecessary, except in a few central reference laboratories. As a consequence, and because of increasing pressure on health service resources, vacated senior virology posts have remained unfilled and this now threatens the career structure of those who want to become, and continue as, virologists.
