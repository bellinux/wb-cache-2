5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather <b>heterogenous</b> series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two <b>heterogenous</b> types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{changes to the}} ethnic {{composition}} of Slavonian counties occurred between censuses conducted in 1991 and 2001. The 1991 census recorded a <b>heterogenous</b> population consisting mostly of Croats and Serbs—at 72 percent and 17 {{percent of the total}} population respectively. The Croatian War of Independence, and the ethnic fracturing of Yugoslavia that preceded it, caused an exodus of the Croat population followed by an exodus of Serbs. The return of refugees since the end of hostilities is not complete—a majority of Croat refugees returned, while fewer Serbs did. In addition, ethnic Croats moved to Slavonia from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Serbia.|$|E

25|$|A snowpack {{will fail}} when the load exceeds the {{strength}}. The load is straightforward; {{it is the}} weight of the snow. However, the strength of the snowpack is much more difficult to determine and is extremely <b>heterogenous.</b> It varies in detail with properties of the snow grains, size, density, morphology, temperature, water content; and the properties of the bonds between the grains.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{conclude}} that the population living around Verteba Cave was fairly <b>heterogenous,</b> but that the wide chronological age of the specimens might indicate that the heterogeneity might {{have been due to}} natural population flow during this timeframe. The authors also link the R0(xHV) and HV(xH) haplogroups with European Paleolithic populations, and consider the T4 and J haplogroups as hallmarks of Neolithic demic intrusions from the southeast (the north-pontic region) rather than from the west (i.e. the Linear Pottery culture).|$|E
25|$|It is in {{the zone}} east of Rua da Rosa that the {{orthogonal}} design of the Bairro is more perceptible. The zone west of the neighborhood, which initially represented {{the periphery of the}} city, is more <b>heterogenous,</b> and where the majority of the monumental buildings were constructed. Situated on the Travessa dos Inglesinhos and Rua dos Caetanos is the old Convento e Colégio dos Inglesinhos (Convent and College of the English), Convento dos Caetanos(Convent of the Caetanos), home to the National Conservatory, and to the southeast limit, thePalácio Marim-Olhão (Palace Marim-Olhão).|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{is defined}} by its {{physiological}} impact, with many <b>heterogenous</b> types of fibers. Some fibers may primarily impact one of these benefits (i.e., cellulose increases fecal bulking and prevents constipation), but many fibers impact {{more than one of}} these benefits (i.e., resistant starch increases bulking, increases colonic fermentation, positively modulates colonic microflora and increases satiety and insulin sensitivity). The beneficial effects of high fiber diets are the summation {{of the effects of the}} different types of fiber present in the diet and also other components of such diets.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of mega-telomeres varies between species. For example, human chromosomes {{do not have}} mega-telomeres while mice and many species of birds do. There is also variation in their structure and location within the same species. In mice and birds, mega-telomeres regions are observed to be hypervariable, meaning {{that there is a}} high degree of polymorphism in the size and position of mega-telomeres between individuals, including those of highly inbred lines. Analysis of siblings from highly inbred chicken-lines have suggested that these ultra-long telomeric sequences are extremely <b>heterogenous.</b> Similar observations of heterogeneity have also been made in mice.|$|E
25|$|Neglect is a <b>heterogenous</b> {{disorder}} that manifests itself radically differently in different patients. No single mechanism {{can account for}} these different manifestations. A vast array of impaired mechanisms are found in neglect. These mechanisms alone would not cause neglect. The complexity of attention alone—just one of several mechanisms that may interact—has generated multiple competing hypothetical explanations of neglect. So {{it is not surprising}} that it has proven difficult to assign particular presentations of neglect to specific neuroanatomical loci. Despite such limitations, we may loosely describe unilateral neglect with four overlapping variables: type, range, axis, and orientation.|$|E
25|$|Neuronal {{migration}} disorder (NMD) {{refers to}} a <b>heterogenous</b> group of disorders that, it is supposed, share the same etiopathological mechanism: a variable degree of disruption in the migration of neuroblasts during neurogenesis. The neuronal migration disorders are cerebral dysgenesis, brain malformations caused by primary alterations during neurogenesis; on the other hand, brain malformations are highly diverse and refer to any insult to the brain during its formation and maturation due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes that ultimately will alter the normal brain anatomy. However, there is some controversy in the terminology because virtually any malformation will involve neuroblast migration, either primarily or secondarily.|$|E
25|$|The cruiser {{fired in}} anger {{for the first}} time on 12 June 1940, in {{retaliation}} to Italian aircraft attacking Aden. On 19 June, the cruiser's Walrus amphibious aircraft dropped bombs on an Italian wireless station on Centre Peak Island in the Red Sea. At the start of August, Hobart escorted a relief force to Berbera, in response to the Italian invasion of British Somaliland. Two weeks later, the decision was made to abandon British Somaliland, and Hobart was designated headquarters for the evacuation. The Walrus was used to successfully fend off air raids and bomb the Italian headquarters at Zeila, while a 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting gun was converted into an anti-tank gun and sent to assist in the rearguard action, although the three volunteers crewing the weapon were captured. Hobarts captain orchestrated the evacuation of over 7,000 soldiers and civilians aboard a <b>heterogenous</b> flotilla of vessels. The cruiser was the last ship to leave on 19 August, collecting stragglers in the ship's boats while demolition teams and the ship's guns destroyed anything of value.|$|E
25|$|During the Anglo-Saxon migration, {{which began}} in the fifth century CE, Germanic-speaking tribes from {{continental}} northern Europe, such as the Angles, Jutes and Saxons, arrived in Britain, where their own culture—with its accompanying language and pagan religion—became dominant across much of eastern Britain. Those Romano-British peoples still residing in these areas either adopted and integrated with this incoming culture or migrated westward. The Anglo-Saxons brought with them their own <b>heterogenous</b> forms of burial practice, which were distinct from those of the British peoples living in western and northern Britain during the Early Medieval, having more in common with those of pagan continental Europe. However, not all of those given an Anglo-Saxon burial at this time were necessarily migrants or the descendents of migrants from continental Europe. Some may have been ethnically descended from the earlier Romano-British people, but who had adopted Anglo-Saxon culture as it became dominant across southern and eastern Britain. An example of such cohabitation can be seen at Wasperton and Stretton-on-the-Fosse in Warwickshire, where Anglo-Saxon graves were found alongside those that were Romano-British in character.|$|E
25|$|Parque Nacionál Amboró {{is one of}} {{the most}} botanically rich {{national}} parks in the world. The current number of documented plant species totals around 3,000, though this is almost certainly an underestimate. By comparison, the much more thoroughly documented and very biologically rich Hawaiian Island archipelago, which covers about six times the total area of Parque Nacional Amboró, has only about 2,800 native plant species, while the British Isles (covering about 65 times the area of Amboró) have only around 2,000. Even the entire California Floristic Province, one of the world's botanical biodiversity hotspots, contains only 8,000 plant species—about 2.5 times as many as Amboró—though it covers an over 170 times larger. Much of the biodiversity of Amboró is partitioned according to the park's highly dissected topography and the widely varying climatic regimes that accompany the sharp transitions in elevation. Vegetational diversity is equally exceptional within the park, with lowland forests, montane forests, yungas and cloud forest, subpáramo, montane and non-montane scrublands, pampas, cactus forests, palm forests, forests composed almost entirely of treeferns, bromeliad-laden cliffs, epilithic subalpine plant communities, and others. The ecotones between these vegetation types are often sharply delineated according to aspect and elevation, yielding a highly <b>heterogenous</b> landscape that can make traveling in the park a dramatic and surprising experience.|$|E

2500|$|Lysosomal storage {{disorders}} {{are not included}} in newborn screening programs with high frequency. [...] As a group, they are <b>heterogenous,</b> with screening only being feasible for {{a small fraction of the}} approximately 40 identified disorders. [...] The arguments for their inclusion in newborn screening programs center around the advantage of early treatment (when treatment is available), avoiding a diagnostic odyssey for families and providing information for family planning to couples who have an affected child. [...] The arguments against including these disorders, as a group or individually center around the difficulties with reliably identifying individuals who will be affected with a severe form of the disorder, the relatively unproven nature of the treatment methods, and the high cost / high risk associated with some treatment options.|$|E
2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that [...] "Henderson's central {{idea was}} {{what you might call}} the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of {{overwhelming}} the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, in the business world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing <b>heterogenous</b> elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected." ...|$|E

2500|$|The genetic {{homogeneity}} of insect colonies makes them theoretically susceptible to infection en masse; the high similarity {{of each group}} members genome means that each is susceptible (and resistant) to the same parasites, whilst experimental manipulation has demonstrated that genetically <b>heterogenous</b> colonies of B. terrestris have lower levels of parasite infection than homogenous colonies. To increase genetic diversity, colonies can {{increase the number of}} queens and/or increase the number of mating partners a queen has— it is thought these social immune benefits may explain the seemingly costly polyandry found in social insect colonies. Social Hymenoptera also have exceptionally high rates of meiotic recombination when compared against a wide range of higher eukaryote taxa which further increases genetic diversity. [...] Ongoing theoretical and empirical work is seeking to tease out the scenarios in which these immune benefits of genetic heterogeneity can be negated due to concomitant costs, e.g., the increased intra-colony conflict and/or susceptibility to an increasing number of parasites which comes with increased genetic diversity.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have been}} amused of late, by tracing, in the {{publications}} at home, {{a great and}} growing admiration for the Prussian polity! There is something so absurd in an American's extolling such a system, that it is scarcely possible to say where human vagaries are to end. The Prussian government is a despotism; a mode of ruling that one would think the world understood pretty well by this time. It {{is true that the}} government is mildly administered, and hence all the mystifying that we hear and read about it. Prussia is a kingdom compounded of <b>heterogenous</b> parts; the north is Protestant, the south Catholic; the nation has been overrun in our own times, and the empire dismembered. Ruled by a king of an amiable and paternal disposition, and one who has been chastened by severe misfortunes, circumstances have conspired to render his sway mild and useful. No one disputes, that the government which is controlled by a single will, when that will is pure, intelligent, and just, is the best possible. It is the government of the universe, which is perfect harmony. But men with pure intentions, and intelligent and just minds, are rare, and more rare among rulers, perhaps, than any other class of men. Even Frederic II, though intelligent enough, was a tyrant. He led his subjects to slaughter for his own aggrandizement. His father, Frederic William, used to compel tall men to marry tall women. The time for the latter description of tyranny may be past, but oppression has many outlets, and the next king may discover some of them. In such a case his subjects would probably take refuge in a revolution and a constitution, demanding guarantees against this admirable system, and blow the new model-government to the winds! ...|$|E
