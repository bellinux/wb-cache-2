5|$|The {{battle was}} the first of three {{separate}} major land offensives by the Japanese in the Guadalcanal campaign. The Japanese realized after Tenaru that Allied forces on Guadalcanal were much greater in number than originally estimated and sent larger <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island for their subsequent attempts to retake Henderson Field.|$|E
5|$|The {{continent}} didn't {{split into}} two because the Grenville province (a microcontinent) was converging with the proto-North American continent to the east. This convergence applied compressional <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rift, preventing the complete splitting apart of the proto-North American continent.|$|E
5|$|After conquering Karasahr, She'er led his <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{kingdom of}} Kucha. The army of Kucha, {{comprising}} 50,000 soldiers, lost to She'er. The king of Kucha fled with his soldiers {{to the kingdom}} of Aksu. After a forty-day siege, the king was captured and the Kucha forces surrendered on 19 January 649. Tang military garrisons were installed {{in the region to}} administer the annexed oasis states. These garrisons, known as the Four Garrisons of Anxi, were located in Kucha, Kashgar, Khotan, and Karasahr.|$|E

5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur, Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation.|$|E
5|$|Although the Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—had {{achieved}} several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, in Italy the Coalition's achievements {{were more}} limited. In northern Italy, {{despite the presence}} of the most experienced of the Austrian generals—Dagobert Wurmser—the Austrians could not lift the siege at Mantua, and the efforts of Napoleon in northern Italy pushed Austrian <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, which led to the formal peace treaty, the Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, {{and for a}} time, the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were {{directly related to the}} respective progress of Islam.|$|E

5|$|During his presidency, Argentina {{aligned with}} the United States, and had special {{relations}} with the country. Menem had a positive relation with US president George H. W. Bush, and maintained it with his successor Bill Clinton. The country left the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Cóndor missile program was discontinued. Argentina supported all the international positions of the US, and sent <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gulf War, and the peace keeping efforts after the Kosovo War. The country was accepted as a Major non-NATO ally, but not as a full member.|$|E
5|$|During that month, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad {{indicated}} {{his intentions}} {{of going to}} war against Israel. Egypt and Syria agreed to coordinate military action via negotiations, and the respective Ministers of War formulated a common military strategy. Egypt enlisted the political support of several more Arab countries, some producers of oil. Sadat discussed {{the possibility of using}} oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing Arab nations, primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front lines.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a series}} of harassing attacks by Saladin's, battle was joined {{on the morning of}} 7 September 1191. Richard's army {{successfully}} resisted attempts to disrupt its cohesion until the Hospitallers broke ranks and charged; Richard then committed all his <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attack. He regrouped his army after its initial success, and led it to victory. The battle resulted in the coastal area of central Palestine, including the port of Jaffa, returning to Christian control.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in Europe the Australian government decided against contributing Australian <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> occupation forces that were sent to Germany {{as part of the}} post war settlement so that it could begin the repatriation of the AIF early. Lieutenant General Sir John Monash was appointed Director-General of Repatriation and Demobilisation and oversaw the process in Britain, while Lieutenant General Henry Chauvel took charge of the efforts in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the South Korea by North Korea, and the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, the United Nations decided to enter the conflict on behalf of South Korea.

5|$|In April 1949, Stewart {{replaced}} Major General Norman Weir as Chief of the General Staff, New Zealand Military Forces. He reestablished compulsory {{military training}} and advanced {{plans for the}} government's commitment to deploy military <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle East {{in the event of}} hostilities with the Soviet Union. This led to a clash with Prime Minister Sydney Holland in 1950 over the rate of progress of these plans for which he later apologised. He also oversaw the deployment of New Zealand forces to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War.|$|E

5|$|In the {{mountains}} northeast of Waegwan, the ROK 1st Division continued to suffer North Korean attacks throughout mid-August. North Korean pressure against the ROK division never ceased for long. US planners believed the main North Korean attack {{would come from}} the west, and so it massed its <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Taegu. It mistakenly believed up to 40,000 North Korean troops were near Taegu. This number was above the actual troop numbers for North Korea, which had only 70,000 men along the entire perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{ordered the}} attack to be {{mounted on the}} night of 6/7 August. To avoid {{alerting}} American <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attack, there would be no preparatory artillery bombardments. The intention was to hit the U.S. 30th Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Leland Hobbs, east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast. Had surprise been achieved, the attack might well have succeeded, but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation Lüttich by August 4. As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the RAF.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July Hitler summoned Manstein and the {{commander}} of Army Group Center – Field Marshal Günther von Kluge – to his headquarters, the Wolfsschanze in East Prussia. The Allied invasion of Sicily {{on the night of}} 9–10 July, combined with the Soviet counteroffensive of Operation Kutuzov against the flank and rear of General Walter Model's 9th Army on the northern side of the Kursk salient on 12 July, and the attacks by strong Soviet forces at Prokhorovka the same day had caused Hitler to stop the offensive and begin redeploying <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean theatre. He ordered his generals to terminate Operation Citadel.|$|E

Twelve NATO members contributed <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties.|$|E

Blamey stepped up to command the 3rd Division on 23 March 1931, and was promoted to major general, one of only four Militia officers promoted to this rank between 1929 and 1939.
