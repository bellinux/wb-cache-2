5|$|For {{his second}} <b>envoi,</b> {{not wishing to}} test the Académie's {{tolerance}} too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work {{in the form of}} a secular mass on a text by Horace. This work, entitled Carmen Saeculare, was intended as a song to Apollo and Diana. No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it. A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet's Rome years; in addition to Carmen Saeculare, he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode on the theme of Ulysses and Circe. After Don Procopio, Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem Vasco da Gama. This replaced Carmen Saeculare as his second <b>envoi,</b> and was well received by the Académie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Through {{the winter}} of 1858–59, Bizet worked on his first <b>envoi,</b> an opera buffa setting of Carlo Cambiaggio's {{libretto}} Don Procopio. Under the terms of his prize, Bizet's first <b>envoi</b> {{was supposed to be}} a mass, but after his Te Deum experience, he was averse to writing religious music. He was apprehensive about how this breach of the rules would be received at the Académie, but their response to Don Procopio was initially positive, with praise for the composer's [...] "easy and brilliant touch" [...] and [...] "youthful and bold style".|$|E
500|$|The sixth stanza is {{followed}} by a tercet that is known variably by the French term <b>envoi,</b> the Occitan term tornada, or, with reference to its size in relation to the preceding stanzas, a [...] "half-stanza". It consists of three lines that include all six of the line-endings words of the preceding stanzas. This should take the pattern of 2–5, 4–3, 6–1 (numbers relative to the first stanza); the first end-word of each pair can occur anywhere in the line, while the second must end the line. However, the end-word order of the <b>envoi</b> is no longer strictly enforced.|$|E
500|$|A sestina (Old Occitan: cledisat {{also known}} as sestine, sextine, sextain) is a fixed verse form {{consisting}} of six stanzas of six lines each, normally followed by a three-line <b>envoi.</b> The words that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings {{in each of the}} following stanzas, rotated in a set pattern.|$|E
500|$|In the 1870s, {{there was}} a revival of {{interest}} in French forms, led by Andrew Lang, Austin Dobson, Edmund Gosse, W. E. Henley, John Payne, and others. The earliest sestina of this period is Algernon Charles Swinburne's [...] "Sestina". It is in iambic pentameter rhyming ababab in the first stanza; each stanza begins by repeating the previous end-words 6 then 1, but the following 4 lines repeat the remaining end-words ad lib; the <b>envoi</b> is (1) 4 / (2) 3 / (5) 6. In the same volume (Poems and Ballads, Second Series, 1878) Swinburne introduces a [...] "double sestina" [...] ("The Complaint of Lisa") that is unlike Sidney's: it comprises 12 stanzas of 12 iambic pentameter lines each, the first stanza rhyming abcabdcefedf. Similar to his [...] "Sestina", each stanza first repeats end-words 12 then 1 of the previous stanza; the rest are ad lib. The <b>envoi</b> is (12) 10 / (8) 9 / (7) 4 / (3) 6 / (2) 1 / (11) 5.|$|E
500|$|The first {{appearance}} of the sestina in English print is [...] "Ye wastefull woodes", comprising lines 151–89 of the August Æglogue in Edmund Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar, published in 1579. It is in unrhymed iambic pentameter, but the order of end-words in each stanza is non-standard – ending 123456, 612345, etc. – each stanza promoting the previous final end-word to the first line, but otherwise leaving the order intact; the <b>envoi</b> order is (1) 2 / (3) 4 / (5) 6. This scheme was set by the Spaniard Gutierre de Cetina.|$|E
500|$|Bizet's third <b>envoi</b> {{was delayed}} {{for nearly a}} year by the {{prolonged}} illness and death, in September 1861, of his mother. He eventually submitted a trio of orchestral works: an overture entitled La Chasse d'Ossian, a scherzo and a funeral march. The overture has been lost; the scherzo was later absorbed into the Roma symphony, and the funeral march music was adapted and used in a later opera. Bizet's fourth and final <b>envoi,</b> which occupied him for much of 1862, was a one-act opera, La guzla de l'émir. As a state-subsidised theatre, the Opéra-Comique was obliged {{from time to time to}} stage the works of Prix de Rome laureates, and La guzla duly went into rehearsal in 1863. However, in April Bizet received an offer, which originated from Count Walewski, to compose the music for a three-act opera. This was Les pêcheurs de perles, based on a libretto by Michel Carré and Eugène Cormon. Because a condition of this offer was that the opera should be the composer's first publicly staged work, Bizet hurriedly withdrew La guzla from production and incorporated parts of its music into the new opera. The first performance of Les pêcheurs de perles, by the Théâtre Lyrique company, was on 30 September 1863. Critical opinion was generally hostile, though Berlioz praised the work, writing that it [...] "does M. Bizet the greatest honour". Public reaction was lukewarm, and the opera's run ended after 18 performances. It was not performed again until 1886.|$|E
500|$|Although they {{appeared}} in print later, Philip Sidney's three sestinas {{may have been}} written earlier, and are often credited as the first in English. The first published (toward the end of Book I of The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia, 1590) is the double sestina [...] "Ye Goatherd Gods". In this variant the standard end-word pattern is repeated for twelve stanzas, ending with a three-line <b>envoi,</b> resulting in a poem of 75 lines. Two others were published in subsequent editions of the Arcadia. The second, [...] "Since wailing is a bud of causeful sorrow", is in the [...] "standard" [...] form. Like [...] "Ye Goatherd Gods" [...] it is written in unrhymed iambic pentameter and uses exclusively feminine endings, reflecting the Italian endecasillabo. The third, [...] "Farewell, O sun, Arcadia's clearest light", is the first rhyming sestina in English: it is in iambic pentameters and follows the standard end-word scheme, but rhymes ababcc in the first stanza (the rhyme scheme necessarily changes in each subsequent stanza, a consequence {{of which is that}} the 6th stanza is in rhyming couplets). Sidney uses the same <b>envoi</b> structure as Spenser. William Drummond of Hawthornden published two sestinas (which he called [...] "sextains") in 1616, which copy the form of Sidney's rhyming sestina. After this, there is an absence of notable sestinas for over 250 years, with John Frederick Nims noting that, [...] "...there is not a single sestina in the three volumes of the Oxford anthologies that cover the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." ...|$|E
500|$|Originating in the Provence {{region of}} present-day France, Occitan {{literature}} {{spread through the}} tradition of the troubadours in the High Middle Ages. The tornada became a hallmark of the language's lyric poetry tradition which emerged [...] 1000 in a region called Occitania that now comprises parts of modern-day France, Italy and Catalonia (northeastern Spain). Under the influence of the troubadours, related movements sprang up throughout medieval Europe: the Minnesang in Germany, trovadorismo in Galicia (northeastern Spain) and Portugal, and that of the trouvères in northern France. Because of this, the concept embodied in the tornada has been found in other Romance language literatures that can directly trace several of their techniques from the Occitan lyric tradition. The tornada appears in Old French literature as the <b>envoi,</b> in [...] Galician-Portuguese literature as the finda, and in Italian literature as the congedo and commiato. The tornada has been used and developed by poets in the Renaissance such as Petrarch (1304–1374) and Dante Alighieri (c.1265–1321), and it continues to be invoked in the poetic forms that originated with the Occitan lyrical tradition that have survived into modernity.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 126 {{has been}} dubbed the <b>envoi</b> to the [...] "Fair Youth" [...] sonnets. An envoy or <b>envoi,</b> {{as defined by the}} Oxford English Dictionary is [...] "The action of sending forth a poem; hence, the {{concluding}} part of a poetical or prose composition; the author's parting words; a dedication, postscript. Now chiefly the short stanza which concludes a poem written in certain archaic metrical forms." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Politics" [...] is {{a poem by}} Irish poet William Butler Yeats {{written on}} May 24, 1938. It was {{composed}} {{during the time of}} the Spanish Civil War as well as during the pre-war period of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich in Germany. The poem hints at the political situations of Rome (or Italy), Russia, and Spain, but ultimately discusses topics more relevant to private human interaction rather than public, or political situations. The poem never mentions Germany or Hitler, despite the fact that the [...] "war and war's alarms" [...] surrounding the poem's creation arose from fears of Germany's aggression rather than Italy's, Russia's, or Spain's. Many versions of the text exist: the original typescript of May 1938, the first typescript with hand-written corrections dated August 12, 1938, as well as a final [...] "Coole Edition" [...] of the poem dated June 29, 1939, which was not published until it was included in Last Poems in 1939. Yeats intended for the poem to be printed last in the collection, as an <b>envoi</b> to [...] "The Circus Animals' Desertion", and while a debate as to the true order of the poems has continued since 1939, [...] "Politics" [...] was the last lyric poem Yeats wrote and remains the final work printed in all posthumous editions.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, after both Forster and McLennan {{had each}} {{recorded}} four solo albums, The Go-Betweens reformed with Pickvance, {{to create a}} new studio album, The Friends of Rachel Worth, they were assisted by Janet Weiss (Sleater-Kinney, Quasi) on drums and backing vocals and Sam Coomes (Quasi) on keyboards. It was issued in September with Bäumler credited for string arrangements, and production duties shared by Coomes, Forster, McLennan and Weiss. Allmusic's Hal Horowitz praised their [...] "oetic, languid, spoken/sung vocals similar to Lou Reed weave between lovely melodies whose appeal unfolds with repeated listens"; however it [...] "sounds more like a combination of two solo albums rather than one from a cohesive unit". The Village Voices critic, Robert Christgau, described them as [...] "rather than lyric poets, as I once thought, Forster and McLennan are better conceived as short-story writers, with the concreteness and forward motion of voices and music compensating for imagistic technique and low word count". He declared that Foster's tracks [...] "are the catchiest and most fetching tracks on the album, taking up surfing dreams, a fond and funny <b>envoi</b> to Patti Smith, and a life-swapping fable that {{when you think about it}} may be a love song after all".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} Han era contributions to poetry is the compilation of the Chuci anthology of poetry, which preserves many poems attributed to Qu Yuan and Song Yu from the Warring States period (ended 221 BC), though about half of the poems seem to have been in fact composed during the Han Dynasty. The meaning of Chuci is something like [...] "The Material of Chu", referring to the ancient Land of Chu. The traditional version of the Chu Ci contains 17 major sections, anthologized with its current contents by Wang Yi, a 2nd-century AD librarian who served under Emperor Shun of Han, who appended his own verses derivative of the Chuci or [...] "sao" [...] style {{at the end of the}} collection, under the title of Nine Longings. The poems and pieces of the Chu Ci anthology vary in their formal poetic styles, including varying line metrics, varying use of exclamatory particles, the use or not of titles for individual pieces within a section, and the varying presence of the luan (or, <b>envoi).</b> Other Han period poets besides Wang Yi the librarian who are known or thought to be contributors of poems collected in the Chuci include the poet Wang Bao and the scholar Liu Xiang. Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, and his literary circle were involved with the Chuci material, but the attribution of authorship of any particular poems is uncertain.|$|E

60|$|And, after all, the Parliament {{changed his}} {{sentence}} {{into one of}} banishment; and to Roussillon, in Dauphiny, our poet must carry his woes without delay. Travellers between Lyons and Marseilles may remember a station on the line, some way below Vienne, where the Rhone fleets seaward between vine-clad hills. This was Villon's Siberia. It {{would be a little}} warm in summer perhaps, and a little cold in winter in that draughty valley between two great mountain fields; but what with the hills, and the racing river, and the fiery Rhone wines, he was little to be pitied on the conditions of his exile. Villon, in a remarkably bad ballad, written in a breath, heartily thanked and fulsomely belauded the Parliament; the <b>ENVOI,</b> like the proverbial postscript of a lady's letter, containing the pith of his performance in a request for three days' delay to settle his affairs and bid his friends farewell. He was probably not followed out of Paris, like Antoine Fradin, the popular preacher, another exile of a few years later, by weeping multitudes; (1) but I daresay one or two rogues of his acquaintance would keep him company for a mile or so on the south road, and drink a bottle with him before they turned. For banished people, in those days, seem to have set out on their own responsibility, in their own guard, and at their own expense. It was no joke to make one's way from Paris to Roussillon alone and penniless in the fifteenth century. Villon says he left a rag of his tails on every bush. Indeed, he must have had many a weary tramp, many a slender meal, and many a to-do with blustering captains of the Ordonnance. But with one of his light fingers, we may fancy that he took as good as he gave; for every rag of his tail, he would manage to indemnify himself upon the population in the shape of food, or wine, or ringing money; and his route would be traceable across France and Burgundy by housewives and inn-keepers lamenting over petty thefts, like the track of a single human locust. A strange figure he must have cut {{in the eyes of the}} good country people: this ragged, blackguard city poet, with a smack of the Paris student, and a smack of the Paris street arab, posting along the highways, in rain or sun, among the green fields and vineyards. For himself, he had no taste for rural loveliness; green fields and vineyards would be mighty indifferent to Master Francis; but he would often have his tongue in his cheek at the simplicity of rustic dupes, and often, at city gates, he might stop to contemplate the gibbet with its swinging bodies, and hug himself on his escape.|$|E
6000|$|J'aurais dû déjà vous remercier de tout le plaisir que vous m'avez fait en m'envoyant Sapho. Je vous suis très-reconnaissant de cette bonne et amicale pensée, qui s'ajoutera désormais, pour moi, au {{souvenir}} du livre. Je n'avais pas attendu l'arrivée de votre volume pour le lire--mais cela m'a donné l'occasion de m'y remettre encore et de tirer un peu au clair les diverses impressions que tant d'admirables pages m'ont laissées. Je n'essaierai pas de vous rapporter ces impressions dans leur plénitude--dans la crainte de ne réussir qu'à déformer ma pensée--tout autant que la vôtre. Un nouveau livre de vous me fait passer par l'esprit une foule de belles idées, que je vous confierais de vive voix--et de grand cœur--si j'avais le bonheur de vous voir plus souvent. Pour le moment, je vous dirai seulement que tout ce qui vient de vous compte, pour moi, comme un grand évènement, une jouissance rare et fructueuse. Je vous aime mieux dans certaines pages que dans d'autres, mais vous me charmez, vous m'enlevez toujours, et votre manière me pénètre plus qu'aucune autre. Je trouve dans Sapho énormément de vérité et de vie. Ce n'est pas du roman, c'est de l'histoire, et de la plus complète et de la mieux éclairée. Lorsqu'on a fait un livre aussi solide et aussi sérieux que celui-là, on n'a besoin d'être rassuré par personne; ce n'est donc que pour m'encourager moi-même que je constate dans Sapho encore une preuve--à ajouter à celles que vous avez données--de tout ce que le roman peut accomplir comme révélation de la vie et du drôle de mélange que nous sommes. La fille est étudiée avec une patience merveilleuse--c'est un de ces portraits qui épuisent un type. Je vous avouerai que je trouve le jeune homme un peu sacrifié--comme étude et comme recherche--sa figure me paraissant moins éclairée--en comparaison de celle de la femme--qu'il ne le faudrait pour l'ntérêt moral la valeur tragique. J'aurais voulu que vous nous eussiez fait voir davantage par où il a passé--en matière d'expérience plus personnelle et plus intime encore que les coucheries avec Fanny--en matière de rammollissement de volonté et de relâchement d'âme. En un mot, le drame ne se passe peut-être pas assez dans l'âme et dans la conscience de Jean. C'est à mesure que nous touchons à son caractère même que la situation devient intéressante--et ce caractère, vous me faites l'effet de l'avoir un peu négligé. Vous me direz que voilà un jugement bien anglais, et que nous inventons des abstractions, comme nous disons, afin de nous dispenser de toucher aux grosses réalités. J'estime pourtant qu'il n'y a rien de plus réel, de plus positif, de plus à peindre, qu'un caractère; c'est là qu'on trouve bien la couleur et la forme. Vous l'avez bien prouvé, du reste, dans chacun de vos livres, et en vous disant que vous avez laissé l'amant de Sapho un peu trop en blanc, ce n'est qu'avec vous-même que je vous compare. Mais je ne voulais que vous remercier et répondre à votre <b>envoi.</b> Je vous souhaite tout le repos qu'il vous faudra pour recommencer encore!
