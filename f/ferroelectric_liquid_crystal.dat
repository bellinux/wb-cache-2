40|$|The <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> (FLCs) are {{demanding}} high attention now a day, {{because of their}} potential applications in many electro-optical devices, particularly in displays. The suitable applications of FLCs in devices are decided by their electro-optical properties like tilt angle, birefringence and spontaneous polarization. In this paper we are presenting a new apparatus for highly accurate measurement of electro-optical parameters of FLCs.

It was not until 1993, that a microdisplay with a resolution sufficient {{for use as a}} display was reported by DisplayTech (now Citizen Finedevices).

50|$|ForthDD’s microdisplays and SLMs {{are based}} on a proprietary, high-speed, <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> on silicon (LCOS) platform, {{protected}} by a number of patents. For the generation of colour and greyscale, ForthDD’s microdisplays use a process called Time Domain Imaging (TDI™). This process involves rendering the red, green and blue colour components which make up an image sequentially over time at high speed. This happens so fast that the human visual system integrates the components into a single, full colour image. This enables the microdisplays to use the same pixel mirror for all three colour components, and avoids the artifacts associated with sub-pixels.|$|E

It should also function at certain wavelengths where appropriate laser sources are available, be radiation-tolerant (for non-terrestrial applications), and be rugged. Mechanical shutters and <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> (FLC) devices, for example, are too slow, heavy, or are not robust enough for many applications.

5000|$|These {{types of}} {{polymers}} {{have played a}} role in biomedical and robotic applications and liquid crystalline polymers. In 1974, R.B. Meyer predicted ferroelectricity in chiral smectic liquid crystals by pure symmetry conditions. Shortly after, Clark and Lagerwall had done work on the fast electrooptic effect in a surface-stabilized <b>ferroelectric</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> (SSFLC) structure. This opened up promising possibility of technical applications of ferroelectric liquid crystals in high-information display devices. Through applied research, it was shown that SSFLC structure has faster switching times and bistability behavior in comparison with commonly used nematic liquid crystal displays. In the same time period, the first side-chain liquid crystalline polymers (SCLCP) were synthesized. These comb-like polymers has mesogenic side chains that are covalently bonded (via flexible spacer units) to the polymer backbone. The most important feature of the SCLCP's is their glassy state. In other words, these polymers have a [...] "frozen" [...] ordered state along one axis when cooled below their glass transition temperature. This is advantageous for research in the area of nonlinear optical and optical data storage devices. The disadvantage is that these SCLCP's suffered from their slow switching times due to their high rotational viscosity.|$|E
