40|$|<b>Funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk {{has played}} a key role in all {{historical}} banking crises. Nevertheless, a measure based on publicly available data remains so far elusive. We address this gap by showing that aggressive bidding at central bank auctions reveals <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. We can extract an insurance premium from banks' bids which we propose as measure of <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. Using a unique data set consisting of all bids in the main refinancing operation auctions conducted at the ECB between June 2005 and October 2008 we find that <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk is typically stable and low, with occasional spikes, especially around key events during the recent crisis. We also document downward spirals between <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk and market liquidity.

5000|$|On 29 August 2012 the Government of Catalonia {{requested}} {{access to}} the Spanish <b>fund</b> <b>liquidity</b> to finance debt maturities, while warning the Spanish President, Mariano Rajoy, {{that it would not}} accept the imposition of [...] "political conditions". This led many Spanish politicians to make controversial statements, such as President of La Rioja Pedro Sanz, who said that [...] "they have the gall to ask money and then keep their television channels and embassies". President of the Community of Madrid Esperanza Aguirre claimed that [...] "Catalonia receives more money than Madrid", while President of Galicia Alberto Núñez Feijoo said that [...] "today Galicia pays and Catalunya asks". The recent publication of studies regarding in-depth economical analysis of the first detailed budgetary and expenditure figures ever provided by the Central Government reached the conclusion that Catalonia was both the autonomous community supporting more taxes yet receiving the smallest returns or investments, a situation that didn't even compare to any other European region. Sustainability as an independent state was shown to be more than feasible in at least one paper published by CatDem, CDC's think tank, although it was ignored by most of the Spanish press. The paper in question focused on the strength of a hypothetical independent Catalonia ceteris paribus, without incorporating to the analysis likely consequences of secession, such as not {{being a member of the}} EU or market share loss in the rest of Spain for Catalan products.|$|E

5000|$|The {{actions of}} Nordlicht have been defended as {{reflecting}} {{the difficulty of}} pricing futures in the energy sector, {{as well as the}} problem of leaks driving down price. In February 2017 the media outlet Newsmax reported:"The valuation of illiquid assets is frequently a topic of disagreement, controversy, and negotiation. The Platinum value arbitrage fund had energy-related assets whose value varied depending on the price of oil. At a certain point, the federal government itself starting driving down the value of Platinum’s assets by leaking that the fund was under investigation. The idea underlying the Platinum value arbitrage fund — private equity illiquid assets in a structure with hedge <b>fund</b> <b>liquidity</b> — may have been too difficult to execute successfully even absent government interference. But having a bad investment idea, or a good idea poorly executed, doesn’t usually warrant the criminal charges and 20 years in jail that the Platinum managers are facing.

40|$|I {{consider}} banks' role {{in providing}} <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> (the ability to raise cash on demand) and market liquidity (the ability to trade assets at low cost), and how these roles have evolved. Traditional banks made illiquid loans funded with liquid deposits, thus producing <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> on the liability side of the balance sheet. Deposits are less important in 21 st century banks, but <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> from lines of credit and loan commitments has become more important. Banks also provide market liquidity as broker-dealers and traders in securities and derivatives markets, in loan syndication and sales, and in loan securitization. Many institutions besides banks provide market liquidity in similar ways, but banks dominate in producing <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> because of their comparative advantage in managing <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. This advantage stems from the structure of bank balance sheets {{as well as their}} access to government-guaranteed deposits and central-bank liquidity. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk {{captures the}} {{inability}} of a financial intermediary to service its liabilities as they fall due. This type of risk is particularly relevant for banks since their business model involves funding long-term loans through short-term deposits and other liabilities. The healthy functioning of interbank lending markets can help reduce <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk because banks can obtain loans in this market quickly and at little cost. When interbank markets are dysfunctional or strained, banks face a greater <b>funding</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk which in extreme cases can result in insolvency.|$|R

Such dispersion is maintained by frequently issuing sets of bonds with different maturities. We further find that more bond maturity dispersion results in higher funding availability and lower funding costs.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the global economic crisis, investors have flocked to bond funds, and especially corporate bond funds, viewing them as the “safest” vehicles for their capital. However, bond funds are subject to fragilities originating from the first-mover advantage problem: when investors cash out, the cost of compensating them amplifies the funds’ price decline, making it costlier for other investors to remain. Moreover, three other conditions—general market illiquidity, lower <b>fund</b> <b>liquidity,</b> and the prevalence of retail investors—accentuate the financial fragility of corporate bond funds. Academic research shows that when corporate bond fund managers have to trade illiquid corporate bonds after investors redeem shares en masse, the subsequent demand shock in the secondary bond market results predictably in significant negative effects to the real economy. This brief looks at the fragility of corporate bond funds and offers policy options to combat these conditions and mitigate their wider effects. [URL]...|$|E
