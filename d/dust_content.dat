These plumes are sometimes only seen in images acquired while Io is in the shadow of Jupiter or those taken in ultraviolet. The little dust that is visible in sunlit images is generated when sulfur and sulfur dioxide condense as the gases reach the top of their ballistic trajectories. That is why these plumes lack the dense central column seen in Prometheus-type plumes, in which dust is generated at the plume source. Examples of Pele-type plumes have been observed at Pele, Tvashtar, and Grian.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} multi-wavelength {{properties}} {{of a set}} of 171 Ly-alpha emitting candidates at redshift z = 2. 25 found in the COSMOS field, with the aim of understanding the underlying stellar populations in the galaxies. We especially seek to understand what the <b>dust</b> <b>contents,</b> ages and stellar masses of the galaxies are, and how they relate to similar properties of Ly-alpha emitters at other redshifts. The candidates here are shown to have different properties from those of Ly-alpha emitters found at higher redshift, by fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using a Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain technique and including nebular emission in the spectra. The stellar masses, and possibly the <b>dust</b> <b>contents,</b> are higher, with stellar masses in the range log M_* = 8. 5 - 11. 0 M_sun and A_V = 0. 0 - 2. 5 mag. Young population ages are well constrained, but the ages of older populations are typically unconstrained. In 15 % of the galaxies only a single, young population of stars is observed. We show that the Ly-alpha fluxes of the best fit galaxies are correlated with their dust properties, with higher dust extinction in Ly-alpha faint galaxies. Testing for whether results derived from a light-weighted stack of objects correlate to those found when fitting individual objects we see that stellar masses are robust to stacking, but ages and especially dust extinctions are derived incorrectly from stacks. We conclude that the stellar properties of Ly-alpha emitters at z = 2. 25 are different from those at higher redshift and that they are diverse. Ly-alpha selection appears to be tracing systematically different galaxies at different redshifts. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables, accepted in A&A.

40|$|Abstract The {{magnetic}} mineral <b>content</b> of wind-transpotted <b>dust</b> {{should reflect}} atmospheric transport dynamics and conditions in its source areas, and could thus {{be used as}} an environmental proxy. To test the feasibility of determining the magnetic mineral content in polar ice, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) was measured on a small suite of Greenland ice samples of Holocene (interglacial) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) age. Although the extremely low dust concentrations limit weak field (susceptibility) measurements, all samples contained an easily measurable concentration of magnetic minerals that can be estimated using IRM intensity provided that special precautions are used. IRM experiments at liquid nitrogen temperatures indicate ice magnetic properties which are consistent with that expected from varying concentrations of magnetite or maghemite. Interestingly, the Holocene ice samples tend to have higher magnetic concentrations, despite having much lower total polar <b>dust</b> <b>contents,</b> than the few LGM ice samples tested thus far. 1...|$|R

New measurements of isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) show that magnetic particles of extraterrestrial origin can be distinguished from terrigenous particles based on their smaller superparamagnetic (SP) size as inferred from magnetic relaxation and by the poor correlation of the SP fraction with <b>dust</b> <b>contents.</b> The magnetic relaxation data suggest that extraterrestrial magnetic particles are in the size range of about 7 – 17 nm, which is compatible with the expected size of condensed particles. The concentration of extraterrestrial material in Greenland ice was estimated from the magnetic relaxation data.

The AGN feedback prescription that we use decreases the simulated CSFRD at z 4) and becomes less efficient with time.

Using a semi-analytic model to follow the thermal evolution of clouds with varying initial metallicities and <b>dust</b> <b>contents</b> at different redshifts, we study self-consistently the response of the mean Jeans mass at cloud fragmentation to metal line-cooling, dust-cooling and the CMB. In the absence of dust grains, at redshifts z 10 and the fragmentation mass scales are always > 100 s of Msun, independent of the initial metallicity. When dust grains are present, sub-solar mass fragments are formed at any redshift for metallicities Z > 10 ^{- 6 } Zsun because dust-cooling remains relatively insensitive to the presence of the CMB. When Z > 10 ^{- 3 } Zsun, heating of dust grains by the CMB at z > 5 favors the formation of larger masses, which become super-solar when Z > 10 ^{- 2 } Zsun and z > 10.

In a small fraction of galaxies, high M_{mol}/M_{HI} ratios are caused by the overestimation of M_{mol} due to a low conversion factor for the translation of CO-line intensities into the number of H_ 2 molecules along the line of sight. It is argued that the "molecularization" of the bulk of the gas mass could be due 1) to the concentration of gas in the inner regions of the galactic disks, resulting to a high gas pressure and 2) to relatively low star-formation rate per unit mass of molecular gas which indeed takes place in galaxies with high M_{mol}/M_{HI} ratios.
