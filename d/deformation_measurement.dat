30|$|<b>Deformation</b> <b>measurement,</b> {{especially}} three-dimensional (3 D) <b>deformation</b> <b>measurement,</b> {{is essential}} to the quantitative description of object change and the accurate determination of mechanical properties. Traditionally, <b>deformation</b> <b>measurement</b> is carried out by the use of displacement transducers, such as strain gauges [1]. However, displacement transducers suffer from the disadvantage of being a spot measurement technique, which leads to low spatial resolution and insufficient information for full-field <b>deformation</b> <b>measurement.</b> Optical techniques such as digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) [2, 3], digital image correlation [4], and Moiré method [5] have become preponderant methods in the measurement of deformation for objects with rough surfaces due to their full-field, stand-off, and non-contact measurement nature. Moreover, optical methods, particularly DSPI, are also very precise tools. DSPI is mainly divided, based on their optical setups and interferometric phase extraction methods, into two categories: phase-shifting DSPI (PS-DSPI) and spatial-carrier DSPI (SC-DSPI). The SC-DSPI is also known as digital holographic interferometry [6, 7].|$|E

30|$|PS-DSPI {{utilizes}} {{the interference}} between an object beam from a measuring target and a reference beam from a fixed surface {{to measure the}} out-of-plane deformation, and the interference between object and reference beams from the measuring target via different paths to measure in-plane deformations [8, 9]. 3 D <b>deformation</b> <b>measurement</b> is then realized by combining one optical setup for out-of-plane <b>deformation</b> <b>measurement</b> and two optical setups for in-plane <b>deformation</b> <b>measurement</b> together. The three channels are enabled in turn when performing the 3 D measurement, resulting in asynchronous measurement of the 3 D deformations. However, synchronous measurement of 3 D deformations is desired in practical applications to enable the change and mechanical model of the measuring object to be characterized properly. Therefore, the inability of PS-DSPI to perform synchronous measurement limits its employment in practical engineering. Furthermore, PS-DSPI is usually unsuitable for dynamic measurement due {{to the amount of}} time consumed in the process of obtaining the interferometric phase. The dominant phase extraction method in PS-DSPI is the temporal phase shift, which carries out several phase shifts and requires the measuring target to be stationary during the phase shift [10]. Dynamic deformations are not easily measured, even if the time interval between adjacent phase steps is very short. Though other phase extraction methods, such as spatial phase shift [11] and phase of difference phase shift [12], have been used in DSPI to make dynamic <b>deformation</b> <b>measurement</b> possible, these methods are difficult to use, result in a more complicated system structure, and provide less reliable measurement results. Consequently, these fast phase extraction methods are rarely used in commercial PS-DSPI instruments.|$|E
