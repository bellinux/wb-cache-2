5|$|The site of Myles Standish's house reveals only {{a slight}} {{depression}} in the <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> the cellar hole was, but {{it is now a}} small park owned and maintained by the town of Duxbury.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the park}} was sparsely used for sports. In 1899, there were 10, 7, and 5 permits issued for lawn tennis, baseball, and football, respectively. The Parade Ground was {{converted}} to recreational use starting in 1902, when the National Guard added fields for polo. In 1907, due to overcrowding, Dr. William Hornaday transferred 15 of the Bronx Zoo's then-rare bison to the Parade <b>Ground,</b> <b>where</b> they stayed until they were shipped to prairie land in Oklahoma later that year.|$|E

5|$|Several {{commentators}} questioned {{what time}} the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad {{arrived at the}} hospital; why {{there seemed to be}} little blood on the <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal's scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Stuart McCall {{was born}} in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Scottish parents Andy, a former {{professional}} footballer, and Jean McCall. He was the couple's third child after Leslie and Janette, who were 20 and 15 respectively when Stuart was born. The family home was just round the corner from Leeds United's Elland Road <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> McCall would spend many Saturday afternoons watching United, dreaming of following his father and playing for Leeds, even after {{the family moved to}} Wortley.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Memorial stands upon {{a raised}} mound ringed by five boxwoods within the {{original}} section of Indian Mound Cemetery, {{not far from}} the cemetery's entrance.

5|$|The {{transfer}} {{went ahead}} just {{one month after}} his hat-trick at Leicester. He made his Leeds debut in an away game against Fulham in December 2001, the same <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> {{he had made his}} Liverpool debut eight years earlier. Fowler scored 12 goals in the remainder of the season, helping Leeds to a UEFA Cup qualifying place. Fowler was included in the England squad for the 2002 World Cup, but only made one appearance, coming on as substitute in a second round win over Denmark.|$|E
5|$|This species forages almost {{exclusively}} from the <b>ground,</b> <b>where</b> it alternates between remaining still and watching attentively and actively searching {{for it by}} rummaging through deep leaf litter. It eats {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, caterpillars, cockroaches, grasshoppers, woodlice, and worms, and occasionally small vertebrates. Despite the long-tailed ground roller's poor flying abilities, it has been seen catching butterflies in midair.|$|E
5|$|Trumble was {{the first}} player to take two hat-tricks in Test cricket. Both hat-tricks were taken against England at the Melbourne Cricket <b>Ground,</b> <b>where</b> Trumble played his club cricket. Hat-tricks are {{extremely}} rare; in over 131years of Test cricket to March 2008, there had only been 37 Test hat-tricks and only Jimmy Matthews and Wasim Akram been able to repeat Trumble's feat of taking a second.|$|E

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the stadium}} has four stands: the Tribune d'Honneur, the Tribune Pasages, the Tribune Populaire Nord, and the Tribune Populaire Sud. The four stands {{currently}} have a combined capacity of 10,898, with 1,324 of these being standing places. The stadium {{is typical of}} many continental European grounds, with an athletics track between the pitch and the stands. Next to the stadium {{there is a small}} annexed <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> the club's reserve and youth teams play their matches. The first televised match at the ground took place on 18 August 1987, when Saint-Étienne were beaten 2–1. The record attendance at the stadium was set on 24 October 1987, when 16,715 people saw Chamois Niortais defeat Marseille by two goals to one in a Division 1 encounter.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{police were}} unclear {{how the two}} groups from Sydney and Brisbane were linked, but did {{establish}} the movements {{of members of the}} group before their departure for Indonesia. Several of the Bali Nine were employed by Eurest Australia, a multinational catering company with more than 9000 employees. Norman, Lawrence, Martin, Stephens and Chan, a supervisor with the company, all worked for Eurest, which provided hospitality services to the Sydney Cricket <b>Ground,</b> <b>where</b> the group was employed. Rush and Czugaj alleged they were recruited by Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, their co-defendant and the alleged financier of the smuggling plan, while socialising at a karaoke bar in Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Marge {{take the}} lizards to the Springfield Birdwatching Society. Principal Skinner, {{a member of}} the society, {{explains}} that they are Bolivian tree lizards, a type of lizard that steals a bird’s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. Skinner says the lizards must be killed by law, because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, but before he can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the lizards glide to the <b>ground,</b> <b>where</b> they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Broad-headed {{compared}} with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown with a black pattern {{across the back of}} its thorax, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's tymbals and sac-like covers. Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. They emerge from the <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear in great numbers in some years, yet are absent in others.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the <b>ground,</b> <b>where</b> they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E

5|$|Government {{agencies}} {{in both the}} USA and Canada have utilized a native species of parasitoid wasp, Cerceris fumipennis, {{as a means of}} detecting areas to which emerald ash borer has spread. The females of these wasps hunt other jewel beetles and emerald ash borer if it is present. The wasps stun the beetles and carry them back to their burrows in the <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> they are stored until the wasps’ eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the beetles. Volunteers catch the wasps as they return to their burrows carrying the beetles to determine whether emerald ash borer is present. This methodology is known as biological surveillance, as opposed to biological control, because it does not appear that the wasps have a significant negative impact on emerald ash borer populations.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on <b>ground</b> <b>where</b> a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Luton faced Oxford United in the semi-final {{which was}} played over two-legs. The first leg was at Oxford's home ground Manor <b>Ground,</b> <b>where</b> Luton had beaten their opponents 5–2 {{earlier in the}} league season. On a wet, muddy surface, both clubs {{struggled}} to control the tempo, though Luton played the more incisive football and looked threatening in their opponent's half. Harford's 19th goal of the season gave Luton the breakthrough in the tie, but Oxford equalised from the penalty spot. The home side were awarded a second penalty when Dean Saunders was brought down in Luton's area, but Sealey saved his attempt. Having received consent from the police to stage the second leg at Kenilworth Road, a near-capacity crowd saw Luton win 2–0.|$|E
