2500|$|In October 1943, the North American Aircraft {{design team}} {{began work on}} a fighter design that could travel over [...] without refueling. It {{consisted}} of a twin-fuselage design, somewhat similar to the experimental German Messerschmitt Bf 109Z [...] "Zwilling". Although based on the lightweight experimental XP-51F, which would later become the P-51H Mustang, {{it was actually a}} new design. North American Design Chief Edgar Schmued incorporated two P-51H Mustang fuselages lengthened by the addition of a [...] fuselage plug located behind the cockpit where additional fuel tanks and equipment could be installed. These were mounted to a newly designed center wing section containing the same six [...]50 caliber M3 Browning machine guns as a single-engine Mustang, but with more concentrated fire. The first XP-82 prototype (s/n 44-83886) was equipped with a removable centerline gun pod housing eight additional [...]50 caliber M3 Brownings, but this did not feature on production aircraft. An even more powerful centerline gun pod containing a 40mm cannon was considered, but was never built. The outer wings were reinforced to allow the addition of hard points for carrying additional fuel or [...] of ordnance. The two vertical tails were also from the XP-51F, but incorporated large dorsal fillets for added stability in case of an engine failure. The aircraft had a conventional landing gear with both wheels retracting into bays under each <b>fuselage</b> <b>center</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Luscombe 10 was a single-seat sport {{aircraft}} {{built in}} the United States in 1945. It was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with fixed, tailwheel landing gear, designed for aerobatics. The wings, tail unit, and engine section were all adapted from the Luscombe 8, while the <b>fuselage</b> <b>center</b> <b>section</b> was an all-new design, relocating the Model 8's wings from a high to low position.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>fuselage</b> <b>center</b> <b>section</b> is of {{welded steel}} tube, covered with sheet metal and fiberglass panels. The tailcone is of monocoque construction. The empennage is of sheet metal. The two-spar wings are of all-metal construction. The {{tricycle landing gear}} is fixed, with a steerable nosewheel. Designed for aerobatics instruction, it was certified to +6.0 and -4.0 limit maneuvering load factors, and was equipped with full inverted fuel and oil systems, permitting extended inverted flight. The Z 42 {{is powered by a}} Walter inverted six-cylinder engine rated at 134 kW (180 hp).|$|E
50|$|DC-3/C-47 {{conversion}} with a stretched <b>fuselage,</b> strengthened wing <b>center</b> <b>section</b> {{and updated}} systems; and powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65AR turboprop engines.|$|R
25|$|In 1943, an enlarged, four-rotored {{version of}} the Fa 223 was considered, but not {{developed}} beyond {{the construction of a}} <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Development of the Ki-11 {{began as}} a private venture in 1934, based on a wire-braced low-wing monoplane, {{inspired}} by the Boeing P-26 Peashooter. The <b>fuselage</b> wing <b>center</b> <b>section</b> and undercarriage were constructed in duralumin, while the wings and tail were of wood and canvas. The aircraft was powered by a single [...] Nakajima Kotobuki Ha-1-3 radial engine. Proposed armament consisted of twin 7.7mm (.303in) machine guns firing from between the engine cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|The Stallion is a single-engined high-winged monoplane, {{with wings}} {{based on those}} of the Lancair ES and a {{retractable}} tricycle landing gear from the Lancair IV. It has a steel-tube <b>fuselage</b> <b>center</b> <b>section,</b> with {{the remainder of the}} airframe of composite construction, and is designed to be powered by engines of 230-350 hp (172-261 kW). The recommended engine is the [...] Continental IO-550, but engines as powerful as the [...] Walter M601 have been used. It is available in two versions, the four seat ADI Stallion and the six-seat Super Stallion.|$|E
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{has begun}} an investigation. On November 3, 2015, the NTSB {{released}} an update to its ongoing investigation, which {{stated that they}} found that the main fuel supply line coupling assembly had disconnected in the wing-to-engine strut above and behind the left engine. Examination of the left engine revealed no evidence of an engine uncontainment or other failure. Also, the lower inboard portion of the left wing, left engine cowling, and left <b>fuselage</b> <b>center</b> <b>section</b> sustained thermal damage. The fire did not penetrate the fuselage. The report condemned some passengers for taking their luggage.|$|E
50|$|The Viperjet {{prototype}} flew late in October 1999. {{and made}} its public debut at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in 2000. The Hanchette brothers, however, were unhappy {{with both the}} low power and the high fuel consumption of the Turbomeca engine, and soon swapped it for a General Electric T58 turboshaft engine with the power turbine removed, {{turning it into a}} turbojet. While this worked, it still did not produce as much thrust as the Hanchettes hoped for, and eventually, they selected the General Electric J85. With this engine producing around four times the thrust of the previous powerplants tested in the Viper, the Hanchettes substantially redesigned the aircraft, dubbing the J85-powered version the MKII. The prototype was dismantled and rebuilt, with parts of the canopy and <b>fuselage</b> <b>center</b> <b>section</b> all that remained of the original design. The slightly larger MKII also features a pressurized cabin, nearly three times the fuel tankage, stronger undercarriage, and optional tip tanks. The MKII prototype flew on 12 June 2005 and Viper Aircraft offered replacement MKII parts to all customers who had purchased kits of the original version, now dubbed the MKI.|$|E

This {{airframe}} is a composite of several aircraft including the <b>fuselage</b> of NZ415, <b>center</b> <b>section,</b> mainplane, and tailplane of VL352, and various other parts from NZ410 and NZ422.|$|R
50|$|The {{center wing}} box, outer wing box, wing panels, flaps, and ailerons are {{planned to be}} built in Xi'an, China; the <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> are planned {{to be built in}} Hongdu, China. Aluminium-lithium alloys account for 8.8% of the {{structure}} and composite materials for 12%. The air frame will be made largely of aluminum alloy. Aircraft design and assembly is performed in Shanghai.|$|R
5|$|A mockup of the cockpit, <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> and wing <b>center</b> <b>section</b> {{was built}} and was {{inspected}} by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. This was due {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be too large for practical operations from escort carriers, and because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1943, the North American Aircraft {{design team}} {{began work on}} a fighter design that could travel over 2000 mi without refueling. It {{consisted}} of a twin-fuselage design, somewhat similar to the experimental German Messerschmitt Bf 109Z [...] "Zwilling". Although based on the lightweight experimental XP-51F, which would later become the P-51H Mustang, {{it was actually a}} new design. North American Design Chief Edgar Schmued incorporated two P-51H Mustang fuselages lengthened by the addition of a 57 in fuselage plug located behind the cockpit where additional fuel tanks and equipment could be installed. These were mounted to a newly designed center wing section containing the same six [...]50 caliber M3 Browning machine guns as a single-engine Mustang, but with more concentrated fire. The first XP-82 prototype (s/n 44-83886) was equipped with a removable centerline gun pod housing eight additional [...]50 caliber M3 Brownings, but this did not feature on production aircraft. An even more powerful centerline gun pod containing a 40 mm cannon was considered, but was never built. The outer wings were reinforced to allow the addition of hard points for carrying additional fuel or 1000 lb of ordnance. The two vertical tails were also from the XP-51F, but incorporated large dorsal fillets for added stability in case of an engine failure. The aircraft had a conventional landing gear with both wheels retracting into bays under each <b>fuselage</b> <b>center</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Bearcat {{that became}} Rare Bear was a {{severely}} damaged wreck when discovered by Lyle Shelton in 1969. It {{had been abandoned}} next to a runway in Valparaiso, Indiana after it crashed there from a throttle-on torque roll in 1962. The airplane had been stripped by parts hunters, so Shelton found a <b>fuselage,</b> wing <b>center</b> <b>section,</b> landing gear and a right wing panel, but little else. Shelton bought the wreck and had the pieces trucked to Orange County and restoration began. One of the major modifications made during the rebuild involved installing a more powerful Wright R-3350 (from a Douglas Skyraider) {{in place of the}} Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engine that is standard for a Bearcat. A Douglas DC-7 propeller and cowl were used and Shelton bought the landing gear fairings and doors from the wreck of Bob Kucera's Bearcat. Bill Fornoff loaned him a left wing panel and Gunter Balz supplied a rudder. The windshield and canopy were supplied by Edward T. Maloney. [...] The rebuild was finished with the first flight on 13 September 1969.|$|R
40|$|On February 24, 1987, a NASA T- 38 A {{airplane}} {{experienced a}} lightning strike while approaching the Los Alamitos Army Aviation Facility in California. The airplane was landed safely at Los Alamitos with no {{injury to the}} crew members. However, the airplane suffered extensive fire damage in the <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section.</b> The NASA investigation board concluded that the airplane was struck by lightning, which resulted in an inflight explosion with subsequent fire. This paper describes the most probable cause of the incident, {{and the implications of}} this mishap to aircraft lightning protection and to the avoidance of those conditions conducive to lightning strikes to aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Under NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project (ERA) {{the most}} {{promising}} vehicle concepts and technologies that can simultaneously reduce aircraft fuel use, community noise, and emissions are being evaluated. Two key factors to accomplishing these goals are reducing structural weight and {{moving away from the}} traditional tube and wing aircraft configuration to a shape that has improved lift and less drag. The hybrid wing body (HWB) configuration produces more lift and less drag by smoothly joining the wings to the <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> so it provides aerodynamic advantages. This shape, however, presents structural challenges with its pressurized, non-circular cabin subjected to aerodynamic flight loads. In the HWB, the structure of the <b>center</b> <b>section</b> where the passenger cabin would be located must support large in-plane loads as well as internal pressure on nearly-flat panels and right-angle joints. This structural arrangement does not lend itself to simple, efficient designs. Traditional aluminum and even state-of-the-art composites do not provide a solution to this challenge...|$|R
25|$|During {{the decade}} several {{military}} projects went into production, including Boeing {{support of the}} stealth B-2 bomber. As part of an industry team led by Northrop, Boeing built the outboard portion of the B-2 stealth bomber wing, the aft <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section,</b> landing gear, fuel system and weapons delivery system. At its peak in 1991, the B-2 was the largest military program at Boeing, employing about 10,000 people. The same year, the National Aeronautic Association of the USA awarded the B-2 design team the Collier Trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. The first B-2 rolled out of the bomber's final assembly facility in Palmdale, California, in November 1988 and it flew {{for the first time}} on July 17, 1989.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} July 1967 meeting, French {{engineer}} Roger Béteille was appointed as the technical director {{of what would}} become the A300 program, while Henri Ziegler, chief operating office of Sud Aviation, was appointed as the general manager of the organization and German politician Franz Josef Strauss became the chairman of the supervisory board. Béteille drew up an initial work share plan for the project, under which French firms would produce the aircraft's cockpit, the control systems, and lower-center portion of the fuselage, Hawker Siddeley would manufacture the wings, while German companies would produce the forward, rear and upper part of the <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections.</b> Addition work included moving elements of the wings being produced in the Netherlands, and Spain producing the horizontal tail plane.|$|R
50|$|The <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> {{houses the}} {{armament}} bay, {{which is set}} beneath the cockpit, and the seven split fuel tanks, which are protected against damage from ground fire by armour plating. The armament bay can accommodate up to four 12.7 mm (0.50 in) M2 Browning machine guns with 300 rounds of ammo per gun, or alternatively up to two 30 mm (1.18 in) DEFA cannons with 120 rounds per cannon. Other munitions included various rockets and bombs; while gun pods and external drop tanks can be installed on hardpoints fitted on the wing. Both weapons and ammunition in the armament bay were mounted on panel doors, which could be easily removed and quickly swapped by two men during rearming on the ground. In addition, various access panels are incorporated to enable simple field maintenance duties to be readily performed on the type.|$|R
5000|$|Production got {{an early}} boost when Nationalist China paid the company US$750,000 for six M18R light bombers, {{but by the}} time of the U.S. entry into World War II, only 39 Model 18s had been sold, of which 29 were for {{civilian}} customers. Work began in earnest on a variant specifically for training military pilots, bombardiers, and navigators. The effort resulted in the Army AT-7 and Navy SNB. Further development led to the AT-11 and SNB-2 navigation trainers and the C-45 military transport. The United States Air Force (USAF) Strategic Air Command had Model 18 variants (AT-11 Kansans, C-45 Expeditors, F-2 Expeditors (the [...] "F" [...] standing for [...] "Fotorecon", short for [...] "photographic reconnaissance"), and UC-45 Expeditors) from 1946 until 1951. From 1951 to 1955, the USAF had many of its aircraft remanufactured with new <b>fuselages,</b> wing <b>center</b> <b>sections,</b> and undercarriages to take advantage of the improvements to the civil models since the end of World War II. Eventually, 900 aircraft were remanufactured to be similar to the then-current Model D18S and given new designations, constructor's numbers and Air Force serial numbers. The USN had many of its surviving aircraft remanufactured as well, these being redesignated as SNB-5s and SNB-5Ps. The C-45 flew in USAF service until 1963, the USN retired its last SNB in 1972, while the U.S. Army flew its C-45s until 1976. In later years, the military called these aircraft [...] "bug smashers" [...] in reference to their extensive use supplying mandatory flight hours for desk-bound aviators in the Pentagon.|$|R
50|$|The DC-7B, with {{a portion}} of its left wing sheared off, {{remained}} airborne {{for a few minutes}} then rolled to the left and began an uncontrollable, spiraling, high-velocity dive earthward. In doing so, it began raining debris onto the Pacoima neighborhoods below as the aircraft began to break apart. Seconds later, part of the hurtling wreckage slammed onto the grounds of the Pacoima Congregational Church, killing all four Douglas crewmen aboard while the major portions fell onto the adjacent playground of Pacoima Junior High School. On the school playground, where some 220 boys were just ending their outdoor athletic activities, the wreckage broke upon impact into numerous pieces and intense fires began due to the aircraft's fuel and oil. Distinct craters were made in the playground by each of the four engines and the main <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>section.</b> Two students, Ronnie Brann, 13, and Robert Zallan, 12, were struck and killed by this wreckage and debris. A third gravely injured student, Evan Elsner, 12, died two days later in a local hospital. An estimated 75 more students on the school playground suffered injuries ranging from critical to minor.|$|R
50|$|The CL-1200 was to {{have kept}} the basic F-104 {{fuselage}} structure, increased in length to provide 46% extra internal fuel capacity. The fuselage extension consisted of a 30 in plug between the standard F-104 front and <b>center</b> <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections.</b> Unlike the F-104, the rear fuselage section was to be constructed using titanium alloy for the frames, longerons and skinning around the jet exhaust. The major revision of the design was a shoulder-mounted wing of 53% larger area which was also moved further aft. The new wing had a span of 29 ft and still featured leading and trailing edge flaps but gained new leading edge extensions, while the 10° anhedral of the Starfighter was retained. The flap system {{was designed to be}} either manual or automatic in operation; the system configuring them as required for load factor, airspeed and altitude. The new inner wing panels featured an additional trailing edge flap which doubled the area in comparison to the F-104; this would have improved short-field performance and lowered the landing speed. The boundary layer control system of the F-104 was deemed unnecessary due to the increased flap area and was omitted. The outer wing panels were virtually identical to those of the F-104.|$|R
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been made}} at low speed {{to determine the effects}} of vertical fins placed ahead of the vertical tail on the directional stability and damping-in-yaw characteristics of a swept-wing model under steady-state oscillatory conditions. Various sizes of fins were used above and below the <b>fuselage</b> <b>center</b> line. The vertical-tail size also was varied...|$|R
50|$|Each {{section of}} the house is {{essentially}} an open room. The <b>center</b> <b>section</b> was partitioned into smaller spaces, and the east section is slightly below the floor level of the other two. The east and <b>center</b> <b>sections</b> have fireplaces, the latter with a wooden Georgian mantel. Exposed ceiling beams support the garrets above. The western and <b>center</b> <b>sections</b> are connected by a battened door with wrought iron strap hinges and pancake nailing plates.|$|R
500|$|The wing was {{the most}} unusual feature. It {{consisted}} of a single <b>center</b> <b>section</b> and two outer sections installed using four universal joints. The <b>center</b> <b>section</b> had a large negative dihedral (anhedral) and the outer surfaces a positive dihedral. This created the inverted gull, or [...] "cranked", wing pattern along the Ju 87's leading edge. The shape of the wing improved the pilot's ground visibility and also allowed a shorter undercarriage height. The <b>center</b> <b>section</b> protruded by only [...] on either side.|$|R
