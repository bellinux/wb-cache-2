5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on <b>God</b> <b>for</b> forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E
5|$|Even so, churches {{within the}} Assemblies of God have {{experienced}} revivals {{in the last}} two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism. The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival, which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida, from 1995 into the early 2000s. These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of <b>God</b> <b>for</b> their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants. In the case of the Brownsville Revival, the AG's national leadership gave it cautious approval and support.|$|E
5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of <b>God,</b> <b>for</b> none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E

5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of <b>God</b> <b>for</b> them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The only {{contemporaneous}} {{record of}} Charles's deeds {{were made by}} a Franciscan friar who was hostile towards the monarch. Instead of emphasizing Charles's achievements in the reunification of the country, the friar described in detail the negative episodes of Charles's reign. In particular, the unusual cruelty that the king showed after Felician Záh's assassination attempt on the royal family contributed to the negative picture of Charles's personality. The Franciscan friar attributed Charles's defeat by Basarab of Wallachia as a punishment from <b>God</b> <b>for</b> the king's revenge.|$|E

5|$|According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Cisneros {{was jailed}} in the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida. Years after her imprisonment, she {{maintained}} {{that she did}} not order Fischer's murder. Martínez, a non-US citizen subject to deportation {{as a result of her}} conviction, was released from prison in April 2001 and later died in Matamoros. Garza, who was sentenced to life in prison, turned to religion and became a devout Catholic. In a letter written to the press in 2013, he thanked <b>God</b> <b>for</b> saving his life after two ruptured stomach ulcers, and a heart attack that nearly killed him in 2012. He was imprisoned at the age of 42 and will not be eligible for parole until June 2028 (when he is 78 years old). He has spent time in several Texas prisons, including the Louis C. Powledge Unit, the Terrell Unit, and the Eastham Unit.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging <b>God</b> <b>for</b> mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed the charging of modest interest rates on loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to <b>God</b> <b>for</b> their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E

5|$|Charles won {{his first}} decisive victory in the Battle of Rozgony (at present-day Rozhanovce in Slovakia) on 15June 1312. After that his troops seized most fortresses of the {{powerful}} Aba family. During the next decade, Charles restored royal power primarily {{with the assistance of}} the prelates and lesser noblemen in most regions of the kingdom. After the death of the most powerful oligarch, Matthew Csák, in 1321, Charles became the undisputed ruler of the whole kingdom, with the exception of Croatia where local noblemen were able to preserve their autonomous status. He was not able to hinder the development of Wallachia into an independent principality after his defeat in the Battle of Posada in 1330. Charles's contemporaries described his defeat in that battle as a punishment from <b>God</b> <b>for</b> his cruel revenge against the family of Felician Záh who had attempted to slaughter the royal family.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Verdugo {{aimed to}} block Niezijl's dike with Frate's and Bievres' companies, but as these troops lagged behind, {{he found himself}} alone on the dike when Norreys and his {{officers}} attempted to retreat back to their camp. Alone, Verdugo fought desperately against them. Twice the Spanish commander was taken prisoner, but in the end, as he killed or wounded many of his foes, Norreys preferred {{to let him go}} free rather than risk allowing the pursuing Spanish troops to capture himself or his remaining men. Once he had recovered, Verdugo massed some cavalry and completed the Anglo-Dutch defeat by destroying an English troop which, trying to save the flags, fled across a field towards the Niezijl canal. Most of the English flags and all of their artillery were lost. As the night was falling, Verdugo collected his troops and returned to Noordhorn, where they formed into squadron formation and, kneeling down, prayed to thank <b>God</b> <b>for</b> their victory.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Claude Mézières {{himself has}} worked as a concept artist on a number of science fiction film projects. The first of these was in 1984 for {{director}} Jeremy Kagan who was attempting to adapt René Barjavel's novel La Nuit des temps (The Ice People). The film was never made. This was followed, in 1985, by a proposed adaptation of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's novel Hard to Be a <b>God</b> <b>for</b> director Peter Fleischmann. This film was eventually finished in 1989 though Mézières' concepts for the film were barely used. The art Mézières produced for both projects was later published in Mézières Extras.|$|E

5|$|Many Massachusetts {{residents}} of the time perceived the quake as punishment from <b>God</b> <b>for</b> immoral behavior. In {{the days after the}} earthquake, special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including Jeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just Displeasure. Not all explanations of the event were theological; John Winthrop, a Harvard professor, proposed an alternate explanation having to do with heat and chemical vapors inside the surface of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{wrote the}} words from {{personal}} experience. He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path {{was formed by}} a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was pressed (conscripted) into service in the Royal Navy, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of County Donegal, Ireland, so severely that he called out to <b>God</b> <b>for</b> mercy, a moment that marked his spiritual conversion. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying Christian theology.|$|E

However, Thalaba refuses to commit vengeance and he travels onwards until he arrives at a small boat waiting for him. He is taken down a river to the sea where Thalaba tosses away his magic ring. He is then taken to a cave that would lead him to the domain of the sorcerers.|$|E
