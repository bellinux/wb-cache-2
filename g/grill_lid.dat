40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the design of the {{production}} of kettle <b>grill</b> <b>lid</b> from steel 11 305 (1. 0338) with a constant wall thickness of 1 mm and a series of 10 000 pcs/year. For the selected method of manufacture by conventional drawing, technological calculations were performed. Depending on the diameter of the blank, maximum force and other parameters, the tool and the machine were designed. The tool is a single-operation drawing tool with a blank holder and aÂ rib around the perimeter. These functional parts, together with the drawing punch and drawing die, are made of surface-treated cementitious steel 14 220 (1. 7131). The drawing tool is clamped into a CBA 250 hydraulic press with a nominal force of 2 500 kN, where the blank holder is controlled by an additional device {{at the bottom of the}} press...|$|E
50|$|The Type-R, Type-V, and Sport trims can had a badge on {{the front}} <b>grill</b> and hood <b>lid,</b> though the pre-facelift models only {{signified}} Type-R {{on the front}}. The {{top of the range}} SE Executive only became identified as such in 2000 with a badge 'SE EXECUTIVE' on the hood lid. Walnut trim interior was also dropped for the SE Executive during the facelift, while a new climate control system was added.|$|R
5000|$|Planned for the 1972 model year, the Porsche 916 {{program was}} {{cancelled}} after eleven prototypes with aerodynamic {{front and rear}} bumpers and either the 2.4 engine from the 911S, or the 2.7 from the Carrera. They were also to have a fixed steel roof, wider wheels, double <b>grilled</b> engine <b>lid,</b> and flared fenders as styled from the 914-6 GT cars. Ventilated disc brakes were fitted to all four wheels, and also a [...] "mid-engined" [...] version of the then-new 915 transmission, giving a conventional shift pattern with one to four in an H and fifth out on a limb. One 916 was built to US specs and on delivery to the US was fitted with air conditioning by the dealer (Brumos) and has been housed at the Automobile Atlanta 914 museum since 1990 along with eleven other rare 914 and 914-6 models ...|$|R
