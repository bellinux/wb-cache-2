25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining <b>dry</b> <b>heat</b> charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E

The water activity of the powder before <b>dry</b> <b>heating</b> and heat intensity (temperature/times) strongly accelerate the kinetic of denaturation/aggregation of whey proteins.

The kinetic of denaturation/aggregation of whey proteins was enhanced at pH 2. 5 as compared to pH 6. 5. [2] However, the presence of traces of lactose, as in case of commercially available WPI powders, modifies such kinetic order. At pH 2. 5 the protein molecules were mainly linked together by intermolecular disulfide bonds, while at pH 6. 5, covalent cross-links other than disulfide bonds were also involved in the formed aggregates.
