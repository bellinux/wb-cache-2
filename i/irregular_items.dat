40|$|Pinker and Prince (1988, 1994) {{propose that}} there are two {{separate}} systems involved in linguistic representation and processing; one system is rule-governed, and incorporates symbolic hierarchical linguistic representations, the other is associative with linguistic information represented in a more distributed fashion. One particular linguistic feature of English said to exemplify the principles of this dual-mechanism model is inflectional morphology. Pinker and Prince (1988; 1994) present a range of evidence showing that native speakers of English process regular inflectional items in ways that are both quantitatively and qualitatively different from <b>irregular</b> inflectional <b>items.</b> This dual-mechanism model has been largely investigated within the context of first language (L 1) learning, and has received considerable support from investigations using a number of different research paradigms. Nonetheless, {{there have been a number}} of serious criticisms in that the apparent behavioural distinctions between regular and <b>irregular</b> inflectional <b>items</b> can be supported by an alternative associative system (Elman, Bates, Johnson, Karmiloff-Smith, Parisi & Plunkett, 1996). The research presented in this dissertation investigates how knowledge of second language (L 2) inflectional morphology might be processed and represented. The research is grounded within the theoretical framework provided by the dual-mechanism model and evaluates whether the claims and assumptions of this model are relevant to how L 2 learners process, represent and learn about inflectional morphology. Three experiments are presented which address the issues of: compounding with regular and irregular noun plurals (Experiment 1); past tense generalization with regular and irregular verbs (Experiment 2); and finally, the development of knowledge of a new inflectional paradigm (Old English noun plurals, Experiment 3).

30|$|In today’s {{world of}} industrialization, mass {{production}} and high material utilization are the crucial factors for growing industries that necessitate {{the need of}} finding correct cutting patterns which {{may result in a}} small improvement. In the long term, it leads to huge economical saving. These problems occur at wide scale in many industries such as wood, textile, rubber, glass, etc., where the complexity is determined by the shape of the item to be cut and the number of applicable constraints. Textile and shipping industries basically deal with <b>irregular</b> shaped <b>items.</b> Automation in a packing system saves much economic time and is preferred over the manual system. One case study discussing strip cuttings in wooden industries is discussed in Lefrançois and Gascon (1995) for a manufacturer of prefabricated doors and windows. These industries follow a daily production schedule where the desired length which may be wood, steel, plastic, etc., are cut to smaller length, either by automation or by manual labor. The policy followed is basically to meet the higher demand length first, followed by others in order of their decreasing length. The main concern for these industries is efficient utilization of available resources with minimum scrap production. The shorter length stock incapable of fulfilling any order demand is termed as scrap. The textile industry also tackles this problem, but under a different heading, namely Nesting and Marker making. It involves finding the best layout for the cutting of irregular shapes, where the shapes are allowed a rotation from 0 ° to 180 °. Regular and irregular shape packing are addressed in the shipbuilding industries where it is required to investigate how the <b>irregular</b> size <b>items</b> can be packed and transported in huge containers. In today’s scenario of surplus demand, an automated system is required for efficient packing thereby reducing the transportation damage risk. The packing problem is not limited to industries, but can also be seen in other dimensions like in very-large-scale integration design, memory allocation during storage and in the field of optical fiber communication.|$|R

The objective function is evaluated in a constructive approach, where the items are placed sequentially. The placement is governed by three different types of parameters: sequence of placement, the rotation angle and the translation. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are cyclic continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement defines a combinatorial problem. This way, it is necessary to control cyclic continuous and discrete parameters. The approaches described in the literature deal with only type of parameter (sequence of placement or translation).

Traditional approaches are in agreement espousing the dichotomy between regulars and irregulars.

In reality, p, lɨ-irregulars overwhelmingly outnumber their regular counterparts, and t, s, h, lə-irregulars are statistically comparable to regulars. To address this problem, regulars vs. irregulars are identified as inconsistent in terms of constraint hierarchy, and constraint cloning with concomitant listed lexical items is proposed. One of my key findings is that a unitary schema Markedness irregular items>> Faithfulness>> Markedness regular items guarantees the rise of regulars vs. irregulars. Second, the size of the set of listed lexical items affects existing inflectional paradigms. Larger sets are likely to launch a paradigm innovation such as total leveling for lɨ-irregulars. Cloned constraints enriched with listed lexical items contribute to the dilution of the demarcation between regular and <b>irregular</b> lexical <b>items,</b> disclosing the continuous undercurrent of Korean...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{assessment}} of the two main processes that children must acquire at the single word reading level: word recognition (lexical) and decoding (nonlexical) skills. Guided by the framework of the dual route model, this study aimed to (1) investigate the impact of item characteristics on test performance, and (2) determine to what extent widely used reading measures vary in their detection of lexical and nonlexical reading difficulties. Thirty children with reading difficulties were administered selected reading subtests from the Woodcock-Johnson III, the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition, the Castles and Coltheart Reading Test 2 (CC 2), as well as a measure of nonverbal IQ. Both within-subjects analyses and descriptive data are presented. Results suggest that in comparison to a pure measure of irregular word reading, children with reading difficulties perform better on word identification subtests containing both regular and <b>irregular</b> word <b>items.</b> Furthermore, certain characteristics (e. g., length, similarity to real words) appear to influence the level of difficulty of nonword items and tests.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional " external penalization" techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted.

30|$|The {{finding that}} ED showed a small {{improvement}} in irregular word spelling following the first intervention, {{even though it}} targeted only sublexical processes, could be also explained by the triangle model (Plaut, [2005]). There is no specific process in the model that deals only with irregular words or nonwords. As the model develops, the semantic pathway deals more with reading and spelling of irregular words and the phonological pathway with consistently read and spelt words. According to Coltheart ([2005]) and Rapp et al. ([2002]) the triangle model also includes two different processes, a direct one via semantics for real word reading and an indirect one via phonology for nonword reading. The major difference {{in comparison to the}} DR model is that the sublexical system can also generate accurate pronunciations for <b>irregular</b> high frequency <b>items.</b> Therefore, the triangle model allows for interaction between the two spelling processes. Thus, the improvement of irregular spelling, although intervention targeted sublexical processes, could relate to this assumption of a phonological route that generates accurate spelling of irregular words.|$|R
40|$|On the accentual {{value of}} Lithuanian nominal suffixes Summary This paper {{presents}} some {{remarks on the}} definition of accentual value of Lithuanian nominal suffixes. All of these suffixes determine the accentuation of derivatives and, therefore, these morphemes {{can be considered as}} dominant. It is argued in this paper that the classification of nominal suffixes into strengthening and weakening ones should be based on the effect these suffixes make on the stems of the derivatives rather than on the stems of the base words. One should note that the weakening suffixes can be not only weak, but also strong in some cases. The description of strong suffixes should not be limited to indicating whether they are acute or non-acute. If the vocal phonemes of the suffix belong to two syllables, the place of the stress also has to be taken into account. In a number of cases the accentual properties of suffixes are conditional (i. e. when the derivatives of these suffixes are described, additional rules have to be provided or at least the <b>irregular</b> <b>items</b> have to be listed). On the other hand, one should note that the majority of suffixes are unconditional (the accentuation of their derivatives is not related to certain conditions) ...|$|E
40|$|Connectionist {{techniques}} {{are increasingly being}} used to model cognitive function {{with a view to}} providing extensions, elaborations or replacements of earlier &quot;box and arrow &quot; models. Networks of simplified processing units loosely based on real neurons are set up with architectures based on known physiology, trained to perform appropriately simplified versions of real tasks, and iteratively refined by checking their performance against humans. Such systems can still be linked together as in the old box and arrow models, with all the old explanations of patient data carrying through, but now we can examine the details of the degradation of the various components, and removing neurons or connections constitute natural analogues of real brain damage. We can also question the validity of the old assumptions of neuropsychological inference, and explore the possibility that processing is actually more distributed and interactive than the older models implied (Bullinaria, 2002). Here I shall outline what I consider to be the essential ideas. Connectionist models learn to perform by iteratively updating their weights (e. g. by gradient descent) to minimise the output errors for appropriate training sets of input-output pairs. Adding up the network weight change contributions due to individual training patterns explains why: 1. High frequency items are learned more quickly, because the appropriate weight changes get applied more often. 2. Regular items are learned more quickly, because consistent weight changes combine while inconsistent weight changes cancel. 3. Ceiling effects arise when items are mastered. These effects are easily demonstrated in a standard feed-forward network with 10 inputs, 100 hidden units and 10 outputs. Training on two sets of 100 regular items and two sets of 10 <b>irregular</b> <b>items,</b> with one regular set and one irregular set presented 20 times more frequently than the other, results in the learning curves of Figure 1 (Bullinaria, 1999) ...|$|E

The results confirmed that students were able to draw from a wide repertoire of coexisting strategies to support their reading and spelling activities. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that pure lexical retrieval could best predict reading and spelling accuracy scores on irregular words, whereas both lexical and nonlexical strategies could, to varying degrees, predict scores on the regular items. Unexpectedly, none of the reported reading or spelling strategies could accurately predict students' scores on the nonword items after controlling for age.

40|$|Manufacturer {{that uses}} {{containers}} to ship products always works {{to optimize the}} space inside the containers. Container loading problems (CLP) are widely encountered in forms of raw material flow and handling, product shipments, warehouse management, facility floor planning, as well as strip-packing nesting problems. Investigations and research conducted two decades ago were logistic orientated, {{on the basis of}} the empirical approaches. Starting from the late 1990 s, researchers and experts in disciplines, such as mathematics, computer science, and industrial engineering, actively participated in the developments of solutions to CLP. Their contributions are mainly in the areas of typological analyses, heuristic methods, and optimization. However, even in the mid- 2010 s, the gaps between those research contributions and the applicable level of problem-solving methods for industry are still tremendously huge. Especially, the majority of existing theoretical solutions fall short in the real-world applications due to the incapability of handling irregular shapes in three-dimensional space. To tackle this shortcoming, this research presents a topology-based metaheuristic approach that simplifies both the irregular shapes and the optimization process. Real-world data and constraints are applied to test the validity of this metaheuristic approach, such as compatibility between commodities, orientation limitations, etc. ^ This research is a project of Center for Technology Development (CTD), sponsored by American Axle Manufacturing, Deere 2 ̆ 6 Company, Eaton, and Faurecia. Within the work scope of this research, two distinctive CLP scenarios are constructed. One scenario is the Shipping Configuration Optimization (SCO), targeting the containerization processes of shipping raw materials and irregular shaped Semi-Knockdown (SKD) modules. The generalized constraints of this scenario are custom and highway regulations, availability of the facilities, labor cost, easiness of loading and unloading, etc. The other scenario is Warehouse and Facility Optimization (WFO). The goal of this scenario was to enhance the efficiency of shelf usage, reduce the floor occupation, corresponding to the change of demands, production plans, regulations, et cetera. ^ The developed metaheuristic approach utilizes topological spatial optimization to handle the complexities related to the three-dimensional irregular shapes. Those <b>irregular</b> shaped <b>items</b> are pixelated into three-dimensional envelop shapes, in which some clearances are added onto the original shapes to ensure the final plan is free of interference. In order to deal with the huge amount of combinations of shipping configurations, this approach applies topology-based category optimization and path optimizations to the existing guided local search (GLS). Topology-based category optimization and path optimization significantly reduce the total number of the possible configuration combinations that need to be analyzed, evaluated, and validated. ^ To test the metaheuristic approach, a proof-of-concept end-user program for engineers that implement the heuristic method is designed and developed. Pilot tests using real world data and conditions from the industrial members of CTD are conducted. The proposed heuristic method satisfactorily takes the constraints into account and generated optimal shipping configurations which cannot be obtained from previous research. ...|$|R

Understanding what customer value and being able to provide and grasp the value of company’s offering, {{is one of the key}} issues in the corporate world. Therefore, companies are concentrating on creating business models that will respond to customer needs and fulfill their expectations. The objective of this paper is to identify customer needs for material handling in mass incineration plants with a grate fire technology in order to create a business model. Recognized customer needs provide an overview of the market of mass incineration and serve as a base for creating a business model that should respond to the customer’s needs. The study provides theoretical background on the business models and customer needs as well as key concepts in the case study. The empirical data was collected by conducting qualitative interviews with the production and maintenance managers of the mass incineration plants that are processing municipal solid waste and produce energy. To understand different points of view on material handling, waste management company, managers in companies providing turn-key solutions for mass incineration and a consultancy company were interviewed. In addition, concept of circular economy approach proposed by European Union was studied to see its possible influence on the mass incineration segment. The results of the thesis shows that the only need for material handling is in the form of crushing machine that reduce the volume size of the bulky waste, that are large, <b>irregular,</b> usually broken <b>items</b> such as furniture, bookcases or shelves. The crushing equipment could be either stationary or mobile. By decreasing the size of those particles, mass incinerators can keep continues process of feeding the material in to the hopper and also prevent from unplanned stoppages or damages of the hopper.

Jest poświęcona anonimowemu poematowi Draxt ī āsūrīg (Drzewo asyryjskie), którego treścią jest spór toczony przez demoniczną palmę i mazdejską kozę. Autorka podejmuje próbę wyjaśnienia genezy tego utworu a także zawartej w nim bogatej symboliki w kontekście szeroko rozumianej kultury Bliskiego Wschodu. Obok komentarza filologicznego – analizującego zarówno warstwę językową jak i literacko-kulturową w oparciu o tło religioznawczo-historyczne – praca ta zawiera pierwsze tłumaczenie poematu na język polski oraz rekonstrukcję partyjskiego oryginału. Książka ta jest jednym z pierwszych kroków na drodze przywracania literaturze irańskiej, kojarzonej głównie z arcydziełami perskimi, zabytków zaginionej twórczości okresu średnioirańskiego; jest próbą wydobycia jej z mroków historii i przywrócenia utraconego miejsca w kanonie starożytnej literatury światowej. The knotty Pahlavi poem Draxt ī āsūrīg {{concerning}} a contest for superiority between a demoniac date palm and an uncanny goat, belongs to Middle Persian wisdom literature, which was intended both to sharpen the wits {{and to give}} instruction. This poem, due to the language mixture (Pahlavi with many Parthian elements), its verse form and rare vocabulary, presents considerable difficulties. It contains not only many <b>irregular</b> lexical <b>items,</b> but also special vocabulary of a rare occurrence, which {{are to be found}} neither in any other published Middle Persian texts nor extant glossaries. The establishment of the original spelling of certain words of this originally Parthian composition, owing to alternations in the course of oral transmission, redaction in the Book Pahlavi script, the usual corruptions and mistakes made by more or less ignorant scribes and generations of copyists, is a challenging task. In spite of numerous scholarly and editorial efforts (cf. Blochet 1895, Unvala 1921, Bartholo-mae 1922, Smith 1923, Benveniste 1930, Henning 1950, Bolognesi 1953, M. Navvābi 1967, Shaki 1975, Brunner 1980, Oriān 1992), discussion and commentary on the text have been by no means full so far. There is no doubt that this poem – originally a song – is a Middle Persian adaptation of a Parthian unwritten or lost original. Almost certainly, this Pahlavi rendering had also been orally transmitted until after the Arab conquest, and then, was written down by order of Zoroastrian priests, who concentrated their activities on the preservation of religious and wisdom literature. Among other things, there is still no agreement as to its character. According to some scholars, the dispute exposes the opposition between two faiths, with goat representing Zoroastrianism and the palm standing for the pagan religions of Assyria and Babylonia, in which a cult of trees formed an important part. Many others, quite contrary, claim it is a rare example of a secular verse text; in fact a manifestation of the contrast between pastoral (the goat) and agricultural life (the palm-tree). Although all these suggestions seem to be reasonable, there are also other traces, which allow us to view the meaning of this symbolic text with a fresh relationship. Numerous hints and references to the Mazdayasnian faith in the text could allow us to consider it not to be quite secular in spirit, although it lacks the usual Zoroastrian admonitory approach (typical for other Pahlavi texts against Jews, Christians, Manichaeans, Buddhists). It is well known that harshness, severity and orthodox attitude towards the religion did not characterize the Parthians, but their successors, the Sasanians. The Parthians had a political idea, central to which was a commitment to Iran as a national concept and considered themselves to be the heirs of the Achaemenids. Moreover they maintained in general the Achaemenian tolerance regarding the beliefs of non-Iranians. Therefore the theory that the text is a religious polemic against Mesopotamian faith is rather weak. One can assume that, the horned goat represents the Parthian empire, its power, pride and might (a huge horn) and its cultural legacy, being a mixture of Iranian tradition and Greek motives. The goat seems to be the heir of the three-legged, white ass living in the Wourukasha sea, the goat who fed the first human couple Mashya and Mashyana, and also the Greek Amalthea and the Alexander the Great kingdom (cf. the vision from the Book of Daniel). It is as tolerant as Parthians used to be. It feeds every man, and every nation, despite the religion they profess. In the textual remains of ancient Iranian culture there is a notable absence of the plant and animal fables so abundant in Western classical tradition. The form of the original Mesopotamian fable (two opponents: plant versus animal) forced its Parthian composer to choose, what personage would represent his ideas better (i. e. would be the winner) : he chose the goat (contrary to Near Eastern texts where the tree always wins, and the goat is the looser). Thus the text is a rearrangement (re-telling) of for-eign fable patterns with Iranian motifs and characters. The importance of goats in the Iranian world is not to be overestimated. For the poor in Iran, as in many dry regions, the goat plays the role of both the cow and the sheep. Moreover, the Parthians’ enemy, the Romans considered it to be an animal harmful. In the first century B. C. Varro in De re rustica, I. 2. 18 - 20 discoursed on their destructiveness to vines, which allegedly provided the motive for their sacrifice to Bacchus. Fables represent universal truth, which can be referred to any situation, religious or political. The Assyrian Tree is such a parable, where the horned animal symbolizes Iranian (Parthian) legal right and authority, while the proud tall tree represents any foreign kingdom, boasting of its superiority (cf. the Biblical visions). Since finally the greatest Parthian’s opponents proved to be not Romans or Greeks, but Sasanians, their relatives, one may assume that this text afterwards could have been also aimed at them...|$|R
