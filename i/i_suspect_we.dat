500|$|Having {{successfully}} withdrawn Childers from danger, Barlow {{returned to}} Britain on 4 January after battling a strong gale in the Channel. [...] Anchoring {{at the small}} Cornish port of Fowey, Barlow took an express coach directly to the Admiralty in London, arriving on 11 January carrying the 48lb (22kg) cannonball {{as evidence of the}} incident and what British historian William James called the [...] "strong spirit of hostility {{on the part of the}} new republic". Historian Edward Pelham Brenton, writing in 1825, noted however that French hostility on this occasion was justified, commenting that [...] "in the then troubled state of Europe Childers and her captain had no business to be prying into the equipments at Brest within gunshot of the forts: if we had seen a French vessel of war running from the Needles to St Helens, and making observations, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>we</b> should, at such a crisis, have taken the liberty to bring her to action." ...|$|E

[...] "It is the duty of Harvard," [...] he said, [...] "to receive just as many boys who have come, or whose parents have come, to his country without our background as it can effectively educate." [...] If higher Jewish enrollment provoked greater prejudice against them, he asked, [...] "How can we cause the Jews to feel and be regarded {{as an integral part of}} the student body?" [...] He also suggested that Harvard would not be facing this issue if other universities and colleges would admit Jews in similar numbers: [...] "If every college in the country would take a limited proportion of Jews, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>we</b> should go a long way toward eliminating race feeling among the students." ...|$|E

"If {{there are}} any parties {{watching}}," [...] he said to Mike, [...] "they will expect that my messenger, or I myself, will travel by the main road to Almarez, for {{not only is it}} better, but it is shorter. But again, they might think that, if <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>we</b> might be attacked, I should take the road through Deleytoza, and would, at any rate, make matters safe by watching both roads. It is a difficult question which to choose." ...|$|R

60|$|January 13.--Went to Selkirk on the {{business}} of the new high road. I perceive Whytbank and my cousin Colonel Russell of Ashestiel are disposed to peep into the expenses of next year's outlay, which must be provided by loan. This will probably breed strife.

When my then-8-year-old son remarked, 'This is the Doonesbury for kids!' <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>we</b> had {{something}} unusual on our hands." [...] —Lee Salem, Watterson's editor at Universal, recalling his reaction after seeing Watterson's first submission Calvin and Hobbes was conceived when Bill Watterson, who was working in an advertising job he detested, began devoting his spare time to cartooning. He explored various strip ideas but all were rejected by the syndicates. United Feature Syndicate finally responded positively to one strip called Critturs, which featured a side character (the main character's little brother) who had a stuffed tiger. Watterson began a new strip centered on them when {{he was told that}} these characters were the strongest. Though United Feature rejected the new strip, Universal Press Syndicate eventually took it.|$|R

"It was {{a fantastic}} {{confidence}} boost," [...] Hecht {{said about the}} band's win in X-Press Magazine, [...] "To see how much things have evolved in the band dynamic, instrumentation and songwriting since recording the debut single is exciting.

60|$|But, when I was in Dullborough one day, revisiting the {{associations}} {{of my childhood}} as recorded in previous pages of these notes, my experience in this wise was made quite inconsiderable and of no account, by the quantity of places and people--utterly impossible places and people, but none the less alarmingly real--that I found I had been introduced to by my nurse before I was six years old, and used {{to be forced to}} go back to at night without at all wanting to go. If we all knew our own minds (in a more enlarged sense than the popular acceptation of that phrase), <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>we</b> should find our nurses responsible for most of the dark corners we are forced to go back to, against our wills.|$|E

Their strategy for tipping the scales even more in their favor: Regardless of the weather, no heavy corduroys or sweaters are allowed at the weigh-in, Browne joked.

Youve got more than you bargained for in the way of enlightenment. I shall never be the same again. I shall never speak in the old way again. Ive been set free from this silly little hole of a house and all its pretences. I know now that I am stronger than you and Papa.

6000|$|If {{we were at}} {{this moment}} to take, in a single glance, an inside view of Mrs. Burrage (a liberty {{we have not yet}} ventured on), <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>we</b> should find that she was {{considerably}} exasperated at her visitor's superior tone, at seeing herself regarded by this dry, shy, obstinate, provincial young woman as superficial. If she liked Verena very nearly as much as she tried to convince Miss Chancellor, she was conscious of disliking Miss Chancellor more than she should probably ever be able to reveal to Verena. It was doubtless partly her irritation that found a voice as she said, after a self-administered pinch of caution not to say too much, [...] "Of course it would be absurd in us to assume that Miss Tarrant would find my son irresistible, especially as she has already refused him. But even if she should remain obdurate, should you consider yourself quite safe as regards others?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{began to}} look at the humorous aspect of the affair, which it {{certainly}} had, and to comment on the singular incongruities which 'Every Other Week' was destined to involve at every moment of its career. [...] "I wonder if I'm mistaken in supposing that no other periodical was ever like it. Perhaps all periodicals are like it. But I don't believe there's another publication in New York that could bring together, in honor of itself, a fraternity and equality crank like poor old Lindau, and a belated sociological crank like Woodburn, and a truculent speculator like old Dryfoos, and a humanitarian dreamer like young Dryfoos, and a sentimentalist like me, and a nondescript like Beaton, and a pure advertising essence like Fulkerson, and a society spirit like Kendricks. If we could only allow one another to talk uninterruptedly all the time, the dinner would be the greatest success in the world, and we should come home full of the highest mutual respect. But <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>we</b> can't manage that--even your infallible Fulkerson couldn't work it--and I'm afraid that there'll be some listening that 'll spoil the pleasure of the time." ...|$|E

I will now return to my ship; and if, as <b>I</b> begin to <b>suspect</b> <b>we</b> are in these seas on a similar errand, we can concert at our leisure a system of co-operation, which, {{properly}} matured by your experience, may serve {{to bring about the}} common end we have in view." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>we</b> {{had fallen}} into rather free and easy habits under mother's government, for she was too jolly, too tender-hearted, to engender fear in us even when she {{threatened}} us with a switch or a shingle. We soon learned, however, that the soldier's promise of punishment was swift and precise in its fulfillment. We seldom presumed a second time on his forgetfulness or tolerance. We knew he loved us, for he often took us to his knees of an evening and told us stories of marches and battles, or chanted war-songs for us, but the moments of his tenderness were few and his fondling did not prevent him from almost instant use of the rod if he thought either of us needed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>I</b> <b>suspected.</b> But <b>we</b> {{must not}} repine, Comrade Maloney. These trifling contretemps are the {{penalties}} {{we pay for}} our high journalistic aims. I will interview these merchants. I fancy that {{with the aid of}} the Diplomatic Smile and the Honeyed Word I may manage to pull through. It is as well, perhaps, that Comrade Windsor is out. The situation calls for the handling of a man of delicate culture and nice tact. Comrade Windsor would probably have endeavoured to clear the room with a chair. If he should arrive during the seance, Comrade Maloney, be so good as to inform him of the state of affairs, and tell him not to come in. Give him my compliments, and tell him to go out and watch the snowdrops growing in Madison Square Garden." ...|$|R
60|$|The Cigarette {{returned}} with good news. There were beds {{to be had}} some ten minutes' walk from where we were, {{at a place called}} Pont. We stowed the canoes in a granary, and asked among the children for a guide. The circle at once widened round us, and our offers of reward were received in dispiriting silence. We were plainly a pair of Bluebeards to the children; they might speak to us in public places, and where they had the advantage of numbers; but it was another thing to venture off alone with two uncouth and legendary characters, who had dropped from the clouds upon their hamlet this quiet afternoon, sashed and be-knived, and with a flavour of great voyages. The owner of the granary came to our assistance, singled out one little fellow and threatened him with corporalities; or <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>we</b> should have had to find the way for ourselves. As it was, he was more frightened at the granary man than the strangers, having perhaps had some experience of the former. But I fancy his little heart must have been going at a fine rate; for he kept trotting at a respectful distance in front, and looking back at us with scared eyes. Not otherwise may the children of the young world have guided Jove or one of his Olympian compeers on an adventure.|$|E
60|$|The French {{have little}} to boast of {{in the way of}} horseflesh. Most of the fine coach and {{cabriolet}} cattle of Paris come from Mecklenburgh, though some are imported from England. It is not common to meet with a very fine animal of the native breed. In America, land is so plenty and so cheap, that we keep a much larger proportion of brute force than is kept here. It is not uncommon with us to meet with those who live by day's work, using either oxen or horses. The consequence is that many beasts are raised with little care, and with scarcely any attention to the breeds. We find many good ones. In spite of bad grooming, little training, and hard work, I greatly question if even England possesses a larger proportion of good horses, comparing the population of the two countries, than America. Our animals are quicker footed, and at trotting, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>we</b> could beat the world; Christendom, certainly. The great avenue between the garden of the Tuileries and the Bois de Boulogne, with the allées of the latter, are the places to meet the fast-goers of the French capital, and I am strongly of opinion {{that there is no such}} exhibition of speed, in either, as one meets on the Third Avenue of New York. As for the Avenue de Neuilly, our sulky riders would vanish like the wind from anything I have seen on it; although one meets there, occasionally, fine animals from all parts of Europe.|$|E
60|$|And {{therefore}} I am apt {{to doubt}} that, how far soever human industry may advance useful and experimental philosophy in physical things, SCIENTIFICAL {{will still be}} out of our reach: because we want perfect and adequate ideas of those very bodies which are nearest to us, and most under our command. Those which we have ranked into classes under names, and we think ourselves best acquainted with, we have but very imperfect and incomplete ideas of. Distinct ideas of the several sorts of bodies that fall under the examination of our senses perhaps we may have: but adequate ideas, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>we</b> have not of any one amongst them. And though the former of these will serve us for common use and discourse, yet whilst we want the latter, we are not capable of scientifical knowledge; nor shall {{ever be able to}} discover general, instructive, unquestionable truths concerning them. CERTAINTY and DEMONSTRATION are things we must not, in these matters, pretend to. By the colour, figure, taste, and smell, and other sensible qualities, we have as clear and distinct ideas of sage and hemlock, as we have of a circle and a triangle: but having no ideas of the particular primary qualities of the minute parts of either of these plants, nor of other bodies which we would apply them to, we cannot tell what effects they will produce; nor when we see those effects can we so much as guess, much less know, their manner of production. Thus, having no ideas of the particular mechanical affections of the minute parts of bodies that are within our view and reach, we are ignorant of their constitutions, powers, and operations: and of bodies more remote we are yet more ignorant, not knowing so much as their very outward shapes, or the sensible and grosser parts of their constitutions.|$|E
60|$|This {{was that}} {{which gave the}} first rise to this Essay {{concerning}} the understanding. For I thought that the first step towards satisfying several inquiries the mind of man was very apt to run into, was, to take a survey of our own understandings, examine our own powers, and see to what things they were adapted. Till that was done <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>we</b> began at the wrong end, and in vain sought for satisfaction in a quiet and sure possession of truths that most concerned us, whilst we let loose our thoughts into the vast ocean of Being; as if all that boundless extent were the natural and undoubted possession of our understandings, wherein there was nothing exempt from its decisions, or that escaped its comprehension. Thus men, extending their inquiries beyond their capacities, and letting their thoughts wander into those depths where they can find no sure footing, {{it is no wonder}} that they raise questions and multiply disputes, which, never coming to any clear resolution, are proper only to continue and increase their doubts, and to confirm them at last in perfect scepticism. Whereas, were the capacities of our understandings well considered, the extent of our knowledge once discovered, and the horizon found which sets the bounds between the enlightened and dark parts of things; between what is and what is not comprehensible by us, men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the avowed ignorance of the one, and employ their thoughts and discourse with more advantage and satisfaction in the other.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>we</b> see a {{trace of}} this same {{expression}} in {{what is called a}} derisive or sardonic smile. The lips are then kept joined or almost joined, but one corner of the mouth is retracted on the side towards the derided person; and this drawing back of the corner is part of a true sneer. Although some persons smile more on one side of their face than on the other, {{it is not easy to}} understand why in cases of derision the smile, if a real one, should so commonly be confined to one side. I have also on these occasions noticed a slight twitching of the muscle which draws up the outer part of the upper lip; and this movement, if fully carried out, would have uncovered the canine, and would have produced a true sneer.|$|R
40|$|In all of nature, {{change is}} the most {{constant}} factor. Throughout manmade civilizations, likewise, change from era to era is continual and inevitable.
