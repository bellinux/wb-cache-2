40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} demand for safer food {{has resulted in the}} development and introduction of new food safety standards and regulations to reach a higher level of food safety. An integrated approach of controlling food safety throughout the entire food chain (‘farm to table’) has become an important issue in improving the food safety level, but little is known about its economic aspects. This paper reviews important issues in this field, namely the definition of safe food, the nature of food safety hazards, the establishment of acceptable hazard levels, the strategy of <b>food</b> safety <b>improvement</b> and the methods for valuing the improvement. Methods considered are risk-risk analysis, health-health analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and conventional cost-benefit analysis. Food safety itself is complex and there is no single indicator to measure it. Also, acceptable levels of food safety hazards need further elaboration to clarify the process of <b>food</b> safety <b>improvement</b> for producers. It is furthermore important to gain more insight into cost-effective ways of <b>food</b> safety <b>improvement</b> throughout the entire chain. Valuation of producers' benefits along the chain and their distribution are urgently needed...|$|R

40|$|Writing abstracts in a {{comprehensive}} and meaningful manner is a challenge for any researcher. However an abstract includes limited set of verbs and standard phrases and other good practices of structuring the contents. A {{research has been conducted}} to develop an Agent-based Solution for Improving Abstracts. This solution is based on multi agent systems technology and natural language processing together with commonly used verb phrases and other good practices. The system has been developed with nine agents, namely, coordination agent, parser agent, problem agent, solution agent, conclusion agent, content <b>agent,</b> synonym <b>agent,</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>agent</b> and restructure agent. The coordination agent coordinates entire process. The parser agent identifies syntactic information of each sentence and prepares the contents of the abstract for further analysis. The problem agent ensures whether the research problem has been stated {{in the early part of}} the abstract and it‘s proportion within the abstract. The solution agent checks for the contents in terms of concepts such as hypothesis, methodology, approach, design, implementation, methods, theoretical framework, technology, hardware, software, and sampling based on the key words. The conclusion agent searches for concepts such as testing, evaluation, data analysis and statistical significance based on the key words. The content <b>agent,</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>agent,</b> synonym agent, and restructure agent are responsible to offer guidelines to modify and improving of the abstract. More importantly, these agents interact with each other and deliberate to reach consensus regarding a solution. For instance, problem agent and solution agent may agree on the proportion of respective contents within the abstract. Each agent has its own Ontology for deliberating with other agents. The Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit has been used to develop parser and JADE has been used for development of the entire multi agent system. The system has been developed with JAVA to run on Windows. It has been incrementally tested, and shown interesting results related to checking for completeness of the abstract in terms required materials and suggestion for improvements...|$|R

Methods of improving fodder through use of Stylosanthes in agropastoral systems is described in the cropping and fallowlands areas.

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the relative importance}} of attributes of <b>food</b> safety <b>improvement</b> in the production chain of fluid pasteurized milk. The chain was divided into 4 blocks: "feed" (compound feed production and its transport), "farm" (dairy farm), "dairy processing" (transport and processing of raw milk, delivery of pasteurized milk), and "consumer" (retailer/catering establishment and pasteurized milk consumption). The concept of <b>food</b> safety <b>improvement</b> focused on 2 main groups of hazards: chemical (antibiotics and dioxin) and microbiological (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus). Adaptive conjoint analysis was used to investigate food safety experts' perceptions of the attributes' importance. Preference data from individual experts (n = 24) on 101 attributes along the chain were collected in a computer-interactive mode. Experts perceived the attributes from the "feed" and "farm" blocks as being more vital for controlling the chemical hazards; whereas the attributes from the "farm" and "dairy processing" were considered more vital for controlling the microbiological hazards. For the chemical hazards, "identification of treated cows" and "quality assurance system of compound feed manufacturers" were considered the most important attributes. For the microbiological hazards, these were "manure supply source" and "action in salmonellosis and M. paratuberculosis cases". The rather high importance of attributes relating to quality assurance and traceability systems of the chain participants indicates that participants look for food safety assurance from the preceding participants. This information has substantial decision-making implications for private businesses along the chain and for the government regarding the <b>food</b> safety <b>improvement</b> of fluid pasteurized mil...|$|R
