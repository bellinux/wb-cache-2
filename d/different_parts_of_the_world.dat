5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian.

In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E

5|$|The taxonomic {{placement}} of the turkey vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures has been in flux.

5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today; the Charminar—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—has come to symbolise Hyderabad. Golconda fort {{is another}} major landmark. The {{influence}} of Mughlai culture {{is also evident}} in the region's distinctive cuisine, which includes Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters from <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with {{the decline of the}} Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city {{from the rest of the}} Indian subcontinent. The Telugu film industry based in the city is the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures.|$|E

5|$|The exact taxonomic {{placement}} of the Andean condor and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and are not closely related. Just how different the two families are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are {{more closely related to}} storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead described them as incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century saw {{increasingly}} sophisticated educational, visitor service, and interpretation services. Botanical gardens started to cater for many interests and their displays reflected this, often including botanical exhibits on themes of evolution, ecology or taxonomy, horticultural displays of attractive flowerbeds and herbaceous borders, plants from <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> special collections of plant groups such as bamboos or roses, and specialist glasshouse collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, cacti and orchids, as well as the traditional herb gardens and medicinal plants. Specialised gardens like the Palmengarten in Frankfurt, Germany (1869), one of the world's leading orchid and succulent plant collections, have been very popular. There was a renewed interest in gardens of indigenous plants and areas dedicated to natural vegetation.|$|E

5|$|Heathen rites {{often take}} place in non-public spaces, {{particularly}} in a practitioner's home. In other cases, Heathen places of worship have been established on plots of land specifically purchased for the purpose; these can represent either a hörg, which is a sanctified place within nature like a grove of trees, or a hof, which is a wooden temple. The Heathen community has made various attempts to construct hofs in <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> In 2014 the Ásaheimur Temple was opened in Efri Ás, Skagafjörður, Iceland, while in 2015 a British Heathen group called the Odinist Fellowship opened a temple in a converted 16th-century chapel in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Heathens have also adopted archaeological sites as places of worship. For instance, British practitioners have assembled for rituals at the Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire, the Rollright Stones in Warwickshire, and the White Horse Stone in Kent. Swedish Heathens {{have done the same}} at Gamla Uppsala, and Icelandic practitioners have met at Þingvellir.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Qutb Shahi {{rulers and}} Nizams {{attracted}} artists, architects and men {{of letters from}} <b>different</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> through patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as mushairas (poetic symposia). The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani Urdu literature leading to works such as the Deccani Masnavi and Diwan poetry, which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu. Lazzat Un Nisa, a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts. The reign of the Nizams saw many literary reforms {{and the introduction of}} Urdu as a language of court, administration and education. In 1824, a collection of Urdu Ghazal poetry, named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa, authored by Mah Laqa Bai—the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad.|$|E
