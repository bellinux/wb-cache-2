40|$|A 2, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> {{is needed}} to replace an {{existing}} 1, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> in the Chemical Lab (Building MO- 733). The existing 1, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> (to be replaced) has a 174 boom (I-beam). The crane {{is attached to the}} wall through two brackets (about 8 1 / 2 -ft apart). The boom is attached to the lower bracket, and a supporting rod is attached to the upper bracket. The supporting rod is attached to the boom at about 8 -ft from the free end. After preliminary studies and discussions, it was decided to construct the new <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> from two perpendicular I-beams (L-shape) without a supporting rod. The crane is to be supported on the wall through the two lower existing brackets (about 5 -ft apart). The boom is to be 20 -ft long cantilever (the horizontal I-beam). The vertical I-beam is to be attached to the lower two existing brackets to support the <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> to the wall. This construction is to be similar to another existing 1, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> (L-shape) in the lab. The purpose of this document is to perform a design analysis for the proposed 2, 000 lbf <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> to determine suitable sizes of members and configuration of the new <b>jib</b> <b>crane</b> assembly.

50|$|Overhead cranes are {{commonly}} used in the refinement of steel and other metals such as copper and aluminium. At {{every step of the}} manufacturing process, until it leaves a factory as a finished product, metal is handled by an overhead crane. Raw materials are poured into a furnace by crane, hot metal is then rolled to specific thickness and tempered or annealed, and then stored by an overhead crane for cooling, the finished coils are lifted and loaded onto trucks and trains by overhead crane, and the fabricator or stamper uses an overhead crane to handle the steel in his factory. The automobile industry uses overhead cranes to handle raw materials. Smaller workstation cranes, such as <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> or gantry cranes, handle lighter loads in a work area, such as CNC mill or saw.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The failure path {{of large}} complex steel {{structure}} systems for lattice <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is investigated in this paper. Considering {{the lack of}} an explicit function expression in the study of reliability, a method based on a modified response surface method is proposed to quantify the reliability index and the failure probability, capitalizing on the linear- approximated iteration and the difference approach rather than the differential approach in solving nonlinear equations. The major failure path is determined through the analysis of the multiple failure probabilities. The main failure mode of lattice <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is a failure in stability, not a failure in strength based on a comparison of the failure probabilities of both stability failures and strength failures. And the failure path is substantially a rearrangement of the hazardous components and the failure path of components with similar probabilities and close locations varies only in that these components break at distinct starting positions. Finally a proposal is put forward to heighten in engineer practices the security reserves of hazardous components to achieve high reliability of an overall system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Jib</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are widely}} used to {{transport}} objects in many factories and work places. Crane motions induce undesirable vibrations of the payload. Therefore, a jib crane designer should seek a satisfactory control method to suppress load vibrations during transportation. The aim of this work is to derive a nonlinear model of a jib crane, which {{takes into account the}} simultaneous rotational motions of the boom and the post. These motions induce not only load sway in the plane of motion, but also oscillations of the plane determined by the ropes and the vertical axis through the suspension point. An active vibration control, based on a stability study, has been developed to transport an object along a specified route {{in such a way that}} the aforementioned sway and oscillations of the object are suppressed quickly. The crane nonlinear model and the developed feedback control scheme are simulated using the data of an actual jib crane. The simulation results show the usefulness of the derived model and the proposed control scheme, in suppressing the payload vibration.

40|$|Abstract — Standardization of {{jib crane}} design {{procedures}} enables designers {{to develop their}} own jib crane automation modules for entire jib crane design applications. Since main effort and time for implementation of the jib crane design procedures are generally spent for interpretation and explanation of the available jib crane design standards, a computer-automated access by using parametric modeling to the available standards may improve speed, reliability and quality of the design procedures. Starting from the fact that components of <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> are generally composed of similar mechanical and electrical sub-components independent of the crane type, a general component tree of <b>jib</b> <b>cranes</b> is developed for automation purpose. Design Modules of cranes are defined from the developed component tree of the cranes based on the available design procedures. Independent Design Procedures are defined as atomic design modules of the jib crane design procedures by considering computational approaches and rules in the "F. E. M. Rules " for each jib crane component. The "F. E. M. rules " is selected for this purpose because of its widespread use and established popularity among the jib crane manufacturers. Access to the "F. E. M. Rules " from any design procedure is fully automated by using a systematic approach of parametric modeling. The parametric model can be used for various jib crane design cases as well as further for optimization. “Ref. [6]...|$|E
