25|$|This {{iteration}} method produces two {{roots of the}} quintic. The remaining three roots {{can be obtained by}} using synthetic division to divide the two roots out, producing a cubic equation. It is to be noted that due to the way the iteration is formulated, this method seems to always find two complex conjugate roots of the quintic even when all the quintic coefficients are real and the starting <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> real. This {{iteration method}} is derived by from the symmetries of the icosahedron and is closely related to the method Felix Klein describes in his book.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no natural}} {{candidate}} {{for what might}} cause {{what has been called}} dark energy but the current best <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that it is the zero-point energy of the vacuum. One difficulty with this assumption is that the zero-point energy of the vacuum is absurdly large compared to the observed cosmological constant. In general relativity, mass and energy are equivalent; both produce a gravitational field and therefore the theorized vacuum energy of quantum field theory should have led the universe ripping itself to pieces. This obviously has not happened and this issue, called the cosmological constant problem, {{is one of the greatest}} unsolved mysteries in physics.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

According to Norris, [...] "my <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that either the information was not accessible to her [...] or it was privileged and could not be released to me." [...] Lewis told Norris to recommend that Cho seek counseling at the on-campus Cook Counseling Center, as Lewis had already done.|$|E

[...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where {{do we go from}} here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> as good as mine.'" ...|$|E

Notably, prior to The Hunchback of Notre Dame, [...] "Disney had been dominating the Original Song category at the Academy Awards, often claiming multiple nominations and a win, but Hunchback was shut out, receiving only a nod for Original Score." [...] Menken told HitFix, [...] "The loss for the 'Hunchback of Notre Dame' score in 1997 ... were 'disappointing.' In spite of this, Mark A.

500|$|In 1962, {{the book}} was {{published}} in Britain. Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for The Times Literary Supplement, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth is something every adult seems sure will turn into a modern Alice... The obvious <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> that the appeal {{of this sort of}} writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the Alices. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up's favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer." [...] Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for The Listener, [...] "This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of Pilgrim's Progress of a little boy in his car... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron. the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book which parents and children can share." [...] It reached Australia in 1963; The Canberra Times reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{intuitive}} early diagnostic guess {{could play}} an important role in reaching a final diagnosis. However, no study to date has attempted to quantify the importance of general practitioners' (GPs) ability to correctly appraise the origin of chest pain within the first minutes of an encounter. Methods The validation study was nested in a multicentre cohort study with a one year follow-up and included 626 successive patients who presented with chest pain and were attended by 58 GPs in Western Switzerland. The early diagnostic <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> assessed prior to a patient's history being taken by a GP and was then compared to a diagnosis of chest pain observed over the next year. Results Using summary measures clustered at the GP's level, the early diagnostic <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by further investigation in 51. 0 % (CI 95 %; 49. 4 % to 52. 5 %) of patients presenting with chest pain. The early diagnostic <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> more accurate in patients with a life threatening illness (65. 4 %; CI 95 % 64. 5 % to 66. 3 %) and in patients who did not feel anxious (62. 9 %; CI 95 % 62. 5 % to 63. 3 %). The predictive abilities of an early diagnostic <b>guess</b> <b>were</b> consistent among GPs. Conclusions The GPs early diagnostic <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> correct in one out of two patients presenting with chest pain. The probability of a correct <b>guess</b> <b>was</b> higher in patients with a life-threatening illness and in patients not feeling anxious about their pain. </p...|$|R
