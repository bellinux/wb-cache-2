5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and <b>diagnosed</b> mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when <b>diagnosed</b> via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when <b>diagnosed</b> via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is <b>diagnosed.</b> ADHD is <b>diagnosed</b> approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys.

40|$|The set of <b>diagnoses</b> is {{commonly}} calculated in consistency based diagnosis, where a diagnosis includes {{a set of}} faulty components.

40|$|In this paper, we {{are mainly}} {{concerned}} with consistency-based <b>diagnoses</b> for systems represented in a propositional framework. Several characterizations of such <b>diagnoses</b> (mainly minimal <b>diagnoses,</b> kernel <b>diagnoses,</b> MT-diagnoses) {{have been proposed}} so far. Unfortunately, minimal <b>diagnoses,</b> and MT-diagnoses characterize only some consistency-based <b>diagnoses</b> and the set of kernel <b>diagnoses</b> for a system is often unsufficiently concise to be helpful; especially, the kernel <b>diagnoses</b> approach does not suggest any way to incorporate hierarchical relations between components within the diagnostic process. As {{an alternative to the}} kernel <b>diagnoses</b> characterization, we introduce the theory minimal conflicts for a system S.

Background: Uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> in health insurance claims (HICs) may introduce bias into Japanese health statistics dependent on computerized HICs. This study’s aim was to identify the causes and characteristics of uncoded <b>diagnoses.</b> Methods: Uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> from computerized HICs (outpatient, inpatient, and the diagnosis procedure-combination per-diem payment system [DPC/PDPS]) submitted to the National Health Insurance Organization of Kumamoto Prefecture in May 2010 were analyzed. The text documentation accompanying the uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> was used to classify <b>diagnoses</b> in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases- 10 (ICD- 10). The text documentation was also classified into four categories using the standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses</b> defined in the master files of the computerized HIC system: 1) standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses,</b> 2) standard descriptions with a modifier, 3) non-standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses,</b> and 4) unclassifiable text documentation. Using these classifications, the proportions of uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> by ICD- 10 disease category were calculated. Results: Of the uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> analyzed (n = 363 753), non-standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses</b> for outpatient, inpatient, and DPC/PDPS HICs comprised 12. 1 %, 14. 6 %, and 1. 0 % of uncoded <b>diagnoses,</b> respectively.

40|$|In fault {{detection}} and isolation, diagnostic test results {{are commonly used}} to compute a set of <b>diagnoses,</b> where each diagnosis points at a set of components which might behave abnormally. In distributed systems consisting of multiple control units, the test results in each unit {{can be used to}} compute local <b>diagnoses</b> while all test results in the complete system give the global <b>diagnoses.</b> It is an advantage for both repair and fault-tolerant control to have access to the global <b>diagnoses</b> in each unit since these <b>diagnoses</b> represent all test results in all units. However, when the <b>diagnoses,</b> for example, are to be used to repair a unit, only the components that are used by the unit are of interest. The {{reason for this is that}} it is only these components that could have caused the abnormal behavior. However, the global <b>diagnoses</b> might include components from the complete system and therefore often include components that are superfluous for the unit. Motivated by this observation, a new type of diagnosis is proposed, namely, the condensed diagnosis. Each unit has a unique set of condensed <b>diagnoses</b> which represents the global <b>diagnoses.</b> The benefit of the condensed <b>diagnoses</b> is that they only include components used by the unit while still representing the global <b>diagnoses.</b> The proposed method is applied to an automotive vehicle, and the results from the application study show the benefit of using condensed <b>diagnoses</b> compared to global <b>diagnoses.</b> Funding Agencies|Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research||Scania CV AB|...|$|R
