25|$|Water for the Taj complex was {{provided}} through a complex infrastructure. It was first {{drawn from the}} river {{by a series of}} purs - an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism. The water then flowed along an arched aqueduct into a large storage tank, where, by thirteen additional purs, it was raised to large distribution cistern above the Taj ground level located {{to the west of the}} complex's wall. From here water passed into three subsidiary tanks and was then piped to the complex. The head of pressure generated by the height of the tanks (9.5m) was sufficient to supply the fountains and irrigate the gardens. A 0.25metre diameter <b>earthenware</b> <b>pipe</b> lies 1.8metres below the surface, in line with the main walkway which fills the main pools of the complex. Some of the earthenware pipes were replaced in 1903 with cast iron. The fountain pipes were not connected directly to the fountain heads, instead a copper pot {{was provided}} under each fountain head: water filled the pots ensuring an equal pressure to each fountain. The purs no longer remain, but the other parts of the infrastructure have survived with the arches of the aqueduct now used to accommodate offices for the Archaeological Survey of India's Horticultural Department.|$|E

50|$|In 1883 George Dames and {{his brother}} Charles Richard Dames leased land in Horsecombe Vale from the Midford Castle estate and opened a mine and {{processing}} works for Fuller's earth. The mines extended nearly 20 acre through four adits. In 1915 the works {{was taken over by}} the Fuller's Earth Union and despite geological problems continued until the end of World War II. At the bottom of the valley was the pan grinding works where water from Horsecombe Brook was used to make a slurry from which sand settled at the bottom of troughs.

Once the water had been drained by sluices the damp caked earth was carried in wooden trams to kilns where it was dried for three to four days. The product was used in the oil refining and pharmaceutical industries. The original uses in woollen production no longer used fuller's earth. A railway siding at Midford railway station was built specifically to load fuller's earth.|$|E

40|$|The sevenspine goby. Chaenogobius heptacanthus (Hilgendorf) is {{distributed}} in the Middle and Southern Japan and Southern Korea. The fish inhabits the shallow waters of bay, particulary it is abundant in eel grass, Zostera beds and lives a free swimming life in aggregation, and moves slowly. The goby feeds on tiny planktonic animals such as copepods and crustacean larvae. The female fish, averaging 48 mm BL, grows bigger than the males, 42 mm BL. During the spawning season, which extends from Feburary to May in Kyhshu, the female fish is decorated with bright nuptial colors. The life span of the fish is about one year. The spawning behavior in the wild is unknown. Four pairs out of 9 pairs of fish treated by gonadotrophic hormones spawned fertilized eggs. The hormones used were dryed pituitaries of the bull frog and the medicine, Synahorin. The former were planted in dorsopectoral muscle of the fish and the latter was injected in the same place. After the hormone operation, each pair of the treated fish were enclosed with net in an <b>earthenware</b> <b>pipe</b> and setttled in aquaria provided with a circulatory system of sea water. During 2 ～ 14 days after the last operation. the fish deposited fertilized eggs on the inner wall of the pipe, but the eggs were not in good quality. The egg is demersal one with adhesive threads. It is ellipsoid in shape, about 3. 0 mm in long axis and about 1. 1 mm in short axis. A 4. 6 mm larva hatched out about 11 days after spawning at the water temperature 10 ～ 15 ℃, but it came out before complete development. The post larvae ranging from 10 to 27 mm TL., were collected by boat seine net all over Hakata Bay, Kyushu during April to June.

5000|$|Traditionally, land drains {{were formed}} in clay soils and peats by {{excavating}} a trench and forming a [...] "tunnel" [...] using flat stones. This was very labour-intensive {{but could be}} often be done using free materials at hand. Typically they were two to three feet (600mm-900mm) below the surface. Agricultural land drains have to be installed sufficiently deep to avoid plough damage. In 1843 in England short <b>earthenware</b> <b>pipes</b> were first used laid edge to edge. The earliest type consisted of a [...] "u" [...] shaped trough onto which a flat lid was placed. Later the extruded clay pipe was developed. These are still used. These can be laid in an excavated trench, or a horizontal hole is formed in the ground using a mole plough and the pipes are forced in {{by means of a}} hand or mechanical press. By this means, heavy wet soils, bogs and swamps could be rendered amendable to agriculture. Virtually all crops need a well drained soil to grow well.|$|R

5000|$|The {{adverse effects}} of lead were known to the ancients. In the 2nd century BC the Greek {{botanist}} Nicander described the colic and paralysis seen in lead-poisoned people. Dioscorides, a Greek physician who {{is thought to have}} lived in the 1st century CE, wrote that lead [...] "makes the mind give way". Lead was used extensively in Roman aqueducts from about 500 BC to 300 AD.

For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because white lead is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body." [...] During the Mongol period in China (1271−1368 AD), lead pollution due to silver smelting in the Yunnan region exceeded contamination levels from modern mining activities by nearly four times. In the 17th and 18th centuries, people in Devon were afflicted by a condition referred to as Devon colic; this was discovered to be due to the imbibing of lead-contaminated cider. In 2013, the World Health Organization estimated that lead poisoning resulted in 143,000 deaths, and [...] "contributed to 600,000 new cases of children with intellectual disabilities", each year. In the U.S. city of Flint, Michigan, lead contamination in drinking water has been an issue since 2014. The source of the contamination has been attributed to [...] "corrosion in the lead and iron pipes that distribute water to city residents". In 2015, drinking water lead levels in north-eastern Tasmania, Australia, were reported to reach over 50 times national drinking water guidelines. The source of the contamination was attributed to [...] "a combination of dilapidated drinking water infrastructure, including lead jointed pipelines, end-of-life polyvinyl chloride pipes and household plumbing".|$|R

50|$|In 1873 an {{open channel}} of 6.4 km length was {{excavated}} by the Public Works Department at cost of Rs. 4,000/- for diverting {{the water of}} the Korampallam irrigation tank to a reservoir in the outskirts of the town. From this reservoir water was distributed to several wells in the town by means of conduits and <b>earthenware</b> <b>pipes</b> laid by the Municipal council at a cost of Rs. 9380/- in 1896 a comprehensive water supply scheme was recommended by the Sanitary Board. It consisted of two portions and the execution of the first portion took place in 1906 at a cost of Rs. 1,17,780/- and the second in April 1908. Later, {{it was found that the}} improvement of the Korampallam tank interfered with the irrigation interests of the ryots. But due to contamination in the drinking water Cholera and other water borne diseases occurred frequently and affected hundreds of people. In order to control these epidemic diseases, Cruz Fernandez who was the Chairman of the Municipality during 1909, 1910, 1912, 1919 and 1925 introduced a novel scheme. it was a joint water supply scheme for the three towns namely Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai from the Thamirabarani River near Vallanadu which is 38 km from Tuticorin at a cost of Rs. 18,23,275/- in 1932. Both these Municipalities and the public works departments plunged in action during 1914 to 1915. but the break of World War I affected its further progress and the work was kept in abeyance. In 1925 and 1926 the expenses of the project was escalated to Rs. 27,83,765/-. Cruz Fernandez got this amount as grant and as loan and completed the scheme in 1938 and enabled the people of Tuticorin, to get good drinking water. Before the completion of this scheme when there was scarcity of water, Cruz Fernandez arranged bringing of water to this town by train from Kadambur and by Thonis (Country Boats) from Sri Lanka. Water tax was also levied on the people. Though initially it was criticized by the people, the success of the programme changed their mind to accept it without opposition.|$|R
