5|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on low {{visibility}} camouflage for ships. Some measures were deceptive, like a false painted bow wave to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> high speed at all times. Measures making cruisers resemble destroyers were discontinued after causing station-keeping confusion among ships operating in formation.|$|E
5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials. Wooden {{fences and}} gates, paths covered with locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> an old-fashioned country garden.|$|E
5|$|The body is {{the main}} part of the cloth, and is filled with a wide variety of patterns. The body can be divided into two {{alternating}} patterns and colours called pagi-sore ('dawn-dusk'). Brighter pattern are shown during the day, while darker pattern are shown in the evening. The alternating colours <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> two batik sets.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the south}} {{transept}} {{is similar in}} dimension to the nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a building balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub. The tower is of the late 15thcentury Perpendicular style, but its four large battlemented turrets are {{the work of the}} restoration architect George Gilbert Scott.|$|E
5|$|Four main {{proposals}} were suggested {{for the new}} fixed link. One involved a four-lane subsea tunnel, one involved building a second, two-lane bridge immediately adjacent to the current one, which would <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a single bridge, another involved a new four-lane bridge slightly to the south, and the last involved a new bridge considerably further to the south, which would connect to County Road 557.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building is clad in multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh slate quarries. Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> rock; strata they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry, the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry, the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd quarry, and the black from the Corris Quarry.|$|E

5|$|This new {{constructional}} technique allowed Gaudí {{to achieve}} his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid vaults have their centre where Gothic vaults had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between vaults, where Gothic vaults have ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaudí employed to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a starry sky.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him is a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around the world, with the player triggering snippets of narration by clicking on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, clicking on them will sometimes result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> them walking.|$|E
5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a living form as they move across the water.|$|E

5|$|The missile silo {{used for}} the episode's climactic scene was {{incomplete}} when the scene was filmed, as the crew {{did not have enough}} time or money left to complete the set. The crew built the incomplete silo on a sound stage around a completed spacecraft prop, and were able to digitally extend the set with computer generated interiors to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a much larger silo. Exterior shots of the silo building were also enhanced digitally, with various buildings and machinery created with computer generated imagery and composited into the exterior shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a fast winter's journey {{by means of the}} troika, a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rescue}} of Mussolini and the {{establishment}} of the Italian Social Republic (RSI), in spite of urging by local German officials, Hitler refused to officially annex South Tyrol, instead he decided that the RSI should hold official sovereignty over these territories, and forbade all measures that would <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> official annexation of South Tyrol. However, in practice the territory of South Tyrol within the boundaries defined by Germany as Operationszone Alpenvorland that included Trent, Bolzano, and Belluno, were de facto incorporated into Germany's Reichsgau Tirol-Vorarlberg and administered by its Gauleiter Franz Hofer. While the region identified by Germany as Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland that included Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola, Fiume (Rijeka), and Ljubljana were de facto incorporated into Reichsgau Kärnten and administered by its Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer.|$|E

5|$|In August {{the brigade}} formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward {{to form the}} left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences. At the same time, the brigade took command of the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment and the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, which {{were part of a}} larger {{deception}} force commanded by the divisional commander, Chaytor. They were tasked with convincing the Turks that the next British attack would be from the Jordan Valley, while the forces were actually being realigned to attack in the west. The regiment was heavily involved in the deception, carrying out offensive patrolling, constructing dummy camps, and moving back and forwards behind the lines to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a much larger force than was actually present.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pains to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience not familiar with the areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the Welsh equivalent, even in the case of Nottingham, which seems unlikely to have had a native Welsh name. As a result, and given that Alfred's overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred's personal qualities and reconcile them to his rule. However, {{it is also possible that}} Asser's inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred's programme of fortification that <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> the book's being aimed at an English audience.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the church was richly decorated. The walls were plastered and painted in white and maroon with geometric patterns and lines designed to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> ashlar masonry. Architectural detail was also picked out in maroon. The floors were covered in polychrome encaustic tiles featuring foliage, heraldic beasts, and coats of arms including those of England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Queen Eleanor of Castile, Richard of Cornwall and many powerful noble families. The chapels in the south transept had tiles with symbols of Edward the Confessor and the Virgin Mary. The windows of the church were filled with painted glass, six panels {{of which have been}} recovered. They show scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the Crucifixion, monks, monsters and humorous animals.|$|E
5|$|The next {{months were}} spent {{training}} and refitting, until August when the brigade formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward {{to form the}} left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences.

5|$|The opening scene, set at {{the closing}} {{ceremony}} of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, was filmed on location at Elland Road, home of Leeds United, and Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford RLFC. Elland Road {{was used for the}} speech elements of the prince stammering his way through his first public address, and Odsal Stadium was selected because of the resemblance of its curved ends to Wembley Stadium in 1925. The crew had access to the stadium only at 10pm, after a football game. They filled the terraces with inflatable dummies and over 250 extras dressed in period costumes. Live actors were interspersed to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a crowd. Additional people, as well as more ranks of soldiers on the pitch, were added in post-production with visual effects.|$|E
