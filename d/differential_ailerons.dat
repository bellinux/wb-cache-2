25|$|The Sparviero had an all wood, low mounted {{cantilever}} wing of isosceles trapezoidal plan, {{built around a}} single spar and covered with stressed plywood skin, with <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> and trailing edge flaps. The fuselage was a ply skinned wooden monocoque, built in two sections which bolted together just aft of the wings. The forward part held the cabin, which seated four in two pairs, with access via two wide doors over the wings. The roof line of the cabin continued aft into that of the rear fuselage. The Sparviero was initially powered by a 250hp (187kW) Hirth inverted V-8 air-cooled engine, though it was the intention to replace this with a 260hp (194kW) Lycoming horizontally opposed engine in production models and the prototype received one later. Fuel was fed from three tanks, two in the wings {{and one in the}} fuselage. The tail unit was conventional, with the tailplane just above the fuselage. The latter tapered in height rearwards and the fin merged into it with a dorsal fillet. The empennage construction was {{similar to that of the}} wing, except that the control surfaces were fabric covered. The tricycle undercarriage was retractable and fitted with hydraulic brakes.|$|E
2500|$|The SM.80 was a {{cantilever}} high-wing monoplane. Like the fin and tailplane, {{the wing}} was a fabric covered wooden structure, but one subdivided into sealed cells to provide buoyancy {{in case of}} hull flooding. Its tips were rounded; the fin was broad and also rounded with the tailplane, braced from below, mounted a little way above the fuselage. [...] All control surfaces, the <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons,</b> split elevators and rounded rudder, were steel tube framed and fabric covered.|$|E
2500|$|The single engine, tandem, {{two seat}} I-12 was a {{development}} of the similarly laid out I-11, strengthened for aerobatics. It was an all wood low wing monoplane, entirely plywood covered apart from the tail control surfaces and with a fixed, conventional undercarriage. Its cantilever wing was built around a main and an auxiliary box spar, both made from spruce and plywood. The short wing centre section was integral with the fuselage, with the main undercarriage legs on it. [...] These and the wheels, fitted with brakes, were faired. [...] Outboard, the wing panels tapered to rounded tips, carrying both the balanced and slotted <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> and hand operated camber changing split flaps.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} had no rudder as such, the tailplane fins being adjustable but {{fixed in}} flight. Turning was by <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> and elevator alone.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the LMAL 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel of various modifications to the trailing edge of a 0. 155 -chord plain aileron on a semispan model of the tapered wing of a fighter airplane. The modifications considered in the present report were: (1) plain and unrigged ailerons with fixed positive tabs to provide upfloating tendencies and allow reduction of stick force through the use of conventional <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> linkages; and (2) plain and downrigged ailerons with fixed negative tabs to provide downfloating tendencies and allow reductions of stick force through the use of reversed <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> linkages. The effect of a gap at the aileron nose was investigated for each of the basic modifications. Prepared at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Langley Field, Virginia.

5000|$|The Kitfox Model 4 was a {{new design}} {{introduced}} in 1991. It incorporated a laminar flow airfoil, new flaperon design, metal flaperon attach brackets and a new 2:1 <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> control system. The gross weight of the Kitfox Model 4-1050 {{was the same as}} the Model 3, 1050 lb. The Model 4 standard engines include the [...] Rotax 912 and the [...] Rotax 912S. 322 were built.|$|R
2500|$|The Bernard 80 was a {{monoplane}} with a {{cantilever wing}} of high aspect ratio (8.6). The wing planform was straight tapered with elliptical tips. Five fuel tanks {{on each side}} provided a total capacity of 7,000L (1,540Impgal, 1,850USgal). <b>Differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> were fitted. The wing was a single piece wooden structure with two spars and plywood ribs, plywood skinned with canvas covering. It thickened continuously towards the centre where its depth increased rapidly to form part of the fuselage. [...] This centre section contained four parallel steel tubes which joined {{the front and rear}} fuselage sections to it. An oval internal opening, 0.7m (28in) high and 0.45m (17in) wide, gave access from the nose to the rear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designer}} of the Pirate was the experienced Harold Boultbee, who had recently produced the Civilian Coupé, and construction began early in 1935. The high wings were straight edged, but tapered, slightly swept {{on the leading edge}} and fully slotted. [...] The trailing edge carried <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> and interacting flaps. A pair of V shaped lift struts ran from the two wing spars down to the lower fuselage side where there was a universal joint to facilitate wing folding. [...] The folding mechanism was unusual: unlocked, the wings slid forward and tipped leading edge down, so that when the front spar was released from its fitting the wings could fold rearwards and downwards about the rear spar. [...] Because of the initial forward movement, the folded length was less {{than it would have been}} with conventional geometries.|$|E
2500|$|The Der Dessauer was a {{monoplane}} {{with a thick}} section, two-part, high wing, {{connected to}} the fuselage by a single, short, steep, tubular Dural lift strut from the upper fuselage longeron to the single wing spar on each side at about 15% of the span. [...] These struts were unusual in incorporating rubber shock absorbers which allowed a compression of [...] at landings, when the downward inertial forces were greatest. [...] They were rigid under lifting loads. Forward of the spar the wing was plywood skinned around the leading edge, forming a torsion resistant D-box, and behind it the wing was fabric-covered with wire defining the trailing edge. A rectangular plan centre section filled about half the span; outboard, the leading edge was slightly swept, leading to straight, oblique wing tips. [...] The trailing edges of these outer panels carried obliquely mounted <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> which broadened to the tips.|$|E

Tests were conducted at Mach numbers from 0. 25 to 0. 99 in order {{to determine the effects of}} <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> deflection and at Mach numbers of 0. 25 and 0. 50 to determine the effects of symmetrical aileron (flap) deflection. The angle of attack range for all tests varied from approximately - 12 deg to 20 deg...|$|R
50|$|A claimed {{benefit of}} the Frise aileron {{is the ability to}} {{counteract}} adverse yaw. To do so {{the leading edge of the}} aileron has to be sharp or bluntly rounded, which adds significant drag to the going up aileron and helps the aircraft to yaw (turn) in the desired direction, but adds some unpleasant, non linear effect and or potentially dangerous aerodynamic vibration (flutter). Adverse yaw moments are more efficiently countered by the use of <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> movement.|$|R
2500|$|This {{arrangement}} reduced unfavourable yawing moments due to aileron {{by making}} use of <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> movement, but avoided the change in longitudinal trim by the opposing differential of the inner flap pair. In high speed flight the nose down trim was provided mainly by the inner elevon section moving downwards, the outer flap deflecting only slightly; this {{had the advantage of}} relieving the tips of torsional loads at high speed. [...] Drag rudders, similar to airbrakes fitted in modern gliders, were fitted near the wingtips, providing yaw control similar to those used in the H.II.|$|R
50|$|IS-3:Original {{prototype}} with high-set 16 m span wings on a pod and boom fuselage, {{with two}} part <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> and non-speed-limiting airbrakes/spoilers.|$|E
50|$|IS-3a:A revised IS-3 {{with wings}} lowered to the mid {{position}} and tailboom also lowered. The IS-3a wings {{were similar to}} the plywood D-box and fabric covered aft section of the IS-3 but incorporated flaps with two part <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> and non-speed-limiting airbrakes/spoilers.|$|E
50|$|At de Havilland {{he invented}} the <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> {{used on the}} Tiger Moth and other de Havilland {{aircraft}} eventually becoming chief designer. In this role {{he was responsible for}} the designs of the DH88 Comet racer and of the Albatross and the Express airliners.|$|E
50|$|One {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of}} the Tiger Moth design is its <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> control setup. The ailerons (on the lower wing only) on a Tiger Moth are operated by an externally mounted circular bellcrank, which lies flush with the lower wing's fabric undersurface covering. This circular bellcrank is rotated by metal cables and chains from the cockpit's control columns, and has the externally mounted aileron pushrod attached at a point 45° outboard and forward of the bellcrank's centre, when the ailerons are both at their neutral position. This results in an aileron control system operating, with barely any travel down {{at all on the}} wing {{on the outside of the}} turn, while the aileron on the inside travels a large amount upwards to counteract adverse yaw.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects that}} {{deflection}} of conventional ailerons {{have on the}} lateral/directional characteristics of an oblique wing mounted {{on top of a}} body of revolution were measured. The wing had an aspect ratio of 6 (based on the unswept wing span) and was tested at various sweep angles ranging from 0 deg to 60 deg. Krueger nose flaps mounted on drooped-nose flaps were investigated on the downstream wing panel (for sweep angles of 45 deg and 60 deg) in an attempt to create more symmetrical spanwise wing stalling at high lift coefficients. The tests were conducted over a Mach number range of 0. 25 to 1. 4 and an angle-of-attack range from - 3 deg to 28 deg. With the oblique wing in the swept position, considerable difference in the aileron effectiveness was measured for positive or negative <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> deflections. With the wing swept 45 deg at a Mach number of 0. 8 and above, an extension of the span of the Krueger nose flaps on the downstream wing panel did not improve the linearity of the pitching-, rolling-, and yawing-moment curves...|$|R
40|$|A {{special class}} of {{fixed-wing}} Micro-Air-Vehicles (MAV) {{is currently being}} designed with the capability to hover vertically like a rotary-wing vehicle through a flight manoeuvre known as prop-hanging. This MAV design provides the range superiority of a fixed-wing aircraft with the hover capabilities of a rotary-wing aircraft to accomplish a variety of missions. The hover manoeuvre requires roll control of the fixed-wing aircraft through <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> deflection to maintain its orientation. A conventional aileron control system typically consists {{of a number of}} discrete components that contribute significantly to the gross weight and power consumption of the aircraft {{especially in the case of}} a MAV. Therefore, it is advantageous to use smart structure approaches with active materials to design a lightweight, robust wing for the MAV with less power requirements. The proposed smart wing structure consists of a composite spar and ailerons that have bimorph active ribs consisting of piezoceramic fiber actuators with interdigitated electrodes. Actuation is enhanced by preloading the piezoceramic fiber actuators with a compressive axial load. The preload is exerted on the actuators through a passive latex or electro active polymer (EAP) skin that wraps around the airfoil. An EAP skin would further enhance the actuation b...|$|R
50|$|IS-3c:The IS-3c was {{markedly}} different from its predecessors in having high-set 17 m span wings, skinned throughout with plywood, with three section <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> and introducing speed-limiting airbrakes.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{and wings}} are of monocoque stressed skin construction. The wings include plain flaps and <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> and are stressed to +4.4 and -2.2 g.

50|$|A revised, Standard {{competition}} class version, the WA 21 Javelot II {{made its}} first flight on 25 March 1958. This has a modified wing with a span of 15 m (49 ft 3 in) and 4° of dihedral on the outer parts though none on the constant chord centre section. The Javelot II also introduced separated pairs of <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> as well as altering the wing to fuselage connection. By mid-1960, 50 Javelots had been delivered.|$|E
40|$|A {{special class}} of {{fixed-wing}} micro-air-vehicle (MAV) {{is currently being}} designed to fly and hover to provide range superiority {{as well as being}} able to hover through a flight maneuver known as prop-hanging to accomplish a variety of surveillance missions. The hover maneuver requires roll control of the wing through <b>differential</b> <b>aileron</b> deflection but a conventional system contributes significantly to the gross weight and complexity of a MAV. Therefore, it is advantageous to use smart structure approaches with active materials to design a lightweight, robust wing for the MAV. The proposed smart wing consists of an active trailing edge flap integrated with bimorph actuators with piezoceramic fibers. Actuation is enhanced by preloading the bimorph actuators with a compressive axial load. The preload is exerted on the actuators through a passive latex or electroactive polymer (EAP) skin that wraps around the airfoil. An EAP skin would further enhance the actuation by providing an electrostatic effect of the dielectric polymer to increase the deflection. Analytical modeling as well as finite element analysis show that the proposed concept could achieve the target bi-directional deflection of 300 in typical flight conditions. Several bimorph actuators were manufactured and an experimental setup was designed to measure the static and dynamic deflections. The experimental results validated the analytical technique and finite element models, which have been further used to predict the performance of the smart wing design for a MAV. 9 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

50|$|The {{geometry}} of most aileron linkages can be configured {{so as to}} bias the travel further upward than downward. By excessively deflecting the upward aileron, profile drag is increased rather than reduced and separation drag further aids in producing drag on the inside wing, producing a yaw force {{in the direction of}} the turn. Though not as efficient as rudder mixing, <b>aileron</b> <b>differential</b> is very easy to implement on almost any airplane and offers the significant advantage of reducing the tendency for the wing to stall at the tip first by limiting the downward aileron deflection and its associated effective increase in angle of attack.|$|R
5000|$|Although entry {{techniques}} are similar, modern military fighter aircraft often tend to require yet another variation on spin recovery techniques. While power is still typically reduced to idle thrust and pitch control neutralized, opposite rudder is almost never used. Adverse yaw {{created by the}} rolling surfaces (<b>ailerons,</b> <b>differential</b> horizontal tails, etc.) of such aircraft is often more effective in arresting the spin rotation than the rudder(s), which usually become blanked by the wing and fuselage due to the geometric arrangement of fighters. Hence, the preferred recover technique has a pilot applying full roll control {{in the direction of}} the rotation (i.e., a right-hand spin requires a right stick input), generally remembered as [...] "stick into the spin". Likewise, this control application is reversed for inverted spins.|$|R
50|$|The SM.80 was a {{cantilever}} high-wing monoplane.

50|$|The {{upper and}} lower wings of the LD20b were very similar, with the same span, area and straight, near-constant chord, plan. The lower wings were {{attached}} to the lower fuselage longerons and the upper ones to cabane struts above {{the front of the}} cabin. They were arranged with considerable stagger. The wings were built around two closely spaced spars, with plywood skin from the rear spar forward forming a torsion box and fabric covering behind. <b>Differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> were mounted only on the lower wings.|$|E
50|$|Flight {{testing of}} the SZD-21 Kobuz began on 3 June 1961 with Stanisław Skrzydlewski at the controls, but the results were disappointing {{prompting}} a re-build as the SZD-21-2A, with a completely revised fuselage, landing gear, canopy and <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons.</b> Flight tests resumed on in May 1962, but serious problems with the pitch and roll stability at high speed as well as flutter in a certain speed range prompted a further round of modifications. The resulting SZD-21-2AZ (still registered as SP-1990) continued the test program until 20 April 1963, when the aircraft broke up in flight during flutter testing, killing the pilot Sławomir Makaruk.|$|E
500|$|The I-3 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. It was provided with <b>differential</b> Frise-type <b>ailerons.</b> The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers and the tailskid was made from duralumin. The main gear could be replaced by skis like those fitted to the Polikarpov R-1. The engine's semi-retractable radiator extended below the fuselage behind the rear main gear struts. Two fuel tanks were fitted, the main one in the fuselage, but a small [...] tank, mainly used to start the engine, was in the center section of the upper wing, along with the engine coolant tank. A total of [...] of fuel was carried. Initially the I-3 was fitted with two fixed [...] synchronized Vickers machine guns, but these were later replaced by PV-1 machine guns.

Designer Zbysław Ciołkosz was given the task and his design resulted in the PZL.27. In addition to Ciołkosz's design DWL (Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) started the design of a competitor, with support promised by the Ministry, hoping that their design would be superior and win orders in place of the officially sanctioned PZL.27. Two airframes were built, with one intended for static testing, the low-wing cantilever monoplane was of mixed construction with a one-piece two-spar wooden wing, tapering in chord and thickness, covered with plywood forward of the mainspar and the under sides with fabric covering the rest. Four section Handley-Page automatic slats were fitted to the entire leading edges out board of the engine nacelles and <b>differential</b> slotted <b>ailerons</b> at the trailing edges.The fuselage of the RWD-11 comprised a welded chrome-molybdenum-steel tubing structure, covered with plywood from the nose, aft to the cabin door, with fabric aft of the door to the fabric covered wooden tail-section. The cockpit had excellent visibility for the two pilots who sat side by side forward of the comfortable passenger compartment which seated six in three pairs on adjustable seats, with electric lighting, controlled ventilation and controlled heating from heat exchangers on the engine exhausts. The cabin had a cargo compartment aft of the seats and could be converted to all freight or postal duties. Two retractable main undercarriage legs were fitted with oleo-pneumatic shock-absorbers, medium pressure braked Dunlop wheels, as well as the non-retractable castoring Dowty tailwheel.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{determine}} the mathematical model between control deflec-tions and structural deflections in an F/A- 18 modified aircraft in the active aeroelastic wing programme. One future application would be the design of a flutter suppression model based on flight flutter tests. Five excited sources were provided by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center from flight flutter tests. These excitations, given by aircraft control surfaces, are: <b>differential</b> and collective <b>ailerons,</b> collective and <b>differential</b> stabilizers, and rudders. The neural network and fuzzy logic algorithms were chosen in order to identify the multi-input multi-output system for the F/A- 18 aircraft. One main contribution {{of this article is}} the mapping of fuzzy logic algorithm results into neural network data. Then, these methods were applied for the F/A- 18 model identifi-cation and validation for sixteen flight conditions expressed in terms of Mach numbers variations between 0. 85 and 1. 30 and altitudes varying between 5000 and 25 000 ft. Accurate results were obtained, expressed in terms of fit coefficients between estimated and measured signals greater than 99 per cent, which allows one to conclude that these new methodologies are very efficient for an aircraft identification and validation...|$|R

The elevators move up through 25 degrees and down through 18 degrees. An adjustable trim tab is installed on the right elevator and is controlled by a small wheel {{in the center of the}} control console.

50|$|The Balestruccio was {{a single}} seat glider with a high aspect ratio gull wing built in four parts. The two inner panels, {{straight}} edged with constant chord and carrying dihedral, joined {{on top of the}} fuselage, their extremities braced from the lower fuselage with flat steel V-struts, encased in faired wood to reduce drag and assisted on each side by a pair of jury struts. The upper end of each strut was attached on one of the two wing spars. The outer wing panels were straight tapered, with rounded tips. There were <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> on the outer trailing edges and flaps inboard.|$|E
50|$|The single engine, tandem, {{two seat}} I-12 was a {{development}} of the similarly laid out I-11, strengthened for aerobatics.

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} engine, the new Gipsy Moth {{was still a}} {{standard}} DH.60. Except for changes to accommodate the engine the fuselage remained the same as before, the exhaust still ran alongside {{the left side of}} the cockpits and the logo on the right side still read 'De Havilland Moth'. The fuel tank was still housed in the bulging airfoil that formed the centre section of the upper wing. The wings could still be folded alongside the fuselage and still had de Havilland's patented <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons</b> on the bottom mainplanes and no ailerons on the top ones.

50|$|The IS-4 {{high-performance}} glider {{followed the}} layout of the earlier IS-3d, constructed largely of wood with plywood and fabric skinning. The high-set cantilever wings with moderate dihedral (2º 30') were built with a single main spar with a plywood covered leading egdge torsion box. The ovoid section fuselage was of monocoque construction with plywood skin with a streamlined full-length cockpit canopyforward of the wings. The undercarriage consisted of a balloon main-wheel with nose and tail skids. Flying controls were largely conventional with plywood skinned fixed portions and fabric covered wooden built up movable surfaces. Pitch trim was achieved by a trim tab on the elevators and adverse yaw was alleviated through the use of <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons.</b>|$|E
50|$|By careful {{design of}} the {{mechanical}} linkages, the up aileron {{can be made to}} deflect more than the down aileron (e.g., US patent 1565097). This helps reduce the likelihood of a wing tip stall when aileron deflections are made at high angles of attack. The idea is that the loss of lift associated with the up aileron carries no penalty while the increase in lift associated with the down aileron is minimized. The rolling couple on the aircraft is always the difference in lift between the two wings. A designer at de Havilland invented a simple and practical linkage and their de Havilland Tiger Moth classic British biplane became one of the best-known aircraft, and one of the earliest, to use <b>differential</b> <b>ailerons.</b>|$|E
