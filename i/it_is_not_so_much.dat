I {{understand that there}} is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.|$|E

[...] Edgar {{occasionally}} used the alias [...] "Henri Le Rennet", a French version of his older brother's name. He was also inspired by his brother Henry's travels, often incorporating some of his stories from overseas into tellings of his own life story. The character of August Barnard in Edgar's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) seems to be inspired by Henry, especially in his travels across the sea and his drinking. Poe may have also transformed his brother's name into the title character in his poem [...] "Lenore".|$|E
500|$|The {{extensive}} use of forest roads through conifer plantations has been another criticism: {{the authors of the}} Lonely Planet guidebook, Walking in Ireland, found, [...] "The Way's one shortcoming is the character of the walking [...] you'll become all too familiar with forest tracks and roads through conifer plantations [...] where they're surrounded by tall, dense forest they're not particularly interesting". Similarly, Paul Gosling, who walked the Way for The Independent, found that, [...] "While the long distance path is, on occasion, very attractive, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> hazardous as unadventurous. [...] Over the next four and a half days, we lost our enthusiasm for conifers [...] The views were restricted and there was little sign of wildlife". In The Irish Times John G. O'Dwyer described them as [...] "gloomy trails through invading armies of monoculture [...] as memorable as a motorway median".|$|E

2500|$|This {{interpretation}} (and {{the criticism}} of Wittgenstein that arises from it) {{is based on a}} complete misreading, however, because Wittgenstein's argument {{has nothing to do with}} the fallibility of human memory, but rather concerns the intelligibility of remembering something for which there is no external criterion of correctness. It is not that we will not in fact remember the sensation correctly, but rather that it makes no sense to talk of our memory being either correct or incorrect in this case. The point, as Diego Marconi puts <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that private language is [...] "a game at which we can't win, it is a game we can't lose".|$|E

[...] Similar sexual sociologies are reported for other Muslim societies from North Africa to Pakistan and the Far East. In Afghanistan in 2009, the British Army was forced to commission a report into the sexuality of the local men after British soldiers reported the discomfort at witnessing adult males involved in sexual relations with boys. The report stated that though illegal, there was a tradition of such relationships in the country, known as bache bazi or [...] "boy play", and that it was especially strong around North Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|Du Bois {{observed}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> [...] "race" [...] {{that we think}} about, but culture: [...] "...a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life". Late 19th century nationalists {{were the first to}} embrace contemporary discourses on [...] "race", ethnicity, and [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] to shape new nationalist doctrines. Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation. According to this view, culture is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of Nordicism, the denomination [...] "Germanic" [...] was equivalent to superiority of race.|$|E

2500|$|Bosley Crowther of the New York Times {{called the}} film [...] "a big musical shenanigan and {{theatrical}} tour-de-force" [...] and added, [...] "In essence, it is a poignant story. It {{was in the}} opera of Bizet, {{and it is in}} the rich nostalgic folklore of the American Negro in the South. But here <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> poignant as it is lurid and lightly farcical, with the Negro characters presented by Mr. Preminger as serio-comic devotees of sex [...] [...] [...] The incongruity is pointed when these people break into song to the wholly surprising and unnatural aria airs from Bizet's opera. The tempos are alien to their spirits, the melodies are foreign to their moods, but they have at those classical numbers as though they were cutting rugs. And whatever illusions and exaltations the musical eloquence might remotely inspire are doused by the realistic settings in which Mr. Preminger has played his film [...] [...] [...] There is nothing wrong with the music — except that it does not fit the people or the words. But that did not seem to make much difference to Mr. Hammerstein or Mr. Preminger. They were carried away by their precocity. The present consequence is a crazy mixed-up film." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} Titus Andronicus is fictional, not {{historical}}, unlike Shakespeare's other Roman plays, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus, {{all of which}} are based on real historical events and people. Even the time in which Titus is set may not be based on a real historical period. According to the prose version of the play (see below), the events are [...] "set in the time of Theodosius", who ruled from 379 to 395. On the other hand, the general setting appears to be what Clifford Huffman describes as [...] "late-Imperial Christian Rome", possibly during the reign of Justinian I (527–565). Also favouring a later date, Grace Starry West argues, [...] "the Rome of Titus Andronicus is Rome after Brutus, after Caesar, and after Ovid. We know it is a later Rome because the emperor is routinely called Caesar; because the characters are constantly alluding to Tarquin, Lucretia, and Brutus, suggesting that they learned about Brutus' new founding of Rome from the same literary sources we do, Livy and Plutarch." [...] Others are less certain of a specific setting, however. For example, Jonathan Bate has pointed out that the play begins with Titus returning from a successful ten-year campaign against the Goths, as if {{at the height of the}} Roman Empire, but ends with Goths invading Rome, as if at its death. Similarly, T. J. B. Spencer argues that [...] "the play does not assume a political situation known to Roman history; it is, rather a summary of Roman politics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that any particular set of political institutions is assumed in Titus, but rather that it includes all the political institutions that Rome ever had." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 1960s and 1970s, the {{reception}} of the poem was mixed but remained overall positive. Mary Moorman analysed the poem in 1965 {{with an emphasis on}} its biographical origins and Wordsworth's philosophy on the relationship between mankind and nature. When describing the beauty of the poem, she stated, [...] "Wordsworth once spoke of the Ode as 'this famous, ambitious and occasionally magnificent poem'. Yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> its magnificence that impresses, as the sense of resplendent yet peaceful light in which it is bathed—whether it is the 'celestial light' and 'glory' of the first stanza, or the 'innocent Brightness of a new-born Day' of the last." [...] In 1967, Yvor Winters criticised the poem and claimed that [...] "Wordsworth gives us bad oratory about his own clumsy emotions and a landscape that he has never fully realized." [...] Geoffrey Durrant, in his 1970 analysis of the critical reception of the ode, claimed, [...] "it may be remarked that both the admirers of the Ode, and those who think less well of it, tend to agree that it is unrepresentative, and that its enthusiastic, Dionysian, and mystical vein sets it apart, either on a lonely summit or in a special limbo, from the rest of Wordsworth's work. And the praise that it has received is at times curiously equivocal." [...] In 1975, Richard Brantley, labelling the poem as the [...] "great Ode", claimed that [...] "Wordsworth's task of tracing spiritual maturity, his account of a grace quite as amazing and perhaps even as Christian as the experience recorded in the spiritual autobiography of his day, is therefore essentially completed". He continued by using the ode as evidence that the [...] "poetic record of his remaining life gives little evidence of temptations or errors as unsettling as the ones he faced and made in France." [...] Summarizing the way critics have approached the poem, John Beer claimed in 1978 that the poem [...] "is commonly regarded as the greatest of his shorter works". Additionally, Beer argued that the ode was the basis for the concepts found in Wordsworth's later poetry.|$|E
