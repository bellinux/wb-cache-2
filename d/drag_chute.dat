25|$|On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, {{an attempt}} was mounted to {{intercept}} two Cuban FAR MiG-23MLs. Captain Arthur Piercy's F1CZ was damaged by either an AA-7 Apex or AA-8 Aphid AAM fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft's <b>drag</b> <b>chute</b> and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy {{was able to}} recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy's ejection seat to fire; he failed to separate from the seat and suffered major spinal injuries.|$|E
500|$|The F-16 has a cropped-delta wing {{incorporating}} wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung {{air intake}} (with splitter plate) {{to the single}} turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal [...] "stabilator" [...] tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip. There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece [...] "bubble" [...] canopy of the cockpit. Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage. A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a <b>drag</b> <b>chute.</b> Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage's [...] "spine", housing additional equipment or fuel.|$|E

50|$|In 1955, the Air Force {{selected}} the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak as their second aircraft. The Thunderstreak was modified {{for the team}} by adding smoke tanks for the first time, and red, white, and blue <b>drag</b> <b>chutes.</b> In addition, the extreme heat from the lead aircraft, , required moving the slot's radio antenna from the jet's fin. For the first time, a solo {{was added to the}} diamond displays, increasing the show time to 19 minutes.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Simpson Performance Products, Bill Simpson {{realized}} that he still had much to contribute to improving driver safety. After a one-year non-compete with Simpson Performance Products expired, he started Impact! Racing in 2002. In addition to the <b>drag</b> <b>chutes</b> and Nomex underwear that Bill Simpson first introduced to racing, Impact! also manufacturers restraints, helmets, race suits, shoes, and gloves for drag racing, NASCAR, Indycar, and other racing applications. In 2010, Bill Simpson sold Impact! Racing to Robbie Pierce and MasterCraft Safety.|$|R
2500|$|Another unique {{external}} feature, {{termed the}} [...] "SILTS" [...] pod, was {{located on the}} top of Columbia's vertical stabilizer, and was installed after STS-9 to acquire infrared and other thermal data. Though the pod's equipment was removed after initial tests, NASA decided to leave it in place, mainly to save costs, along with the agency's plans to use it for future experiments. The vertical stabilizer was later modified to incorporate the <b>drag</b> <b>chute</b> first used on Endeavour in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|The 604 is {{constructed}} from fibreglass. The wing employs a modified Wortmann FX 67-K-170 airfoil at the wing root, changing to a Wortmann FX 67-K-150 at the wing tip. The wing features six flaps, with the outer pair {{moving at a}} 2:1 differential ratio with the ailerons. For glidepath control the 604 has wing top-surface spoilers and a tail-mounted <b>drag</b> <b>chute.</b> The aircraft can carry [...] of water ballast.

50|$|Simpson's uncle owned a {{military}} surplus store, {{and suggested that}} he use a cross-form parachute {{to slow down the}} drag car. Simpson rented a sewing machine to create a prototype. Simpson got together with his friend dragster driver Mike Sorokin to test the prototype. They tested it by attaching it to a tow hitch, and dumping it {{from the back of the}} Chevy wagon while Sorokin drove down a street at 100 mph. The chute was too big for the car, and the car went airborne and crashed into a tree nursery. Both racers were jailed for the incident, but Simpson <b>Drag</b> <b>Chutes</b> was founded.|$|R
50|$|The first X-40 {{drop test}} {{occurred}} at Holloman AFB, New Mexico on August 11, 1998 at 06:59. This was a joint Air Force/Boeing project known as Space Maneuver Vehicle. It {{was released from}} an altitude of approximately 9200 ft and 2.5 mi away {{from the end of}} Runway 04 by a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter (later tests used the CH-47 Chinook helicopter). The vehicle dove to the runway in an approach similar to the space shuttle's, flared, and landed left of the runway centerline. Its <b>drag</b> <b>chutes</b> successfully deployed, and the vehicle tracked to within seven feet of the centerline and stopped at a distance of slightly more than 7000 ft.|$|R
50|$|The minimal {{ejection}} altitude for ACES II seat in inverted {{flight is}} about 140 ft {{above ground level}} at 150 KIAS, while the Russian counterpart - K-36DM has the minimal ejection altitude from inverted flight of 100 ft AGL.When an aircraft is equipped with the NPP Zvezda K-36DM ejection seat and the pilot is wearing the КО-15 protective gear, {{he is able to}} eject at airspeeds from 0 to 1400 km/h and altitudes of 0 to 25 km (16 mi or about 82,000 ft). The K-36DM ejection seat features <b>drag</b> <b>chutes</b> and a small shield that rises between the pilot's legs to deflect air around the pilot.|$|R

2500|$|Norway {{participates in}} the F-35 program as a Level 3 partner in the system {{development}} and demonstration phase, {{with a view to}} enabling its industry to compete for industrial opportunities. Norwegian National Deputy Rune Fagerli, the country's sole representative on the Joint Strike Fighter program, told SPACE.com that the Norwegian Royal Ministry of Defence has pledged $125 million in preparation to replace a fleet of F-16 jets that have about 12 years left of operation. [...] "By getting involved here on the ground level, we can try and address the needs of Norway into this capable fighter early," [...] said Fagerli, a colonel. For example, Norwegian F-16s are fitted with <b>drag</b> <b>chutes</b> because of wet, slippery runways. Likewise, international cooperation to aircraft development could also yield aircraft from cooperating nations that fit well together during combat. Fagerli also mentioned that Norwegian pilots currently fly missions over Afghanistan in F-16s alongside Danish and Dutch aviators.|$|R
5000|$|A Hawk hit {{the ground}} at RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, while practising a loop. The pilot, Flt Lt Chris Hurst, {{suffered}} serious injuries when the impact with the ground forced the ejection seat through the canopy and deployed the <b>chute,</b> <b>dragging</b> him out.|$|R

50|$|A <b>drag</b> <b>chute</b> is fitted as {{optional}} equipment on some Learjet 25 aircraft. The chute offers an addition safety margin, since it will {{significantly reduce the}} stopping distance. The <b>drag</b> <b>chute</b> {{is attached to the}} aircraft with a lanyard system that releases it from the aircraft should an inadvertent deployment be made while airborne. The lanyard is attached to the aircraft at the forward end of the tailcone access door opening. This point is near the aircraft centre of gravity and minimizes weathervaning when the chute is deployed under crosswind conditions. The <b>drag</b> <b>chute</b> has been deployed in a crosswind of up to 20 knots under actual test conditions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>drag</b> <b>chute</b> door {{detached}} {{and fell}} from the orbiter at main engine ignition.

5000|$|The Drop Test Article (DTA), {{also known}} as the Drop Test Vehicle (DTV) is {{undergoing}} test drops at the US Army's Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. The mock Orion parachute compartment is dropped from an altitude of 25,000 feet from a C-130. Testing began in 2007. Drogue chutes deploy around 20,000 and 15,000 feet. Testing of the reefing staged parachutes includes partial failure instances including partial opening and complete failure of one of the three main parachutes. With only two chutes deployed the DTA lands at 33 feet per second, the maximum touchdown speed for Orion's design. Other related test vehicles include the now-defunct Orion Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV) and its replacement the Generation II Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV2). The drop test program has had several failures in 2007, 2008, and 2010. The new PTV was successfully tested February 29, 2012 deploying from a C-17. Ten <b>drag</b> <b>chutes</b> will <b>drag</b> the mockup's pallet from the aircraft for the drop at 25,000 feet. The landing parachute set of eight is known as the Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS). The test examined air flow disturbance behind the mimicked full size vehicle and its effects on the parachute system. The PTV landed on the desert floor at 17 mph. A third test vehicle, the PCDTV3, was successfully tested in a drop on April 17, 2012. “The test examined how Orion’s wake, the disturbance of the air flow behind the vehicle, would affect the performance of the parachute system” ...|$|R
5000|$|A related {{problem was}} that the aircraft's engines would have to be {{throttled}} down on landing approach. Since it could take as long as 20 seconds to throttle them back up to full power, the big bomber could not easily do a [...] "touch and go" [...] momentary landing. A 16-foot [...] "approach chute" [...] (drogue parachute) provided aerodynamic drag so that the aircraft could be flown at approach speeds with the engines throttled at ready-to-spool-up medium power. On the ground, the pilots used the 32-foot [...] "brake chute". The brake chute could be deployed to stop the aircraft from [...] "porpoising", or bouncing, after a hard landing on the front nose gear. Training typically included an hour of <b>dragging</b> this <b>chute</b> around the landing pattern for multiple practice landings.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of smaller higher {{performance}} canopies, the drag induced by trailing a pilot chute behind a canopy has become a significant concern. To reduce this <b>drag</b> some pilot <b>chute</b> designs of the Pull-out and Throw-out variety are collapsible. Once deployment of the parachute has occurred a kill line running up {{the center of the}} pilot chute bridle becomes loaded. This kill line pulls down on the apex of the pilot chute collapsing it and greatly reducing its drag on the canopy.|$|R

40|$|Many {{industrial}} chute {{applications are}} characterised by rapid flow {{conditions in which}} the bulk solid stream thickness or depth {{is less than the}} chute width. Under these conditions, it is possible to describe the stream flow by means of a lumped parameter model which takes into account the frictional <b>drag</b> around the <b>chute</b> boundaries as well as making allowance for inter-particle friction. Equations of motion to describe the chute flow are presented and their application to the determination of chute profiles to achieve optimum flow is illustrated. By means of design examples, the problems associated with the feeding of bulk solids onto belt conveyors and conveyor transfers are discussed. Criteria for the selection of the most appropriate chute geometry to minimise chute wear and belt wear at the feed point are presented. The determination of optimum chute profiles to achieve specified performance criteria is outlined...|$|R
5000|$|Historical {{accounts}} {{report that}} all the Zefir versions required superior piloting abilities but the modern restoration aircraft {{is reported to be}} docile. Until Zefir 4 they had no airbrakes (spoilers) which had caused multiple landing incidents. A chute (except Zefir 4) was used for braking, from 2B version the pilot could adjust the <b>chute</b> <b>drag.</b> The forward visibility was considered poor. Similarly, the controls required substantial force, were causing strain for the pilots and in general their ergonomics was not optimal. All these inconveniences were the result of the design striving to squeeze every possible bit of performance (hence i.e. narrow cockpit with uncomfortably prone pilot position), handling comfort was considered second. One of the test pilots (Jan Gawęcki) [...] recalls that the introduction of airbrakes in the Zefir 4 model was welcomed by the pilots, despite their dreadful influence (L/D down to 34 from 43+) on glider performance. Also, Zefir 3 had substantial horizontal stabilizer flatter issues.|$|R
50|$|The SZD-19 {{was totally}} re-designed with all-wooden wings, revised {{fuselage}} and tail section, and towing hook relocated to the retractable undercarriage chassis, {{designated as the}} SZD-19-2 Zefir 2, first flying on 11 March 1960, showing a marked improvement over the Zefir. Two prototypes of the Zefir 2 were built, flying in the 1960 World Championships at Köln in Germany to gain second, piloted by Edward Makula, and third, piloted by Jerzy Popiel, places in the Open class.With significant success in the World Championships, the SZD-19-2 was refined with new stabilisers and landing gear to become the SZD-19-2 Zefir 2A, flying {{for the first time}} in 1962, in time for the 1963 World Championships, held in Argentina, where Makula and Popiel took first and second places. As a result of these successes, demand for the SZD-19-2 was significant with 14 units built, most being sold to other countries, (according to some sources, 20 SZD-19-2A units were constructed.). From the beginning until (and including) Zefir 3 these gliders did not have spoilers (airbrakes) - a tail chute was used. The <b>chute</b> <b>drag</b> could be controlled by the pilot (in versions 2B and 3).Several records were established by the Zefir 2A/B's, including; a flight distance of 714 km and a 100 km closed triangle speed record of 102 km/h (63.4 mph).|$|R
