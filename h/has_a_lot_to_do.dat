25|$|In the NFC Championship Game, Cutler {{completed}} 6-of-14passes for 80yards and an interception, {{before a}} knee injury sidelined him early {{in the third quarter}} of a 21–14 loss to Green Bay. The Bears did not make an immediate announcement about Cutler's condition, allowing speculation to grow. In possibly the NFL’s first player-on-player social media attack, Cutler was being criticized seconds after the injury by Maurice Jones-Drew, Darnell Dockett, Deion Sanders, and Mark Schlereth. Bears coach Lovie Smith later clarified that he, and not Cutler, made the decision after consulting the medical and training staff. The following day, an MRI revealed Cutler had sprained his MCL. Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman commented that the widespread reaction reflected hostility towards Cutler's career-long polarizing attitude. Bears teammates defended Cutler, and his critics themselves became the targets of insults from other players, including Packers Aaron Rodgers ("disrespectful"), LeRoy Butler ("stupid"), and B. J. Raji ("pretty wrong and a lot times it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with jealousy").|$|E
25|$|The EGC is {{composed}} of a mixture of three distinct water masses. The water masses are Polar Water, Atlantic Water, and Deep Water. These water masses can be clearly seen throughout the EGC's tract southward, however, the upper layer water masses do change some due to atmospheric interaction along with inflow from other water sources in the Nordic Seas. The top 150 meters of the EGC is considered polar water and it is cold and low in salinity. The lowness in salinity <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with freshwater run off from sea ice melting, river runoff, and Pacific water flux and it is cold due to air-sea interactions while in the Arctic. Typical characteristics for the EGC Polar water are a temperature between 0°C and –1.7°C (e.g. freezing point of low-salinity sea water), and the salinity varies greatly from 30 psu (near the surface) to 34 psu at a 150-meter depth. The layer beneath the Polar Water {{is known as the}} Atlantic Water layer. It extends down to about 1000 m. This layer is defined as having relatively warm temperatures and saline waters. The temperatures are normally above 0°C and have a salinity of 34 psu at 150 meters and it increases to about 35 psu at 1000 meters. The Atlantic water that is seen in the EGC comes from two different sources. The first source of Atlantic Water originates from westward directed Atlantic water in the West Spitsbergen Current. This current sends Atlantic water (AW) into the Fram Strait, and because it is more dense then the surface Polar water it sinks to an intermediate depth. The second source of AW in the EGC originates from recirculated AW in the Arctic. This is AW that has entered the Arctic via the North Atlantic and has been circulating in the Arctic and is now being pushed out of the Arctic via the EGC. The layer beneath the Atlantic Water is simply referred to as the Deep Water where the salinity and temperatures are relatively constant. This level typically extends from 1000 meters {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. The temperatures in this bottom level are normally below 0°C and the salinity is around 34.9 psu.|$|E

500|$|Brand New's second studio {{album was}} written in [...] "the year and-a-half or two years" [...] that they were touring the {{material}} off Your Favorite Weapon. According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different things than 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it."

He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E

Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used {{with the permission of}} NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason that we went with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule.

500|$|Sire Records had marketed the [...] "Everybody" [...] single as if Madonna {{was a black}} artist. This {{misconception}} {{was cleared}} by {{the release of the}} music video for the song. Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, [...] "If I didn't have a video, I don't think all the kids in the Midwest would know about me. It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees them everywhere. That really <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the success of my album." [...] She invited Sire Records executives, including Stein and Rosenblatt, to the New York nightclub Danceteria. She performed [...] "Everybody" [...] on the dancefloor, wearing a top hat and tails. On the night of the performance, Madonna's friend Haoui Montaug introduced her to the 300 strong audience. Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.' Seeing the performance, they also realised that Madonna appeared visually stunning. They ordered an in-house video of [...] "Everybody" [...] to be sent to the clubs around the country which used dance videos.|$|E

I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking {{back and forth between the}} two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

Natalie really adored her dad but he couldn't {{put up with that}} horrible wife of his, Andrea… and so he walked out on the family. Andrea is a total nightmare control freak, and it says a lot about who Natalie is, why she had no confidence in herself. Her mother probably emotionally abused her. So Barry represented safety and a secure family environment…She feels safe with him and she felt she made the right choice at the time, although of course she was apprehensive about it.” ...|$|E

The problems [...] "faced by the Maya are extraordinarily similar to those faced today by our own civilization," [...] co-writer Safinia stated during production, [...] "especially {{when it comes to}} widespread environmental degradation, excessive consumption and political corruption".
