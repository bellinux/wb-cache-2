2500|$|In each episode, Penn and Teller debunk {{a chosen}} {{misconception}} such as cryptozoology, debate a controversial topic like gun control, or [...] "expose the truths" [...] {{of an organization}} like PETA. Sometimes their objective is not to completely dismiss the topic at hand but to decry {{certain aspects of the}} topic that they believe to be pernicious, misleading, unnecessary, or overemphasized. For example, in the case of college they argue that while college <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>place</b> to learn, drink beer or train for a career, the concept of diversity is bullshit when used as an excuse to restrict free speech or selectively recruit to fill quotas. Or that [...] "the casual asshole, or just plain dickhead, might do well in an anger management program" [...] but teaching people they can relieve anger through attacking or screaming at inanimate objects is bullshit, since this [...] "venting" [...] (as it's called in the industry) by an angry person in a social situation will lead to violence.|$|E

2500|$|Use of {{the label}} came under {{vigorous}} renewed criticism during {{the run-up to the}} 2017 Summer Universiade, hosted in Taiwan. Changing demographics and opinions in the country mean that more than 80% of citizens now see themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese whereas in 1991 this figure was only 13.6%. This radical upswell in Taiwanese national identity has seen a re-appraisal and removal of [...] "sinocentric" [...] labels and figures established by the KMT regime during the period of Martial Law. Moved by a desire to use the country's own national flag and anthem this has included ridiculing the term [...] "Chinese Taipei" [...] not only in the national and international press but by Taiwanese legislators; New Power Party (NPP) Executive Chairman Huang Kuo-chang in particular lambasted the English-language guide to the Universiade for its [...] "absurd" [...] use {{of the label}}, illustrating this with statements extracted from the guide rendered nonsensical by their author's insistence on completely avoiding the name [...] "Taiwan" [...] not only when referring to the label under which Taiwanese athletes compete, but even when referring to geographical features such as the island of Taiwan itself.

Nearly all the best pine-wood comes down the Ottawa and its tributaries.

The timber from the Ottawa and St. Maurice finds its way down the St. Lawrence to Quebec, where, however, it loses the whole of its picturesque character. The Saguenay and the Madawaska fall into the St. Lawrence below Quebec.|$|E

60|$|Besides {{its other}} useful and {{manifold}} purposes, the Gulf Stream {{would seem to}} be one of the great purveyors of food to the whales. Sea-nettles, or medusae, are well known to constitute the principal food of that species of whale which is termed the right whale. Navigators have frequently observed large quantities of these medusae floating along with the Gulf Stream; and one sea captain in particular fell in with an extraordinarily large quantity of them, of a very peculiar species, off the coast of Florida. As we have said, no whales ever enter the warm waters of the Gulf Stream; therefore, at that time at least, the leviathan could not avail himself of this rich provision. The captain referred to was bound for England. On his return voyage he fell in with the same mass of medusae off the Western Islands, and was three or four days in sailing through them. Now, the Western Islands <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>place</b> of resort for the whale, and thither had the Gulf Stream been commissioned to convey immense quantities of its peculiar food.|$|E
