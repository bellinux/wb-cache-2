5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold.

40|$|SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Hereditary factors {{account for}} {{approximately}} 50 % {{of the risk}} of developing alcohol dependence. Genes that affect the dopamine function in the brain have been extensively studied as candidate genes. AIM: To present the results of recent Dutch studies on the interaction between genes and their environment in relation to dopamine function and <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use.</b> METHOD: Two large scale research projects were recently carried out in order to study the relation between dopamine genes and <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use</b> in the Netherlands. The first study investigated <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use</b> among adolescents. The second studied alcohol dependence among adult males. RESULTS: Genes that affect the dopamine function in the brain were not directly linked to <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use</b> or dependence. Dopamine genes, however, do influence sensitivity to environmental risk factors for <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use.</b> CONCLUSION: These studies show that genetically determined dopamine function increases the risk of <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use</b> {{in the context of an}} adverse environment. Traumatic experiences and parenting style were both shown to be important environmental factors...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between substance use and central aspects of bipolar disorder (BD); the development or onset of the disorder, the clinical and functional characteristics, and the initiation of adequate treatment. The prevalence of substance use disorders (abuse or dependence) among patients with BD are generally high, but also vary widely. Furthermore, to what degree and in which outcome areas substance use disorders {{have a negative impact on}} the BD is still unclear, and little is known about the role of <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> that does not meet diagnostic criteria. Thus, the first aim was to investigate lifetime rates of illicit substance use in BD relative to the normal population, and if there are differences in clinical and functional features between BD patients with and without <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use.</b> The rate of lifetime illicit substance use was found to be significantly higher among the 125 BD patients compared to the 327 persons randomly drawn from the population. BD patients with <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> (45 % of total) had poorer educational level, occupational status, GAF-scores and medication compliance, with a trend towards higher suicidality rates, compared to patients without. There were no significant differences between BD patients with or without <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> in current symptom levels or disease course. Recently, there has been increasing focus on the age at onset of BD. Variation in age at onset has been associated with several factors, including substance abuse. However, the relationship between age at onset, type of substance use and sequencing of the onsets of BD and <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> calls for further investigation. The second aim was to investigate which factors are associated with age at onset in BD with a specific focus on excessive alcohol and cannabis use, and the sequence of the onsets of <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> and BD. Among the 151 BD patients investigated, patients with <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>use</b> had a significantly later onset compared to patients with <b>excessive</b> cannabis <b>use.</b> <b>Excessive</b> general substance <b>use</b> prior to BD onset was associated with a later onset. <b>Excessive</b> cannabis <b>use</b> was associated with an earlier onset whether it preceded or followed BD onset, also after adjusting for possible confounders such as a family history of psychotic/affective disorders or use of alcohol or other illicit substances. Research has shown that the delay between the onset of BD and adequate treatment is long. How this delay is related to <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> is sparsely investigated, but previous research indicates that it may both delay and expedite treatment initiation. When patients experience long delays from onset of the BD until treatment initiation, this may also increase the risk of <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> as an attempt to self-medicate increasing symptoms. The third aim was to investigate whether <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> before illness onset is associated with increased or reduced treatment delay, and whether long treatment delays are associated with increased risk for subsequent <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use.</b> Among the 151 BD patients investigated, the risk of a long treatment delay (> 2 years from first elevated episode to adequate pharmacological treatment) was reduced when <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> was present before the onset of the BD. In patients with no <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> prior to the onset of the BD, the risk for subsequently developing <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> was increased with longer treatment delays after controling for possible confounders such as gender and educational level. The conclusions of the current thesis were that patients with BD are at greater risk for lifetime use of illicit substances than the normal population and that BD patients with <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> clearly have impaired functioning, but not a worse course of illness compared to patients without <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use.</b> Furthermore, finding that alcohol use was associated with a later onset compared to cannabis use suggests different relationships between these substances and the onset of BD. The association between <b>excessive</b> cannabis <b>use</b> and an earlier BD onset indicates that an early onset may increase the risk of cannabis use and that cannabis use may trigger BD in vulnerable individuals. Lastly, since excessive substance prior to BD onset was associated with a reduced risk for long treatment delays, it does not appear to be an obstacle for initiating treatment for BD. The finding that the risk for developing <b>excessive</b> substance <b>use</b> after BD onset increased with longer treatment delays is in line with the self-medication hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Excessive</b> {{internet}} <b>use</b> and its problematic outcomes is {{a growing}} focus of research, receiving attention from academics, journalists, health workers, policymakers and the public. However, surprisingly little has yet been accomplished in terms of understanding the causes and consequences of this phenomenon. I argue that {{this is due to}} the framing of <b>excessive</b> internet <b>use</b> as an addiction, which leads researchers to neglect people’s reasons and motivations for <b>excessive</b> internet <b>use.</b> The perspective taken in this thesis is that <b>excessive</b> internet <b>use</b> may help people to cope with difficult life situations. This explains why people keep using the internet excessively despite problematic outcomes: the overall experience is positive because worse problems are alleviated. Based on the relationship between a person’s well-being, which is the focal point of literature on <b>excessive</b> internet <b>use,</b> and the motivations for media use grounded in uses and gratifications research, this thesis proposes a combined framework to examine if <b>excessive</b> internet <b>use</b> may be explained as a coping strategy taken to excess. This question was asked in relation to three online activities: World of Warcraft; Facebook; and online poker. Each group was surveyed about their psychosocial well-being, motivations for internet use, and any problematic outcomes. Findings showed that interactions between motivations for use and psychosocial well-being were important explanatory factors for problematic outcomes. Respondents with low self-esteem or high stress experienced more problematic outcomes when gaming or gambling to escape negative feelings, while escapist use was less problematic for players with high self-esteem or low stress. This has implications for how society needs to respond to cases of <b>excessive</b> internet <b>use,</b> since such behaviour can be both helpful and harmful. Future studies may usefully move beyond theories of addiction and consider <b>excessive</b> internet <b>use</b> as a coping behaviour that has both positive and negative outcomes...|$|R

5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant.

Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for <b>excessive</b> <b>use</b> of violence.

5|$|From the {{founding}} of modern Singapore in 1819 until 1826, Singapore was headed by two Residents in succession. Following Singapore's amalgamation into the Straits Settlements in 1826, it was governed by a Governor together with a Legislative Council. An Executive Council of the Straits Settlements was introduced in 1877 to advise the Governor but wielded no executive power. In 1955, a Council of Ministers was created, appointed by the Governor {{on the recommendation of}} the Leader of the House. Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the Colonial Office were held from 1956 to 1958, and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959. The Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963, and subsequent independence in 1965. The PAP has been returned to power in every general election and has thus formed the Cabinet since 1959. The Government is generally perceived to be competent in managing the country's economy and largely free from political corruption.

Moreover, research indicates individuals play computer games excessively to cope with everyday stressors and to regulate their emotions by applying media-focused coping strategies, suggesting pathological computer game players play in order to relieve stress and to avoid daily hassles.

Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed in order to examine the associations between alcohol use and problematic Internet, use such as Internet addiction (Young Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction ≥ 5) and <b>excessive</b> Internet <b>use</b> (≥ 5 h/day). Results: The results of multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that the adjusted odds ratios for Internet addiction (YDQ ≥ 5) and <b>excessive</b> Internet <b>use</b> (≥ 5 h/day) became higher as the number of days in which alcohol had been consumed during the previous 30 days increased.
