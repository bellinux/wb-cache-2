25|$|Other {{potential}} and threatening diseases include rabbit <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> in New Zealand and flystrike. Although strike {{is not limited}} to blow flies, these maggots are a major source of this skin invasion, causing lesions, which, if severe enough, may be lethal. Strike starts when blow flies lay eggs in a wound or fecal material present on the sheep. When the maggots hatch, they begin feeding on the sheep and thus irritating it. As soon as the first wave of maggots hatch, they attract more blow flies, causing the strike. Insecticides are available for blow fly prevention, and precautionary measures may be taken, such as docking tails, shearing, and keeping the sheep healthy overall.|$|E

During the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014, there were major issues surrounding hidden corpses. Non-native response teams responding to an outbreak frequently reported funerals and burials as being genuine sites of Ebola amplification. There were also major issues surrounding the transmission of Ebola by scarification or other methods used by healers.|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the long term}} outcomes after conservative and surgical treatment for <b>haemorrhagic</b> moyamoya <b>disease.</b> Methods 97 consecutive patients with <b>haemorrhagic</b> moyamoya <b>disease</b> from 1997 to 2009 were enrolled in this study (mean age 31610 years; range 5 e 56 years). We reviewed the clinical charts and radiographs of patients at the first bleeding episode. Follow-up was obtained prospectively by questionnaires and radiographic examinations. Outcomes were compared based on initial treatment (conservative vs surgical). Results After a median follow-up of 7. 1 years, 21 of the 97 (21. 7 %) patients developed a second episode of bleeding, and six patients (6. 2 %) died of intracranial rebleeding. The median interval from initial episode to subsequent rebleeding was 9. 1 years (0. 1 e 23. 2 years). 17 of 43 (37. 1 %) conservatively treated patients and four of 54 (7. 4 %) surgically treated patients experienced a rebleeding event (OR 8. 1; 95 % CI 2. 4 to 26. 8; p 0. 05). Conclusions There is {{a high risk of}} rebleeding after the first haemorrhagic episode in Chinese patients with <b>haemorrhagic</b> moyamoya <b>disease.</b> Revascularisation surgery can improve regional blood flow and have greater efficacy at preventing rebleeding than conservative treatment...|$|R
2500|$|Twenty-four European rabbits were {{introduced}} to Australia in 1859 by estate owner Thomas Austin in Victoria. They soon spread throughout the country {{due to the lack}} of natural predators, widespread farming producing an ideal habitat, and mild Australian winters allowing them to breed year-round. Australia's equivalent to the rabbit, the bilby, was quickly pushed out by the rabbits. The bilbies are endangered, but are now making a comeback due to government protection. Between 1901 and 1907, Australia built an immense [...] "rabbit-proof fence" [...] to halt the westward expansion of the introduced rabbit population. The European rabbit can not only jump very high, but also burrow underground, making fencing essentially futile. During the 1950s, experiments with introduction of a virus, Myxomatosis cuniiculi, provided some relief in Australia, but not in New Zealand, where the insect vectors necessary for spread of the disease were not present. Myxomatosis can also infect pet rabbits of the same species. Today's remaining wild rabbits in Australia are largely immune to myxomatosis. The rabbit <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> virus has been cleared as a biological control agent against the European rabbit in Australia, and has already killed millions of the animals. It was also illegally introduced in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the western}} Mediterranean region, the Eurasian Eagle-Owl is {{something}} of a specialist on a single prey species: the European rabbit. The rabbit historically reached extremely high densities in Iberian scrub, i.e. more than 40 per every 1 square hectare (2471 square acres). In central Spain, up to 73.1% of the prey that were recorded for Eurasian eagle-owls, by number, can be rabbits. Where still available, they are also the main prey in Portugal and central France. However, following the devastation of the wild rabbit due to rabbit <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>disease,</b> the local eagle-owls have frequently had to adapt to other, often smaller, prey. On the other hand, given the now much reduced numbers of rabbits, the eagle-owls still regularly select rabbits, seemingly out of proportion to their commonality. Although large mature wild rabbits commonly weigh , the eagle-owls usually hunt smaller specimens, often with an average weight around , with young rabbits usually selected in spring and summer and subadults selected in the autumn and winter. This is largely due to the behaviour of rabbits, with younger rabbits being forced to distribute following weaning, being less cautious in behaviour and occupying less primary habitat, thus being forced out of the confines of their burrows more regularly than mature adults. However, the estimated average weight of rabbits taken can be variable, reported from as little as [...] in a study from Spain to as much as [...] in the Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|In the Iberian peninsula, the Eurasian eagle-owl {{is part of}} {{a complex}} guild of predators that have evolved to survive mostly on European rabbits. Among this guild, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were {{recorded}} per one study to rely on rabbits for 40% of the diet, the eagle-owl for 49% of the diet, the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) for 50% of the diet, the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) [...] for 61% of the diet and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) for 79% of the diet. Elsewhere, the Spanish imperial eagle and eagle-owl are considered to outflank the golden and even the Bonelliâ€™s eagle as the most specialized avian predator of rabbits in the Iberian region. Other predators, such as common buzzard (Buteo buteo), [...] northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) black kite (Milvus migrans) Iberian wildcat (Felis silvestris tartessia), red fox, stone marten (Martes foina) and introduced Egyptian mongoose also prey heavily on rabbits in Spain, but are more generalized and less reliant than the above predators. All these powerful predators do not generally compete directly for food but conflicts may ensue over the rights to territories and nesting sites amongst the birds. Being nocturnal in activity, however, the Eurasian eagle-owl does not tend to compete as directly as do the three eagle species and even these are discreetly segregated by habitat preferences, the goldens preferring open, steep cliffs, the Bonelli's favoring densely vegetated areas mixed with rocky spots and the imperial favoring relatively flat open woodlands. Among these eagles, the golden eagle tends to have the most similar habitat preferences to the Eurasian eagle-owl and across a broad band of overlapping distribution, the two are considered nearly ecological equivalents by day and night. However, good-sized female golden eagles are up to twice as heavy as an average eagle-owl, so seem to have a considerable advantage in size and power. Conversely, to support their large size and large territory needs, the golden eagle cannot survive on small and diverse prey nearly as successfully as the eagle-owl. Among the Iberian peninsula rabbit-eating guild, the species with wider ranges, the eagle-owl and the golden and Bonelli's eagles, have had some degree of success living off of alternate prey following the devastation of the rabbit population due to rabbit <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>disease.</b> The two rabbit predators endemic to Iberia, the Iberian lynx and Spanish imperial eagle, have been devastated by the reduction and other causes and both are threatened species today.|$|E

40|$|Summary: African {{swine fever}} (ASF) {{is a highly}} {{contagious}} disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs of all ages, causing enormous economic and health losses in affected countries. It is a notifiable non-zoonotic disease for which no effective treatment or vaccine currently exists. ASF {{is caused by a}} virus with a highly complex structure, classified as {{the only member of the}} family Asfaviridae. The clinical signs observed during acute and peracute infection with the disease vary depending on the virus isolate, the viral dose and the route of entry, and the signs can be confused with those of other swine <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>diseases.</b> At present time, ASF is endemic in more than 20 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In Europe, it has been endemic since 1978, on the Italian island of Sardinia. In June 2007, an outbreak was reported in Georgia and, since then, the virus has spread through the zone, currently affecting a number of countries in the Caucasus and the Russian Federation. This epidemiological situation represents a major new risk for neighbouring countries of Europe and Asia. The ASF control strategy should be based on early detection of the disease and on the adoption of strict control and biosecurity measures. This paper reviews the principal aspects relating to early detection and contingency plans for ASF. It also highlights the characteristics of the disease as well as such aspects as diagnosis and control...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{thrombin}} generation test is used {{to study}} coagulation in patients with <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>diseases</b> or with high thrombotic risk. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study investigating the relative influence of coagulation factors on thrombin generation in plasma. The aim was to investigate the influence of coagulant factors, anticoagulant factors, and tissue factor (TF) on three parameters: endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), peak thrombin concentration, and lag time for the appearance of thrombin. At a low TF concentration, all factors except factor XI influenced thrombin generation. At a high TF concentration, only the factors of the extrinsic pathway exerted an influence. ETP and peak thrombin were linearly correlated to factor II concentration. Factor V and factor VII effects increased hyperbolically with factor concentration. The influence of factor X on thrombin generation depended on TF concentration. In the absence of factor VIII and factor IX, ETP fell to 60 - 70 % of the normal when peak thrombin fell to 25 - 30 % of the normal. Fibrinogen concentration influenced ETP and peak thrombin and decreasing fibrinogen levels shortened the lag time. As expected, decreasing antithrombin concentration caused dramatic increases in thrombin generation. Protein S prolonged the lag time, especially at a low TF concentration. No effect of protein C was observed, likely due to the absence of thrombomodulin. The thrombin generation test was more sensitive to factor deficiencies at low than at high TF concentration. ETP was not the most critical parameter for studying coagulation factor deficiencies. Instead, peak thrombin was the most sensitive parameter...|$|R
