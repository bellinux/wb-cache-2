25|$|I owe {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> {{that one}} could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E
25|$|He comprehended at {{last that}} I {{wanted to see}} a grisette. Then <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> dozens of them. They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw—homely. They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug noses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good {{breeding}} could overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting; they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I knew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and finally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral.|$|E
500|$|John William Newham, {{known as}} [...] "Jake", {{was born in}} Cowra, New South Wales, and educated at Cowra High School. After matriculating, {{he worked as a}} clerk in the Commonwealth Bank, and joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in February 1951. He {{underwent}} flying training at RAAF Base Point Cook, Victoria, and graduated as a sergeant pilot in July 1952. Following fighter training, he saw operational service in the Korean War, flying Gloster Meteor jets with No. 77 Squadron from February to September 1953. He later recalled that his first sortie was as wingman to a Royal Air Force flight lieutenant: [...] "We flew up past P'yongyang and <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> enemy gun locations by arranging for them to shoot at us".|$|E
6000|$|... "An' 'ad a fifteen {{year old}} daughter. <b>'E's</b> <b>shown</b> <b>me</b> her photograph. Settin' that aside, so to say, 'ave you ever found these little things make much difference? Because I haven't." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> the paper. It is an {{old scrap}} of print, the picture of an American patent door-spring, with {{directions:}} 'Fasten the spring either end up. Wind it up. Never unwind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have Uncle to help me, and I {{think my}} ideal {{grew out of}} my {{knowledge}} of him. How can I fail to believe in goodness, when <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> what it can be and do?" ...|$|R
500|$|In his {{biography}} of Simpson, Put Me Back on My Bike, William Fotheringham quoted Alan Ramsbottom as saying, [...] "Tom {{went on the}} [...] Tour de France with one suitcase for his kit and another with his stuff, drugs and recovery things", which Fotheringham said was confirmed by Simpson's roommate Colin Lewis. Ramsbottom added, [...] "Tom {{took a lot of}} chances. He took a lot of it [...] I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the box, and had to take one every few days." [...] although he implied that other competitors were involved. Lewis recalled Simpson acquiring a small box at their hotel. Simpson explained to him: [...] "That's my year's supply of Micky Finns'. That lot cost me £800." ...|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1940s Williamson {{continued}} {{to pursue his}} interest in cartooning and began to take art classes with Tarzan cartoonist Burne Hogarth, and later at Hogarth's Cartoonists and Illustrators School. There he met future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel. According to Williamson, [...] "Roy broadened my collecting horizons, he became my guide to all the great illustrators — the artists who directly influenced adventure cartoonists like [...] Raymond and [...] Foster. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> J.C. Coll, Franklin Booth, Joseph Franke, Dan Smith, Norman Lindsay, Fortunino Matania, and the great Blue Book illustrators like Herbert Morton Stoops and Frank Hoban." [...] As he {{continued to}} learn about the cartooning field, he would visit the comic-book publisher Fiction House, meeting such artists as George Evans, Bob Lubbers, John Celardo, and Mort Meskin.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Catherine faced a new {{crisis with}} the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were [...] "oh, my mother...". The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his {{coronation}} at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: [...] "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> at the end... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gad, that's true!' {{said the}} doctor. 'Where is <b>he?</b> <b>Show</b> <b>me</b> the way. I'll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That's the little window {{that he got}} in at, eh? Well, I couldn't have {{believed}} it!' ...|$|R
60|$|One day, at last, very timidly, {{like one}} who, whilst overconscious of his utter unworthiness, ventures to crave a boon which he knows himself without {{the right to}} expect, I asked Falcone would <b>he</b> <b>show</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} of Marozzo's art with real weapons.|$|R
60|$|He becomes quite {{angry at}} this, and says <b>he</b> can <b>show</b> <b>me</b> {{the figures in}} the guide-book.|$|R
500|$|The siege failed, Bolingbroke was crowned and the {{new king}} granted the Castle and Honour of Pevensey to Pelham {{as a reward for}} his loyalty. The Lancastrian kings {{subsequently}} used the castle as a prison for high-ranking nobles. Its inmates included King James I of Scotland, who was captured while en route to France in 1405, and Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, who was held at Pevensey after becoming involved in a plot against Henry IV. On his death, Edward bestowed £20 in his will to Thomas Playsted, apparently one of his jailers, [...] "for the kindness <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> when I was in ward at Pevensey." [...] Henry IV's second wife Joan of Navarre was imprisoned by Joan's stepson Henry V on charges of plotting to kill him through witchcraft; she was released in 1422 after being held at Pevensey for three years. When the Tudor dynasty took over the castle was abandoned, and by 1573 it was recorded to be in ruins.|$|E
2500|$|... "He [...] {{showed me}} marks on his back, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> {{cigarette}} burns on his body, {{and the subsequent}} examination by another professor of medicine, more expert in physical examination than me, confirmed that he's got skin discolouration on his right loin which {{would be consistent with}} old bruising, which in turn would be consistent with beating..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 27 August, the Arab League {{condemned}} the crackdown and dispatched Elaraby on an [...] "urgent mission" [...] to Syria. After meeting with Assad on 10 September, Elaraby told reporters, [...] "I {{heard from him}} {{an understanding of the}} situation and <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> a series of measures taken by the Syrian government that focused on national dialogue." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of January I delivered a small piece thereof to John Baptista Agnello, not telling what nor from whence, but prayed him to prove what metal was therein. And within three days I came to him for answer. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> a very little powder of gold, saying it came thereout, and willed me to give him another piece {{to make a better}} proof. [...] I did so, and within three days again <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> more powder of gold. [...] I told him I would not believe it without better proof. He asked another piece to make a better proof, saying that he would make anatomy thereof. I gave it him saying that I marvelled much of his doings sith I had given pieces to other 3 to make proof who could find no such thing there. He answered me, Bisogna sapere adulare la natura.|$|E
2500|$|Mcdonald {{read the}} script and was angered by the {{deviations}} from his original text. He wrote to the studio and listed his many objections. Director Ritchie invited Mcdonald to {{the set of the}} film, and took him out to dinner where, according to Mcdonald, [...] "Point by point, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> where I was wrong. I was beautifully chewed out." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the war, … Lt. Harold Cherniss, the American {{intelligence}} officer, telephoned me {{and said}} ‘Michou, you must come quickly.’ I went to Harold’s office and <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> twelve little pictures of identity cards and asked ‘Do you know that boy?’ I said ‘Yes, [...] …’ He said, ‘Michou, this is very important. Please look carefully.’ I said ‘No problem… [...] the same boy.’ He laughed. I said ‘What happened, Harold?’ ‘That boy is working for the Americans in Nuremburg.’ But not for long… [...] was tried and executed at Lille in 1945.|$|E

2500|$|Arkansas Republicans {{were eager}} to work with Winthrop Rockefeller on another race for {{governor}} if he could be led to run as a true Republican to help build the party in the state. I liked him personally. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> many courtesies, and I still thought [...] {{that he would make}} a good governor and could be elected on the Republican ticket..... He had learned a lesson. And he won his next two races for governor..... His service contributed greatly to the enormous benefits of two-party government in Arkansas.|$|E
2500|$|On January 4, 2012, Robertson {{reported}} that God {{had spoken to}} him and he [...] "thinks <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the next president" [...] but would not name who it is. He did give an indication {{that it would not be}} President Obama since Robertson said God told him Obama's views were at [...] "odds with the majority", but left some room for interpretation had the 2012 election expanded beyond a two-person race. Closer to the election, however, he expressly stated that God had told him that Mitt Romney would win and would be a two-term President.|$|E
2500|$|Tatum played chords with a {{relatively}} flat-fingered technique compared to the curvature taught in classical training. [...] Composer/pianist Mary Lou Williams told Whitney Balliett, [...] "Tatum {{taught me how to}} hit my notes, how to control them without using pedals. And <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> how to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone." [...] Jimmy Rowles said, [...] "Most of the stuff he played was clear over my head. [...] There was too much going on—both hands were impossible to believe. [...] You couldn't pick out what he was doing because his fingers were so smooth and soft, and the way he did it—it was like camouflage." [...] When his fastest tracks of [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] are slowed down, they still reveal a coherent, syncopated rhythm.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Rahere promised <b>he</b> would <b>show</b> <b>me</b> some sport {{after supper}} {{to cover his}} morning's offence," [...] said he to De Aquila. [...] "So this is thy man, Rahere?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he {{answered}} slowly, [...] "I am fond of him. <b>He</b> has <b>shown</b> <b>me</b> {{a side of}} himself, perhaps, that other men have not seen,--and he is very lonely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he answered, [...] "might be misleading. <b>He</b> has <b>shown</b> <b>me</b> so much kindness. Yet I think--I am sure--that I {{liked him}} from the first moment I saw him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding The Thing, by John Carpenter, I've asked him, {{as he was}} {{preparing}} some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, [...] "Why did you call me, {{if you want to}} do it on your own?" [...] He surprised me, he said - [...] "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." [...] I was quite amazed, he called me because he had my music at his wedding. Then when <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} process, Hall and the design team took a research trip to Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, where they met a team of DARPA-funded researchers who were pioneering the new field of 'soft robotics' using inflatable vinyl, which ultimately inspired Baymax's inflatable, vinyl, truly huggable design. Hall stated that [...] "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. … It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app {{would be in the}} healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant. He had me at vinyl. This particular researcher went into this long pitch but the minute <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> that inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot." [...] Hall stated that the technology [...] "will have potential probably in the medical industry in the future, making robots that are very pliable and gentle and not going to hurt people when they pick them up." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say was that my grandma showed me my first strap. That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Eighteen,' says he, 'as a {{friendly}} devil in a cabbage-scented hell, {{would you mind}} cutting up this piece of steak for me? I don't say that it's got more muscle than I have, but--' And then <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> the insides of his hands. They was blistered and cut and corned and swelled up till they looked {{like a couple of}} flank steaks criss-crossed with a knife--the kind the butchers hide and take home, knowing what is the best.|$|R
60|$|My friend, having {{presented}} me, mentioned {{my desire}} to inspect the establishment, and received Monsieur Maillard's assurance that <b>he</b> would <b>show</b> <b>me</b> all attention, now took leave, and I saw him no more.|$|R
5000|$|... "When I go to a situation, I see {{something}} interesting, and I see the enormity {{and the size}} of it, and the complexity of it, and I say “Yes God, you’ve <b>shown</b> <b>me</b> this but it’s not enough for me.” So he says “Alright.” Then I keep walking, then <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> something more complex and bigger. I say “Yes God, It’s nice. But it’s still not enough for me.” So I {{go on and on and}} I don’t accept it, and then he knows this child of his is very demanding and restless. And then he opens up and <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> something I have never experienced before. Then I take a picture and say “Thank you God.” ...|$|R
