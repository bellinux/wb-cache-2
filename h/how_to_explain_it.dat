According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it</b> to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

Theko reacted over a second after the gun fired to signal the start of the heat, although she improved her personal best time by over seven seconds. She ranked behind heat winner Nafissatou Moussa Adamou of Niger (37.29 seconds) and Togo's Adzo Kpossi (37.55 seconds).

Language is never about the things in themselves, only about conceptual fictions, hence they are nominalists. Due to this theory, the main issue for Dharmakirti becomes <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> that <b>it</b> is possible for our arbitrary and conventional linguistic schemas to refer to perceptual particulars which are ineffable and non conceptual. <b>To</b> <b>explain</b> this gap between conceptual schema and perceptual content, Dharmakirti takes up Dignaga's theory of [...] "exclusion" [...] (apoha). Dignāga's view is that [...] "a word talks about entities only as they are qualified by the negation of other things." [...] Dharmakīrti's unique take on this nominalist theory, which underlies his entire system, is to reinterpret it in terms of causal efficacy - arthakriyā (which can also be translated as 'telic function', 'functionality', and 'fulfillment of purpose').|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> value. <b>It</b> {{outlines}} a hedonistic theory about value. I propose to draw this outline by investigating how value and pleasure are related. The suggestion, of course, being a hedonistic one, is that value and pleasure are very intimately related. By turning to explanatory matters, the suggestion also involves a shift of attention {{when it comes to the}} philosophy of value. Hedonism as traditionally understood is a theory in substantive (as opposed to formal) axiology. As such it is supposed to tell you that pleasures are what have positive value intrinsically. The intrinsic value of an event (like a life or sitting through a concert), according to hedonism, is a matter of the pleasures and pains involved only 1. The discipline known as axiology is mostly concerned either with formal matters as in analysing ‘value’, working out a formal framework for it and for understanding committing claims involving evaluative terms in general, or with the substantial matter of assigning value to objects, to properties or to states of affairs. Typically, formal and substantial theories have an impac...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{begins by}} re-examining the {{spectral}} properties of several cyclically sensitive {{variables such as}} hours worked, unemployment and capacity utilization. For each of these series, we document {{the presence of an}} important peak in the spectral density at a periodicity of approximately 36 - 40 quarters. We take this pattern as suggestive of intriguing but little-studied cyclical phenomena at the long end of the business cycle, and we ask <b>how</b> best <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>it.</b> In particular, we explore whether such patterns may reflect slow-moving limit cycle forces, wherein booms sow the seeds of the subsequent busts. To this end, we present a general class of models, featuring local complementarities, that can give rise to unique-equilibrium behavior characterized by stochastic limit cycles. We then use the framework to extend a New Keynesian-type model in a manner aimed at capturing the notion of an accumulation-liquidation cycle. We estimate the model by indirect inference and find that the cyclical properties identified in the data can be well explained by stochastic limit cycles forces, where the exogenous disturbances to the system are very short lived. This contrasts with results from most other macroeconomic models, which typically require very persistent shocks in order <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> macroeconomic fluctuations...|$|R

"Lies-to-children are not {{strictly}} true, but they’re simplified {{in a way}} that makes them easier to grasp". —Chad Orzel, Forbes Writing in 2011 for the Carleton College website, geophysicist Kim Kastens in a column with her daughter at first found the notion of lie-to-children as surprising. Kastens delved further into the issue, and identified specific instances where a lie-to-children teaching technique would do more harm than good for students. The worst examples included a lie-to-children which would later have to be unlearned following teaching from subsequent professors, an instance where the student is successfully able to identify the factual inaccuracy and knows more about it than the teacher, and using the technique without having a [...] "master plan" [...] involving progressive learning. In her 2011 book The Children's Bill of Emotional Rights, Eileen Johnson discussed the lies told by parents to their children during the formation of childhood fictional mythology and pointed out the inherent problems this could raise in the future during the parenting process. Johnson cautioned: [...] "Why do we tell these lies to children? At some point we have to admit we were lying.

His growing love for the Highland character, perhaps also a sense of the difficulty of the task, led him to take up at forty-one the study of Gaelic; in which he made some shadow of progress, but not much: the fastnesses of that elusive speech retaining to the last their independence. At the house of his friend Mrs. Blackburn, who plays the part of a Highland lady as to the manner born, he learned the delightful custom of kitchen dances, which became the rule at his own house and brought him into yet nearer contact with his neighbours.
