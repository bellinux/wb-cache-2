25|$|Protestants {{perceived}} Roman Catholic salvation to {{be dependent}} upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that a sinner is not accepted by God {{on account of the}} change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, for no one deserves salvation.|$|E
25|$|Salvation is {{available}} through Jesus' work on the cross and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> from God made possible by grace through faith and not by human works. The PCG believes {{it is possible to}} lose one's salvation if one turns away from God. After salvation, a Christian can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The evidence of this baptism is speaking in other tongues. It believes in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite and progressive work of grace. It believes heaven and hell are real places. Heaven is for those who have received the gift of salvation, and hell is for those who have not.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{government}} and military institutions, {{a number of}} Canadian civilian organizations have association with the monarchy, either through their being founded via a Royal Charter (such as the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, the Royal Kennebecasis Yacht Club, and McGill University), having been granted {{the right to use}} the prefix royal before their name (such as the Royal Quebec Golf Club and Royal Manitoba Winter Fair), or because at least one member of the Royal Family serves as a patron. Some of these organizations may use a royal crown in their logo or coat of arms, though this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> from the monarch showing royal support and/or association, and requires her approval before being added.|$|E

25|$|For Francis, work <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> {{and to work}} is a grace. Daily work is {{not only}} the means of livelihood, but the {{opportunity}} to serve God and neighbor as well as a way to develop one's own personality. In the conviction that work is a right and a duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time.|$|E

Julia later realises that Aunt Gina {{would have known that}} Jennifer's racquet had been refurbished and restrung recently, so she would not have assumed the problem is in the strings. Soon enough, Jennifer's aunt writes that she did not send the new racquet.|$|E
