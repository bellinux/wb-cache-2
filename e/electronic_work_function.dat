A central topic in these fields is exploring electronically efficient, stable and effective hole-transporting layer (HTL) materials. The goal is to enhance hole-collection ability, reduce charge recombination, increase built-in voltage, and hence improve the performance as well as the device stability. Transition metal oxides (TMOs) semiconductors such as NiOx, CuOx, CrOx, MoOx, WO 3, and V 2 O 5, have been widely used as HTLs in OSCs. These TMOs are naturally adopted into PSC as HTLs and shows their importance. There are similarities, and also differences in applying TMOs in these two types of main solution processed solar cells. This concise review is on the recent developments of transition metal oxide HTL in OSCs and PSCs.

A reduced device-to-device characteristics variations was also noticed when fluorinated additives {{were used to}} modify the PEDOT:PSS. Shading lights onto the effect of HTL fluorination, we show that the morphology of the polymer:PCBM blends remains surprisingly unaffected by the fluorinated HTL surface energy but that, instead, the OPVs are impacted {{not only by the}} HTL <b>electronic</b> properties (<b>work</b> <b>function,</b> dipole layer, open circuit voltage, charge transfer dynamic) but also by alteration of the complex refractive indices (photogeneration, short circuit current density, external quantum efficiencies, electro-optic modelling).

40|$|By various {{representative}} examples {{the structural}} properties of hydrogen adsorption on transition metal surfaces are illustrated. It is {{shown that the}} occurrence of hydrogen induced substrate recon-struction is rather the rule than the exception. In many cases the reconstruction is weak with atomic displacements of a few 1 / 100 A only. However, also strong reconstructions can take place with dis-placements> 0 : 1 A and/or even removal of substrate atoms. Also, reconstructions already existing for the clean surface can be drastically modified and even switched in symmetry. At full coverage, atomic displacements add up to modify the vertical relaxation of interlayer distances of the clean surface towards the bulk layer spacing and in this sense hydrogen acts to restore the truncated sur-face bonds. No induced registry shifts of layers are observed. The structural influence of hydrogen seems to extend and to be limited down to about the second to third layer.

40|$|The {{combination}} of electrochemical research methods like cyclic voltammetry and chrono-coulometry with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at the electron synchrotron BESSYII was suited {{to examine the}} impact of thymine on the underpotential deposition (upd) of lead and bismuth on the gold (111) electrode. Using this method, new insight was gained concerning the potential dependence of the thymine adsorption state on different layers of copper and silver – which previously had been electrochemically deposited on a gold single crystal. Moreover, these techniques were employed to examine the underpotential deposition of bismuth and copper on different layers of silver which had been electrochemically depos-ited on gold (111) -electrodes. The following summary is graphically depicted in figure 6. 1. The presence of thymine in the electrolyte is leading to a stabilization of metallic lead situated on the gold (111) -electrode at - 650 mV vs. ref. Due to the lead adsorption on Au (111), the electrode’s potential of zero charge (pzc) changes, which, in turn, leads to thymine being modified to a chemisorbed state. At the electrode potential of 850 mV vs. ref, the stabiliza-tion is cancelled out because it comes to a change of charge (due to the potential in relation to the pzc) of the electrode surface as well as to a reorientation of thymine. At the bulk deposi-tion of 1150 mV vs. ref., thymine is physisorbed on the electrode surface. On the basis of the desorption potentials in the cyclic voltammogramme, the upd shift of lead on Au (111) in 100 mM perchloric acid was found to be 175 mV. The Pb 4 f 7 / 2 -binding energy of a lead monolayer on Au (111) comes to 137, 6 eV, whereas the one of the metallic lead sums up to an amount of 136, 8 eV. Thymine stabilizes metallic bismuth on the Au (111) -electrode at - 250 mV vs. ref. From the beginning of the bismuth-upd onwards, this potential lies positively on Au (111). In contrast to the previously described experiment of the lead deposition, it is not possible- because of the XPS dates- to say whether thymine is chemisorbed or physisorbed on the electrode surface. At more negative deposition potentials, thymine is fully desorbed by the electrode surface, although a chemisorption, meaning an interaction via the deprotonated N(3) - atom, could be expected because of the position of the pzcs as well as the positive charge which is related to the latter. The upd-shift of bismuth on Au (111) amounts ca. 140 mV in 100 mM perchloric acid solu-tion. The Bi 4 f 7 / 2 -binding energy of the bismuth mono layer has a value of 158, 5 to 158, 7 eV. In the case of metallic bismuth, the Bi 4 f 7 / 2 -binding energy comes to ca. 156, 9 eV. Compared to other systems, the silver- UPD has a special characteristic: It is possible to sepa-rate two mono layers at different points in the underpotential region. During the presence of thymine, the first silver- UPD is favoured, whereas the second monolayer’s deposition is in-hibited. The determination of the absorption state of thymine on silver was acted out on the first and second monolayer {{as well as on the}} bulk deposition of silver on Au (111) at - 700 mV vs. ref. On the second monolayer as well as on the bulk silver, thymine interacts with the electrode surface via the deprotonated N(3) -atom. On the first monolayer, this interaction takes place via the O(4) -atom. The N(3) -atom is protonated. The cyclovoltammogrammes show a needle peak at - 900 mV vs. ref. which results from the deposition of thymine. Thymine is chemisorbed at the deposition potentials of co-adsorption of silver and thymine (at - 15 mV vs. ref. (upd) and - 145 mV vs. ref. (bulk)). It interacts with the substrate via its deprotonated N(3) atom. Hence, the interaction between the silver monolayer and thymine undergoes a change from the deprotonated N(3) to the O(4) atom. In absence of thymine, the upd shift of the first silver monolayer amounts 500 mV, whereas the upd shift for the second silver monolayer amounts 35 mV. In presence of thymine, the upd shift of the silver monolayer is 415 mV. The Ag 3 d 5 / 2 -binding energy of the silver monolayer is 367, 9 eV, which is about 0, 2 eV smaller than the binding energy of metallic silver. The copper deposition in perchloric acid is kinetically hindered at underpotentials as well as at overpotentials. It was shown that the hindrance is caused by the deposition of the copper mono layers. They are the basis for three dimensional copper growth (Stranski-Krastanov-growth). If the copper upd is conducted at - 700 mV vs. ref. on a pre-adsorbed copper mono-layer, it can be observed that the copper opd starts earlier (at around 500 to 600 s). The copper electrodeposition is accelerated and stabilized in the presence of thymine in the electrolyte. Thymine is physisorbed on the Au (111) surface at the deposition potential of the copper upd (- 480 mV vs. ref.). The electrodeposition of copper leads to a change of the pzc of the electrode and causes a reorientation of thymine into the chemisorbed state. In contrast, thymine is physisorbed on different copper layers on Au (111) at - 700 mV vs. ref. (upd) and 750 mV vs. ref. (bulk), respectively. The upd shift of copper is 165 mV in absence and 225 mV in presence of thymine. The Cu 2 p 3 / 2 -binding energy of a copper monolayer is 931, 5 eV. It is increased by 0, 3 eV in pres-ence of thymine. The electrodeposition of a single silver monolayer on gold (111) leads to a variation of the <b>electronic</b> <b>work</b> <b>function</b> of the substrate. Due to this modification, a copper upd could be ob-served on a silver substrate for the first time ever! The upd leads to a copper coverage of 0. 24 with respect to the underlying gold substrate. Neither in the presence of thymine in the elec-trolyte, nor in the presence of sulphate, the copper upd could be observed. Moreover, it could not be observed on the second silver monolayer nor on bulk silver. The copper opd is accelerated on the pre-deposited silver monolayer. On this substrate, it is not necessary for the three dimensional growth of copper to have a complete underlying cop-per monolayer. The copper upd-shift on the first silver monolayer amounts 95 mV. The upd of bismuth shows a significantly different behaviour in the first silver monolayer compared to the clean Au (111) substrate. On the silver layer, it proceeds in two distinguish-able steps. It reaches a degree of coverage close to 1. Whereas on Au (111) the degree of cov-erage is 0, 76. Contrary to the upd on the first silver monolayer, the bismuth upd on bulk silver takes place in one step only. The coverage which was obtained is close to 1, too. A second deposition step is not stabilized. The upd shift of the bismuth upd on AgML / Au (111) and AgVOL / Au (111) is 110 mV and 85 mV, respectively. The copper upd and the bismuth upd on the silver substrates fulfil the forecasts, which could be set on the basis of the empirical rule of D. M. Kolb et al...|$|E
