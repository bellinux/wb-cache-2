40|$|The {{advent of}} ‘fusion retail’ has raised {{numerous}} concerns of ‘under reported’ <b>internet</b> <b>sales</b> at shopping centres resulting in less reported sales and overage rent.   Claims {{have also been}} made that ‘fusion retail’ keeps potential customers away from shopping centres causing space vacancies and voids.   As most US retail leases contain overage rent, examining the validity of these claims should assist retail investors to make informed investment decisions.   Irrespective of whether the concerns are valid or not, institutional change and market adjustment theory expects investors and occupiers {{to adjust to the}} ‘fusion retail’ challenge as they have previously done with catalogue shopping. The research suggests sales migration to the internet which reduces overage rent but no deliberate ‘under reporting’ of <b>internet</b> <b>sales.</b>   Most existing percentage leases exclude <b>internet</b> <b>sales</b> since they were unanticipated when the leases were signed.   Despite the sales migration, ‘base’ rents have remained strong suggesting that ‘fusion retail’ and physical stores are synergistic.   New leases are adjusting to include disclosure of <b>internet</b> <b>sales</b> if fulfilled at shopping centres.   However, due to occupiers’ reluctance to adjust sales reporting systems, investors are unable to ascertain the accuracy of <b>internet</b> <b>sales</b> generated.   Since it is also costly to access the reporting systems, investors rely on occupiers to report <b>internet</b> <b>sales</b> akin to offline sales.   To ensure accurate disclosure, investors incentivise occupiers provided <b>internet</b> <b>sales</b> are shown separate from offline sales and meet a specific margin above a sales threshold.   Despite the lease adjustment, the research shows a diversion of in-store collections of internet purchases to owner-occupied stores to avoid overage rent payment.   Since the diversion does not breach the lease, investors cannot stop occupiers from acting opportunistically.   This suggests that occupiers can sign new leases whilst knowing that no <b>internet</b> <b>sales</b> will be subjected to overage rent payment.

30|$|Rooted in {{the context}} of the {{emergence}} of many alternative forms of agriculture and food networks, SFSCs are characterized by the proximity of producers and consumers, either relational – i.e. with few (or even no) intermediaries between producers and consumers – or physical – i.e. a short geographical distance between them (Aubry and Kebir, 2013). Ideally, they fulfil both these conditions (Pascucci, 2010). These features are inherent to different types of SFSCs, ranging from direct sale at farm shops to farmers’ markets, <b>internet</b> <b>sale</b> and organized box schemes. The considerable social involvement of the participants is another key feature of SFSC practices, due to both their embeddedness in the local community (Sage, 2003) and the social interactions that are likely to take place in these alternative markets (Cicatiello et al., 2014).|$|E

40|$|Counterfeit alcohol {{belongs to}} the {{category}} of unrecorded alcohol not reflected in official statistics. The internet trade of alcoholic beverages has been prohibited by the Russian Federation since 2007, but various sellers still offer counterfeit spirits (i. e., forged brand spirits) over the internet to Russian consumers, mostly in a non-deceptive fashion at prices up to 15 times lower than in regular sale. The public health issues arising from this unregulated trade include potential harm to underage drinkers, hazards due to toxic ingredients such as methanol, but most importantly alcohol harms due to potentially increased drinking volumes due to low prices and high availability on the internet. The <b>internet</b> <b>sale</b> also undermines existing alcohol policies such as restrictions of sale locations, sale times and minimum pricing.

40|$|According to {{a recent}} study by the Bureau of Business Research (BBR), a high-income Nebraska family pays only 1. 3 percent of its income in sales taxes under the current state sales tax base 1. Conversely, a low-income family pays nearly three times more- 3. 7 percent of income-in sales taxes (Figure 1). Interestingly, the tax {{incidence}} does not improve when the base is broadened to include certain services. If services are taxed, a highincome family 2 ̆ 7 s tax burden-the percent of income paid in sales taxes-nearly doubles to 2. 3 percent, but the low-income family still pays nearly three times as much- 6. 5 percent. Economists generally agree that sales taxes are regressive-the percent of income paid in taxes (average tax rate) decreases as income increases. Nevertheless, they are popular revenue generators because, only a few cents or dollars are paid on individual purchases throughout the year. The total amount is not apparent like income taxes that are tallied annually. However, total sales taxes become a significant burden on low-income families.

40|$|We used {{a unique}} dataset of 30, 533 off-lease vehicle auction sales (10, 898 offline and 19, 635 online) {{to examine the}} {{economic}} impact of adding an <b>Internet</b> <b>sale</b> channel to a firm’s existing channel portfolio. Our findings suggest that an Internet channel adds economic benefit in several ways. First, the data suggest that prices are significantly higher and that the dispersion of prices for vehicles sold is significantly narrower in the online channel than in the offline channel. In addition, the price difference observed between vehicles sold via online and offline channels is greater than one would expect to see from reduced transaction costs alone. Our data suggest that there are significant differences in the prices obtained for vehicles across locations and that and that these differences are associated with the flow of vehicles between states with vehicles flowing from low cost states to higher cost states. Finally, we show that the range of online prices is narrower that the range of offline prices. These findings are consistent with the suppositions that online prices converge more closely toward a national price than offline prices and that the online channel may allow the firm to capture a portion of the arbitrage rents...|$|E
