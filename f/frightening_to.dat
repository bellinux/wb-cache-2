5|$|An eclipse is {{a natural}} phenomenon. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> people who are unaware of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear {{during the day and}} the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.|$|E
5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E

500|$|Faust {{stated that}} as she {{provided}} Hasbro {{with more of}} her ideas for the show, she was inspired by their positive response to the non-traditional elements. Faust had initially pitched the show to include [...] "adventure stories" [...] in a similar proportion to [...] "relationship stories", but recognizing the younger target audience, {{as well as the}} difficulty of basing complex plots on the adventure elements, she trimmed back this content, focusing more on exchanges between the characters. The show still incorporates episodic creatures intended to be <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> children, such as dragons and hydras, but it places more emphasis on the friendships among the characters, displayed with a comedic tone. By the time the show was approved, Faust had developed three full scripts for the series.|$|E
500|$|The Gentlemen, {{called the}} [...] "creepiest villains we've ever done" [...] by series writer Doug Petrie, were {{inspired}} by a nightmare Whedon had as a child, specifically {{one in which he}} was in bed and approached by a floating monster. Whedon fashioned The Gentlemen as something from a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, intending them to be <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> children — monsters who carve out people's hearts, smiling as they do so. Nosferatu, Pinhead from Hellraiser, and Mr. Burns from The Simpsons all served as physical models for The Gentlemen. Elegantly Victorian in costume and demeanor, Whedon found their politeness and grace especially unsettling. Their metallic teeth {{were inspired by}} the intersection of Victorian culture with the height of the Industrial age, an era that Whedon considers [...] "classically creepy". For Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox, The Gentlemen and their straitjacket-wearing minions, who clumsily flap, gyrate, and crouch as they move, are representative of class disparity and patriarchy: The Gentlemen, with their Victorian suits, move effortlessly to accomplish what they set out to do while their minions, whom Whedon called [...] "footmen", do the [...] "dirty work".|$|E
500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink so much is that it was scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> put yourself on display all the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} at the 1993 Conservative conference, Archer urged then Home Secretary Michael Howard, to [...] "Stand and deliver," [...] saying: [...] "Michael, I am sick and tired of being told by old people that they are <b>frightened</b> <b>to</b> open the door, they're <b>frightened</b> <b>to</b> go out at night, <b>frightened</b> <b>to</b> use the parks and byways where their parents and {{grandparents}} walked with freedom... We say to you: stand and deliver!". He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending. He criticised the role of [...] "do-gooders" [...] and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party's law and order policies. This was a time when Archer was actively seeking another front-line political role.|$|R

2500|$|In an interview, Irwin {{described}} {{a late night}} conversation at a Waffle House that he had with Cyndi Craven (a friend, musician and Irwin's website designer):... and I was talking about what I have to tell myself {{all the time when}} I'm afraid about doing something that hasn't been done before because it really is <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> step out and do something different. So I will tell myself, [...] "Don’t be afraid to be amazing". Cyndi said, [...] "Where did you get that?" [...] I said, [...] "I made it up". [...] Craven subsequently posted the quotation on the internet and it now appears on hundreds of websites.|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist Carol Gilligan {{writes that}} [...] "The penchant of {{developmental}} theorists {{to project a}} masculine image, and one that appears <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> women, goes {{back at least to}} Freud." [...] She sees Freud's criticism of women's sense of justice reappearing in the work of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg. Gilligan notes that Nancy Chodorow, in contrast to Freud, attributes sexual difference not to anatomy but to the fact that male and female children have different early social environments. Chodorow, writing against the masculine bias of psychoanalysis, [...] "replaces Freud's negative and derivative description of female psychology with a positive and direct account of her own." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once the triremes were seaworthy, it {{is argued}} that they were highly {{decorated}} with, [...] "eyes, nameplates, painted figureheads, and various ornaments". These decorations were used both to show the wealth of the patrician and to make the ship <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> the enemy. The home port of each trireme was signaled by the wooden statue of a deity located above the bronze ram {{on the front of the}} ship. In the case of Athens, since most of the fleet's triremes were paid for by wealthy citizens, there was a natural sense of competition among the patricians to create the [...] "most impressive" [...] trireme, both to intimidate the enemy and to attract the best oarsmen. Of all military expenditure, triremes were the most labor- and (in terms of men and money) investment-intensive.|$|E
2500|$|Reeve {{went through}} inner anguish in the ICU, {{particularly}} {{when he was}} alone during the night. His approaching operation to reattach his skull to his spine (June 1995) [...] "was <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> contemplate. ... I already knew that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery. ... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent." [...] The man {{announced that he was}} a proctologist and was going to perform a rectal exam on Reeve. It was Robin Williams, reprising his character from the film Nine Months. Reeve wrote: [...] "For {{the first time since the}} accident, I laughed. My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of [...] "The Fighting Okra" [...] grew {{so much that}} many myths started on how the mascot came to be, {{the most popular of}} these stating there was a stubborn okra plant at first base on the baseball field that grew back every time it was cut. The true origin of the fighting okra mascot was a discussion between basketball and baseball players in the [...] "Court of Governors" [...] dormitory. The Statesman mascot was temporarily prohibited from participating in athletic activities after a physical altercation with the Mississippi College's Choctaw mascot at a basketball game. Basketball player Houston Williamson was lamenting the fact that [...] "Fighting Statesmen" [...] was not particularly <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> their opponents. All present agreed that an alternate mascot would have to be mean and green. After a lively discussion and many suggestions, baseball pitcher Bob Black suggested that okra was green, fuzzy and tough. The DSU baseball team began using the chant [...] "Okra! Okra! Okra! Okra!" [...] at DSU basketball games.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the couple}} was popular, they were also controversial. Sosnovska was asked if she {{realized}} that by accepting this role she would be stepping into [...] "so much" [...] controversy. [...] "I’m still {{coming to terms with}} this phenomenon of Lianca," [...] she replied, [...] "with the devotion that I’m shown as a couple on TV, and the whole concept of fans. The letters that I get are heart breaking. It’s horrible that even now in the 21st century [...] feel the need to hide. Not everyone is confident enough to face the world, and not everyone lives in a safe environment." [...] She continued, [...] "I never really thought about it before--it doesn’t occur to you that this medieval type of mentality occurs. It’s horrifying what happens." [...] Sosnovska did, however, see the decision to be out as a personal choice. [...] "I don’t blame people who choose not be out," [...] she said. She donated her time to fan sponsored fundraisers that raised money for several charities connected to the Lena and Bianca storylines. Over $20,000 had been raised for the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project. Sosnovska stated, [...] "I would never have known what a powerful tool TV could be, especially daytime. It’s <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> the extent it’s a huge responsibility on the producers, directors, and actors to influence minds. You can’t underestimate the force of it." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{now what}} was he to do next {{in the way of}} earning his bread? Various {{thoughts}} ran through his brain, and different resolves--half-formed but still, perhaps, capable of shape--presented themselves to him for the future. It was still on the cards--on the cards, but barely so--that he might make money out of these people; but he must wait perhaps for weeks before he again commenced such an attempt. He might perhaps make money out of them, and be merciful to them at the same time;--not money by thousands and tens of thousands; that golden dream was gone for ever; but still money that might be comfortably luxurious as long as it could be made to last. But then on one special point he made a firm and final resolution,--whatever new scheme he might hatch he alone would manage. Never again would he call into his councils that son of his loins whose rapacious greed had, as he felt sure, brought upon him all this ruin. Had Aby not gone to Castle Richmond, with his cruelty and his greed, <b>frightening</b> <b>to</b> the very death the soul of that poor baronet by the enormity of his demands, Mr. Prendergast would not have been there. Of what further chance of Castle Richmond pickings there might be Aby should know nothing. He and his son would no longer hunt in couples. He would shake him off in that escape which they must both now make from Cork, and he would not care how long it might be before he again saw his countenance.|$|E
