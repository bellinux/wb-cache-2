40|$|Problem statement: The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to determine the}} effects of&# 13; carbadox on Apparent Ileal Digestibility (AID) of Amino Acid (AA) by nursery pigs. Approach: Fifteen&# 13; weanling barrows (initial BW: 9. 6 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum. &# 13; Animals were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments with five pigs per treatment during a 6 -&# 13; period experiment. Dietary treatments included: (1) a basal diet (BD) containing mainly corn and&# 13; soybean meal, (2) BD + 27. 5 mg kg - 1 <b>of</b> <b>carbadox</b> and (3) BD + 55. 0 mg kg - 1 <b>of</b> <b>carbadox.</b> Treatment&# 13; diets were provided during period 2 - 4; the BD was fed to all pigs during period 1, 5 and 6.

40|$|Carbadox is a quinoxaline-di-N-oxide {{antibiotic}} fed to over 40 % {{of young}} pigs in the United States {{that has been}} shown to induce phage DNA transduction in vitro; however, the effects <b>of</b> <b>carbadox</b> on swine microbiome functions are poorly understood. We investigated the in vivo longitudinal effects <b>of</b> <b>carbadox</b> on swine gut microbial gene expression (fecal metatranscriptome) and phage population dynamics (fecal dsDNA viromes). Microbial metagenome, transcriptome, and virome sequences were annotated for taxonomic inference and gene function by using FIGfam (isofunctional homolog sequences) and SEED subsystems databases. When the beta diversities of microbial FIGfam annotations were compared, the control and carbadox communities were distinct 2  days after carbadox introduction. This effect was driven by carbadox-associated lower expression of FIGfams (n = 66) related to microbial respiration, carbohydrate utilization, and RNA metabolism (q < 0. 1), suggesting bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects within certain populations. Interestingly, carbadox treatment caused greater expression of FIGfams related to all stages of the phage lytic cycle 2  days following the introduction <b>of</b> <b>carbadox</b> (q ≤ 0. 07), suggesting the carbadox-mediated induction of prophages and phage DNA recombination. These effects were diminished by 7  days <b>of</b> continuous <b>carbadox</b> in the feed, suggesting an acute impact. Additionally, the viromes included a few genes that encoded resistance to tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and beta-lactam antibiotics but these did not change in frequency over time or with treatment.

Overall, pigs fed the diet containing both carbadox and 0. 15 % BIOSAF had greater ADG than did pigs fed the control diet or the diet containing 0. 4 % BIOSAF (P< 0. 04), although their growth performance did not differ from that <b>of</b> pigs fed <b>carbadox</b> alone. Antibody titers in response to routine vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae were not affected by dietary treatment. There was no evidence that BIOSAF improved growth performance of nursery pigs, either alone or in combination with the carbadox.

40|$|Antibiotics {{are used}} in {{livestock}} and poultry production to treat and prevent disease {{as well as to}} promote animal growth. Carbadox is an in-feed antibiotic that is widely used in swine production to prevent dysentery and to improve feed efficiency. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the effects <b>of</b> <b>carbadox</b> and its withdrawal on the swine gut microbiota. Six pigs (initially 3 -weeks old) received feed containing carbadox and six received unamended feed. After 3 -weeks <b>of</b> continuous <b>carbadox</b> administration, all pigs were switched to a maintenance diet without carbadox. DNA was extracted from feces (n= 142) taken before, during, and following (6 -week withdrawal) carbadox treatment. Phylotype analysis using 16 S rRNA sequences showed the gradual development of the non-medicated swine gut microbiota over the 8 -week study, and that the carbadox-treated pigs had significant differences in bacterial membership relative to non-medicated pigs. Enumeration of fecal Escherichia coli showed that a diet change concurrent with carbadox withdrawal was associated with an increase in the E. coli in the non-medicated pigs, suggesting that carbadox pretreatment prevented an increase of E. coli populations. In-feed carbadox caused striking effects within four days of administration, with significant alterations in both community structure and bacterial membership, notably a large relative increase in Prevotella populations in medicated pigs. Digital PCR was used to show that the absolute abundance of Prevotella was unchanged between the medicated and non-medicated pigs despite the relative increase shown in the phylotype analysis. Carbadox therefore caused a decrease in the abundance of other gut bacteria but did not affect the absolute abundance of Prevotella. The pending regulation on antibiotics used in animal production underscores the importance of understanding how they modulate the microbiota and impact animal health, which will inform the search for antibiotic alternatives...|$|R

Methods The enzymolysis of sample within Tris/HCl buffer under stable temperature was acidized by hydrochloric acid and extracted by ethyl acetate.

40|$|Antibiotics {{are used}} for disease {{therapeutic}} or preventative effects in humans and animals, {{as well as for}} enhanced feed conversion efficiency in livestock. Antibiotics can also cause undesirable effects in microbial populations, including selection for antibiotic resistance, enhanced pathogen invasion, and stimulation of horizontal gene transfer. Carbadox is a veterinary antibiotic used in the U. S. during the starter phase of swine production for improved feed efficiency and control of swine dysentery and bacterial swine enteritis. Carbadox has been shown in vitro to induce phage-encoded Shiga toxin in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and a phage-like element transferring antibiotic resistance genes in Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, but the effect <b>of</b> <b>carbadox</b> on prophages in other bacteria is unknown. This study examined carbadox exposure on prophage induction and genetic transfer in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a human foodborne pathogen that frequently colonizes swine without causing disease. S. Typhimurium LT 2 exposed to carbadox induced prophage production, resulting in bacterial cell lysis and release of virions that were visible by electron microscopy. <b>Carbadox</b> induction <b>of</b> phage-mediated gene transfer was confirmed by monitoring the transduction of a sodCIII::neo cassette in the Fels- 1 prophage from LT 2 to a recipient Salmonella strain. Furthermore, carbadox frequently induced generalized transducing phages in multidrug-resistant phage type DT 104 and DT 120 isolates, resulting in the transfer of chromosomal and plasmid DNA that included antibiotic resistance genes. Our research indicates that exposure <b>of</b> Salmonella to <b>carbadox</b> induces prophages that can transfer virulence and antibiotic resistance genes to susceptible bacterial hosts.
