5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|With an {{unconventional}} front-on bowling action, Meckiff progressed through the district cricket ranks at South Melbourne Cricket Club, making his first-class debut for Victoria in 1956–57. After a productive first season, Meckiff was named in a new-look Australian {{team for the}} 1957–58 tour of South Africa. This {{was the result of}} a generational change in the Australian Test team after a decline in performances in the 1950s. The shift saw Meckiff open the bowling in his debut Test, where he performed strongly to take eight wickets. Generating his pace from an unusual bent-arm action which involved a <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrist, Meckiff reached his peak in the Second Test of the 1958–59 season against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He took 6/38 in the second innings as England were dismissed for 87, setting up an Australian victory. His achievement was engulfed by controversy, as English media and former players accused him of throwing Australia to victory.|$|E
25|$|Aquatic species rarely display any {{particular}} specializations for jumping. Those {{that are good}} jumpers usually are primarily adapted for speed, and execute moving jumps by simply swimming to the surface at a high velocity. A few primarily aquatic species that can jump while on land, such as mud skippers, do so via a <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail.|$|E
50|$|Courtship {{involves}} singing, puffing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throat, bobbing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head, <b>flicking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail, ritual {{feeding and}} allopreening.|$|R

50|$|A final {{issue with}} this {{explanation}} is that {{there appears to be}} no delay between <b>the</b> <b>flicking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrist and <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image on the moon, a process that is expected if the photon resolution is correct. This does not invalidate <b>the</b> resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paradox. The apparent simultaneity is a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> light, and <b>the</b> observers inability to detect changes that fast. In ideal conditions the expected delay would be noticeable.|$|R
25|$|If the tubing label {{has been}} lost, a {{high-quality}} (chromoly or manganese) steel frame can {{be recognized by}} tapping it sharply with a <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fingernail. A high-quality frame will produce a bell-like ring where a regular-quality steel frame will produce a dull thunk. They can also be recognized by their weight (around 2.5kg for frame and forks) {{and the type of}} lugs and fork ends used.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013, Murphy won {{his second}} Donegal Senior Football Championship as Glenswilly {{defeated}} Killybegs by 3–19 to 2–6. Murphy scored 1–5 {{and set up}} Ciaran Bonner's goal with a deft <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heel. Murphy played less than 24 hours after captaining Ireland in the first 2013 International Rules Test win against Australia. Glenswilly progressed to the final of that year's Ulster Senior Club Football Championship, which they lost to Ballinderry, despite Murphy opening the scoring with a goal after 25 seconds and later assisting Caolan Kelly for a second.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} one cord (called the {{retention}} cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord,) it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the right moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered with a <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrist.|$|E
40|$|Tumor cells {{communicate}} with <b>the</b> cells <b>of</b> their microenvironment via {{a series of}} molecular and cellular interactions to aid their progression to a malignant state and ultimately their metastatic spread. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> cells in the microenvironment with {{a key role in}} cancer development, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most notable. Tumor cells release a range of chemokines, cytokines and growth factors to attract macrophages, and these in turn release numerous factors (e. g.

25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed with a <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a dangerous condition, as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, {{and the potential for}} an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} on tweening {{is used by}} a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a stroker. It {{can also be used}} to describe a stroker with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually smooth release. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker).|$|E
25|$|In Ohio, {{courts have}} held {{that the act of}} {{flashing}} one's headlights so as to alert oncoming drivers of a radar trap does not constitute the offense of obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties, where there was no proof that the warned vehicles were speeding prior to the warning. In another case, where a driver received a citation under an ordinance prohibiting flashing lights on a vehicle, a court held that the ordinance referred to the noun of flashing lights and did not prohibit the verb of flashing the headlights on a vehicle. In a different case, a court held that a momentary <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high beams is not a violation of Ohio R.C. 4513.15 (which prohibits drivers from aiming glaring rays into the eyes of oncoming drivers).|$|E

50|$|Having survived severe storms before, Indianola {{was almost}} totally {{destroyed}} on 16 September 1875.

2500|$|One {{theory about}} the Highland Fling {{is that it}} was a dance <b>of</b> triumph at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a battle. Another (no less romantic) theory {{is that it was}} {{performed}} before battles (like the sword dance), on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dancer's shield. The shield would have a spike in the middle, around which the dancer would do the dance that involves <b>flicking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feet, jumping and careful stepping supposedly to drive evil spirits away. The dancer is confined to one spot and snaps his fingers (which was reduced in recent times to merely holding the hands with the thumb touching <b>the</b> second joint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle finger, and the other three fingers extended in the air). Leaving aside <b>the</b> obvious difficulty <b>of</b> dancing around a sharpened spike on a shield, a much more plausible theory is that the Highland Fling is none other than a Foursome Reel with the progressive bits left out - at social gatherings, dancers would [...] "compete" [...] by showing off the fancy solo steps they could perform, long before formal competitions at highland games had been invented.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} some {{specialised}} passes {{that can be used}} during a rugby game. The 'dive-pass' is a pass which is sometimes used by the scrum-half if they are unable to get into the correct position for a long pass. The player dives as they release the ball, resulting in a quick pass. A 'flick-pass' is similar to a standard pass except the ball is passed with a <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrists, making it a faster pass but with less distance. The 'pop-pass' is a short pass where the ball is simply popped up in a small loop to a player. The 'gut-pass' is a pass straight into the stomach area of a player and is mostly used by the forwards when moving the ball back through a maul.|$|E
500|$|Later in the year, AC/DC {{released}} the self-produced album <b>Flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Switch, which was less successful than their previous albums, {{and was considered}} underdeveloped and unmemorable. One critic stated that the band [...] "had made the same album nine times". AC/DC were voted the eighth-biggest disappointment {{of the year in}} the 1984 Kerrang! readers' poll. However, <b>Flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Switch eventually reached No.4 on the UK charts, and AC/DC had minor success with the singles [...] "Nervous Shakedown" [...] and [...] "Flick of the Switch". Fly on the Wall, produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless. A music concept video of the same name featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.|$|E
500|$|The {{follow-up}} album, 1981's For Those About to Rock We Salute You, {{also sold}} well and was positively received by critics. The album featured {{two of the}} band's most popular singles: [...] "Let's Get It Up" [...] and the title track, [...] "For Those About to Rock", which reached No.13 and No.15 in the UK, respectively. The band split with Lange for their self-produced 1983 album, <b>Flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Switch, {{in an effort to}} recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums.|$|E

40|$|Local scour due to 2 -D {{submerged}} horizontal jets is {{a well-known}} topic of hydraulic research. If the jet is directly injected on the erodible bed and the tailwater depth is either deep or shallow, the equilibrium state characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scoured bed profile are mainly a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> densimetric Froude number. If the submergence lays between these two extremes, at fixed Froude number, three different scour regimes are possible. For relatively shallow tailwater depths, the jet mainstream directs towards the free surface (surface-jet scourhole regime), determining shallow and elongated scourhole profiles. For relatively large tailwater depths, the jet remains attached to the channel bottom (bed-jet scourhole regime), leading to deeper and shorter scourhole profiles. For intermediate conditions, <b>the</b> <b>flicking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet between the erodible bed and the water free-surface is possible. When this instability occurs, <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scourhole rapidly changes as a response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet mainstream position (bed-surface jet scourhole regime). This paper aims to give an experimental description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three mentioned regimes, in presence of a protection apron. Scourhole profile evolutions and velocity profile measurements on the apron are briefly discussed...|$|R
5|$|Antlion larvae {{are capable}} of {{capturing}} and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in <b>the</b> jaws <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larva are hollow and through this, the larva sucks <b>the</b> fluids out <b>of</b> its victim. After the contents are consumed, the dry carcass is <b>flicked</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pit.

500|$|A running gag {{throughout}} {{the series is}} the fact that Plankton is smaller than the other regular characters; he is easily stepped on and sent flying back to the Chum Bucket with a mere <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finger. His small size has led him to develop a Napoleon complex, which is occasionally manifested as a desire for global domination. He is a skillful inventor and regularly builds machines, both to help him in his plots, and for his own personal gain. Although he uses his intellect for evil, Plankton did not start out as a villainous scientist; he built Karen, his first invention, when he was friends with Mr. Krabs in grade school. Prominent in his earliest appearances, Plankton's catchphrase is [...] "I went to college!", uttered to illustrate the character's intelligence.|$|E
500|$|... "I sneaked {{up there}} a few times. And under the bright, unforgiving lights of television, I was able to {{encounter}} the real Michelangelo. I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you look closely at the angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E
500|$|Traditional {{means of}} capture varied across the birds' range and nets and rods {{were used in}} various ingenious ways. A typical device used in the Faroes was a [...] "fleyg". This was a long pole with a net on the end laid flat on the ground. A few dead puffins were strewn around to entice {{incoming}} birds to land, and the net was flicked upwards to scoop a bird from the air as it slowed before alighting. Most of the birds caught were sub-adults, and a skilled hunter could gather two or three hundred in a day. Another method of capture, used in St Kilda, involved {{the use of a}} flexible pole with a noose on the end. This was pushed along the ground towards the intended target, which advanced to inspect the noose as its curiosity overcame its caution. A <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrist would flip the noose over the victim's head and it was promptly killed, before its struggles could alarm other birds nearby.|$|E
50|$|Anderson {{has been}} married four times; her first three marriages were to: Bruce Hasselberg (1964-1966), Ross Bickell (1973-1981), and actor (and {{one-time}} co-star) Burt Reynolds (1988-1993). On May 17, 2008, Anderson married musician Bob <b>Flick,</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founding members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folk band The Brothers Four.

500|$|The {{common toad}} usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short {{shuffling}} jumps involving all four legs. It spends the day concealed in a lair {{that it has}} hollowed out under foliage or beneath a root or a stone where its colouring makes it inconspicuous. It emerges at dusk and may travel some distance in the dark while hunting. It is most active in wet weather. By morning it has returned to its base and may occupy the same place for several months. It is voracious and eats woodlice, slugs, beetles, caterpillars, flies, earthworms and even small mice. Small, fast moving prey may be caught by a <b>flick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue while larger items are grabbed with the jaws. Having no teeth, it swallows food whole {{in a series of}} gulps. It does not recognise its prey as such but will try to consume any small, dark coloured, moving object it encounters at night. A research study showed that it would snap at a moving [...] piece of black paper as if it were prey but would disregard a larger moving piece. Toads seem to use visual cues for feeding and can see their prey at very low light intensities where humans are unable to discern anything. Periodically, the common toad sheds its skin. This comes away in tattered pieces and is then consumed.|$|E

50|$|Forked tongues {{have evolved}} in these Squamate {{reptiles}} (lizards and snakes) for various purposes. The advantage {{to having a}} forked tongue is that more surface area is available for the chemicals to contact {{and the potential for}} tropotaxis. The tongue is <b>flicked</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth regularly to sample the chemical environment. This form of chemical sampling allows these animals to sense non-volatile chemicals, which cannot be detected by simply using the olfactory system. This increased ability to sense chemicals has allowed for heightened abilities to identify prey, recognize kin, choose mates, locate shelters, follow trails, and more.|$|R
