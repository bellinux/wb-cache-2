5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} a ward, was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or cistern. Over time the focus of <b>high</b> <b>status</b> accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the <b>high</b> <b>status</b> buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E
5|$|In some Pre-Columbian and North American cultures, labrets {{were seen}} as a status symbol. They were the oldest form of <b>high</b> <b>status</b> symbol among the Haida women, though the {{practice}} of wearing them died out due to Western influence.|$|E

25|$|After {{the normal}} lords was the tánaise ríg, who was {{supposed}} to be heir to the throne. He had higher property qualifications than the aire forgill, but his prime claim to <b>higher</b> <b>status</b> was that he would one day be king. Kings held the <b>highest</b> <b>status</b> that the laws describe. The basic king had an honour price of seven cumals, and higher kings had yet a <b>higher</b> <b>status.</b> Having the <b>highest</b> <b>status,</b> the king especially was expected to be careful to keep his honour. Cowardice, as demonstrated in flight from battle, as well as taking up manual labour might cost him his honour-price.|$|R

5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only <b>high</b> <b>status</b> prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{occupied}} a rare position in seventeenth-century England, {{as a person}} of common birth who rose {{to a position of}} <b>high</b> <b>status</b> as an independently wealthy, unmarried woman running a substantial business enterprise. She figures in a wide assortment of contemporary literature and songs, in ballads, poems, broadsides, novels and party pamphlets, often portrayed as a caricature of vice, a satirical figure of street commentary, sexual theatre and political bawdry.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{was in a}} rare {{position}} for many reasons. Although she was of common birth, a woman and unmarried, she rose {{to a position of}} <b>high</b> <b>status,</b> running a large business enterprise. By mid-life she was an independently wealthy woman, connected across England to rich and powerful men in government and the court. Her network of services were in high demand, counter to the religious and social morals of the day.|$|E

5|$|The {{supposedly}} <b>higher</b> <b>status</b> of cavalry in the 4th {{century is}} also open to doubt. This view is {{largely based on}} underestimating the importance of cavalry in the 2nd century.

5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of {{preparation for a}} fancy dress party would have been familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience. In both London and the English provincial cities, such balls and parties had become extremely fashionable by the 1830s.

5|$|The professions of architect, master craftsman, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer {{did not have}} the <b>high</b> <b>status</b> of the Confucian scholar-officials during the dynastic era. Architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years, usually from craftsman fathers to their sons. There were also government agencies and schools for construction, building, and engineering. The Song dynasty's building manuals aided not only the various private workshops, but also the craftsmen employed by the central government.|$|E

5|$|A {{panelled}} stone {{structure in}} the church, carved with processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in the Book of Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a sarcophagus built to hold {{the remains of a}} <b>high</b> <b>status</b> person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their similarity to the illustrations in the Book of Cerne to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the Benedictine monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics {{dating to}} the Terminal Classic period are {{uncommon}} outside of the site core, suggesting that {{the population of the}} city was concentrated in the city centre in the final phase of Calakmul's occupation. The majority of the surviving population probably consisted of commoners who had occupied the elite architecture of the site core but the continued erection of stelae into the early 10th century and the presence of <b>high</b> <b>status</b> imported goods such as metal, obsidian, jade and shell, indicate a continued occupation by royalty until the final abandonment of the city. The Yucatec-speaking Kejache Maya who lived in the region at the time of Spanish contact in the early 16th century may have been the descendants of the inhabitants of Calakmul.|$|E
5|$|Focusing on the {{cultural}} and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has put forward a revisionist interpretation of the castle's architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle {{was intended to be}} entered from {{the north end of the}} Lower Court, passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and then up into the Inner Court. This would have provided <b>high</b> <b>status</b> visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political prestige of the owners. Historian Magnus Alexander disputes the practicality of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.|$|E

5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was {{symbolic of the}} <b>high</b> <b>status</b> of the Elves, the firstborn of the races of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became symbolic of the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya tongue. In the Third Age, {{the time of the}} setting of The Lord of the Rings, Quenya was learnt as a second language by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in spoken and written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E
5|$|Margiris, {{the defender}} of Pilėnai, is often {{suggested}} {{as the most}} likely candidate for the fourth brother. The chronicles of Hermann de Wartberge mention that in 1329 Gediminas {{and two of his}} brothers raided Livonia. By that time Vytenis was already dead and Fiodor was probably occupied with establishing himself in Kiev. One of these two brothers must then have been Vainius; the identity of the other still puzzles historians. Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that he was Margiris because sources attest to his <b>high</b> <b>status</b> and wealth. Sources mention one son of Margiris, who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father's suicide in 1336 and did not return.|$|E
5|$|Mellor hill fort is a prehistoric site in North West England, {{that dates}} from the British Iron Age—about 800 BC to 100 AD. Situated on a hill in Mellor, Greater Manchester, on {{the western edge of}} the Peak District, the hill fort overlooks the Cheshire Plain. Although the {{settlement}} was founded during the Iron Age, evidence exists of activity on the site as far back as 8,000BC; during the Bronze Age the hill may have been an area where funerary practices were performed. Artefacts such as a Bronze Age amber necklace indicate the site was <b>high</b> <b>status</b> and that its residents took part in long-distance trade. The settlement was occupied into the Roman period. After the site was abandoned, probably in the 4th century, it was forgotten until its rediscovery in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1100 Henry married Matilda, the {{daughter}} of Malcolm III of Scotland. Henry was now around 31 years old, but late marriages for noblemen were not unusual in the 11th century. The pair had probably first met earlier the previous decade, possibly being introduced through Bishop Osmund of Salisbury. Historian Warren Hollister argues that Henry and Matilda were emotionally close, but their union was also certainly politically motivated. Matilda had originally been named Edith, an Anglo-Saxon name, {{and was a member}} of the West Saxon royal family, being the niece of Edgar the Ætheling, the great-granddaughter of Edmund Ironside and a descendant of Alfred the Great. For Henry, marrying Matilda gave his reign increased legitimacy, and for Matilda, an ambitious woman, it was an opportunity for <b>high</b> <b>status</b> and power in England.|$|E
5|$|One of the barrows (south {{of where}} the {{thatched}} barn now stands) contained a <b>high</b> <b>status</b> cremation of a woman of about twenty years in age, accompanied by an incense cup, a halberd-style pendant made from amber and copper alloy, and two gold cones that would have covered buttons of an organic material. The burial-goods recovered {{are similar to those}} of the Wessex culture, the Wilsford and Dorset Ridgeway series in particular. An urn from one of the barrows likely to have been made between 1700 and 1500 B.C., has been identified as Trevisker ware, a type widely found throughout Devon and Cornwall which was transported east in lesser amounts, this find being one of the easternmost discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Earls of Morton {{continued}} to live at Aberdour, although they never regained their earlier <b>high</b> <b>status.</b> In 1688 the castle was badly damaged by fire, and in 1690 the 11th Earl consulted the architect James Smith. Smith surveyed the damage and drew up proposals for repairing and extending the castle with another wing north of the east range. The Earl also sought estimates for the demolition of the tower house and central range. Nothing ever came of these proposals, although repairs were carried out to the east range, being completed in 1703.|$|E
