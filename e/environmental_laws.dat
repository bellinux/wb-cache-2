5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot.

While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the <b>environmental</b> <b>laws</b> under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of <b>environmental</b> <b>laws.</b> They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E
5|$|The FBI raid {{led to the}} {{formation}} of Colorado's first special grand jury, the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds. This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the GAO, and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record. Due to DOE indemnification of its contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers. While any criminal penalties allotted to Rockwell would not have been covered by U.S. taxpayers, Rockwell claimed that the Department of Energy had specifically exempted them from most <b>environmental</b> <b>laws,</b> including hazardous waste.|$|E

The research shows that current <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> does not foster eco-innovation. It also shows that <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> indeed sometimes hampers eco-innovations, but that a transparent process, involving all stakeholders from the start, limits this risk and allows for circumnavigation of the possible legal obstacles...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper for}} the {{launching}} of the journal Transnational <b>Environmental</b> <b>Law</b> first sets forth a concept of transnational <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> that encompasses but is broader than international <b>environmental</b> <b>law.</b> When we speak of transnational law and legal process, we {{are concerned with the}} migration and impact of legal norms, rules and models across borders. Such migration can occur through the mediation of international law and institutions, or through the impact of unilateral legal developments in one jurisdiction that affect behavior in others. The paper then discusses the importance of assessing transnational <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> in light of the constraints facing consent-based international <b>environmental</b> <b>law,</b> examines the tradeoffs between transnational and international <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> from the perspective of legitimacy, and concludes by discussing the important but delicate relation of international <b>law</b> to transnational <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> as both a check and a consolidator. International law should guard against the self-serving unilateral use of transnational <b>environmental</b> <b>law,</b> but it should do so in a way that preserves (and does not shut off) the dynamic, responsive character of the transnational <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> process. Otherwise international law itself will be delegitimized...|$|R

40|$|This short {{paper offers}} three propositions to help {{maintain}} the traditional core of <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> while also expanding environmental concerns into the frontiers of the field: 1. <b>Environmental</b> <b>law</b> in the heartland and <b>environmental</b> <b>law</b> at the frontiers of the field differ in important ways. 2.
