This principle informed Koppelman's art, teaching, and his work as an Aesthetic Realism consultant. About the importance of this principle to art and life, Koppelman stated, [...] "When Eli Siegel showed that what makes a work of art beautiful [...] the oneness of opposites [...] is the same as what every individual wants, {{it was one of the}} mightiest and kindest achievements of man's mind".|$|E
500|$|Sheffield United Academy U18s {{played in}} the FA Premier Academy League U18s Group D at the Shirecliffe ground at Firshill Crescent. [...] Under the {{management}} of John Pemberton, the side were seeking to replicate {{the success of the}} previous season when they had reached the final of the FA Youth Cup final. [...] Shorn of a number of key players (who had either graduated to the first team or left the club), the team completed a solid but unspectacular season. [...] Results fluctuated with impressive victories over the likes of Everton, Bolton and Sunderland being mixed with heavy defeats to Leeds United, Coventry City and West Ham United. [...] Eventually finishing fifth (out of ten teams) in their division, manager John Pemberton described the season as [...] "another successful one for everyone associated with the Academy. We have five players becoming professionals who will all be linking up with the first team next season and that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> judged on – producing players." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{held two}} Organized Team Activities (OTAs) {{prior to the}} draft, in {{addition}} to 12 throughout May and June. The OTAs were voluntary, however, most players did attend. Many players routinely worked on their conditioning and strength together, in addition to [...] "informal" [...] on field training. A week prior {{to the end of}} OTAs Mike Tomlin said he was happy with the team's progress during the sessions. Also stating, “We are having a productive off-season and that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> here for. We are here to get better individually and collectively and I think we are doing that.” Limas Sweed experimented on special teams play for the first time ever, with a concentration in punt blocking. On the day of the final OTA, June 12, Tomlin stated that while he was pleased with the progress of the team, no positions would be gained or lost based on the voluntary camp. Tomlin added, [...] "it's been teach-oriented, it's been skill-develop-oriented. It's different than playing the game of football." [...] The team was given 44days off until the beginning of training camp.|$|E

500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|As above, let [...] denote a {{translation}} operator that shifts every wave function {{by the amount}} , where ni are integers.

2500|$|The {{practice}} which monks in {{the tradition}} generally begin with are meditations on what Ajaan Mun called the five “root meditation themes”: the hair of the head, the hair of the body, the nails, the teeth, and the skin. One {{of the purposes of}} meditating on these externally visible aspects of the body is to counter the infatuation with the body, and to develop a sense of dispassion. Of the five, the skin is described as being especially significant. Ajaan Mun writes that “When we get infatuated with the human body, the skin <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> infatuated with. When we conceive of the body as being beautiful and attractive, and develop love, desire, and longing for it, it's because of what we conceive of the skin.” ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{solution}} {{method is}} to label the card faces, for example numbers 1 through 6. Label {{the faces of the}} black card 1 and 2; label the faces of the mixed card 3 (black) and 4 (white); and label the faces of the white card 5 and 6. The observed black face could be 1, 2, or 3, all equally likely; if it is 1 or 2, the other side is black, and if it is 3, the other side is white. The probability that the other side is black is [...] This probability can be derived in the following manner: Let random variable B equal the a black face (i.e. the probability of a success since the black face <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> looking for). Using Kolmogrov's Axiom of all probabilities having to equal 1, we can conclude that the probability of drawing a white face is 1−P(B). Since P(B)=P(1)+P(2) therefore P(B)=+=. Likewise we can do this P(white face)=1−=.|$|E
2500|$|Moravia once {{remarked that}} the most {{important}} facts of his life had been his illness, a tubercular infection of the bones that confined him to a bed for five years and Fascism, because they both caused him to suffer and do things he otherwise would not have done. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> forced to do that forms our character, not what we do of our own free will." [...] Moravia was an atheist. His writing was marked by its factual, cold, precise style, often depicting the malaise of the bourgeoisie. It was rooted in the tradition of nineteenth-century narrative, underpinned by high social and cultural awareness. Moravia believed that writers must, if they were to represent reality, [...] "assume a moral position, a clearly conceived political, social, and philosophical attitude" [...] but also that, ultimately, [...] "A writer survives in spite of his beliefs". Between 1959 and 1962 Moravia was president of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers.|$|E

Others who received votes were: Andorra, Iran, Jordan, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Thailand and Tunisia.

Namibia, Macedonia and Vietnam were elected for the first time. The minimum required votes was 97.
