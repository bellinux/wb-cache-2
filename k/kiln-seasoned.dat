5000|$|Balsa lumber is {{very soft}} and light, with a coarse, open grain. The density of dry balsa wood ranges from , with a typical density of about [...] The {{wood of the}} living tree has large cells that are filled with water. This gives the wood a spongy texture. It also makes the wood of the living tree not much lighter than water and barely able to float. For {{commercial}} production, the wood is kiln-dried for about two weeks, leaving the cells hollow and empty. The large volume-to-surface ratio of the resulting thin-walled empty cells gives the dried wood a large strength-to-weight ratio because the cells are mostly air. Unlike naturally rotted wood, that soon disintegrates in the rainforests where balsa trees grow, the cell walls of <b>kiln-seasoned</b> balsa wood retain their strong structure of cellulose and lignin. Because it is low-density but high in strength, balsa is a very popular material for light, stiff structures in model bridge tests, model buildings, and {{for the construction of}} model aircraft; all grades are usable for airworthy control line and radio-controlled aircraft varieties of the aeromodeling sports, with the lightest [...] "contest grades" [...] especially valuable for free flight model aircraft. However, it also is valued as a component of full-sized light wooden aeroplanes, most notably the World War II de Havilland Mosquito.|$|E
