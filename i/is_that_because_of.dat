25|$|In 1930, the {{boundaries}} between the 88 constellations were devised by Eugène Delporte along vertical and horizontal lines of right ascension and declination. However, the data he used originated back to epoch B1875.0, which was when Benjamin A. Gould first made his proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work. The consequence of this early date <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the precession of the equinoxes, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch J2000, are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal. This effect will increase {{over the years and}} centuries to come.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a survey}} by the {{regulatory}} body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. One of the reasons <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes.|$|E
25|$|The Shias {{accept some}} of the same hadiths used by Sunnis as part of the sunnah to argue their case. In addition, they {{consider}} the sayings of Ahl al-Bayt that are not attributed directly to Muhammad as hadiths. Shias do not accept many Sunni hadiths unless they are also recorded in Shia sources or the methodology can be proven of how they were recorded. Also, some Sunni-accepted hadith are less favored by Shias; one example <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Aisha's opposition to Ali, hadiths narrated by Aisha are not given the same authority as those by other companions. Another example is hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah, who is considered by Shias as the enemy of Ali. The Shia argument is that Abu Hurairah was only a Muslim four years of his life before Muhammad's death. Although he accompanied Muhammad for four years only, he managed to record ten times as many hadiths as Abu Bakr and Ali each.|$|E

500|$|Between Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977, Fonda did {{not have}} a major film success. She {{appeared}} in A Doll's House (1973), Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: [...] "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted." [...] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. [...] "The suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed." [...] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.|$|E
500|$|The {{sociologist}} Miriam M. Johnson {{wrote that}} Bell et al.′s {{study was the}} [...] "largest, best-designed, {{and one of the}} least heterosexist investigations" [...] of the development of sexual preference. In her view, its only possible bias <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its nature and San Francisco location [...] "activist" [...] homosexuals were over-represented. Johnson argued that [...] "this bias would probably work against finding support for any hypotheses concerning parental influences, because activist homosexuals have ordinarily been opposed to psychoanalytic speculations about parental involvements." [...] Johnson concluded, however, that the study′s credibility was enhanced by the fact that Bell et al. took into account whether their respondents had been exposed to books or articles about the etiology of homosexuality, and disregarded results when they could be explained by such exposure. Johnson credited Bell et al. with showing that [...] "almost all the alleged causes of adult sexual orientation are either nonexistent or highly exaggerated", but considered their claim that they had refuted psychoanalytic theories that attribute homosexuality to an unresolved Oedipus complex only [...] "half true", given the father findings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} tale that biographers tell {{is the story}} of Armstrong as a young boy dancing for pennies in the streets of New Orleans, who would scoop up the coins off of the streets and stick them into his mouth to avoid having the bigger {{children}} steal them from him. Someone dubbed him [...] "satchel mouth" [...] for his mouth acting as a satchel. Another tale <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his large mouth, he was nicknamed [...] "satchel mouth" [...] which became shortened to Satchmo.|$|E

To claim that you didn’t know is now unacceptable.". Stephen Matthew, a partner in the project group at corporate law firm Nabarro, advises: [...] "Councils and regeneration bodies still need to be very open and clear about how they intend to deal with material on brownfield sites. Councils need to take professional advice... Don't leave a gaping hole for any future class actions." ...|$|E

She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed adapted curved corrals, intended to reduce stress, panic and injury in animals being led to slaughter. This {{has proved to be}} a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep, godlike connection to them.|$|E
2500|$|Because of this hypervisibility from symbols {{like the}} veil, {{it makes it}} {{difficult}} to talk about the realities of Arab and Arab American women's lives, [...] "without invoking, and necessarily responding to, the looming image and story that the mythology of the veil tells", she goes on to state that the veil is not the only symbol, there are others such as [...] "honor killings" [...] and [...] "stoning". [...] The argument that is being made <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> these symbols it is hard to talk about anything else that is currently taking place in the lives of Arab and Arab American women. Theses symbols make it difficult to focus on other important issues, however Jarmakani states that because of this hypervisibility Arab feminists can take advantage of it. She builds her argument off of Joe Kadi from her essay, [...] "Speaking about Silence" [...] where Joe argues that those who are silenced or being forced into being silent can break this silence by speaking out. Jarmakani argues that unlike Joe who said one should speak out, Jarmakani is stating to use the silence, meaning that Arab women should use the hypervisibility that is being given by the symbols of invisibility.

2500|$|Originally, {{there were}} three Tanith regiments raised for the Imperial Guard: the Tanith 1st, 2nd and 3rd – 6,000 men and {{a small number of}} {{vehicles}} and artillery pieces. When Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt was sent to Tanith to oversee the founding of these regiments, he was not impressed by the appearance of the men, initially describing them as [...] "a scrawny, scruffy mob of soft-voiced woodsmen". His opinion of them changed quickly after seeing them in combat. He impatiently ordered the regiments to begin boarding the carriers that will take them to the troop ships waiting to ferry them to their first war zones – a fortunate move which gets enough men off-world before the Chaos fleet strikes Tanith the same night. He confirms after leaving Tanith that this salvages three and a half thousand men and the majority of their equipment. It is unclear which regiments actually were saved from the fires of Tanith, but the remaining men are formed into the Tanith First, which is soon named the [...] "Tanith First-and-Only". On the regiment's first battlefield on Blackshard, Hlaine Larkin coins the nickname [...] "Gaunt's Ghosts". The term Ghosts has two meanings: the first is that Corbec tells Gaunt that his decision to abandon Tanith [...] "made ghosts of them, hollow echoes". [...] The second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their exceptional stealth and scouting skills, they are ghost-like on the battlefield. The Tanith First excels at recon work as the Tanith never get lost, and using camo-cloaks they can move quickly and stealthily through terrain.|$|E
60|$|DEAR WILLIAM:--Your {{letter of}} the 19th ultimo was {{received}} last night, and for which I am much obliged. The only thing in it that I wish {{to talk to you}} at once about <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> my vote for Ashmun's amendment you fear that you and I disagree about the war. I regret this, not because of any fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter, but because if you misunderstand I fear other good friends may also. That vote affirms that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President; and I will stake my life that if you had been in my place you would have voted just as I did. Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie? I know you would not. Would you have gone out of the House--skulked the vote? I expect not. If you had skulked one vote, you would have had to skulk many more {{before the end of the}} session. Richardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move or gave any vote upon the subject, make the direct question of the justice of the war; so that no man can be silent if he would. You are compelled to speak; and your only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie. I cannot doubt which you would do.|$|E
