40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{spelling}} pronunciation, a term coined by Emil Koeppel in 1901. Scholarly discussions provide several implications. Firstly, {{it is the}} relationship between phonemes and their graphic representation. In English, the phoneme-grapheme relations are in disbalance. This applies especially to vowels but also to several consonants, where digraphs, for example, are mostly ambiguous and very dependent on surroundings. A typical example of the poor grapheme-phoneme relations is represented by, which can be either [ʃ], or [tʃ], or even [k]. At the same time, spelling pronunciation is also regarded as a process of language change and it is believed that spelling pronunciation is also governed by analogy. It is generally believed by scholars that spelling pronunciation is more likely to occur in unusual structures or in words which have weaker 'oral tradition'. From the <b>historical</b> perspective, <b>spelling</b> pronunciation is very related to etymological respellings. One of the main premises is that spelling pronunciation is rooted in the notion that pronunciation should reflect spelling, which was most likely introduced and induced by 18 th century orthoepists and standardisation of English spelling. Although {{much has been written about}} spelling pronunciation and its relations, no paper so [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an annotated corpus which forms a challenging testbed for geographical text analysis methods. This dataset, the Corpus of Lake District Writing (CLDW), consists of 80 manually digitised and annotated texts (comprising over 1. 5 million word tokens). These texts were originally composed between 1622 and 1900, and they represent a range of different genres and authors. Collectively, the texts in the CLDW constitute an indicative sample of writing about the English Lake District during the early seventeenth century and the early twentieth century. The corpus is annotated more deeply than is currently possible with vanilla Named Entity Recognition, Disambiguation and geoparsing. This is especially true of the geographical information the corpus contains, since we have undertaken not only to link different <b>historical</b> and <b>spelling</b> variants of place-names, but also to identify and to differentiate geographical features such as waterfalls, woodlands, farms or inns. In addition, we illustrate the potential of the corpus as a gold standard by evaluating the results of three different NLP libraries and geoparsers on its contents. In the evaluation, the standard NER processing of the text by the different NLP libraries produces many false positive and false negative results, showing the strength of the gold standard...|$|R

5000|$|French orthography {{encompasses}} the spelling and punctuation of the French language. It {{is based on}} a combination of phonemic and <b>historical</b> principles. The <b>spelling</b> of words is largely based on the pronunciation of Old French c. 1100-1200 CE and has stayed {{more or less the same}} since then, despite enormous changes to the pronunciation of the language in the intervening years. This has resulted in a complicated relationship between spelling and sound, especially for vowels, a multitude of silent letters, and a large number of homophones (e.g., ///// (all pronounced [...] ), // (all pronounced [...] )). Later attempts to respell some words in accordance with their Latin etymologies further increased the number of silent letters (e.g., [...] vs. older [...] - compare English [...] "tense", which reflects the original spelling - and [...] vs. older [...] ). Nevertheless, there are rules governing French orthography which allow for a reasonable degree of accuracy when pronouncing French words from their written forms. The reverse operation, producing written forms from a pronunciation, is much more ambiguous.|$|R
