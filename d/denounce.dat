5|$|At {{the same}} time the website MoveOn.org {{released}} an ad that slammed General Petraeus, calling him a traitor. Dodd voted against a Congressional act to <b>denounce</b> the ad on September 21.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{and other}} dignitaries were often in {{attendance}} at the cathedral, and the court occasionally held session there. The building was also the scene of several incidents of mediaeval intrigue. In 1191, whilst King Richard I was in Palestine, his brother John summoned a council of bishops to St Paul's to <b>denounce</b> William de Longchamp, Bishop of Ely—to whom Richard had entrusted the affairs of government—for treason.|$|E
5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I {{and the prospect of}} a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and The Defender contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, but he did not <b>denounce</b> the nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E

50|$|Chikuzan whole-heartedly <b>denounced</b> Ogyū Sorai and {{contended that}} all people have potential, even commoners could become scholars, while he also <b>denounced</b> {{religion}} and superstition.|$|R
5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to <b>denounce,</b> as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer {{suffers a}} back injury from the rodeo and sees a chiropractor, but does not follow his instructions. Later, Homer falls {{backwards}} onto a round garbage can at home and discovers that it solved his back problems. He makes a business out of his discovery, which proves {{to be a successful}} method of solving problems with pain, causing the chiropractic business decline until the chiropractors in town <b>denounce</b> the method and destroy the garbage can at the Simpsons' home.|$|E
5|$|Ministers of {{the church}} {{reported}} that {{the site of a}} newly constructed temple in Silao was subject to harassment of its members, vandalism, and physical threats because of religious intolerance, which caused them to request increased police protection. In February 2012, seventy ministers of La Luz del Mundo from different nations appeared before Mexican authorities in Guadalajara to <b>denounce</b> the lack of police protection for the church's residents in the city after a series of attacks left several members hospitalized.|$|E
5000|$|He {{continued}} to publish {{in the same}} vein, often <b>denouncing</b> authors from his avowed specialty, French literature. He also criticized Francis Bacon and <b>denounced</b> literary [...] naturalism and utilitarianism.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} large protests in Budapest, one on 17 March {{and another on}} 30 December, at which protesters chanted slogans <b>denouncing</b> Orbán, and carried {{placards}} <b>denouncing</b> his [...] "dictatorship".|$|R

5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition {{of blacks in}} the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to <b>denounce</b> the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's {{four-year}} term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, {{which included the}} building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, {{and gave him a}} reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant civil rights movement were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to <b>denounce</b> a planned demonstration in support of the victims.|$|E
5|$|Angry at his {{treatment}} by the Byers enquiry, Scott sought {{other means of}} pursuing his vendetta against Thorpe. In June 1971 he met Gordon Winter, a South African journalist who was also an agent for the South African intelligence agency BOSS. Scott provided details of his supposed seduction by Thorpe, a story which Winter assured his BOSS masters would destroy Thorpe and the Liberal Party. He found that no newspaper would print the story on largely uncorroborated and unreliable evidence. In March 1972 Scott's friend Gwen Parry-Jones died; Scott used the inquest to <b>denounce</b> Thorpe for ruining his life and driving Parry-Jones to her death. None of these accusations was published. Depressed, Scott retreated {{into a state of}} torpor, assisted by tranquilisers, and for a while presented no threat to Thorpe.|$|E

50|$|As of 2013, the {{convention}} had been ratified by 46 states. Of the ratifying states, 12 had <b>denounced</b> the treaty by an automatic process which <b>denounces</b> the 1952 convention {{when the state}} ratifies a superseding treaty.|$|R
50|$|The {{document}} was <b>denounced</b> worldwide as hegemonic, {{especially in the}} United States, which also had designs on accessing Iranian oil fields. Eventually, the Anglo-Persian agreement was formally <b>denounced</b> by the Iranian Parliament (Majlis) on June 22, 1921.|$|R
5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} are dying from {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to <b>denounce</b> nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E
5|$|Dworkin {{authored}} ten {{books of}} radical feminist theory and numerous speeches and articles, each designed to assert {{the presence of}} and <b>denounce</b> institutionalized and normalized harm against women. She {{became one of the}} most influential writers and spokeswomen of American radical feminism during the late 1970s and the 1980s. She characterized pornography as an industry of damaging objectification and abuse, not merely a fantasy realm. She discussed prostitution as a system of exploitation, and intercourse as a key site of subordination in patriarchy. Her analysis and writing influenced and inspired the work of contemporary feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, John Stoltenberg, Nikki Craft, Susan Cole, and Amy Elman.|$|E
5|$|Gary {{uses the}} novel {{as a vehicle to}} <b>denounce</b> both racism and the activists {{supporting}} African-American rights, including his own ex-wife and Marlon Brando. He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and whether they can be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story to focus more on the dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
50|$|Three councils were held, two by Constantinople, one by Rome. Rome {{attempted}} {{to replace a}} seated Patriarch with one amenable to the Filioque dispute. The Orthodox responded by <b>denouncing</b> the replacement and excommunicating the pope convening the Roman council, <b>denouncing</b> the pope's attempt to control affairs outside the purview of Rome, and <b>denouncing</b> the addition of Filioque as a heresy. Each church recognizes its own council(s) as legitimate and does not recognize the other's council(s).|$|R

50|$|As of 2013, the {{convention}} has been ratified by 30 states. Of these ratifying states, one—Bosnia and Herzegovina—has <b>denounced</b> the treaty via an automatic process that <b>denounces</b> the 1959 convention when a superseding convention is {{ratified by the}} same state.|$|R
5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and <b>denounce</b> two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to the}} Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to <b>denounce</b> Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, WKMS {{reported}} that Bevin had remained politically {{active in the}} aftermath of his defeat by McConnell, and an email to his followers calling on Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, a Democrat, to <b>denounce</b> new carbon regulations issued by the EPA fueled speculation that Bevin would seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2015. The station also cited an anonymous source that said Bevin would campaign for Rand Paul's Senate seat in 2016 if Paul's expected presidential bid kept him from running for re-election. An August 2014 survey by Public Policy Polling showed that 25% of Republicans wanted Bevin to be the party's gubernatorial nominee, ahead of declared candidates James Comer (20%) and Hal Heiner (18%).|$|E
50|$|As of 2013, the {{convention}} has been ratified by 34 states. Of the ratifying states, 20 have <b>denounced</b> the treaty {{by means of}} an automatic process that <b>denounces</b> the 1938 treaty when other superseding conventions are ratified by the same state.|$|R
50|$|As of 2013, the {{convention}} has been ratified by 42 states. Of the ratifying states, 18 have subsequently <b>denounced</b> {{the convention}}, some by an automatic process that <b>denounces</b> the 1949 convention when another superseding convention is {{ratified by the}} same state.|$|R
50|$|The CRC <b>denounces</b> Vatican II, {{which it}} {{considers}} as a legitimately convoked ecumenical council, yet they accuse it of many errors because it {{chose not to}} speak infallibly. For example, the movement <b>denounces</b> the ecumenical dialogue and worship of man.|$|R
5|$|On 15 July 1942, Mihailović sent a {{telegram}} to the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{asking them to}} publicly <b>denounce</b> Ljotić, Nedić and the openly collaborationist Chetnik leader Kosta Pećanac as traitors. The Yugoslav government-in-exile responded by doing so publicly over BBC Radio. In October, Ljotić was forced to withdraw his two representatives in the Serbian puppet government {{in order to avoid}} being held responsible for the unpopular and difficult economic measures and food policies enacted by Nedić that month. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, Montenegrin Chetnik commander Pavle Đurišić established ties with Ljotić. Ljotić later provided Đurišić with weapons, food, typewriters, and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|The Ententist bid {{resulted}} in major initial defeats, and a Romanian theater of war was opened. The country suffered heavily, and Bucharest {{was taken by}} the Central Powers. Reputedly, the occupation forces picked up Bogdan-Pitești from his cell at Văcărești, where he was still serving time. Like Arghezi, Macedonski, Galaction and Mateiu Caragiale, he remained in German-occupied territory. Despite his apparent triumph over the Ententist lobby, he kept a low profile: according to popular but unverifiable rumors, he was even arrested once the occupation authorities angrily discovered his uselessness for the cause. He was however a free man as of April 12, 1917, the date of his marriage to Domnica Colanoski. One account has it that Bogdan-Pitești proceeded to <b>denounce</b> his Ileana colleague, Petrescu Găină, who had published a set of anti-German cartoons. As a result, the Romanian draftsman spent the war years in German captivity.|$|E
5|$|After 875/6 {{he entered}} into open {{conflict}} with al-Muwaffaq, who {{tried unsuccessfully to}} unseat him. In 878, {{with the support of}} al-Muwaffaq's brother, Caliph al-Mu'tamid, Ibn Tulun took over the governance of Syria as well as the frontier districts with the Byzantine Empire, although control of Tarsus in particular proved tenuous. During his absence in Syria, his eldest son and deputy, Abbas, tried to usurp power in Egypt, leading to the imprisonment of Abbas and the nomination of Ibn Tulun's second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir. The defection in 882 of a senior commander, Lu'lu', to al-Muwaffaq, and the defection of Tarsus, forced Ibn Tulun to return to Syria. Now virtually powerless, al-Mu'tamid tried to escape from his brother's control to Ibn Tulun's domains but was captured by al-Muwaffaq's agents, and Ibn Tulun convened an assembly of jurists at Damascus to <b>denounce</b> al-Muwaffaq as a usurper. His attempt in autumn 883 to bring Tarsus to heel failed, and he fell sick. Returning to Egypt, he died in May 884 and was succeeded by Khumarawayh.|$|E
