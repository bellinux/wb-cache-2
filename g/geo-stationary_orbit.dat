40|$|The Martian human {{missions}} {{will need}} heavy launchers with payloads in earth orbit {{in the range}} of 80 to 150 tons. Previous launchers of this size were the American Saturn 5 and the Russian Energya. The industrial tool to produce these launchers is no more available. Some projects more or less based upon the shuttle hardware have been studied in the past years in the USA (Shuttle C, Magnum, Star Eagle, …). In the beginning of the 90 s, in Europe, CNES studied a heavy version of ARIANE 5. The development of a heavy launcher will probably be, as the whole Martian program, an international endeavour building on the engines and stages operationally used for commercial launchers in the next twenty years to reduce the costs. Thus we may already have an idea of the configuration of this heavy international launcher. The need for such a launcher will probably remain unchanged for decades. For Martian missions the progresses in space propulsion will reduce the propellant mass and/or reduce the travel time but the low earth orbit mass will remain the same.

40|$|Ground-based telescopes {{routinely}} acquire temporal brightness {{measurements of}} satellites in <b>geo-stationary</b> and geo-synchronous <b>orbit</b> that provide valuable characterization information. For instance, GEO satellites {{that are not}} stabilized tend to rotate, and produce brightnesses that vary in time with frequencies corresponding to rotation rates. Temporal brightness patterns can also be exploited to characterize stabilized GEO satellites. For example, many operational GEO satellites have solar panels that glint when they reflect sunlight towards an observer in a mirror-like fashion. These well-known solar panel glints can be remarkably bright, often exceeding several stellar magnitudes in amplitude. Measured brightnesses and times of these glints can be exploited to estimate the size, segmentation, and alignment of the solar array, valuable information about the satellite’s power generation and consumption capabilities. However, satellites can produce other glints {{in addition to those}} originating from solar panels. These glints can be much fainter, with amplitudes as small as 0. 2 magnitudes. Several observations of GEO satellites show several such glints occurring during the span of a single night. Furthermore, many of these recur from night to night when observed from a single ground-based site, but with subtle, incremental changes in both peak times and brightnesses. These fainter glints must originate from reflective elements mounted on the satellite’s main bus, solar panel structure, or other peripheral structures that might be stationary or moving with respect to the main bus. Our analysis indicates that such glints can be exploited for GEO satellite characterization. ...|$|R
40|$|Different maxima in the Leonid {{activity}} {{observed in}} the same year can be identified as due to dust particles ejected during different perihelion passages of the parent comet, 55 P/Tempel-Tuttle. This is because the ecliptic intersections of trajectories of particles that were ejected during different comet apparitions lie well separated in the ecliptic plane. For November 2001, we determine the ecliptic intersection points of particles originating from various apparitions of 55 P/Tempel-Tuttle and thus predict the times of maximum Leonid activity. By comparing this year's configuration with the past, we also give an estimate of the flux that might be expected in 2001. As light flashes due to Leonid impacts on the Moon can be detected on Earth, we give the times of closest approaches of dust trails to the Moon. By comparing the predicted Leonid meteoroid flux on the Earth's atmosphere with the flux of sporadic meteoroids, we estimate that the hazard of a Leonid impact on a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit is low. However, the densest part of the Leonid trails will not reach Earth, but will cross the <b>geo-stationary</b> <b>orbit</b> (GEO) ring. The impact risk will reach its maximum for GEO satellites at longitudes between 35 ° and 160 ° W between 17. 00 and 20. 00 UT on 18 November 2001.

40|$|The Argus {{reusable}} {{launch vehicle}} (RLV) concept is a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) conical, wingedbodied vehicle powered by two liquid hydrogen (LH 2) /liquid oxygen (LOX) supercharged ejector ramjets (SERJ). The 3 rd generation Argus launch vehicle utilizes advanced vehicle technologies along with a magnetic levitation (Maglev) launch assist track. A tanker version of the Argus RLV is envisioned to provide an economical means of providing liquid fuel and oxidizer to an orbiting low Earth orbit (LEO) propellant depot. This depot could then provide propellant to various spacecraft, including reusable orbital transfer vehicles used to ferry space solar power (SSP) satellites to <b>geo-stationary</b> <b>orbit.</b> Two different tanker Argus configurations were analyzed. The first simply places additional propellant tanks inside the payload bay of an existing Argus {{reusable launch vehicle}}. The second concept is a modified pure tanker version of the Argus RLV in which the payload bay is removed and the vehicle propellant tanks are extended to hold additional propellant. An economic analysis was performed for this study that involved the calculation of the design/development and recurring costs of each vehicle. The goal of this analysis was to determine at what flight rate it would be economically beneficial to spend additional development funds to change an existing, sunk cost, payload bay tanker vehicle into a pure tanker design.

40|$|The latest {{operational}} satellite in the GOES series, GOES-M, {{was launched}} on 23 July 2001. It achieved <b>geo-stationary</b> <b>orbit</b> on 12 August 2001, and hence {{is referred to}} as GOES- 12. The Imager on GOES- 12 has been modi-fied from the previous four imagers in this series. One change is the addition of a spectral band centered at 13. 3 pm. The GOES- 12 Imager also includes a spectrally mod-ified 6. 5 pm band with an improved spatial resolution from 8 km to 4 km at the sub-satellite point. The addition of the 13. 3 pm band comes at the expense of eliminating the 12 pm band on the GOES- 12 IN 10 I P Imagers. A 12 /-Lm band will remain available on the GOES- 12 and beyond Sounders, although with coarser spatial and tem-poral resolutions and less geographic coverage than is available with the GOES Imagers. The 12 /-Lm band will be re-introduced on the next series of Imagers, slated to begin with GOES-R in approximately 2012. The overall changes to the Imager will improve several satellite products, such as cloud properties and satellite-derived wind fields. In contrast, products that utilize the information provided by the 12 /-Lm band to characterize low-level moisture and to differentiate between cloud types and volcanic ash may be degraded. In these cases, {{it may be necessary to}} rely upon data and products from a host of polar-orbiting satellites.

40|$|A space {{elevator}} is {{a physical}} connection {{from the surface of}} the Earth to a <b>geo-stationary</b> <b>orbit</b> above the Earth approximately 35, 786 km in altitude. Its center of mass is at the geo-stationary point such that it has a 24 -hour orbit, and stays over the same point above the equator as the Earth rotates on its axis. The structure is utilized as a transportation and utility system for moving payloads, power, and gases between the surface of the Earth and space. It makes the physical connection from Earth to space in the same way a bridge connects two cities across a body of' water. The space elevator may be an important concept for the future development of space in the latter part of the 21 th century. It has the potential to provide mass-transportation to space in the same way highways, railroads, power lines, and pipelines provide mass-transportation across the Earth's surface. The low energy requirements for moving payloads up and down the elevator make it one of only a few concepts that has the potential of lowering the cost to orbit to less than $ 10 per kilogram. This paper will summarize the findings from a 1999 NASA workshop on Space Elevators held at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The workshop was sponsored by the Advanced Projects Office in the Flight Projects Directorate at MSFC, and was organized in cooperation with the Advanced Space Transportation Program at MSFC and the Advanced Concepts Office in the Office of Space Flight at NASA Headquarters. New concepts will be examined for space elevator construction and a number of issues will be discussed that has helped to bring the space elevator concept out of the realm of science fiction and into the realm of possibility. In conclusion, it appears that the space elevator concept may well he possible in the latter part of the 21 st century if proper planning and technology development is emphasized to resolve key issues in the development of this advanced space infrastructure concept...|$|E
40|$|The 19 th of October 2006 at 16 : 28 UTC {{the first}} MetOp {{satellite}} (MetOp A) was successfully launched from the Baykonur cosmodrome by a Soyuz/Fregat launcher. After {{only three days}} of LEOP operations, performed by ESOC, the satellite was handed over to EUMETSAT, who is since then taking care of all satellite operations. MetOp A is the first European operational satellite for meteorology flying in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO), all previous satellites operated by EUMETSAT, belonging to the METEOSAT family, being located in the <b>Geo-stationary</b> <b>orbit.</b> To ensure safe operations for a LEO satellite accurate and continuous commanding from ground of the on-board AOCS is required. That makes the operational transition {{at the end of}} the LEOP quite challenging, as the continuity of the Flight Dynamics operations is to be maintained. That means that the main functions of the Flight Dynamics have to be fully validated on-flight during the LEOP, before taking over the operational responsibility on the spacecraft, and continuously monitored during the entire mission. Due to the nature of a meteorological operational mission, very stringent requirements in terms of overall service availability (99 % of the collected data), timeliness of processing of the observation data (3 hours after sensing) and accuracy of the geo-location of the meteorological products (1 km) are to be fulfilled. That translates in tight requirements imposed to the Flight Dynamics facility (FDF) in terms of accuracy, timeliness and availability of the generated orbit and clock solutions; a detailed monitoring of the quality of these products is thus mandatory. Besides, being the accuracy of the image geo-location strongly related with the pointing performance of the platform and with the on-board timing stability, monitoring from ground of the behaviour of the on-board sensors and clock is needed. This paper presents an overview of the Flight Dynamics operations performed during the different phases of the MetOp A mission up to routine. The activities performed to validate all the Flight Dynamics functions, characterize the behaviour of the satellite and monitor the performances of the Flight Dynamics facility will be highlighted.
