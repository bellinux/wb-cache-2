5|$|As many {{newspapers}} {{belonging to}} the dwindling Communist Party, Arbeideren would cease to exist {{before the end of}} the 1920s. It was still published six times a week, but had to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> printing press in 1929, switching to Samtrykk in Oslo. The last ever issue of Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad was published on 4 October 1929.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 the United States {{announced}} the Marshall Plan initiative {{to help rebuild}} postwar Europe and thus gain more political power there. After initially welcoming the idea of Poland's participation in the plan, the Polish government declined the American offer under pressure from Moscow. Also, following the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, Poland was forced by the Soviet Union to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> claims to compensation from Germany, which as a result paid no significant compensation for war damages, either to the Polish state or to Polish citizens. Poland received compensation {{in the form of}} land and property left behind by the German population of the annexed western territories.|$|E
25|$|The post-war {{tensions}} and arguments surrounding the Turkish Straits {{would come to}} be known as the Turkish Straits crisis. The fear of Soviet invasion and Joseph Stalin's unconcealed desire for Soviet military bases in the Turkish Straits eventually caused Turkey to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> principle of neutrality in foreign relations and join NATO in February 1952.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s the Swedish {{government}} {{decided that the}} navy would <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> blue-water navy capacity and become a more coast-based navy. All frigates and destroyers were decommissioned. The first two Visby-class frigates left the navy in 1978 and in 1982 the remaining two followed. HSwMS Visby and HSwMS Sundsvall were used as target ships before being sold to Spain for scrapping.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of {{improved}} diplomatic relations with the Bush Administration, India agreed to allow close international monitoring of its nuclear weapons development, although it has refused to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> current nuclear arsenal. In 2004, the US decided to grant Major non-NATO ally (MNNA) status to Pakistan. The US extended the MNNA strategic working relationship to India but the offer was turned down.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} that arose {{at that point}} of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation. During the reception of former British Prime Minister Edward Heath during his sixth visit to the PRC, Deng Xiaoping commented quite clearly on the impossibility of exchanging sovereignty for administration, declaring an ultimatum: the British government must modify or <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> position or the PRC will announce its resolution {{of the issue of}} Hong Kong sovereignty unilaterally.|$|E

25|$|After 1843, fast on {{the heels}} of the Syrian debacle, and the treaty of Balta Liman, which forced the Egyptian {{government}} to tear down its import barriers, and to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the silver nitrate he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.|$|E

On 5December 2006, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf told an Indian TV {{channel that}} Pakistan would <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> claim on Kashmir if India {{accepted}} {{some of his}} peace proposals, including a phased withdrawal of troops, self-governance for locals, no changes in the borders of Kashmir, and a joint supervision mechanism involving India, Pakistan, and Kashmir.

25|$|The events {{led to the}} Quasi-War (1798–1800) between France and the United States, {{with actual}} naval {{encounters}} taking place between the two powers, with the encounter between USS Constellation and French ship L'Insurgente on 9 February 1799 off Nevis Island, and USS Constellation and La Vengeance in February 1800 off Guadeloupe.

25|$|In {{order to}} get its merger with US Airways {{approved}} by the Department of Justice (DOJ), American Airlines was forced to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> 2 gates at Love Field. Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America all expressed interest, while the DOJ indicated that a low cost carrier should receive the gates. The former American Airlines gates were ultimately granted to Virgin America on October 13, 2014, thus denying the gates to Delta and Southwest.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoelectric}} effect will cause spacecraft exposed to sunlight {{to develop a}} positive charge. This can be a major problem, as {{other parts of the}} spacecraft are in shadow which will result in the spacecraft developing a negative charge from nearby plasmas. The imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components. The static charge created by the {{photoelectric effect}} is self-limiting, because a higher charged object doesn't <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> electrons as easily as a lower charged object does.|$|E
25|$|Smuggling: During {{the civil}} war, Lebanon turned {{into one of}} the world's largest {{narcotics}} producers, with much of the hashish production centered in the Bekaa valley. But much else was also smuggled, such as guns and supplies, all kinds of stolen goods, and regular trade – war or no war, Lebanon would not <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> role as the middleman in European-Arab business. Many battles were fought over Lebanon's ports, to gain smugglers access to the sea routes.|$|E

25|$|The borders {{between the}} three {{countries}} got the shape they have had since {{in the middle of}} the seventeenth century: In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway ceded the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre & Särna, as well as the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia) to Sweden. The Treaty of Roskilde, signed in 1658, forced Denmark–Norway to cede the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden. The 1660 Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to return Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark–Norway, and to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> recent claims to the island Funen.|$|E

While chairing the Indian Committee on National Integration, C. P. introduced the clause making it mandatory that newly elected member of Parliament and state assemblies should take an allegiance to the Indian Union. It is believed that the introduction of this clause compelled the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>its</b> goal of secession from the Indian Union.|$|E
