40|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} imaging procedures play {{an important}} role in the assessment of inflammatory diseases. With the advent of 3 -dimensional anatomic imaging, there has been a tendency to replace traditional planar scintigraphy by CT or MRI. Furthermore, scintigraphic techniques may have to be combined with other imaging modalities to achieve high sensitivity and specificity, and some may require time-consuming labeling procedures. On the other hand, new developments such as combined SPECT/CT increase the diagnostic power of scintigraphy. Also, the advent of PET had a considerable impact on the use of nuclear medicine imaging techniques. In this review, we aim to provide nuclear medicine specialists and clinicians with the relevant information on rational and efficient use of nuclear medicine imaging techniques in the assessment of patients with osteomyelitis, infected vascular prostheses, metastatic <b>infectious</b> disease, rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, and fever of unknown origin...|$|R
2500|$|Unicompartmental {{arthroplasty}} (UKA), {{also called}} partial knee replacement, {{is an option}} for some patients. The knee is generally divided into three [...] "compartments": medial (the inside part of the knee), lateral (the outside), and patellofemoral (the joint between the kneecap and the thighbone). Most patients with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in {{two or more of}} the above compartments and are best treated with total knee replacement. A minority of patients (the exact percentage is hotly debated but is probably between 10 and 30 percent) have wear confined primarily to one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better post-operative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and blood clots, but a harder revision if necessary. While most recent data suggests that UKA in properly selected patients has survival rates comparable to TKA, most surgeons believe that TKA is the more reliable long term procedure. Persons with <b>infectious</b> or inflammatory <b>arthritis</b> (Rheumatoid, Lupus, Psoriatic), or marked deformity are not candidates for this procedure.|$|R

40|$|Inflammation is a {{hallmark}} of many diseases, such as atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, <b>arthritis,</b> <b>infectious</b> diseases, and cancer. Although steroids and cyclooxygenase inhibitors are effective antiinflammatory therapeutical agents, they may cause serious side effects. Therefore, developing unique antiinflammatory agents without significant adverse effects is urgently needed. Vinpocetine, a derivative of the alkaloid vincamine, has long been used for cerebrovascular disorders and cognitive impairment. Its role in inhibiting inflammation, however, remains unexplored. Here, we show that vinpocetine acts as an antiinflammatory agent in vitro and in vivo. In particular, vinpocetine inhibits TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation and the subsequent induction of proinflammatory mediators in multiple cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells. We also show that vinpocetine inhibits monocyte adhesion and chemotaxis, which are critical processes during inflammation. Moreover, vinpocetine potently inhibits TNF-α- or LPS-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2, and decreases interstitial infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in a mouse model of TNF-α- or LPS-induced lung inflammation. Interestingly, vinpocetine inhibits NF-κB–dependent inflammatory responses by directly targeting IKK, independent of its well-known inhibitory effects on phosphodiesterase and Ca 2 + regulation. These studies thus identify vinpocetine as a unique antiinflammatory agent that may be repositioned {{for the treatment of}} many inflammatory diseases...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Lyme {{disease is}} a tick-borne disease caused by a {{spirochete}} Borrelia burgdorferi, which manifests as a multisystem disease of the skin nervous system, heart and joints. Recently {{it is the most}} common vector-borne disease in Yugoslavia. New epidemiological studies New epidemiological studies revealed that ticks can occasionally be infected not only by Borrelia burgdorferi, but also by some other microbes that can cause diseases in humans. Recently discovered the variable major protein-like sequence, antigenic variation of B. burgdorferi B 31 partly explains the ability of this organism to evade an active immune response. A key role in development of clinical symptoms associated with lyme disease belongs to the connection with ability of B. burgdorferi to induce and activate metallopeptidases and fibrinolytic enzymes, leading to extracellular matrix destruction. Diagnosis and treatment Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is {{made on the basis of}} clinical picture, exposure to ticks in endemic areas and serologic confirmation. It seems that polymerase chain reaction has little role in detection of B. burgdorferi in urine, blood, and spinal fluid samples, but it is most useful in evaluating the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy of Lyme <b>arthritis.</b> <b>Infectious</b> Diseases Society of America had prepared new guidelines for selective treatment of Lyme disease.

5000|$|Perceived {{health status}} is {{impacted}} {{in a couple}} of ways in regards the welfare state regimes. These factors include benefits received through differing ideologies and socio-economic disadvantages which groups of people face. When focusing on benefits which people receive, liberal welfare states have minimal access to benefits because of the minimal government influence. As well, privatized care requires means testing and strict criteria in order to be considered for care. The conservative welfare state has benefits which are earnings related and depend on what the employer decides to offer their employees. Conservative regimes also believe in family ties which impact the amount of personal care a person receives. The liberal and conservative welfare state regimes provide benefits depending on an individuals engagement in the workforce. As has been noted, women tend to face a disadvantage in employment opportunity and wages. This makes it difficult to receive good health benefits in liberal and conservative regimes. The social democratic welfare state believes in universal public care services in return for full employment by society. The social democratic regime believes in creating equality for all with access to good health and health care. This regime is able to do this because it has a fully contributive market economy which agrees to decommidifying their labour for this care. [...] A study conducted by Eikemo et. al depicts how welfare state regimes impact health issues caused by socio-economic disadvantages. The authors do so through the European Social Survey which focused on 21 different countries. The main findings were that liberal and social democratic regimes had a higher perceived health rating than the conservative regime. The study relates these findings to the decommodification theory. Liberal and social democratic regimes substitute worker wages and receive care service to compensate for that loss.These services are seen to correlate with better health. On the other hand, the conservative view rejects decommodifiction, causing the access for necessary care to be lower. Socio-economic explanations for gender health also point to women being more vulnerable to health problems. Women disproportionally represent the poorer populations across the welfare state regimes. Women who are economically deprived are more vulnerable to <b>infectious</b> disease, <b>arthritis,</b> migraines, stress, mental illness (depression), and increased risk to heart disease.|$|R

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae {{remains the}} leading causative {{pathogen}} in pediatric pneumonia and bacteremia throughout the world. The invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) {{is known as}} isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (e. g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, pleural fluid, or peritoneal fluid). The {{aim of this study}} is to survey the clinical manifestations and laboratory results of IPD and identify the prognostic factors of mortality. From January 2001 to December 2006, a retrospective review of chart was performed in a teaching hospital in Taipei. The hospitalized pediatric patients with the diagnosis of pneumonia, <b>arthritis,</b> <b>infectious</b> endocarditis, meningitis or sepsis were recruited. Among them, 50 patients were pneumococcal infections proved by positive culture results or antigen tests. Clinical manifestations, laboratory data and hospitalization courses were analyzed. The median age was 3. 5 -year-old and there were 30 male patients (60 %). Eight patients (16 %) had underlying disease such as leukemia or congenital heart disease. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was observed in ten patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was performed in three patients. Leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein and AST level were noted in most of the patients. The overall mortality rate was 10 %. We found that leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and high CRP level were significant predictors for mortality. In conclusion, S. pneumoniae remains an important health threat worldwide and IPD is life-threatening with high mortality rate. We found leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and high CRP levels to be associated with mortality in pediatric IPD, and these factors are worthy of special attention at admission. Although we failed to identify a statistically significant prognostic factor in multivariate analysis due to relatively small sample size, we suggest an aggressive antibiotic treatment in patients with these factors at admission. Further large-scale studies are warranted...|$|R
