2500|$|A {{portion of}} the beam of light coming from the sun {{scatters}} off molecules of gas and other small particles in the atmosphere. Here, Rayleigh scattering primarily occurs through sunlight's interaction with randomly located air molecules. It is this scattered light that gives the surrounding sky its brightness and its color. As previously stated, Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength, so that shorter wavelength violet and blue light will scatter more than the longer wavelengths (yellow and <b>especially</b> <b>red</b> <b>light).</b> However, the Sun, like any star, has its own spectrum and so I0 in the scattering formula above is not constant but falls away in the violet. In addition the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere absorbs wavelengths {{at the edge of}} the ultra-violet region of the spectrum. [...] The resulting color, which appears like a pale blue, actually is a mixture of all the scattered colors, mainly blue and green. [...] Conversely, glancing toward the sun, the colors that were not scattered away — the longer wavelengths such as red and yellow light — are directly visible, giving the sun itself a slightly yellowish hue. Viewed from space, however, the sky is black and the sun is white.|$|E
40|$|Tropisms are growth-mediated plant {{movements}} that help plants {{to respond to}} changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, {{as well as the}} presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight experiments done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out {{in the absence of a}} significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i. e. the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, <b>especially</b> <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, are key mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space Station will clarify some of the unknown mechanisms and molecular players of the plant responses to these environmental signals involved in tropisms and the cell cycle...|$|E

Then until the appearance of the second leaf (usually 10 d) the plants {{had been growing}} under blue (459 nm) or red (635 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or under blue and red LEDs with red to blue ratio 2 : 1. Plants grown under white fluorescent lamps were used as a control. All lamps had the same light intensity. Water-soluble phenols content was determined spectrophotometrically and α- and γ-tocopherols contents were determined with HPLC with fluorescent detector. Phenolic peroxidase activity was assayed by guaiacol consumption kinetics at 436 nm. We found that water-soluble phenols and tocopherols levels increase by 80 % and 30 % under blue LEDs while under red LEDs these levels, conversely, decrease by 30 % and 13 % compared to control plants. During combined action of <b>red</b> and blue <b>light</b> water-soluble phenols content increased by 55 % compared to control. On the other hand tocopherols contents under such lighting were at the level of control. Under red LEDs α- to γ-tocopherol ratio was lower than that under blue light. Previously we showed that monochromatic narrow-band <b>light</b> sources, <b>especially</b> with <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> are considered by plant organism as a stress factor. Low α-tocopherol level detected under <b>red</b> <b>light</b> may be caused by its intensive consumption as an effective quencher of reactive oxygen species and free radicals interceptor. It is not impossible that narrow-band lighting has the inhibiting effect on γ-tocopherol methyltransferase – an enzyme that catalyses γ- to α-tocopherol conversion. Phenolic peroxidase activity changed adversely compared to phenols content – it had the highest value under red LEDs and the lower value under blue LEDs. This is consistent with the fact that it uses phenols as the substrate. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{stars of}} Roman candles {{can be found}} in any number of colors. Colors are {{manipulated}} by adding compounds which, when ignited, release visible light and other radiation. For example, when potassium perchlorate (KClO4) is used as an oxidizer, chemical reactions involving the dissociated elements of the perchlorate—potassium and chlorine ions—create barium compounds which emit green light (especially BaCl2). The potassium compounds formed by this reaction emit mostly near-infrared light, and so they do not affect the color of the star in a significant way. This reaction occurs at temperatures exceeding 2500 °C (4532 °F), at which the ions in KCl dissociate into free K+ and Cl−. Alternatively, SrCO3 can be added to the candle to produce a red or pink star, but, because it does not oxidize, more oxidizers and fuels must be added to sustain combustion. During combustion, various strontium compounds (<b>especially</b> Sr(OH)2 emit <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> most of which is between 506 and 722 nm in wavelength.|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an inventory of}} <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running by slow traffic (pedestrians and cyclists) at moveable bridges. We observe the frequency of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running, using an observational study of 22 moveable bridges in the South of the Netherlands, as observed from a central traffic control center. The bridges are observed {{for a period of}} 1 week. Slow traffic was present during 105 bridge openings. Results show that <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running at bridges occurs very frequently: in our sample, some form of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running by slow traffic occurred at all of the bridge openings where slow traffic was present. At 95 % 1 of the bridge openings, we observed <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running by people that cross a bridge too early; the bridge has closed again, but the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> has not dimmed yet. In 9 % of the bridge openings, we observed <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running before the bridge is open, but when the <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> are just turned on. Furthermore, we observed <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running when the <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> had been on for a while in 25 % of the bridge openings. In addition, we have found during a pilot that some traffic participants crawl underneath traffic barriers, even after these have been closed for a while. We introduce the new term "barrier negation" for this. This form of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> negation has not been observed during our eventual study, which suggests that this form occurs infrequently in general. We have observed what the characteristics were of bridges where <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running occurred frequently. In the phases where the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> is active, but where the bridge has not yet opened, there are many situations where <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running occurs (see Table 3). In general, <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running has occurred more frequently in urban areas compared to rural areas. In addition, more <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running has been observed when there were double traffic barriers (compared to single barriers) 2, when the closing of the barriers took relatively longer, or when the time interval between the onset of a <b>red</b> <b>light</b> and the onset of a barrier closing is relatively short. Most <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running has been observed in the phase where the bridge has closed again and barriers opened, but when the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> has not been dimmed yet. We identified no specific bridge characteristics that increased the probability of this type of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running. As this is an observational study, it provides an overview of the scale at which <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running by slow traffic occurs at bridges in the Netherlands. However, as we did not manipulate behavior, it does not conclusively demonstrate any causal relationship between bridge characteristics and <b>red</b> <b>light</b> running. Such causal relationships need to be tested in follow-up research. Our observations can be used to inform the design of such studies...|$|R
