5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E

25|$|Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent. Actual bias is {{established}} {{where it is}} actually established that a decision-maker was prejudiced in favour of or against a party.

25|$|The {{underground}} {{scenes of}} various genres are very lively in Finland {{at the moment}} {{and a lot of}} bands and artists defy the genre-limits. A good example is very popular Finnish underground rap artist ASA (formerly known as MC Avain), who has used folk-artists as the accompanying band.

25|$|The most {{important}} fragment is the First Partheneion or Louvre-Partheneion, found in 1855 in Saqqara in Egypt by the French scholar Auguste Mariette. This Partheneion consists of 101 lines, of {{which more than}} 30 are severely damaged. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> {{to say anything about}} this fragment, and scholars have debated ever since the discovery and publication about its content and the occasion on which this partheneion could have been performed.|$|E

25|$|The phase {{structure}} of quark matter remains mostly conjectural {{because it is}} difficult to perform calculations predicting the properties of quark matter. The reason is that QCD, the theory describing the dominant interaction between quarks, is strongly coupled at the densities and temperatures of greatest physical interest, and hence <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to obtain any predictions from it. Here are brief descriptions of some of the standard approaches.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> {{to come up}} {{with another}} process that would produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after {{no more than a few}} minutes. It would also be necessary for the deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to {{estimate}} the number of Pomaks along with the Turkified Pomaks who live in Turkey, as they have blended into the Turkish society and have been often linguistically and culturally dissimilated. According to Milliyet and Turkish Daily News reports, the number of Pomaks along with the Turkified Pomaks {{in the country is}} about 600,000. According to the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Bulgarian Orthodox Christian community in Turkey stands at 500 members.|$|E

Students are advised {{to continue their education}} after graduation as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to find a job with a gymnasium diploma. There are also two types of special gymnasiums: The Gymnasium of Mathematics and The Gymnasium of Philology. There are plans for an integrated entrance exam for higher education, as well as unified scoring systems for entrance exams, even for special gymnasiums.|$|E
25|$|Foley {{is another}} method of adding sound effects. Foley {{is more of}} a {{technique}} for creating sound effects than a type of sound effect, but it is often used for creating the incidental real world sounds that are very specific to what is going on onscreen, such as footsteps. With this technique the action onscreen is essentially recreated to try to match it as closely as possible. If done correctly <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for audiences to tell what sounds were added and what sounds were originally recorded (location sound).|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to uniquely {{identify}} neutrino {{interactions among}} the natural background of radioactivity. For this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel {{was chosen to}} facilitate the identification: the interaction of an antineutrino {{with one of the}} hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur within a heavier nucleus, don't need to be considered for the detection experiment. Within a cubic metre of water placed right outside a nuclear reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the setup is now used for measuring the reactor's plutonium production rate.|$|E

25|$|All plywoods bind resin {{and wood}} fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) {{to form a}} {{composite}} material. This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to bend it perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply.|$|E

They {{do this in a}} walking motion. <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> especially if you have to follow the beat of fast drums. If they catch themselves off beat they will tap their foot three times instead of two to get back with the drums' rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Silicon nitride, Si3N4, can {{be formed}} by {{directly}} reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300°C, {{but a more}} economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500°C. It would make a promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it: it is chemically near-totally inert, and even above 1000°C it keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> (9 on the Mohs hardness scale), dissociates only at 1900°C at 1atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185g/cm3), because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite (Be2SiO4). A similar refractory material is Si2N2O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450°C in an argon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear Si–O–Si linkages to each other.|$|E

25|$|Other {{diseases}} {{are influenced by}} genetics, but the genes a person gets from their parents only change their risk of getting a disease. Most of these {{diseases are}} inherited in a complex way, with either multiple genes involved, or coming from both genes and the environment. As an example, {{the risk of breast}} cancer is 50 times higher in the families most at risk, compared to the families least at risk. This variation is probably due to a large number of alleles, each changing the risk a little bit. Several of the genes have been identified, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, but not all of them. However, although some of the risk is genetic, the risk of this cancer is also increased by being overweight, drinking a lot of alcohol and not exercising. A woman's risk of breast cancer therefore comes from a large number of alleles interacting with her environment, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to predict.|$|E
