Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe's first {{match for}} his new state in 192829 was against the touring England cricket team. He took 3/114 as the {{tourists}} compiled 406 in a drawn match. He took the wickets of leading batsmen Ernest Tyldesley, Douglas Jardine and Herbert Sutcliffe. During the second innings of the match against England, Halcombe struck George Geary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bouncer, forcing him to be carried from the field. This drew further attention to Halcombe's bowling action. Halcombe was dropped to the colts (youth) team, and he promptly bowled them to victory against South Australia with 6/31 and 6/32. After taking match figures of 3/77 against Victoria Colts, Halcombe played his second first-class fixture of the season when Australian selectors selected him for an Australian XI against England {{at the end of}} the season. He took 2/50 in a drawn match, his wickets being Maurice Tate and Maurice Leyland.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{took office}} as {{president}} of Argentina on 25 May 2003. Contrary to tradition, the ceremony {{was held at the}} Palace of the Argentine National Congress rather than Casa Rosada. He announced that he would spearhead change on many issues, from politics to culture. The ceremony was attended by the provincial governors, Supreme Court president Julio Nazareno, the heads of the armed forces, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Raúl Alfonsín was the only former president in attendance.

5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 with the score at 64, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip. Hutton managed to continue resisting the Australians before Miller struck Crapp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bouncer. Hutton then edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in both innings. He had batted for over four hours and left England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed. Crapp was bowled by Miller for nine, and two runs later, Ring dismissed debutant Watkins for two to take his only wicket. Lindwall returned and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in the fading light, and the umpires called off play due to bad light. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E
5|$|Faye and Joseph separate, {{and she and}} Linden begin a relationship.

5|$|TNA held a Three Way War between A.J. Styles, Booker T, and Christian Cage at the show. Leading {{into the}} event, Styles {{represented}} the younger wrestlers in the company, while Booker T represented the veterans. Cage was neutral in the storyline, due to not having revealed which side he had aligned with. This upset Styles in the storyline, who wanted Cage {{to join the}} younger wrestlers. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Styles fought Booker T in a standard match. Booker T won the bout after bashing Styles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steel briefcase. Styles blamed the loss on Cage, who had interfered in the bout and accidentally cost Styles the win due to a miscommunication. On the October2 episode of Impact!, the team of Cage, Styles, and Jay Lethal teamed to face the team of Booker T and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) in a Six Man Tag Team match. Another miscommunication between Styles and Cage occurred in the contest, allowing Booker T to pin Cage to win the bout. This led to the October9 episode of Impact!, when Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Booker T versus Styles with Cage as Special Guest Referee would be the main event of that telecast to settle the issue. Styles defeated Booker T during the show, with Cage assaulting both wrestlers after the contest. Cornette then promoted a Three Way War at Bound for Glory in order to end the overall conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kaz and Scott SteinerSteiner was {{accompanied}} by Petey Williams and Rhaka Khan. At {{the beginning of the}} bout, Joe placed Kaz and Steiner in various holds and submission maneuvers. Steiner countered this by placing Joe in his signature Steiner Recliner submission maneuver, which Joe escaped by lifting him in the air on his shoulders. Kaz then jumped off of a turnbuckle and dropkicked Steiner. Later, Joe dove through the second rope onto Steiner. However, Steiner countered by hitting Joe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steel pipe while the referee was distracted by Khan. Near the end of the match, Kaz tried to perform his signature Flux Capacitor maneuver on Steiner from a turnbuckle, but Steiner countered by pushing him off to the ringside area. Joe then kicked Steiner in the head and then performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver, driving Steiner neck- and back-first into the mat, at fourteen minutes and thirty seconds to win the contest and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Edge, and Triple H. As the match began, Edge chose to stand outside the ring, hoping that Cena and Triple H would simply fight the match themselves. Cena and Triple H, however, teamed up and turned against Edge. One spot in the match saw Edge catapult Triple H into the steel ringpost, which made Triple H bleed. Afterwards, Edge executed an Edgecution onto an announce table on Triple H and then focused on Cena. Cena, however, locked Edge in the STFU, but was broken when Triple H hit Cena <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> microphone. Triple H then went after Edge and hit him with a chair, sending him over the security wall and into the audience. Lita, who accompanied Edge, entered the ring with a chair to hit Triple H, but Triple H reversed it into a Spinebuster, a move where the wrestler lifts the opponent, turning 180°, and then tosses her forward onto her back. Near {{the end of the}} match, Cena attempted an FU on Edge but Triple H delivered a low blow to Cena, which made Cena drop Edge out of the ring and attempted to execute a Pedigree. Cena, however, countered it into a jackknife roll-up. Cena won the match and successfully retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Triple H hit Cena, Edge, and the referee with a sledgehammer, and performed his signature taunt until performing his signature DX cross chops, receiving a standing ovation from the audience, closing the show.|$|E

5|$|The teams {{proceeded}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Dewes and Hutton opened for England. Dewes took a single from Lindwall's opening over and thus faced {{the start of}} the second over, which was bowled by Miller, who had troubled him in the past and dismissed him several times. During his short innings, Dewes was visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still. Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball to sprinkle sawdust on the slippery and damp crease. With his second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 1/2. He then removed Jack Crapp caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. The paceman ended with 2/5 from eight overs; Lindwall took 6/20 and England were all out for 52. In his last Test innings for the summer, Miller scored five before overbalancing and being stumped. Australia made 389 and led by 337 on the first innings on the second afternoon. Bowling for the second time, Miller struck Crapp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bouncer, before bowling him for nine. He then extracted an edge from Hutton—who fell for 64, having top-scored in both innings—to wicket-keeper Tallon, leaving England at 4/153. Miller ended with 2/22 as Australia won by an innings and took a 4–0 series win.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{subsequent}} setbacks {{in their}} relationship, such as Jac briefly deceiving Joseph {{into believing that}} she is pregnant with his child, Faye and Joseph marry.

When Archie's nurse Lauren later accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye and Joseph grow apart in the aftermath and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. She and Joseph separate, but after she begins a relationship with Linden, she discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their relationship.

Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit. Jac's support during this time results in a renewal of their relationship, and when Faye secretly makes plans to leave the country with Harry, Jac helps convince her to leave the baby with Joseph. Joseph struggles as a working father, and accepts a job as a GP in Penrith. Jac declines his offer to accompany him, so he departs with Harry, leaving her in tears.|$|E
