5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier <b>homolog</b> to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its <b>homolog</b> lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E

40|$|A general {{strategy}} for cloning the functional <b>homologs</b> of an Escherichia coli gene {{was used to}} clone <b>homologs</b> of 4. 5 S RNA from other bacteria. The genes encoding these <b>homologs</b> were selected by their ability to complement a deletion of the gene for 4. 5 S RNA. DNA sequences of the regions encoding the <b>homologs</b> were determined. Since this approach does not require that the homologous genes hybridize with probes generated from the E. coli sequence, the sequences of the <b>homologs</b> were not all similar to the sequence of the E. coli gene.

Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E

The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in aqueous solution.

5|$|A {{lawrencium}} atom has 103 electrons, {{of which}} three {{can act as}} valence electrons. In 1970, {{it was predicted that}} the ground-state electron configuration of lawrencium was 5f146d17s2 (ground state term symbol 2D3/2), following the Aufbau principle and conforming to the 4f145d16s2 configuration of lawrencium's lighter <b>homolog</b> lutetium. However, the next year, calculations were published that questioned this prediction, instead expecting an anomalous 5f147s27p1 configuration. Though early calculations gave conflicting results, more recent studies and calculations confirm the s2p suggestion. 1974 relativistic calculations concluded that the energy difference between the two configurations was small and that it was uncertain which was the ground state. Later 1995 calculations concluded that the s2p configuration should be energetically favored, because the spherical s and p1/2 orbitals are nearest to the atomic nucleus and thus move quickly enough that their relativistic mass increases significantly.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} acute corneal epithelial toxicity {{induced by}} benzalkonium chloride (BAC) <b>homologs</b> with different alkyl chain lengths using an in vivo electrophysiological method. Methods: BAC <b>homologs</b> with C 12, C 14, and C 16 alkyl chain lengths were used at concentrations of 0. 0025 %, 0. 005 %, and 0. 01 %, respectively. Cytotoxicity of BAC <b>homologs</b> on the normal rabbit corneal epithelial cells was examined {{by using a}} WST- 1 assay. Corneal transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured in living Japanese white rabbits by 2 Ag/AgCl electrodes placed in the anterior aqueous chamber and on the cornea. TER changes were then evaluated after a 60 -second exposure to these BAC <b>homologs.</b> Morphological changes in corneal epithelium after exposure to the BAC <b>homologs</b> were examined using scanning electron microscopy.

5|$|Lead {{can form}} {{multiply}} bonded chains, a property it shares with its lighter <b>homolog,</b> carbon. Its {{capacity to do}} so is much less because the Pb–Pb bond energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds (due to the Pb–C bond being rather weak). This makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. It predominantly forms organolead(IV) compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are Pb2 and Pb(η5-C5H5)2.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide <b>homolog</b> promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{the first}} {{ionization}} energy of lawrencium was measured, using the isotope 256Lr. The measured value, , agreed {{very well with}} the relativistic theoretical prediction of 4.963(15)eV, and also provided a first step into measuring the first ionization energies of the transactinides. This value is the lowest among all the lanthanides and actinides, and supports the s2p configuration as the 7p1/2 electron {{is expected to be}} only weakly bound. This suggests that lutetium and lawrencium behave similarly to the d-block elements (and hence being the true heavier congeners of scandium and yttrium, instead of lanthanum and actinium), and also that lawrencium may behave similarly to the alkali metals sodium and potassium in some ways. Given that the s2p configuration is correct, then lawrencium cannot be regarded as a transition metal under the IUPAC definition ("An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell"), unlike its lighter <b>homolog</b> lutetium and the group 3 elements, with which lutetium and lawrencium are sometimes classified. It is nevertheless quite likely that metallic lawrencium will behave similarly to curium, which has an 5f76d17s2 configuration, and show the expected 5f146d17s2 configuration, which is supported by the earlier volatility experiments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Aeromonas spp. {{have been}} {{regarded}} as "emerging pathogens". Aeromonads possess multifactorial virulence {{and the production of}} many of these virulence determinants is associated with high cell density, a phenomenon that might be regulated by quorum sensing. However, only two species of the genus are reported to possess the luxRI quorum sensing gene <b>homologs.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if the luxRI <b>homologs</b> are universally present in the Aeromonas strains collected from various culture collections, clinical laboratories and field studies. Results Of all the 73 Aeromonas strains used in the study, seventy-one strains elicited acyl-homoserine lactone-mediated response in multiple biosensor strains. However, dot blot hybridization revealed that the luxRI <b>homologs</b> are present in all the strains. PCR amplification and sequencing revealed that the luxRI <b>homologs</b> shared a very high percentage sequence similarity. No evidence for lateral gene transfer of the luxRI <b>homologs</b> between aeromonads and other genera was noted. Conclusion We propose that the luxRI quorum sensing gene <b>homologs</b> are universally present in the genus Aeromonas independently from their origin. This study is the first genus-wide report of the taxonomic distribution of the luxRI <b>homologs.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The genome {{sequences}} of new viruses often contain many “orphan ” or “taxon-specific ” proteins apparently lacking <b>homologs.</b> However, because viral proteins evolve very fast, commonly used sequence similarity detection {{methods such as}} BLAST may overlook <b>homologs.</b> We analyzed a data set of proteins from RNA viruses characterized as “genus specific ” by BLAST. More pow-erful methods developed recently, such as HHblits or HHpred (available through web-based, user-friendly interfaces), could detect distant <b>homologs</b> of a quarter of these proteins, suggesting that these methods {{should be used to}} annotate viral genomes. In-depth manual analyses of a subset of the remaining sequences, guided by contextual information such as taxonomy, gene or-der, or domain cooccurrence, identified distant <b>homologs</b> of another third. Thus, a combination of powerful automated meth-ods and manual analyses can uncover distant <b>homologs</b> of many proteins thought to be orphans. We expect these methodologi-cal results to be also applicable to cellular organisms, since they generally evolve much more slowly than RNA viruses. As an application, we reanalyzed the genome of a bee pathogen, Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV). We could identify <b>homologs</b> of most of its proteins thought to be orphans; in each case, identifying <b>homologs</b> provided functional clues. We discovered that CBPV encodes a domain homologous to the Alphavirus methyltransferase-guanylyltransferase; a putative membrane protein, SP 24, with <b>homologs</b> in unrelated insect viruses and insect-transmitted plant viruses having different morphologies (cileviruses...|$|R
5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base that binds {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary <b>homolog</b> of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of moscovium {{in aqueous solution}} should essentially be that of the Mc+ and Mc3+ ions. The former should be easily hydrolyzed and not be easily complexed with halides, cyanide, and ammonia. Moscovium(I) hydroxide (McOH), carbonate (Mc2CO3), oxalate (Mc2C2O4), and fluoride (McF) should be soluble in water; the sulfide (Mc2S) should be insoluble; and the chloride (McCl), bromide (McBr), iodide (McI), and thiocyanate (McSCN) should be only slightly soluble, so that adding excess hydrochloric acid would not noticeably affect the solubility of moscovium(I) chloride. Mc3+ should be about as stable as Tl3+ and hence should also be {{an important part of}} moscovium chemistry, although its closest <b>homolog</b> among the elements should be its lighter congener Bi3+. Moscovium(III) fluoride (McF3) and thiozonide (McS3) should be insoluble in water, similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds, while moscovium(III) chloride (McCl3), bromide (McBr3), and iodide (McI3) should be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form oxyhalides such as McOCl and McOBr, again analogous to bismuth. Both moscovium(I) and moscovium(III) should be common oxidation states and their relative stability should depend greatly on what they are complexed with and the likelihood of hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{photosynthesis}} {{and how this}} capability has spread to other bacterial phyla remain important unresolved questions. I describe here a number of conserved signature indels (CSIs) in key proteins involved in bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) biosynthesis that provide important insights in these regards. The proteins BchL and BchX, which are essential for Bchl biosynthesis, are derived by gene duplication in a common ancestor of all phototrophs. More ancient gene duplication {{gave rise to the}} BchX–BchL proteins and the NifH protein of the nitrogenase complex. The sequence alignment of NifH–BchX–BchL proteins contain two CSIs that are uniquely shared by all NifH and BchX <b>homologs,</b> but not by any BchL <b>homologs.</b> These CSIs and phylogenetic analysis of NifH–BchX–BchL protein sequences strongly suggest that the BchX <b>homologs</b> are ancestral to BchL and that the Bchl-based anoxygenic photosynthesis originated prior to the chlorophyll (Chl) -based photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. Another CSI in the BchX–BchL sequence alignment that is uniquely shared by all BchX <b>homologs</b> and the BchL sequences from Heliobacteriaceae, but absent in all other BchL <b>homologs,</b> suggests that the BchL <b>homologs</b> from Heliobacteriaceae are primitive in comparison to all other photosynthetic lineages. Several other identified CSIs in the BchN <b>homologs</b> are commonly shared by all proteobacterial <b>homologs</b> and a clade consisting of the marine unicellular Cyanobacteria (Clade C).

In addition to full length aaRS genes, genomes of many organisms are sprinkled with truncated genes encoding single-domain aaRS-like proteins, which often have relinquished their canonical role in genetic code translation. We have identified the genes for putative seryl-tRNA synthetase <b>homologs</b> widespread in bacterial genomes and characterized three of them biochemically and structurally. The proteins encoded are homologous to the catalytic domain of highly diverged, atypical seryl-tRNA synthetases (aSerRSs) found only in methanogenic archaea and are deprived of the tRNA-binding domain. Remarkably, in comparison to SerRSs, aSerRS <b>homologs</b> display different and relaxed amino acid specificity. aSerRS <b>homologs</b> lack canonical tRNA aminoacylating activity and instead transfer activated amino acid to phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of putative carrier proteins, whose genes were identified in the genomic surroundings of aSerRS <b>homologs.</b> Detailed kinetic analysis confirmed that aSerRS <b>homologs</b> aminoacylate these carrier proteins efficiently and specifically. Accordingly, aSerRS <b>homologs</b> were renamed amino acid:[carrier protein] ligases (AMP forming).

The longevity network is composed of 175 human <b>homologs</b> of proteins known to confer increased longevity through loss of function in yeast, nematode, or fly, and 2, 163 additional human proteins that interact with these <b>homologs.</b> Overall, the network consists of 3, 271 binary interactions among 2, 338 unique proteins. A comparison of the average node degree of the human longevity <b>homologs</b> with random sets of proteins in the Core Network indicates that human <b>homologs</b> of longevity proteins are highly connected hubs with a mean node degree of 18. 8 partners. Shortest path length analysis shows that proteins in this network are significantly more connected than would be expected by chance. To examine the relationship of this network to human aging phenotypes, we compared the genes encoding longevity network proteins to genes known to be changed transcriptionally during aging in human muscle.
