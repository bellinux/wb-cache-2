25|$|The <b>Hertzian</b> dipole {{is similar}} to but differs from the short dipole, {{discussed}} above. In both cases the conductor is very short compared to a wavelength, so the standing wave pattern present on a half wave dipole (for instance) is absent. However, with the <b>Hertzian</b> dipole we specified that the current along that conductor is constant over its short length. This makes the <b>Hertzian</b> dipole useful for analysis of more complex antenna configurations, where every infinitesimal section of that real antenna's conductor can be modelled as a <b>Hertzian</b> dipole with the current found to be flowing in that real antenna.|$|E
25|$|Classical contact {{mechanics}} is most notably associated with Heinrich Hertz. In 1882, Hertz solved the contact problem of two elastic bodies with curved surfaces. This still-relevant classical solution provides {{a foundation for}} modern problems in {{contact mechanics}}. For example, in mechanical engineering and tribology, <b>Hertzian</b> contact stress is {{a description of the}} stress within mating parts. The <b>Hertzian</b> contact stress usually refers to the stress close to the area of contact between two spheres of different radii.|$|E
25|$|The Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) {{model is}} an {{alternative}} model for adhesive contact which assumes that the contact profile remains {{the same as in}} <b>Hertzian</b> contact but with additional attractive interactions outside the area of contact.|$|E
25|$|However a short {{conductor}} {{fed with}} a RF voltage {{will not have}} a uniform current even along that short range. Rather, a short dipole in real life has a current equal to the feedpoint current at the feedpoint but falling linearly to zero over the length of that short conductor. By placing a capacitive hat, such as a metallic ball, {{at the end of the}} conductor, it is possible for its self capacitance to absorb the current from the conductor and better approximate the constant current assumed for the <b>Hertzian</b> dipole. But again, the <b>Hertzian</b> dipole is meant only as a theoretical construct for antenna analysis.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a <b>Hertzian</b> cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar to anyone who has seen what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile. The partial <b>Hertzian</b> cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E
25|$|During the Industrial Revolution the {{electrical}} industry exploited direct current (DC) and low frequency alternating current (AC), {{but not much}} was known about frequencies above 20kHz, what are now called radio frequencies. In 1887, four years previously, Heinrich Hertz had discovered <b>Hertzian</b> waves (radio waves), electromagnetic waves which oscillated at very high frequencies. This attracted much attention, {{and a number of}} researchers began experimenting with high frequency currents.|$|E
25|$|It was Albert Einstein's {{concept of}} mass–energy {{equivalence}} (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount m=E/c2 that resolved Poincaré's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether. The <b>Hertzian</b> oscillator loses {{mass in the}} emission process, and momentum is conserved in any frame. However, concerning Poincaré's solution of the Center of Gravity problem, Einstein noted that Poincaré's formulation and his own from 1906 were mathematically equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Colloidal {{suspensions}} of nanoparticles of {{boric acid}} dissolved in petroleum {{or vegetable oil}} can form a remarkable lubricant on ceramic or metal surfaces with a coefficient of sliding friction that decreases with increasing pressure to a value ranging from 0.10 to 0.02. Self-lubricating H3BO3 films result from a spontaneous chemical reaction between water molecules and B2O3 coatings in a humid environment. In bulk-scale, an inverse relationship exists between friction coefficient and <b>Hertzian</b> contact pressure induced by applied load.|$|E
25|$|However, Poincaré's {{resolution}} led to {{a paradox}} when changing frames: if a <b>Hertzian</b> oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincaré performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to {{the frame of the}} moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} {{need for}} a propagation medium for such <b>Hertzian</b> waves {{can be seen by}} the fact that they consist of perpendicular electric (E) and magnetic (B or H) waves. The E waves consist of undulating dipolar electric fields, and all such dipoles appeared to require separated and opposite electric charges. Electric charge is an inextricable property of matter, so it appeared that some form of matter was required to provide the alternating current that would seem to have to exist at any point along the propagation path of the wave. Propagation of waves in a true vacuum would imply the existence of electric fields without associated electric charge, or of electric charge without associated matter. Albeit compatible with Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic induction of electric fields could not be demonstrated in vacuum, because all methods of detecting electric fields required electrically charged matter.|$|E
25|$|To justify such {{a radical}} move towards the {{depiction}} {{of the world in}} unrecognizable terms, Antliff and Leighten argue that the emergence of Cubism transpired during an era of dissatisfaction with positivism, materialism and determinism. The 19th century theories upon which such philosophies were based, came under attack by intellectuals such as the philosophers Henri Bergson and Friedrich Nietzsche, William James and the mathematician Henri Poincaré. New philosophical and scientific ideas emerged based on non-Euclidean geometry, Riemannian geometry and the relativity of knowledge, contradicting notions of absolute truth. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available popularized publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism. Popularized too were new scientific discoveries such as Röntgen's X-rays, <b>Hertzian</b> electromagnetic radiation and radio waves propagating through space, revealing realities not only hidden from human observation, but beyond the sphere of sensory perception. Perception was no longer associated solely with the static, passive receipt of visible signals, but became dynamically shaped by learning, memory and expectation.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{of light}} quanta began with Max Planck's {{published}} law of black-body radiation ("On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum") by assuming that <b>Hertzian</b> oscillators could only exist at energies E {{proportional to the}} frequency f of the oscillator by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant. By assuming that light actually consisted of discrete energy packets, Einstein wrote an equation for the photoelectric effect that agreed with experimental results. It explained why the energy of photoelectrons was dependent only on {{the frequency of the}} incident light and not on its intensity: a low-intensity, high-frequency source could supply a few high energy photons, whereas a high-intensity, low-frequency source would supply no photons of sufficient individual energy to dislodge any electrons. This was an enormous theoretical leap, but the concept was strongly resisted at first because it contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from James Clerk Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic behavior, and more generally, the assumption of infinite divisibility of energy in physical systems. Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, resistance to the idea of photons continued, since it appeared to contradict Maxwell's equations, which were well understood and verified.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Hertzian</b> dipole or Elementary doublet {{refers to}} a {{theoretical}} construction, rather than a physical antenna design. It may {{be defined as a}} finite oscillating current (in a specified direction) of [...] over a tiny or infinitesimal length δℓ at a specified position. The solution of the fields from a <b>Hertzian</b> dipole can be used as the basis for analytical or numerical calculation of the radiation from more complex antenna geometries (such as practical dipoles) by forming the superposition of fields from a large number of <b>Hertzian</b> dipoles comprising the current pattern of the actual antenna. As a function of position, taking the elementary current elements multiplied by infinitesimal lengths [...] I(r)dℓ, the resulting field pattern then reduces to an integral over the path of an antenna conductor (modelled as a thin wire).|$|E

2500|$|The short dipole, with a {{feedpoint}} {{current of}} I0, has an average current over each conductor of only I0/2. The above field equations for the <b>Hertzian</b> dipole of length δℓ would then predict the actual fields {{for a short}} dipole using that effective current I = I0/2.

2500|$|The {{original}} work in contact mechanics {{dates back to}} 1882 {{with the publication of}} the paper [...] "On the contact of elastic solids" [...] (...) by Heinrich Hertz. Hertz was attempting to understand how the optical properties of multiple, stacked lenses might change with the force holding them together. <b>Hertzian</b> contact stress refers to the localized stresses that develop as two curved surfaces come in contact and deform slightly under the imposed loads. This amount of deformation is dependent on the modulus of elasticity of the material in contact. It gives the contact stress {{as a function of the}} normal contact force, the radii of curvature of both bodies and the modulus of elasticity of both bodies. <b>Hertzian</b> contact stress forms the foundation for the equations for load bearing capabilities and fatigue life in bearings, gears, and any other bodies where two surfaces are in contact.|$|E

[...] However, in the late 1960s, several contradictions were observed when the Hertz theory was compared with experiments involving contact between rubber and glass spheres.|$|E

2500|$|The late 1880s {{through to}} the 1890s saw the {{discovery}} and then development of a newly understood phenomenon into a form of wireless telegraphy, called <b>Hertzian</b> wave wireless telegraphy, radiotelegraphy, or (later) simply [...] "radio". Between 1886 and 1888, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published {{the results of his}} experiments where he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves (radio waves) through the air, proving James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 theory of electromagnetic radiation.

Hertz is in part responding to Thomas Weiskel's book The Romantic Sublime, probably the most influential recent account of British and German Romantic attitudes towards the Sublime of both Burke and Longinus. Laura Quinney treats the attractions grim demystification in analyzes of Longinus, particularly Weiskel's. Jonathan Culler has an appreciation of Hertz on Longinus in [...] "The <b>Hertzian</b> Sublime."

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1894, {{the young}} Italian {{inventor}} Guglielmo Marconi began working {{on the idea of}} building a commercial wireless telegraphy system based on the use of <b>Hertzian</b> waves (radio waves), a line of inquiry that he noted other inventors {{did not seem to be}} pursuing. Building on the ideas of previous scientists and inventors Marconi re-engineered their apparatus by trial and error attempting to build a radio based wireless telegraphic system that would function the same as wired telegraphy. He would work on the system through 1895 in his lab and then in field tests making improvements to extend its range. After many breakthroughs, including applying the wired telegraphy concept of grounding the transmitter and receiver, Marconi was able, by early 1896, to transmit radio far beyond the short ranges that had been predicted. Having failed to interest the Italian government, the 22-year-old inventor brought his telegraphy system to Britain in 1896 and met William Preece, a Welshman, who was a major figure in the field and Chief Engineer of the General Post Office. A series of demonstrations for the British government followed—by March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about [...] across Salisbury Plain.|$|E
