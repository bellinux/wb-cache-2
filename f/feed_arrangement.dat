Few years back, main target of CEB was to achieve 100 % electrification level {{and was not}} greatly concerned about the reliability of electricity supply. Presently Sri Lanka has achieved 96 % electrification level [01]. It {{is expected to reach}} 100 % with in next few years. Presently CEB is providing electricity supply to 90 % consumers and LECO is providing electricity to the remaining 10 % consumers in Sri Lanka [02]. Once electricity is there the consumers will be more concerned about supply reliability. Nowadays most human activities depend on the electricity supply availability. Therefore electricity service providers need to provide reliable supply to consumers. Electricity supply reliability can be improved providing N- 1, N- 2, and N- 3 electricity feeding plans. At least CEB need to provide N- 1 electricity <b>feeding</b> <b>arrangement</b> to their consumers.

Such antennas {{are useful for}} monolithic integration with active components. Specifically, micromachining can be employed to achieve a low dielectric constant region under the patch which causes (i) the suppression of surface waves and hence the increase in radiation efficiency and (ii) increase in the bandwidth. The performance of such a patch antenna can be significantly improved by selecting a coupled <b>feed</b> <b>arrangement.</b> We have optimized the dimensions and location of the capacitive feeding strip to get the maximum improvement in bandwidth.

40|$|Power {{distribution}} systems feed in radial {{and ring}} feeding mechanisms. The radial <b>feeding</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{is used in}} rural networks where reliability is very low. In urban areas, ring <b>feeding</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{are likely to be}} used which provides an alternative <b>feeding</b> <b>arrangement</b> for load. Colombo City uses an open loop <b>feeding</b> <b>arrangement</b> with a normally open point in the ring arrangement. It has an underground 11 kV network where panel substations in a ring (partly meshed) manner are connected around the primary substation. Outgoing feeders from these panel substations are again connected in a ring manner through Ring Main Units. By providing correct directional protection coordination these panel substations can be operated in a closed loop ring arrangement to improve reliability. It will also reduce distribution line losses and improve the system voltage profile. In my dissertation, area fed by Primary Substation F was taken into consideration for analysis. Different time zones were recognized based on load changes for week days and weekends. The possible ring arrangements were identified and load flow analysis was carried out using SynerGEE for radial and closed loop ring arrangement to detail the power loss reduction, voltage improvement, excessive active power and reactive power absorbed by loads. Reliability improvement was derived for SAIFI and SAIDI, using the rate of failure of cables based on the cable failure details of Colombo City. Voltage analysis and cost analysis were also carried out using SynerGEE. Directional protection coordination was derived for two feeders operating in closed loop, two substations operating in closed loop and three substations operating in closed loop to cover the identified paralleling patterns in selected zones. Based on fault levels and the cable impedance data protection settings were calculated for actual field conditions for each pattern. Each pattern was simulated in Matlab to monitor the voltage and current variations for cable faults. In conclusion, if the conditions prevail, the panel arrangement existing in Colombo City provides an easy approach to operate the system in a closed loop ring arrangement by replacing existing numerical relays with directional numerical relays, which improves the reliability, reduces the distribution losses and provides voltage improvements...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of large antennas in spacecraft is often limited by available volume, {{as well as}} by the more usual mass limitation. Shroud dimensions usually determine the maximum aperture which can be carried without resorting to complex and potentially unreliable unfurling mechanisms.

FLAPS (Flat Parabolic Surface) is a newly developed technology for RF reflector surfaces which frees the spacecraft designer from the packaging rigidity of the common parabolic dish. It offers the ability to essentially duplicate the capability of a parabolic reflector in a reflector of almost any shape. The surface is shaped electrically rather than physically, in much the same manner as in a phased array, but by a totally passive array of dipoles suspended above a conductive ground plane. The dipoles are sized and spaced for the particular frequency and <b>feed</b> <b>arrangement</b> desired, and can produce a beam of essentially any desired shape.

40|$|In this {{research}} we attempted several modifications to microstrip ring/loop antennas to design multi-frequency antennas through systematic approaches. Such multi-frequency antennas {{can be useful}} while building compact terminals to operate at multiple wireless standards. One of the primary contributions {{was the use of}} a capacitive <b>feed</b> <b>arrangement</b> that enables simultaneous excitation of multiple concentric rings from an underlying transmission line. The combined antenna operates in the same resonant bands as the individual rings and avoids some of the bands at harmonic frequencies. A similar feeding arrangement is used to obtain dual band characteristics from just one ring, with improved bandwidth. This is made possible by widening two adjacent sides of a square ring antenna symmetrically, and attaching an open stub to the inner edge of the side opposite to the feed line. Use of fractal segments replacing the side with the stub also results in a similar performance. Use of fractal geometries has been widely associated with multi-functional antennas. It has been observed from the parametric studies that, the ratio of the resonant frequencies can range from 1. 5 to 2. 0. This shows some flexibility in systematically designing dual-band antennas with a desired pair of resonant frequencies. An analysis technique based on multi-port network modeling (MNM) has been proposed to accurately predict the input characteristics of these antennas. This approach can make use of the ordered nature of fractal geometries to simplify computations. Several prototype antennas have been fabricated and tested successfully to validate simulation and analytical results...|$|E
