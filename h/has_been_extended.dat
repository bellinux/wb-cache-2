CBS states that the season premiere would deal with where life has taken Sara and what brings her back to Las Vegas.|$|E
5|$|Ford Road {{has been}} a part of the state highway system since December 3, 1930. Since the state has {{maintained}} the roadway as M-153, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> westward from Wayne County into Washtenaw County and upgraded in sections to expressway conditions. The first of these improvements were made in the 1930s with additional upgrades in the 1960s and 1970s. The last change was made by 1980 to create the modern routing.|$|E

5|$|The modern routing of this highway was {{originally}} defined in 1954. Since then, FM1957's western terminus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> to FM471 near Rio Medina, {{and the entire}} routing along Culebra Road was transferred to FM3487. Before the current routing was established, FM1957 was also the designation for a highway in Borden County from 1951 to 1954, now part of FM1610.|$|E
5|$|Worth was {{originally}} a village {{with its own}} civil parish, lying just beyond {{the eastern edge of}} the Crawley urban area and borough boundary; but development of the Pound Hill and Maidenbower neighbourhoods has filled in the gaps, and the borough boundary <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> to include the whole of the village. The civil parish of Worth remains, albeit reduced in size, as part of the Mid Sussex district.|$|E
5|$|A road {{bearing the}} M-81 {{designation}} has existed {{since at least}} July 1, 1919, when the state initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended,</b> rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last change was {{the construction of a}} pair of roundabouts at the I-75/US23 interchange in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Skagen's Skipper School {{was opened}} to train navigators for both fishing boats and {{merchant}} ships. It {{is now the}} only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003. The private school Brovandeskolen, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach. A primary goal is active cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Cross Hotel, 118 High St (cnr. High and Princes Sts) (Category I). One of Dunedin's {{principal}} hotels, the Southern Cross {{is housed}} in an impressive 1883 building designed by Louis Boldini. It occupies a prominent corner site {{in the heart of}} the Exchange. Formerly the Grand Hotel, the building <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> considerably on several occasions in its history, and was considerably renovated in the 1980s, though most of its original features remain. The Southern Cross Hotel Building is home to Dunedin Casino.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground was}} first {{constructed}} in 1905, soon before the club moved in. The club rented the ground until 1933, when newly appointed chairman Charles Jeyes organised {{the purchase of}} the stadium. The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989, when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £3.25million. The club was granted a seven-year lease at peppercorn rent for its continued use. This arrangement <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> several times, and as of 2015 is due to end in 2028.|$|E

5|$|The {{line will}} operate as M3 and M4. The former will run a full circle, while M4 will only {{operate on the}} eastern half from Copenhagen Central Station (København H) via Østerport to Nørrebro. This {{solution}} is temporary, once the metro network <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> to Nordhavn, the M4 will start at Copenhagen Central Station but leave the City Circle Line at Østerport and service the Nordhavn branch. Later, when the Sydhavn extension has been completed, the M4 will have Ny Ellebjerg as its southern terminus. Trains will operate both ways through the circle. The line will have transfer to M1 and M2 at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv. The line is estimated to carry 240,000daily passengers, bringing the metro's total daily ridership to 460,000.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} two other {{highways}} to bear the M-84 moniker. The first was one in the Upper Peninsula and the second was in The Thumb area. The current highway was originally part of M-47 until that road was relocated onto what was formerly US10 in the Tri-Cities area. Since the 1960s reuse of the number, M-84 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> in the 1970s to replace part of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75, now Business Spur I-75, BS I-75) in Bay City. Other projects have reconstructed and widened the roadway through the Bay City area in the early 21st century.|$|E
5|$|USB {{implements}} {{connections to}} storage devices using {{a set of}} standards called the USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS). This was at first intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> to support flash drives. It has also been extended to support {{a wide variety of}} novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.|$|E

5|$|While {{driving through}} {{a rural area}} in Georgia, Peter and his group are pulled over by the local sheriff, and Peter makes every effort to talk as annoyingly and rudely to him as possible. But the Sheriff is more {{offended}} by Cleveland's attempt to calmingly explain themselves, punching out one of their headlights and then planting a bag of marijuana in their trunk. The group are then sent to a county work camp where {{they are forced to}} perform various tasks, including ditch digging and rock crushing. As their stay in the jail supposedly comes to an end, the warden then approaches them and tells them that their stay <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended</b> an additional thirty days. Learning from another prisoner that they might be locked up forever, the group decides {{to break out of the}} prison when the prison guards's eyes are diverted. Successful in their attempt, they soon come across a house where they discover a set of handcuff and shackle keys.|$|E
5|$|Question Time is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but for that reason alone – that the invitation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>extended.</b>|$|E
