40|$|Literature from {{a variety}} of fields {{indicates}} that Physical Education classes can {{have a positive impact on}} students? <b>educational</b> outcomes. <b>Kinesiology</b> and health related publications indicate that individuals who engage in regular, vigorous exercise reap myriad health benefits, including a decreased risk of contracting chronic diseases. The benefits of exercise are particularly noteworthy for school age children, many of whom are obese, and lack access to sufficiently rigorous P. E. classes. Anecdotal evidence from the education field further suggests that students who engage in physical activity during the day are more focused in the classroom and have better learning outcomes as a result. Psychology literature also indicates that people who engage in regular physical activity enjoy improved mental health, which can also correlate to improved academic performance. Although a variety of disciplines embrace physical activity, and by association P. E. programs, economists have paid little attention to the subject. Economic research in education has focused on decisions regarding funding for education and the matter of opportunity cost for students, rather than on the specific relationship between P. E. and student outcomes. As such, this paper concludes that to fully understand the topic in an economic framework, there remains a need for a focused investigation of the issue. In order to effectively interrogate the subject, it is necessary to implement a longitudinal study of a newly implemented P. E. program at a school that did not previously have a formal P. E. curriculum...|$|R

The college is organized as four departments and one center: (i) Counseling and Higher Education, (ii) <b>Educational</b> Psychology, (iii) <b>Kinesiology,</b> Health Promotion and Recreation, (iv) Teacher Education and Administration, and (v) The Kristin Farmer Autism Center. As of the Fall 2012, enrollment was 4,178—27% at the graduate level (609 masters, 416 doctoral, 86 post doctoral).

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the combined effects of <b>educational</b> <b>kinesiology</b> tasks and stuttering treatment on the fluency of a pre-school child who stutters. Method: This paper details a case study. After the initial diagnosis of a 3 -year; 5 -month old male with a very severe fluency disorder as indicated by the SSI- 4, four months of {{a modified version of the}} Lidcombe program for stuttering was completed. After 4 months of receiving this treatment, the participant began receiving occupational therapy services in addition to speech services for two additional months. The occupational services incorporated <b>educational</b> <b>kinesiology</b> tasks. Measures of fluency were obtained throughout the intervention stages. Results: Fluency measures indicated no significant decrease in stuttered syllable proportions during the initial four-month treatment period. However, significant decreases in stuttered syllable proportions during the combined treatments were documented. The participant’s fluency levels were determined to be within normal limits after two months of the combined treatments and he was discharged from treatment. Conclusion: Although natural recovery is common during the participant’s age group, the results of this study indicated that the incorporation of movement-type exercises into fluency treatment might lead to greater gains in fluency. It is possible that these movement tasks recruit and stabilize neural function in regions of the brain such as the cerebellum which has been shown to exhibit signs of dysfunction in people who stutter. Future research should be conducted with larger sample sizes in order to investigate the generalizability of these findings...|$|E
40|$|Following recent {{legislative}} {{initiatives in}} education requiring evidence-based practices, schools have implemented various instructional programs characterized as evidence-based. However, {{it is important}} to question whether these methods are truly effective. One example of a methodology currently promoted and used in schools is an <b>educational</b> <b>kinesiology</b> program called Brain Gym®. Brain Gym ® is reported to improve various education related skills. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of Brain Gym ® on academic engagement for children with developmental disabilities. In this study, Brain Gym ® was compared to an alternate intervention, simple physical activity, which did not conform to Brain Gym ® guidelines. Neither intervention produced consistently positive effects for academic engagement. Based on these findings, it is questionable whether Brain Gym ® can successfully be used with children with developmental disabilities to improve engagement. These results can inform the decision-making process of selecting evidence-based practices in education. In recent years, legislation such as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 or the 2004 revision of the Individual with Disabilities Education Act have prompted schools in the United States to begin choosing instructional practices that are evidence-based. However, not all instructional practices are equally effective. Some produce more positiv...|$|E
40|$|D. Ed. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} a strategy to identify and develop entrepreneurship from the point of educational psychology. In this regard, it was necessary to divide the study into two components. The first was to determine a profile of the entrepreneur and secondly how this profile could be developed. In the first part in the literature attributes and skills of the entrepreneur were researched and empirical tested. Two questionnaires were specifically developed to identify attributes and skills of entrepreneurs: firstly a questionnaire, The Entrepreneurial Index Questionnaire, for individuals with a qualification standard six and higher and secondly a projective format questionnaire, The Entrepreneurial Index Projective Format, for semi-skilled and unskilled individuals. In the second part techniques were introduced to developed entrepreneurial attributes and skills: Neurolinguistic Programming and <b>Educational</b> <b>Kinesiology.</b> A specific program to develop entrepreneurship with young adults was also introduced. The programme was completed with a illustration of a young adult that completed the program. The following results were obtained from the empirical investigation: From the anova variance-analysis there is a significant statistical difference on all the entrepreneurial attributes and skills. The Scheffe-pair-variance-analysis show significant statistic differences on the average scores of the entrepreneurial attributes and skills except for: Questionnaire test General knowledge and driving force, responsibility, selfimage and interpersonal relations. Risk and responsibility, self-image and interpersonal relations. Drive force and depression. Adaptation and interpersonal relations. Responsibility and stress, aggression and depression. Stress and interpersonal relations. Self-image and depression. Aggression and interpersonal relations. Depression and interpersonal relations. Projective test Mental alertness in all pairs. Total work attitude and responsibility. Locus of control and responsibility. Locus of control and interpersonal relationships. Adaptation and responsibility. The program for the development of entrepreneurial skills was divided into four phases: what is possible, what is realistic, critical analysing of the business opportunity and lastly the implementation of above mentioned steps. Each phase went through specific steps and NLP and Edu-K was used in each step one to develop and anchor specific attributes and skills of entrepreneurship. The implementation of the program is implemented on five levels. The basic level is the individual environment. The entrepreneur is going to operate in the environment through behaviour. The behaviour is guided by the individual capabilities. These capabilities are organized by the believe systems. Believe systems are organized by the identity of the entrepreneur. The illustration analysis of the individuals that completed the course shows a growth and development in the entrepreneurial attributes and skills that were identified in the first part of the study. It seems possible to identify certain attributes and skills that is part of the successful entrepreneur, and develop it in the young adult to become an entrepreneur...|$|E
