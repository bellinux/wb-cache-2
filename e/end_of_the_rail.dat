5|$|MT 287 {{begins at}} a T-intersection with MT 41 {{in the town}} of Twin Bridges. MT 41 heads west along Fourth Street to cross the Beaverhead River and north along Main Street. MT 287 heads south on Main Street and veers {{southeast}} out of the town. The two-lane highway parallels an inactive Montana Rail Link line through the valley of the Ruby River between the Ruby Range to the southwest and the Tobacco Root Mountains to the northeast. MT 287 follows Main Street through the town of Sheridan, where the route passes the H.D. Rossiter Building, Christ Episcopal Church and Rectory, and the William O'Brien House. The highway passes by the Robbers Roost and to the west of St. Mary of the Assumption Church in the hamlet of Laurin before reaching the southern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line in the unincorporated village of Alder, through which the highway follows Main Street and meets the northern end of Upper Ruby Road, which is designated Secondary Highway 357 (S-357).|$|E
25|$|The battery {{covering}} the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> tunnel was completed between 1913 and 1916, mounting six 155mm guns. It was renovated in the 1930s, but unaltered. The position remained military property into the 2000s, and is presently abandoned. It {{is owned by}} the commune of Modane. Access is forbidden.|$|E
25|$|Supply trains carried all the {{necessary}} material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it {{the rest of the}} ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the track ballast and levelled {{to get ready for the}} rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with spike mauls. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and rail installation repeated.|$|E
25|$|LRV 2311 was {{destroyed}} on September 20, 2016 when it departed Tuscany Station into the tail track, and overshot <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> crashing into <b>the</b> tail fence and a metal power pole at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> <b>The</b> LRV was {{retired as a}} result.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the battle}} Dearborn served under Colonel John Stark {{at the front}} lines, near the right <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> fence. In his {{controversial}} account published in The Port Folio on April 29, 1818, Dearborn directly attacked the integrity of Putnam's involvement at the Battle, maintaining: ...|$|E
2500|$|The W was a {{standard}} gauge road with rails of [...] flat bar constructed upon ties cut from white oak and locust. The main line ran [...] with another [...] of sidings and turnouts. The railroad terminated {{at the corner}} of Water and Market Streets in Winchester. The Winchester depot immediately became a key economic hub serving merchant traders in Winchester for commodities such as wheat, hide, fur, tobacco and hemp. [...] The north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line also served the thriving industrial town of Virginius Island, which sat astride the Shenandoah Canal {{on the south side of}} Harpers Ferry.|$|E
2500|$|Amusement park railroads {{have had}} a long and varied history in American {{amusement}} parks as well as overseas. Some of the earliest park trains were not really trains; they were trolleys, which brought park patrons to the parks on regular rail lines from the cities to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> lines where the parks were located. As such, some older parks, such as Kennywood in Pennsylvania, were referred to as trolley parks. [...] The earliest park trains that only operated on lines within the park's boundaries, {{such as the one}} on the Zephyr Railroad in Dorney Park, were mostly custom-built. [...] Also, amusement park railroads tend to be narrow gauge, meaning the space between their rails is smaller than that of [...] railroads. [...] Some specific narrow gauges that are common on amusement park railroads are [...] gauge, [...] gauge, , and [...] gauge.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Jones. [...] "Just pile up two {{or three}} plates or {{something}} to lean <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> on. There, notice the way it buzzes before it starts. Isn't that a great thing for a kid, eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|That train carried {{hundreds}} of men, tons of steel rails, thousands of ties; and also it was equipped {{to feed the}} workers and to fight Indians. It ran to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> about forty miles out of Roaring City.|$|R
50|$|During a rolling-highway journey, if {{the drivers}} {{accompany}} the trailer, they are accommodated in a passenger car with seats or beds. At both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> link there are purpose-built terminals {{that allow the}} train to be easily loaded and unloaded.|$|R
2500|$|The Coast Line Limited {{was heading}} for Los Angeles, California, on May 22, 1907, when it was derailed just west of Glendale, California. Passenger cars {{reportedly}} tumbled down the embankment. At least two were killed and others injured. [...] "The horrible deed was planned with devilish accurateness," [...] the Pasadena Star News reported at the time. It said spikes {{were removed from the}} track and hook placed under the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail.</b> [...] The Star's coverage was extensive and its editorial blasted the criminal elements behind the wreck. [...] "Diabolism Incarnate" [...] is how they headlined the editorial. It read: [...] "The man or men who committed this horrible deed near Glendale may not be anarchists, technically speaking. But if they are sane men, moved by motive, they are such stuff as anarchists are made of. If the typical anarchist conceived that a railroad corporation should be terrorized, he would not scruple to wreck a passenger train and send scores and hundreds to instant death." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to these accidents, MARTA trains have derailed four times in recent years. The most recent incident occurred at the Medical Center station on December 4, 2006 when a train carrying passengers was moved over a rail switch. [...] No injuries were reported. A previous derailment occurred in July 1996 during Atlanta's hosting of the Olympics. A paired car on a train which had developed mechanical problems was uncoupled from other cars at Indian Creek station (the last station on the east line). The train began rolling, crashing through the bumper at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line and running off of the track. The train operator, the only person on board, received minor injuries. In June 1996 a minor derailment occurred at the junction between the North and Northeast lines; MARTA estimated 150 people were aboard. The derailment occurred when a rail supervisor told the train driver to reverse the train after realizing the train had gone the wrong way at a track split; a MARTA investigation of the incident showed the derailment caused $125,000 of damage to the train and track and caused injury to 16 passengers. And in August 1994 a minor derailment occurred at a switch between Candler Park and Inman Park. Approximately 20 passengers were on board {{and no one was}} injured.|$|E
60|$|The troops, both of {{the right}} and left wings, made most of their advance along the line of railroads, which they destroyed. The method adopted to perform this work, was to burn and destroy all the bridges and culverts, and for a long distance, at places, to tear up the track and bend the rails. Soldiers to do this rapidly would form a line along one side of the road with {{crowbars}} and poles, place these under the rails and, hoisting all at once, turn over many rods of road at one time. The ties would then be placed in piles, and the rails, as they were loosened, would be carried and put across these log heaps. When a sufficient number of rails were placed upon a pile of ties it would be set on fire. This would heat the rails very much more in the middle, that being over {{the main part of the}} fire, than at the ends, so that they would naturally bend of their own weight; but the soldiers, to increase the damage, would take tongs and, one or two men at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail,</b> carry it with force against the nearest tree and twist it around, thus leaving rails forming bands to ornament the forest trees of Georgia. All this work was going on at the same time, there being a sufficient number of men detailed for that purpose. Some piled the logs and built the fire; some put the rails upon the fire; while others would bend those that were sufficiently heated: so that, by the time the last bit of road was torn up, that it was designed to destroy at a certain place, the rails previously taken up were already destroyed.|$|E
60|$|They {{carried the}} tie out to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> {{and dropped it}} on the level road-bed. Men there set it {{straight}} and tamped the gravel around it. Neale and his partner went back for another, passing a dozen couples carrying ties forward. Behind these staggered <b>the</b> rows <b>of</b> men burdened with <b>the</b> heavy iron <b>rails.</b>|$|R

Instead, both <b>the</b> movable <b>rails</b> and <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{diverging}} routes have their ends cut off square. The switch mechanism aligns <b>the</b> movable <b>rails</b> with <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diverging routes. In 19th century US railroad use, the stub switch was typically {{used in conjunction with}} a harp switch stand.|$|R

50|$|The {{first white}} {{settlers}} in the area now known as Eriksdale, were from Sweden and began arriving in 1905. They mostly arrived via Oak Point, which was the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> line at the time.|$|E
25|$|Track {{circuits}} {{can detect}} some {{but not all}} broken rails. Broken rails in switches may be in parallel paths, which cannot be detected. Breaks that are not clean breaks {{from top to bottom}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> also cannot be detected. Wiring at the start and finish of track circuits are connected a short distance from <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails,</b> so that there is a blind spot within which broken rails are not detected.|$|R

60|$|Those days it {{took the}} work-train several hours to reach <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails.</b> Neale rode by some places with a {{profound}} satisfaction in the certainty that but for him the track would not yet have been spiked there. Construction was climbing fast into the hills. He wondered when and where would be <b>the</b> long-looked-for meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rails</b> connecting East with West.
