Monotremes have some features which may be <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original amniotes such as the same orifice to urinate, defecate and reproduce (cloaca) – as lizards and birds also do – and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} {{element of a}} group G is often written as 1 or 1G, a notation <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> multiplicative identity. If a group is abelian, then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the {{identity element}} by 0; in that case, the group is called an additive group. The identity element can also be written as id.|$|E

The king again asks {{the advice of the}} spaeman, who tentatively suggests that the king's only daughter, Princess Gem-de-lovely, his most prized possession, will have to be offered to the stoor worm to encourage it to leave. During the ten-week period of grace before the princess has to be sacrificed, messengers are despatched to every corner of the realm offering the kingdom, marriage to the princess, and the magic sword the king had <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> god Odin.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Etruscans {{were still in}} use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E

5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E
5|$|Most fungi {{have both}} a haploid and a diploid stage {{in their life}} cycles. In sexually {{reproducing}} fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, anastomosis, {{is required for the}} initiation of the sexual cycle. Many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes go through a dikaryotic stage, in which the nuclei <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two parents do not combine immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis).|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{regard the}} badnjak customs as practises <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> old Slavic {{religion}}. In the pre-Christian {{religion of the}} Serbs, as shown by Serbian scholar Veselin Čajkanović, there were trees seen as dwelling places of spirits or divinities. Čajkanović argues that there were also trees seen as divinities per se. He considers the badnjak as a convincing example of the latter. Salutations, prayers, and sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered to him (the name badnjak is of masculine gender in Serbian); he is consistently treated not as a tree but as a person.|$|E

Previously, it was a formal transition for pupils from one playroom to the next {{at the beginning of the}} year, which involved a pupil from each year announcing to the playroom of the year below them that the next playroom had been vacated by the senior pupils. The students and their belongings would then move up to their next playroom.|$|E
5|$|The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{collection}} of William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), {{a pioneer of}} astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, {{during the reign of}} Landgrave Frederick III. Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{style of}} {{architecture}} {{was influenced by}} the Pallava and Badami Chalukya architectural features, in addition to indigenous Jain features. The Ganga pillars with a conventional lion at the base and a circular shaft of the pillar on its head, the stepped Vimana of the shrine with horizontal mouldings and square pillars were features <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pallavas. These features are also found in structures built by their subordinates, the Banas and Nolambas.|$|E

5|$|The most {{powerful}} ordinary magistrate was the consul, {{of which there}} were two, who served {{for the period of}} one year. These consuls had the authority to call assemblies of the people. In the early Republic, they held judicial duties until these responsibilities were moved to the praetors and later to permanent courts; similarly, they held financial responsibilities until these duties were transferred to the quaestors. The consuls also held vague religious duties <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kings, along with their more important military functions, serving as the commander-in-chief of Rome's armies.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{revealed}} {{a number of}} problems in that the thick wing <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Yak-3 limited the top speed of the aircraft, the engine exhaust damaged the surface of the airfield, the cockpit often filled with smoke from kerosene and oil that had dripped onto the engine, and the aircraft was very short-ranged. Despite these problems, the Yak-15 proved to be very easy to fly, even for pilots accustomed to piston-engined fighters, and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} important prehistoric remains in Orkney, {{especially from the}} Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites. The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Norse period of occupation) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity..|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper compares two {{patterns}} of concurrency: the Actor Model and the Active Object Model. The Actor Model {{is a pattern}} that decouples function invocation from execution and offers both inherent thread-safety and scalability. The Active Object Model <b>inherits</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Actor Model and as such presents the same major properties. As the Active Object Model <b>inherits</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Actor Model one may think they are equivalent. Throughout this paper we show that both patterns differ in terms of structure design and communication protocols. These differences affect the choice of pattern for specific applications as each pattern has strengths and weaknesses...|$|R
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that auxiliary infantry fought in a looser order than legionaries. It appears that in a set-piece battle-line, auxiliary infantry would normally be stationed on the flanks, with legionary infantry holding the centre e.g. as in the Battle of Watling Street (AD 60), the final defeat of the rebel Britons under queen Boudicca. This was a tradition <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Republic, when the precursors of auxiliary cohortes, the Latin alae, occupied the same position in the line. The flanks of the line required equal, if not greater, skill to hold as the centre.|$|E
5|$|When {{one parent}} is {{heterozygous}} for the mutation, {{and the other}} homozygous for the mutation or the normal form of the myostatin gene, the expected average difference in rib eye area of progeny will be about 0.9in2 (12.3in2 x 7.5%), {{depending on whether the}} mutation or normal form of the gene is <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heterozygous parent. In this case, the unpredictable variation in rib eye area represents about twice the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy.|$|E
5|$|By 6 April 1941, the VVKJ {{had been}} almost {{completely}} mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighter aircraft, and 100 modern medium bombers. Other than {{a small number of}} locally made Rogožarski IK-3 fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available. The KJRM consisted of a flotilla of river monitors based on the Danube and a small fleet based in several ports along the Adriatic coast. The blue-water navy centred on a flotilla leader, three smaller destroyers, four obsolescent submarines and a gunboat, supplemented by minelayers and torpedo boats. Some of the smaller vessels in the Yugoslav fleet had been <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire following World War I and were obsolete.|$|E

50|$|Bilateral primogeniture is a rarer {{custom of}} {{inheritance}} where <b>the</b> eldest son <b>inherits</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> father and <b>the</b> eldest daughter <b>inherits</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mother. This practice was common among the Classic Mayas, who transmitted the family's household furnishings from mother to eldest daughter, and the family's land, houses and agricultural tools from father to eldest son. It was also {{seen in the}} Greek island of Karpathos, where the family's house was transmitted from mother to eldest daughter, and the family's land was transmitted from father to eldest son. Among the Igorot, the father's land is inherited by his eldest son and the mother's land is inherited by her eldest daughter.|$|R
