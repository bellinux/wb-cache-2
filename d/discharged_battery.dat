50|$|This picture {{shows the}} zinc {{container}} of fresh batteries at (a), and <b>discharged</b> <b>batteries</b> at (b) and (c). The battery shown at (c) had a polyethylene protection film (mostly removed in the photo) {{to keep the}} zinc oxide inside the casing.|$|R
5000|$|... "Battery swap technology" [...] {{requires}} an operator to manually remove the <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> from the AGV {{and place a}} fully charged battery in its place after approximately 8 - 12 hours (about one shift) of AGVs operation. 5 - 10 minutes is required to perform this with each AGV in the fleet.|$|E
5000|$|A {{car with}} a [...] "dead" [...] (<b>discharged)</b> <b>battery</b> {{can be made to}} start by {{supplying}} it with power from an external source, such as the battery of another car. The cables used to make the necessary temporary connection are also commonly called [...] "jumper cables". These usually are equipped at the ends with alligator clips.|$|E
5000|$|One {{problem with}} battery {{locomotives}} was battery replacement. This was simplified {{by use of}} removable battery boxes. Eventually, battery boxes were developed that included wheels {{so that they could}} be rolled off of the locomotive. [...] While the initial motivation had to do with battery maintenance, the primary use for this idea was at charging stations where a <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> box could be rolled off and replaced with a freshly charged box.|$|E
5000|$|After the 1990s, spent upper stages are {{generally}} passivated after their {{use as a}} launch vehicle is complete {{in order to minimize}} risks while the stage [...] [...] Passivation means removing any sources of stored energy remaining on the vehicle, as by dumping fuel or <b>discharging</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a <b>discharging</b> <b>battery</b> or {{galvanic}} cell (diagram at right), the anode is the negative terminal {{because it is}} where conventional current flows into [...] "the device" [...] (i.e. the battery cell). This inward current is carried externally by electrons moving outwards, negative charge flowing in one direction being electrically equivalent to positive charge flowing in the opposite direction.|$|R
5000|$|... is {{the actual}} time to <b>discharge</b> the <b>battery,</b> which must be {{expressed}} in hours.|$|R
50|$|The deep {{discharge}} testing is itself damaging to batteries {{due to the}} chemicals in the <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> starting to crystallize into highly stable molecular shapes that will not re-dissolve when the battery is recharged, permanently reducing charge capacity. In lead acid batteries {{this is known as}} sulfation but also affects other types such as nickel cadmium batteries and lithium batteries. Therefore, it is commonly recommended that rundown tests be performed infrequently, such as every six months to a year.|$|E
50|$|Most {{battery voltage}} testers and {{chargers}} {{that can also}} test 9V need another snap clip to hold the battery, while cylindrical batteries often share a holder that may be adjustable in size. Because of {{the proximity of the}} positive and negative terminals {{at the top of the}} battery and relatively low current of most common batteries, one informal method of testing voltage is to place the two terminals across a tongue. A strong tingle would indicate a battery with a strong charge, the absence, a <b>discharged</b> <b>battery.</b> While there have been stories circulating of unfortunate outcomes, the process is rarely dangerous under normal circumstances, though it may be unpleasant.|$|E
50|$|Telecommunications, {{electric}} power, {{and computer}} {{uninterruptible power supply}} facilities may have very large standby battery banks (installed in battery rooms) to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power. Such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation, supervisory alarms for various system faults, and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems. Chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the battery to be disconnected for maintenance, while the charger supplies the DC system load. Capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> within, say, 8 hours or other interval.|$|E
40|$|Lithium ion {{battery is}} one of the most {{promising}} technologies for electric power storage and soft energy path. However, inadequate handling of Lithium ion battery may cause spontaneous ignition. To reduce the risk of such accidents, changes of Lithium ion battery during repetitive charge and discharge cycles were investigated. By 400 cycles of charge and <b>discharge,</b> <b>battery</b> capability was reduced to about 80...|$|R
50|$|Nearly all {{vehicles}} will be fitted with 12 or 24 volt 'jump start' or 'booster' sockets to start other vehicles with <b>discharged</b> <b>batteries.</b> Most {{will also have}} power winches to load the casualty, or for dislodging stuck vehicles. Some larger recovery {{vehicles will}} have two (or more) winches capable of pulling up to 30 tons per line. These {{will be used to}} winch back vehicles that have left the roadway.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{rechargeable}} batteries can be damaged by repeated deep <b>discharge.</b> <b>Batteries</b> {{are composed of}} multiple similar, but not identical, cells. Each cell has its own charge capacity. As the battery {{as a whole is}} being deeply discharged, the cell with the smallest capacity may reach zero charge and will [...] "reverse charge" [...] as the other cells continue to force current through it. The resulting loss of capacity is often ascribed to the memory effect.|$|R
5000|$|Neutral gear (equivalent): Most jurisdictions require {{automotive}} transmissions to have {{a neutral}} gear that decouples the engine and transmission. The HSD [...] "neutral gear" [...] is achieved by turning the electric motors off. Under this condition, the planetary gear is stationary (if the vehicle wheels are not turning); if the vehicle wheels are turning, the ring gear will rotate, causing the sun gear to rotate as well (the engine inertia will keep the carrier gear stationary unless the speed is high), while MG1 is free to rotate while the batteries do not charge. The owners manual warns that Neutral gear will eventually drain the battery, resulting in [...] "unnecessary" [...] engine power to recharge batteries; a <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> will render the vehicle inoperable.|$|E
50|$|Better Place {{was started}} by Shai Agassi on October 29, 2007, {{focusing}} on building massive scale Electric Recharge Grids as infrastructure to support the deployment of electric vehicles (including plug-in hybrids). The company had said it was in talks with more than 25 countries around the world. Better Place called themselves the first Electric Recharge Grid Operator (ERGO) and was developing commercial electric vehicle networks in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Israel, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. Better Place planned to include battery switching, or swapping, stations in their network which would allow drivers to quickly exchange an electric vehicle's <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> pack for a fully charged pack. In Better Place's business model, the battery pack {{is owned by the}} network operator who then bills the electric vehicle owner for use of the battery based on distance traveled.|$|E
50|$|Fuel-powered engines allow model cars {{to reach}} {{moderate}} speeds unmodified. Maximum power is generally achieved at medium to high speeds, {{and a slightly}} slower throttle response than electrically powered vehicles {{is to be expected}} due to clutching and lack of torque. Electric motors effectively produce instantaneous torque, whereas nitro engines, like full-sized gasoline engines, take time for the engine to spool up and for the clutch to engage. Nitro- (and fuel) powered cars may be refueled and returned to action in a few seconds, as opposed to electrics which require removal of the body shell and battery fasteners to replace a <b>discharged</b> <b>battery.</b> Nitro cars are cooled some by air, some by the oil mixed in with the fuel and may be run continuously with no need to take breaks for cooling down assuming they are properly tuned.|$|E

50|$|Currently, the Buddy is {{delivered}} with lead acid <b>batteries.</b> Completely <b>discharged</b> <b>batteries</b> can be recharged in 6-8 hours. The batteries can be rapidly charged {{so that one}} hour's charging allows the vehicle to be driven about 10 km. Charging requires an ordinary, grounded outlet with a minimum circuit of 10 A. The life expectancy for the batteries {{is expected to be}} between two and five years, or about 20 000 km, depending on driving and charging habits. A complete battery set costs from , excluding value added tax.|$|R
40|$|Firstly, this {{bachelor}} thesis {{handles the}} issues concerning NiCD and NiMh batteries and methods used when charging and discharging. Next {{segment of the}} document deals with designing and the actual realization of a device, which can work with these batteries and perform variable tasks,such as charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>battery</b> with adjustable current value, measuring temperature of the battery. Sending data via the serial port,it also implements charging and discharging curve. Device can be operated intuitively using buttons and display. The Device is realized via microcontroller ATMEL...|$|R
50|$|Stage 1 {{is called}} the I-phase, constant-current stage, or bulk charge stage. This phase occurs when an IUoU charger is {{connected}} to a deeply <b>discharged</b> <b>battery.</b> The charger provides a constant current, typically the maximum current that the charger is capable of producing. As {{a result of the}} current, the battery absorbs the charge and its voltage rises. The charger limits the maximum voltage to Umax, a constant or temperature-dependent maximum, typically around 2.4 V per cell. Once the Umax voltage is reached, typically when the battery is charged to 70-80% of its capacity, the charger enters the Uo-phase. In case of a battery that is more than 80% full, this may happen immediately once the charger is switched on. Some chargers may keep the voltage at Umax for some time and allow the current to drop to 80% of the constant-current value, before proceeding to the next stage.|$|E
5000|$|On May 13, 2009, Better Place premiered their battery {{switching}} station {{to the public}} in Yokohama where BP had been invited by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment. The battery {{switching station}} demonstrated was set up similarly to a gas station automatic car wash. The vehicle drove up on a ramp and was aligned on the swapping pad. The battery shuttle then engaged and rose up toward the bottom of the vehicle. It made contact with the battery, released it, lowered it, and moved the depleted battery pack away from the car. The charged battery pack was then inserted. The <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> was returned to the charging bay. The battery switch was complete in less than two minutes and the vehicle drove away. [...] The battery swap was designed to require less time than filling a tank of gas. [...] In order to keep electric vehicles in demand, Better Place {{was going to try to}} keep the vehicles competitive with the other cars on the market. By building infrastructure that made owning an electric car more practical, they hoped to increase demand.|$|E
30|$|Some {{users have}} {{expressed}} their concern or fear of becoming {{stuck with a}} <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> in a limited-range vehicle, away from the electric infrastructure. With the urban short-range vehicle model proposed above, this concern is reduced since the EV will be used primarily for short city distances. That concern can be further reduced if the battery leasing model is applied whereby users {{will be allowed to}} exchange their discharged batteries with charged ones.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>discharging</b> <b>battery</b> or a {{galvanic}} cell, the cathode is {{the positive}} terminal since {{that is where}} the current flows out of the device (see drawing). This outward current is carried internally by positive ions moving from the electrolyte to the positive cathode (chemical energy is responsible for this [...] "uphill" [...] motion). It is continued externally by electrons moving inwards, this negative charge moving inwards constituting positive current flowing outwards. For example, the Daniell galvanic cell's copper electrode is the positive terminal and the cathode.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} level usesRS-485 {{levels at}} 1 Mbit/s data rate. The encoding uses a Manchester II code and a HDLC frame protocol with proper voltage balancing to avoid DC {{components in the}} galvanic isolation transformers. The Manchester decoder uses a phase/quadrature demodulation (not RS485, that operates with zero-crossings) which allows to span 750 m under worst-case conditions, especially when only the two extremity vehicles are equipped, {{as is the case}} with multiple traction for freight trains. No repeaters are foreseen since vehicles in between can have <b>discharged</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{lead-acid}} {{batteries are}} still important {{and very often}} used type of battery even in 21 st century. This project is focused on development of charger, which provides fast, but save charging of batteries with respect to maximum life time and reliability. The developed system uses constant current charging and constant voltage charging methods. It's specialized in charging batteries with liquid or gel electrolyte and traction types of batteries, which works with 12 V value of voltage. It's able to charge safely the deeply <b>discharged</b> <b>batteries</b> and when battery is unpluged for a long time, it can keep its capacity at maximum level too. The charger can choose optimal charging process according to the <b>discharged</b> level of <b>battery.</b> Each charging phase is interpreted by light signals and the achievable charging current is 20 A...|$|R
30|$|The {{internal}} {{control of the}} converter is also presented in Fig.  3. In {{order to maintain the}} line voltage of the AC bus at 400  V rms independently of the active and reactive power deviations among the DERs and the loads, a feedback control compares the magnitude of the measured voltage with the desired of 400  V. Since the nominal open-circuit voltage of the <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> is sufficiently high, the converter operates constantly at the linear region.|$|E
40|$|Inside a {{wireless}} sensor network there exist a number of nodes; often deployed in remote and inaccessible areas. These nodes take the power from batteries. The nodes are intended for monitoring physical phenomena like temperature changes, Percentage of humidity etc. Over the time, any of the nodes finds itself {{in a situation that}} it is difficult to maintain its course of routine. This can happen due to a <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> or any physical damage to the node. This situation hampers the synchronization accuracy among nodes. Therefore, in this paper a method is suggested to keep the throughput inside {{a wireless}} sensor network, simply by anticipating the situation with an algorithm that is based on consensus approach and using average time synchronization protocol...|$|E
30|$|Range {{anxiety in}} EVs refers to “[road users] continual concern {{and fear of}} {{becoming}} stranded with a <b>discharged</b> <b>battery</b> in a limited range vehicle” (Tate et al. 2008). The existence of range anxiety {{is related to the}} technical limitations of the batteries of EVs (Botsford & Szczepanek 2009). The V 2 G technology allows EVs to both draw electricity from and return electricity to the grid. Furthermore, V 2 G technology may allow utility companies to increase their use of intermittent renewable energies, such as wind and solar (Guille & Gross 2009 b). Therefore, we think early consumers will tolerate hassle, and later, consumers will not because there will be a new technology to resolve it. According to some experts, vehicle-to-home (V 2 H) technology is therefore likely to be successful in a shorter term, as the technology operates independently from the utility company and can already manage energy flows within the home effectively (Jorrit J. Bakker 2011).|$|E
40|$|Following a deep {{discharge}} of AGM SVT 300 valve-regulated lead-acid batteries using the ten-hour <b>discharge</b> current, the <b>batteries</b> were charged using variable current. In {{accordance with the}} obtained results, exponential and polynomial functions for the approximation of the specified processes were analyzed. The main evaluation instrument {{for the quality of}} the implemented approximations was the adjusted coefficient of determination R- 2. It was perceived that the <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> process might be successfully approximated with both an exponential and the second order polynomial function. On all the occasions analyzed, values of the adjusted coefficient of determination were greater than 0. 995. The charging process of the deeply <b>discharged</b> <b>batteries</b> was successfully approximated with the exponential function; the measured values of the adjusted coefficient of determination being nearly 0. 95. Apart from the high measured values of the adjusted coefficient of determination, polynomial approximations of the second and third order did not provide satisfactory results regarding the interpolation of the battery charging characteristics. A possibility for a practical implementation of the procured regression functions in uninterruptible power supply systems was described...|$|R
30|$|Given {{the limited}} {{capacity}} of transmission lines and current situation of wind curtailment, this paper proposes a new battery-charging mode {{to solve problems}} on the power-generation and consumer sides simultaneously. The new battery-charging mode aims to transport <b>discharged</b> <b>batteries</b> from battery exchange stations to wind farms and charge batteries using energy {{that would otherwise be}} curtailed. These batteries can be used to smooth the power output and improve supply quality. In a normal battery-charging process, a stable power supply is required. However, the output from a wind turbine generator (WTG) fluctuates. Therefore, corresponding simulation and analysis are required.|$|R

In one pulse, 285 coulombs are transferred to the load whose electric energy equals 22. 6 kJ.
