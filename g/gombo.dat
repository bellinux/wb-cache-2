5000|$|In 1932, Horthy {{appointed}} <b>Gömbös</b> {{prime minister}} and made him promise not to ask for new elections. <b>Gömbös</b> publicly recanted his previous anti-Semitism when taking office. The Jewish leadership under Stem and Szanto supported the appointment of <b>Gömbös</b> and his programs in exchange for <b>Gömbös</b> promising not to enact any anti-Jewish laws and through his policies not cause economic harm to the Jews, a promise which <b>Gömbös</b> kept.|$|R
50|$|While prime minister, <b>Gömbös</b> {{was very}} active in {{international}} politics, seeking support for revising the Treaty of Trianon and trade to revive the disastrous economy. One of his major goals was to align Hungary into an Axis with Italy and Austria. Shortly after becoming prime minister, <b>Gömbös</b> flew to Italy and visited Benito Mussolini. The two came to an accord, and Mussolini gave <b>Gömbös</b> {{his support for the}} revision of the Treaty of Trianon. Mussolini also promised <b>Gömbös</b> Italy’s aid if Hungary went to war with Yugoslavia and Romania in an attempt to regain Hungary’s former territory from those nations. <b>Gömbös</b> also formed an alliance with Germany. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, <b>Gömbös</b> became the first foreign head of government to visit the Nazi leader. Shortly thereafter, <b>Gömbös</b> signed a major trade agreement with Germany which would greatly improve Hungary’s ailing economy as the 1930s progressed. <b>Gömbös</b> eventually decided to align Hungary primarily with Italy and Austria when Hitler made it clear to <b>Gömbös</b> that while he would support Hungary in an effort to regain land from Czechoslovakia, he would not support Hungary against Romania or Yugoslavia. Hitler was also against Gömbös’ plans to expand the size and power of the Hungarian military, while Mussolini supported the idea.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gömbös</b> {{entered the}} Austro-Hungarian Army as a cadet in Pécs and {{quickly became a}} member of the officer corps, serving as a captain during World War I. While in the army, <b>Gömbös</b> became a staunch {{advocate}} of Hungary's gaining independence from Austria and a bitter critic of the Habsburgs. After World War I ended and Hungary split from Austria, <b>Gömbös</b> joined Conservative Hungarian forces in Szeged that were unwilling to support Communist Béla Kun, who had seized control of Hungary in 1919, forming his own paramilitary group, the Hungarian National Defence Association (Magyar Országos Véderő Egylet, or MOVE). <b>Gömbös</b> became a close ally of Miklós Horthy, the leader of the anti-Communist government in Szeged, and played a leading role in organizing Horthy’s army. For his services, <b>Gömbös</b> was made minister of defense in the Szeged government. After Kun’s government was ousted in August 1919, <b>Gömbös</b> helped direct the purge of Communists from Hungarian society. <b>Gömbös</b> also supported certain political actions against Hungary’s Jews.|$|R
60|$|Going ashore in {{the same}} boat with the Goulds, Don Jose Avellanos was very silent. Even in the Gould {{carriage}} he did not open his lips for a long time. The mules trotted slowly away from the wharf between the extended hands of the beggars, who for that day seemed to have abandoned in a body the portals of churches. Charles Gould sat on the back seat and looked away upon the plain. A multitude of booths made of green boughs, of rushes, of odd pieces of plank eked out with bits of canvas had been erected all over it for the sale of cana, of dulces, of fruit, of cigars. Over little heaps of glowing charcoal Indian women, squatting on mats, cooked food in black earthen pots, and boiled the water for the mate gourds, which they offered in soft, caressing voices to the country people. A racecourse had been staked out for the vaqueros; and away to the left, from where the crowd was massed thickly about a huge temporary erection, like a circus tent of wood with a conical grass roof, came the resonant twanging of harp strings, the sharp ping of guitars, with the grave drumming throb of an Indian <b>gombo</b> pulsating steadily through the shrill choruses of the dancers.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned his}} horse slowly, and paced {{on between the}} booths, {{checking}} the mare almost to a standstill now and then for children, for the groups {{of people from the}} distant Campo, who stared after him with admiration. The Company's lightermen saluted him from afar; and the greatly envied Capataz de Cargadores advanced, amongst murmurs of recognition and obsequious greetings, towards the huge circus-like erection. The throng thickened; the guitars tinkled louder; other horsemen sat motionless, smoking calmly above the heads of the crowd; it eddied and pushed before the doors of the high-roofed building, whence issued a shuffle and thumping of feet in time to the dance music vibrating and shrieking with a racking rhythm, overhung by the tremendous, sustained, hollow roar of the <b>gombo.</b> The barbarous and imposing noise of the big drum, that can madden a crowd, and that even Europeans cannot hear without a strange emotion, seemed to draw Nostromo on to its source, while a man, wrapped up in a faded, torn poncho, walked by his stirrup, and, buffeted right and left, begged [...] "his worship" [...] insistently for employment on the wharf. He whined, offering the Senor Capataz half his daily pay for the privilege of being admitted to the swaggering fraternity of Cargadores; the other half would be enough for him, he protested. But Captain Mitchell's right-hand man--"invaluable for our work--a perfectly incorruptible fellow"--after looking down critically at the ragged mozo, shook his head without a word in the uproar going on around.|$|E
5000|$|A Mongolian {{shepherd}} <b>Gombo</b> {{lives in}} a yurt in Inner Mongolia with his wife, three children, and mother. They are portrayed as unsophisticated and traditional people. <b>Gombo</b> desires relations with his wife, to try for a fourth child, which puts his wife at unease due to Chinese law. Sergei, an intoxicated, buffoonish Russian truck driver, has stranded himself by driving his truck into a river, and is picked up by <b>Gombo,</b> taken to his family's yurt, {{to join him in}} dinner. Gombo's family are particularly taken with Sergei's back tattoos, later revealed to be music notation for the popular waltz, [...] "On the Hills of Manchuria". <b>Gombo</b> and Sergei become mutually dependent despite their language and cultural differences. <b>Gombo</b> and Sergei go into the nearest city together, where <b>Gombo</b> is supposed to buy contraceptives (condoms); buying a television set and other goods, but not contraceptives due to the drugstore staff being women. Sergei, a former army bandsman, becomes drunk and sings [...] "On the Hills of Manchuria" [...] in a nightclub, with the band playing from tattoos on his back. He is arrested and bailed out of jail by <b>Gombo.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Gömbös</b> {{had been}} a Smallholder before the war, but veered sharply to the right in the {{upheaval}} following the breakup of Austria-Hungary. After Miklós Horthy was made regent of Hungary in 1920, <b>Gömbös</b> became the primary leader of Hungary’s emerging nationalist movement, which was gaining some support from the people {{in response to the}} brief period of Communist rule and the signing of the Treaty of Trianon, which resulted in Hungary losing two-thirds of its territory to neighboring nations. Despite some disagreements with Horthy, <b>Gömbös</b> was active in the widespread purge of Hungarian Communists and later organized mass military opposition to the Habsburg pretender Charles IV's plan to regain his throne in 1921, a move which kept Horthy firmly in control of Hungary. Later that year, <b>Gömbös</b> became one of the primary leaders of the opposition to Prime Minister István Bethlen.

Gombo's wife, although saddened when learning that he bought no contraceptives, leaves the yurt, inviting him to follow her with a gesture. <b>Gombo</b> follows her out onto the prairie, sticking an urga (a long stick with a lasso on the end used to capture animals) into the ground in a traditional signal that a couple is being intimate.
