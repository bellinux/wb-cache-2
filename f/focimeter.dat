50|$|A lensmeter or lensometer, {{also known}} as a <b>focimeter</b> or vertometer, is an {{ophthalmic}} instrument. It is mainly used by optometrists and opticians to verify the correct prescription in a pair of eyeglasses, to properly orient and mark uncut lenses, and to confirm the correct mounting of lenses in spectacle frames. Lensmeters can also verify the power of contact lenses, if a special lens support is used.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{an optical}} {{apparatus}} enabling {{the measurement of}} spherical power, cylindrical power, and optical center coordinates of ophthalmic lenses. The main advantage of this new <b>focimeter</b> {{is to provide a}} full bidimensional mapping of the characteristics of ophthalmic glasses. This is made possible thanks to the use of a large-area and high-resolution position-sensitive detector. We describe the measurement principle and present some typical mappings, particularly for progressive lenses. We then discuss the advantages in terms of speed and versatility of such a <b>focimeter</b> for the measurement of complex lens mappings. (C) 2002 Optical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{accuracy}} and precision of any instrument {{should not be taken}} for granted. While there is an international standard for checking focimeters, there is no report of any study on their performance. Method: A sample set of 51 focimeters (11 brands), were used to measure the spherical power of a set of lenses and the prismatic power of two lenses complying with ISO 9342 - 1 : 2005 and other calibrated prismatic lenses and the spherical power of some grey filters. Results: The mean measured spherical power corresponded very closely with the calibrated values; however, the spread of results was substantial and 10 focimeters did not comply with ISO 8598 : 1996. The measurement of prism was much more accurate and precise and all the focimeters complied easily. With the grey filters, about one-third of the foci meters either showed erratic reading or an error with the equivalent of category 4 sunglasses. On the other hand, nine focimeters had stable and accurate reading on a filter with a luminous transmittance of 0. 5 per cent. Conclusions: These results confirm that, in common with all other measurement instruments, {{there is a need to}} ensure that a <b>focimeter</b> is reading accurately and precisely over the range of refractive powers and luminous transmittances. The accurate and precise performance of an automated <b>focimeter</b> over its working life cannot be assumed. Checking before purchase with a set of calibrated lenses and some dark sunglass tints will indicate the suitability of a <b>focimeter.</b> Routine checking with the calibrated lenses will inform the users if a <b>focimeter</b> continues to indicate accurately...|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} for accurately extracting {{the local}} fringe direction is presented. The algorithm estimates, {{in the neighborhood}} of n × n points, the direction of the gradient that points normal to the local fringe direction. The performance of four different derivative kernels is also compared. Since this method is sensitive to noise and variations in background and amplitude, a preprocessing step is used to limit these error sources. The method has been applied to the moiré deflectogram of a spherical and a progressive addition ophthalmic lens, resulting in a map of the refractive power of these lenses. The results are compared with the data obtained with a commercial <b>focimeter.</b> This technique is useful for analyzing the fringe patterns where the fringe direction is variable and must be obtained locally. ...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{simulation}} {{is being}} increasingly {{used as a}} teaching tool. Having developed a computer-generated virtual <b>focimeter,</b> {{we are now in}} the process of developing a computer-generated virtual streak retinoscope to teach the principles of retinoscopy and the effect of residual refractive error and mirror movement on the pupil reflex. One of the important requirements was to provide as accurate a simulation as possible for the completely general case of an astigmatic patient and a streak in any orientation being moved also in any orientation. This required a thorough understanding of the optical theory of the retinoscope and equations that describe the behaviour of the pupil reflex. We have taken this opportunity to review the optics of the streak retinoscope and derive equations for the behaviour of the pupil streak reflex. <br /...|$|E

In addition, the Humphrey Lens Analyzer in mode 1 gave prism measurements which were similar to conventional measurements.

40|$|Progressive {{addition}} {{spectacle lenses}} (PALs) {{have now become}} the method of choice for many presbyopic individuals to alleviate the visual problems of middle-age. Such lenses are difficult to assess and characterise because of their lack of discrete geographical locators of their key features. A {{review of the literature}} (mostly patents) describing the different designs of these lenses indicates the range of approaches to solving the visual problem of presbyopia. However, very little is published about the comparative optical performance of these lenses. A method is described here based on interferometry for the assessment of PALs, with a comparison of measurements made on an automatic <b>focimeter.</b> The relative merits of these techniques are discussed. Although the measurements are comparable, it is considered that the interferometry method is more readily automated, and would be ultimately capable of producing a more rapid result...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a Fourier {{transform}} {{technique for}} automatic analysis of moire deflectograms is presented. A squared grating {{is used to}} multiplex the information of the deflection in two orthogonal directions in one image. This procedure avoids the necessity of rotating the gratings to obtain the complete deflection information. With this method only two fringe patterns. reference and distorted, are needed to determine the complete deflection information. To deal with irregularly shaped processing areas, a Gerchberg extrapolation method is used. The automatic determination of the carrier {{as well as the}} size and position of the reconstruction windows permit the complete and automatic measurement of the deflection produced by an ophthalmic lens in two orthogonal directions. Afterwards, the refractive power maps can be obtained, Experimental results obtained with a progressive addition lens are presented and comparison with measurements obtained with a commercial <b>focimeter</b> are shown showing a good agreement...|$|E
40|$|A 2. 5 × Selsi {{achromatic}} Galilean focusable {{telescope was}} calibrated for refraction at 6 m. In its calibration, minus power trial lens was {{placed at the}} objective of the telescope to simulate vergence of a target at a finite distance, before the back vertex power (BVP) of the telescope at each setting (telescope length) was measured by a <b>focimeter.</b> By using a graphical presentation of the results, the BVP of the telescope at each setting could be determined at different selected target distances. For a target vergence of − 0. 167 D or a distance of 6 m, the common testing distance in clinical practice, this calibrated telescope had a BVP or refraction measuring range of − 7. 27 –+ 7. 52 D. When this telescope was used to measure simulated manifest refractive errors at 6 m, it yielded a mean error of + 0. 13 D with a 95 % confidence limit of agreement of − 0. 38 –+ 0. 64 D. These results indicated that the accuracy and precision of telescopic refraction were comparable to that of retinoscopy. Therefore, the calibrated telescope could be considered as a reliable and inexpensive instrument for determining spherical refractive errors. Telescopic refraction is applicable in refracting economically disadvantaged population in under-served areas where modern equipment and electricity are not available. In addition, it provides an alternative subjective refraction method for low vision population because the magnification of this calibrated telescope has the advantage of allowing low vision patients to be refracted at the common 6 m testing distance in clinical practice.

40|$|Ophthalmic lenses are ideally {{measured}} {{in accordance with}} the center of rotation of the eye. Therefore a measuring device was constructed due to this principle to measure lenses with a <b>focimeter.</b> In this work that measuring device was validated. Lenses of ± 4 dpt in spherical and aspherical design were measured across a field of 9 x 9 measuring points being at 5 ° distance from each other. This corresponds to a field of view of 40 °. The measurement points in x- and y- direction were theoretically calculated to validate the measurement results. Regarding angles of incidence up to 20 ° it was supposed that the main optical aberration depends on a change in the sagittal and tangential sphere powers which is also defined as astigmatism. Therefore the calculation presents the tangential and sagittal oblique sphere powers depending on the different angles of the line of vision. On average the measurement results and the calculated data of the spherical designed lenses coincide quite good (correlation at 0, 98), the systematic deviation of both values on average is 0. 01 dpt and the random error (standard deviation) amounts 0. 03 dpt on average. The minimum deviation is - 0. 06 dpt and the maximum is 0. 09 dpt. Common focimeters have a measuring inaccuracy of up to 0. 06 dpt (Diepes, Blendowske 2002). Therefore the quality of the measured data should be reliable. The aspherical designed lenses were compared to the spherical designed lenses. With increased angles of incidence the astigmatism of the aspherical lenses leads to lower values than the astigmatism of the spherical lense...|$|E

To explain why glasses with progressive addition lenses {{increase the}} risk of falls and whether this can be attributed to false projection, this study aimed to 1) map the prismatic displacement of a progressive lens, and 2) test whether this displacement impaired reaction time and accuracy. Methods: The reaction times of healthy ≥ 75 -year-olds (31 participants) were measured when grasping for a bar and touching a black line. Participants performed each test twice, wearing their progressives and new, matched single vision (distance) glasses in random order. The line and bar targets were positioned according to the maximum and minimum prismatic displacement effect through the progressive lens, mapped using a <b>focimeter.</b> Results: Progressive spectacle lenses have large areas of prismatic displacement in the central visual axis and edges. Reaction time was faster for progressives compared with single vision glasses with a centrally-placed horizontal grab bar (mean difference 101 ms, P= 0. 011 [repeated measures analysis]) and a horizontal black line placed 300 mm below center (mean difference 80 ms, P= 0. 007). There was no difference in accuracy between the two types of glasses. Conclusion: Older people appear to adapt to the false projection of progressives in the central visual axis. This adaptation means that swapping to new glasses or a large change in prescription may lead to a fall. Frequently updating glasses may be more beneficial.

40|$|Automated focimeters {{can be used}} to make quick, precise {{measurements}} of off-axis power and prismatic effects corresponding to an eye rotating behind a spectacle lens. An automated <b>focimeter,</b> the Humphrey Lens Analyzer, was assessed in this regard. The Humphrey Lens Analyzer {{can be used to}} give a valid measure of off-axis power of lenses low power, but not of lenses with moderate to higher power (> 3 D). For 3 D spherical lenses discrepancies of the order of 0. 1 D occur at 30 degree rotation, and 6 D spheres give discrepancies of 0. 5 D at the same rotation. Small discrepancies were found for {{measurements of}} prism. The Humphrey Lens Analyzer was also used in a mode where the lens being tested is rotated about the center of curvature of its back surface. This is the mode often used to assess aberrations and prism of progressive-addition lenses. In this mode, the instrument provides reasonable accuracy in estimating off-axis power corresponding to eye rotation for lenses with low power, but not for lenses with moderate to higher power (> 3 D). However, it provides accurate values of the variation in off-axis surface power for low powered lenses with aspheric front surfaces. There were considerable systematic errors associated with the measurement of prism. A simple raytracing method was developed to predict the results of measurements with the Humphrey Lens Analyzer. Predictions of off-axis power were good when lenses were rotated about a position corresponding to the center-of-rotation of an eye, but were poorer when lenses were rotated about the center of curvature of their back surfaces. Predictions of prismatic efforts were good in both situations. A method by which the Humphrey Lens Analyzer should provide an accurate measurement of off-axis powers corresponding to eye rotation behind a spectacle lens is described, but has not been tested...|$|E
40|$|Although diffractive {{contact lenses}} {{have been well}} {{documented}} in theory, no definitive experimental data have been reported which confirm that the near image is in fact created by diffraction rather than by refraction. We have tested the diffraction hypothesis for one type of diffractive contact lens (the Hydron Echelon bifocal) experimentally by measuring its longitudinal chromatic aberration in isolation and when worn on the eye. The basis of this test is that, according to theory, diffractive lenses should have chromatic aberration which is opposite in sign to that measured for the eye. Objective measurements of chromatic aberration were made with a <b>focimeter</b> when the lens was in a wet cell. Subjective measurements were made with a Badal optometer when the lens was worn on the eye. Four control experiments were conducted to provide baseline measurements of the eye’s chromatic aberration, against which we compared the results obtained for the diffractive contact lens. The data were also compared with conventional measurements of refractive error obtained by standard subjective techniques and by an automated infrared refractor. Our {{results showed that the}} longitudinal chromatic aberration of the diffraction image of the Echelon bifocal lens was about one-half that obtained under the four control conditions: for the naked eye, for the nondiffraction image of the Echelon lens, or for either image of a refractive bifocal contact lens (CIBA Bisoft). These results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that the negative chromatic aberration of a diffractive contact lens should partially cancel the positive chromatic aberration of the human eye. Conversely, {{it would be difficult to}} explain these results on the basis of any other known technique for achromatizing the human eye. We therefore conclude that diffraction is responsible for one of the images formed by the Echelon bifocal lens...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent to}} which the surface {{parameters}} of Progressive Addition Lenses (PALs) affect successful patient tolerance was investigated. Several optico-physical evaluation techniques were employed, including a newly constructed surface reflection device which was shown to be of value for assessing semi-finished PAL blanks. Detailed physical analysis was undertaken using a computer-controlled <b>focimeter</b> and from these data, iso-cylindrical and mean spherical plots were produced for each PAL studied. Base curve power was shown to have little impact upon the distribution of PAL astigmatism. A power increase in reading addition primarily caused a lengthening and narrowing of the lens progression channel. Empirical measurements also indicated a marginal steepening of the progression power gradient with an increase in reading addition power. A sample of the PAL wearing population were studied using patient records and questionnaire analysis (90 % were returned). This subjective analysis revealed the reading portion to be the most troublesome lens zone and showed that patients with high astigmatism (> 2. 00 D) adapt more readily to PALs than those with spherical or low cylindrical (2. 00 D) corrections. The psychophysical features of PALs were then investigated. Both grafting visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) were shown to be reduced with an increase in eccentricity from the central umbilical line. Two sample populations (N= 20) of successful and unsuccessful PAL wearers were assessed for differences in their visual performance and their adaptation to optically induced distortion. The possibility of dispensing errors being the cause of poor patient tolerance amongst the unsuccessful wearer group was investigated and discounted. The contrast sensitivity of the successful group was significantly greater than that of the unsuccessful group. No differences in adaptation to or detection of curvature distortion were evinced between these presbyopic groups...|$|E
