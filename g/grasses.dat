5|$|Primarily a grazer, the oribi prefers fresh <b>grasses</b> and browses occasionally. <b>Grasses</b> can {{constitute}} up to 90% of the diet; preferred varieties include Andropogon, Eulalia, Hyparrhenia, Loudetia, Pennisetum and Themeda species. Mineral licks {{are also}} visited regularly. Oribi {{have been observed}} feeding on flowers and Boletus mushrooms. Groups of oribi congregate in the rainy season, when <b>grasses</b> are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are herbivores that browse during drier {{winter months}} but have also adapted to grazing {{during the rainy}} season when <b>grasses</b> are more common. They require a high-protein diet of {{succulent}} leaves from flowering plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs, trees, shrubs, <b>grasses,</b> seeds and tubers. The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. <b>Grasses</b> the eland eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from Securinega and Strychnos. Large antelope can survive on lower quality food in times of little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.|$|E
5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of <b>grasses.</b> A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short <b>grasses</b> and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile <b>grasses.</b> These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial <b>grasses</b> at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E

5|$|Much of South Dakota, {{with the}} notable {{exception}} of the Black Hills, is dominated by a temperate grasslands biome. Although <b>grasses</b> and crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts.

Native <b>grasses</b> that form sod in parts of the monument include Sandberg's bluegrass and other bluegrass species. Reed canary grass, if mowed, also forms sod along stream banks.|$|E
5|$|The dromedary's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} foliage, dry <b>grasses</b> and desert vegetation mostly thorny plants. A study said the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), <b>grasses</b> (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%).

5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious <b>grasses</b> such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall <b>grasses,</b> such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing <b>grasses.</b> Such <b>grasses</b> would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E

5|$|Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding {{exclusively}} on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous {{and a few}} are predators. The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on <b>grasses,</b> herbs, root tubers, moss, and other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects <b>grasses,</b> roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers.|$|E
5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat <b>grasses</b> and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available.

The addax eat only certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida <b>grasses</b> neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
