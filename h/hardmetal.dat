The fatigue strength increases with the cobalt content. Although distinct fatigue limits, as observed in metals, cannot be observed, the calculated fatigue limit stress at 10 7 cycles is found to be approximately 70 % of the flexural strength, and the stress value exhibits a linear relationship with the flexural stress...|$|R
40|$|Grain {{growth and}} {{abnormal}} grain growth in tungsten carbide cobalt composites (cemented carbides, <b>hardmetals)</b> are usually discussed {{with respect to}} liquid phase sintering (Ostwald ripening). Densification and grain growth during solid state sintering are not as thoroughly studied but do {{play an important role}} in sintering <b>hardmetals</b> and, particularly tungsten carbide ceramics (binderless <b>hardmetals).</b> In this work the influences of sintering temperature, carbon content, additions of grain growth inhibitors, defects and dislocations (microstrain) introduced by milling on the densification and microstructure of WC ceramics were studied including density, micro structural, thermal and X-ray analysis. Microstrain promotes densification and results in lowering the sintering temperature, whereas free carbon seems to hinder densification at low temperatures and to promote it slightly at higher temperatures. Depending on sintering regime, free carbon and microstrain may drastically boost abnormal grain growth. By adding grain growth inhibitors, densification is shifted to higher temperatures. However, the addition prevents abnormal grain growth regardless of C-content and microstrain. Like in <b>hardmetals</b> grain growth inhibitors also inhibit normal grain growth.

Thus, placing data in an historical, chronological order is somewhat difficult. However, it has been possible to establish that as far back as 1929, approximately 6 years after the first patent was granted, Krupp/Osram workers had identified the positive aspects of tungsten carbide grain refinement. By 1939 they had also discovered the beneficial effects of adding a small amount of vanadium and tantalum carbide. This effectively controlled discontinuous grain growth.|$|E
50|$|Sintered {{tungsten}} carbide cutting tools are very abrasion resistant {{and can also}} withstand higher temperatures than standard high-speed steel tools. Carbide cutting surfaces are often used for machining through materials such as carbon steel or stainless steel, and in situations where other tools would wear away, such as high-quantity production runs. Because carbide tools maintain a sharp cutting edge better than other tools, they generally produce a better finish on parts, and their temperature resistance allows faster machining. The material is usually called cemented carbide, <b>hardmetal</b> or tungsten-carbide cobalt: it is a metal matrix composite, where {{tungsten carbide}} particles are the aggregate, and metallic cobalt serves as the matrix. Manufacturers use tungsten carbide as the main material in some high-speed drill bits, as it can resist high temperatures and is extremely hard.|$|E

40|$|Exceptional {{fracture}} toughness levels exhibited by WC-Co cemented carbides (<b>hardmetals)</b> are due mainly to toughening derived from plastic stretching of crack-bridging ductile enclaves. This takes place {{due to the}} development of a multiligament zone at the wake of cracks growing in a stable manner. As a result, <b>hardmetals</b> exhibit crack growth resistance (R-curve) behavior. In this work, the toughening mechanics and mechanisms of these materials are investigated by combining experimental and analytical approaches. Focused Ion Beam technique (FIB) and Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) are implemented to obtain serial sectioning and imaging of crack-microstructure interaction in cracks arrested after stable extension under monotonic loading. The micrographs obtained provide experimental proof of the developing multiligament zone, including failure micromechanisms within individual bridging ligaments. Analytical assessment of the multiligament zone is then conducted on the basis of experimental information attained from FIB/FESEM images, and a model for the description of R-curve behavior of <b>hardmetals</b> is proposed. It was found that, due to the large stresses supported by the highly constrained and strongly bonded bridging ligaments, WC-Co cemented carbides exhibit quite steep but short R-curve behavior. Relevant strength and reliability attributes exhibited by <b>hardmetals</b> may then be rationalized on the basis of such toughening scenario. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

This study presents a three-step multiscale simulation strategy, developed {{for evaluation of}} stress and strain heterogeneity within the <b>hardmetal</b> microstructure when subjected to loadings representative for drilling applications. Two homogenization approaches are used: a full-field finite-element model and a Beta-model (a nonlinear extension of the Kröner’s uniform field model). Both models combine isotropic Drucker–Prager elasto-plastic {{behavior of}} WC grains and isotropic von Mises elasto-plastic behavior of the binder, and include nonlinear hardening. First, a three-dimensional finite-element model of a representative volume element is constructed, which closely resembles the <b>hardmetal</b> microstructure. Full-field simulation with applied proportional loadings allows to determine the <b>hardmetal</b> effective elastic properties for different binder content, and an initial yield surface, resembling in shape a Drucker–Prager surface with a cap. These simulations are also used to calibrate the Beta-model, which, however, cannot predict the correct plastic behavior for the loadings with high hydrostatic component. Second, macroscopic finite-element simulations of normal and oblique frictional impact of an elastic rock by a <b>hardmetal</b> spherical tip are performed using a macroscopic set-up. The calibrated Beta-model is used at every Gauss-point of the <b>hardmetal</b> impactor. Finally, the most critical for the hardmetal’s integrity points are identified on the impactor’s surface, and complex non-proportional stress paths associated with these points are extracted. These stress paths are used as boundary conditions in a full-field simulations employing representative volume elements of <b>hardmetal</b> microstructure.

A series of tests were also performed on freshly polished sintered <b>hardmetals</b> and coatings using both NaOH (pH 11) and neutral SiC aqueous slurries. Contrary to expectations, micro-abrasion under alkaline conditions generally resulted in lower wear rates producing a negative 8 – 18 % abrasion–corrosion synergy, {{with the exception of}} the sintered WC– 11 Ni. Typically, wear scars for the sintered <b>hardmetals</b> were 7 – 8 carbides deep and the wear mechanism was binder depletion and undermining of the carbides.

40|$|Strength and {{reliability}} of WC-Co cemented carbides (<b>hardmetals)</b> are dependent on effective fracture toughness {{as well as on}} nature, size and distribution of processing flaws. Regarding toughness, they exhibit a crack growth resistance (R-curve) behavior, derived from the development of a multiligament bridging zone at the crack wake. Accordingly, successful implementation of fracture mechanics requires consideration of tangency criterion, between applied stress intensity factor and R-curve, in addition to fractographic inspection. It is the aim of this study to evaluate the strength behavior of a series of experimental WC-Co grades on the basis of R-curve failure criteria.
