25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>say</b> will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E

We were violated and it's not right." [...] She said, [...] "I’ve been raped, I’ve been sexually abused as a child and I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t sleep with my boss." [...] She said, [...] "I always thought it was my fault; that I didn’t <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>say</b> the right thing. I know young girls who’ve been raped and didn’t even know it was rape. They think, ‘It must have been because I said ‘no’ the wrong way.’" ...|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was {{defensive}} about Jessica Fletcher, having creative input over the character's costumes, makeup and hair, and rejecting pressure from network executives {{to put her}} in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single female. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>say</b> things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her [...] "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life." [...] Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as [...] "a television landmark" [...] in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like The Golden Girls. Lansbury herself noted that [...] "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience", and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived.|$|E

2500|$|Gavin's father, David Arvizo, visited Neverland {{several times}} in 2000, {{sometimes}} with the whole family {{and at other times}} with only the children. [...] After 2000, the accuser's parents were divorced, and his mother received custody of him, his older sister, and his younger brother. In 2002, Arvizo pleaded no contest to spousal abuse, and in 2003 pleaded no contest to child cruelty. After completing classes in parenting and anger management, David Arvizo applied to have a three-year restraining order against him temporarily lifted to allow him to see his three children. He claimed he wanted to see for himself how his son's health was and hoped to find out whether the boy and Jackson had had sexual contact. He blamed his ex-wife for allowing the boy to sleep {{in the same room with}} Jackson and also claimed that she had been in a mental hospital. As of late 2004, David insisted: [...] "My children are routinely rehearsed by their mother, Janet, to <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>say</b> whatever she wishes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that she {{reasoned}} much upon the subject," [...] said the young man, [...] "and I am sure I did not. We made no plans. Every day we thought only of what we were <b>doing</b> <b>or</b> <b>saying,</b> and not at all what we had <b>done</b> <b>or</b> would <b>do.</b> We were very happy.|$|R
60|$|De Lugeac, {{who lived}} in {{perpetual}} fear of <b>doing</b> <b>or</b> <b>saying</b> something which would inevitably betray his plebeian origin, meekly obeyed M. de Belle-Isle's command.

5000|$|In {{the modern}} world, a [...] "Cloud Cuckoo Lander" [...] {{is defined as}} someone who is seen as [...] "crazy" [...] or [...] "strange" [...] by most average people, often <b>doing</b> <b>or</b> <b>saying</b> things that {{seemingly}} only make sense to themselves, but also exhibit cleverness at times in ways no one else would think of.|$|R
6000|$|At last, more {{disappointed}} than {{he cared}} to own, he said, 'Mrs. Harnham, my darling is so flurried that she doesn't {{know what she}} is <b>doing</b> <b>or</b> <b>saying.</b> I see that after this event a little quietude will be necessary before she gives tongue to that tender philosophy which she used to treat me to in her letters.' ...|$|R

25|$|The primary {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of what other people will think of a person's behavior. This results in a person becoming scared of <b>doing</b> <b>or</b> <b>saying</b> {{what they want to}} out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.|$|R
40|$|In M. Ju.

5000|$|Cowardice is a trait wherein {{fear and}} {{excessive}} self-concern override <b>doing</b> <b>or</b> <b>saying</b> what is right, good, and of help to others or oneself {{in a time}} of need—it is the opposite of courage. As a label, [...] "cowardice" [...] indicates a failure of character {{in the face of a}} challenge. One who succumbs to cowardice is known as a coward, or informally a chicken.|$|R

60|$|The unlucky wretch, who {{scarcely}} {{knew what}} he was <b>doing</b> <b>or</b> <b>saying,</b> selected one of the most outrageous performances of his repertoire, fired off a tipsy howl by way of overture, and away he went.

5000|$|... “Lewis {{is not a}} hero, and he’s not an icon.

50|$|If {{it is not}} {{actually}} clear what the person <b>does,</b> <b>or</b> what he is really saying, the criticism may miss the mark.

It would be unfair and unjust, not to say irrelevant, to criticize people for something they have {{not actually}} done. It would be a false accusation.|$|R
