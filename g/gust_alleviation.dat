Piezoelectric materials have been extensively used for active vibration control of engineering structures.

Numerical studies are conducted to investigate the beneficial effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the quasi “Global Hawk” airfoil using arrays of jets during the gust process. Based on unsteady Navier-Stokes equations, the grid-velocity method is introduced to simulate the gust influence, and dynamic response in vertical gust flow perturbation is investigated for the airfoil as well. An unsteady surface transpiration boundary condition is enforced over a user specified portion of the airfoil's surface to emulate the time dependent velocity boundary conditions. Firstly, after applying this method to simulate typical NACA 0006 airfoil gust response to a step change in the angle of attack, it shows that the indicial responses of the airfoil make good agreement with the exact theoretical values and the calculated values in references. Furthermore, gust response characteristic for the quasi “Global Hawk” airfoil is analyzed. Five kinds of flow control techniques are introduced as steady blowing, steady suction, unsteady blowing, unsteady suction and synthetic jets.

[...] The report {{presents}} the theoretical calculations of <b>gust</b> <b>alleviation</b> factor made for rigid aircraft {{and with one}} degree of freedom only (i. e., vertical motion).

The influence of aspect ratio, the importance of the mass parameter and the gust shape on the values of the <b>gust</b> <b>alleviation</b> factor are shown. The large influence of the gust shape on the value of the alleviation factor makes the gust analysis by simple measurements of maximum aircraft acceleration inadequate, and the full records of the time-history of the aircraft are necessary.
