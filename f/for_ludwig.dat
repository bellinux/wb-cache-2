5|$|Some critics, {{including}} Murray Rothbard, {{have sought}} to show that Keynes had sympathy with Nazism, {{and a number of}} writers described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which can be characterized as antisemitic, others as philosemitic. Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current {{at the time that he}} accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied <b>for</b> <b>Ludwig</b> Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{twenty years of}} its existence, the only staged {{performances}} of Parsifal {{took place in the}} Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances <b>for</b> <b>Ludwig</b> II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had two reasons for wanting to keep Parsifal exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. Firstly, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him – a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Secondly, he thought that the opera would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance.|$|E

25|$|The crown {{passed to}} Ludwig's brother Otto I. However, Otto {{had a long}} history of mental illness and had been placed under medical {{supervision}} a few months earlier.

25|$|Scriabin himself made {{recordings}} of 19 {{of his own}} works, using 20 piano rolls, six for the Welte-Mignon, and 14 <b>for</b> <b>Ludwig</b> Hupfeld of Leipzig. The Welte rolls were recorded during early February 1910, in Moscow, and have been replayed and published on CD. Those recorded for Hupfeld include the piano sonatas Op. 19 and 23. While this indirect evidence of Scriabin's pianism prompted a mixed critical reception, close analysis of the recordings {{within the context of}} the limitations of the particular piano roll technology can shed light on the free style that he favoured for the performance of his own works, characterized by extemporary variations in tempo, rhythm, articulation, dynamics, and sometimes even the notes themselves.|$|E

Others killed included Gregor Strasser, a former Nazi who had angered Hitler by resigning from the party in 1932, and Gustav Ritter von Kahr, the former Bavarian state commissioner who crushed the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. Kahr's fate was especially gruesome. His body was found in a wood outside Munich; he had been hacked to death, apparently with pickaxes. The murdered included at least one accidental victim: Willi Schmid, the music critic of the , a Munich newspaper.

2500|$|Luitpold's {{years as}} regent {{were marked by}} {{tremendous}} artistic and cultural activity in Bavaria where they are known as the Prinzregentenjahre ("The Prince Regent Years"). In 1912, Luitpold died, and his son, Prince-Regent Ludwig, took over as regent. [...] By then, it had long been apparent that Otto {{would never be able}} to reign, and sentiment grew <b>for</b> <b>Ludwig</b> to become king in his own right. [...] On 6 November, a year after the Landtag passed a law allowing him to do so, Ludwig ended the regency, deposed Otto and declared himself King of Bavaria as Ludwig III.|$|E
2500|$|Ludwig was notably {{eccentric}} in {{ways that}} made serving as Bavaria's head of state problematic. [...] He disliked large public functions and avoided formal social events whenever possible, preferring a life of seclusion that he pursued with various creative projects. [...] He last inspected a military parade on 22 August 1875 and last gave a Court banquet on 10 February 1876. His mother had foreseen difficulties <b>for</b> <b>Ludwig</b> when she recorded her concern for her extremely introverted and creative son who spent much time day-dreaming. These idiosyncrasies, combined {{with the fact that}} Ludwig avoided Munich and participating in the government there at all costs, caused considerable tension with the king's government ministers, but did not cost him popularity among the citizens of Bavaria. The king enjoyed traveling in the Bavarian countryside and chatting with farmers and labourers he met along the way. He also delighted in rewarding those who were hospitable to him during his travels with lavish gifts. He is still remembered in Bavaria as [...] "Unser Kini" [...] ("our cherished king" [...] in the Bavarian dialect).|$|E
2500|$|As {{recounted in}} his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers {{came to know}} Lore because they both {{reported}} to rezident Markin: [...] He described him as follows: [...] Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, {{he had been the}} friend of Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. [...] Bukharin, in his New York days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons still lived. [...] He describes the Lore family with some detail: [...] I was introduced to Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless procession of guests. [...] "Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores," [...] a German friend had called them... I have seldom seen a happy family life so explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the Lores' house as a kind of second home. [...] <b>For</b> <b>Ludwig</b> I developed an almost filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. [...] The kindness of all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all {{the other members of the}} family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their detestation of the Communist Party. [...] Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: [...] I did not know that at the very time I was visiting him most frequently, Lore was under surveillance. [...] He was being watched, not by the American authorities, but by the Russian secret police... I discovered that he was afraid to walk alone with me on the street at night and that he was terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six or seven years, and Lore was dead, before I discovered that the old Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, but from another security agency of the Government. [...] I respected Lore all the more for that act. My feeling for him and for all the Lores remained unchanged.|$|E
