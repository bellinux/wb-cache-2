25|$|The {{design of}} the man-carrying machine known as a Rotachute, {{also known as a}} Hafner H.8, evolved from November 1940 and {{throughout}} 1941. In September 1941, the Central Landing Establishment was renamed the Airborne Forces Establishment. The Rotachute Mark I design initially comprised a tubular steel framework with a single seat, rubber-mounted rotor hub, hanging control column, skid undercarriage, and a self-inflating rear fairing made of rubberised fabric with integral tailplane. The two rotor blades, of wooden construction, could achieve flapping and coning characteristics via hinges on the rotor hub. Fixed footrests were provided, plus fittings below the seat to accommodate a soldier's weapon, such as a Bren gun. The control column offered two-axis control, rolling and pitching, with turns made via controlled rolling movement. Air Ministry Specification No. 11/42 was <b>issued</b> <b>retrospectively</b> to describe the outline requirements. The Ministry of Aircraft Production sub-contracted construction of parts to specialist firms including F. Hills and Sons, Airwork General Trading, Dynaflex, Dunlop, and H. Morris & Co. Some full size rotor trials were carried out using a pivoting rig mounted on a Ford flatbed truck, and full-size unmanned airframes were used in ground-based and inflight trials.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fludarabine (FAMP) is {{the most}} active single agent in relapsed and {{refractory}} patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). However, {{it is not clear}} whether it should be used immediatly after failure of chlorambucil (CLB). We addressed such an <b>issue</b> <b>retrospectively</b> analyzing a series of patients in whom FAMP was used as third-line therapy after a sequential use of CLB and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or CHOP-like regimen, respectively. DESIGN AND METHODS: On a retrospective basis, 57 B-CLL patients fulfilling the above mentioned criteria and followed-up in seven different hematologic institutions, were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 57 patients who were evaluated for response, 3 (5. 2 %) achieved a complete response (CR), 30 (52. 6 %) had a partial response (PR) and the remaining 24 (42. 1 %) failed to respond to FAMP. Overall median survival from the start of FAMP therapy was 30 months. Survival by tumor response did not show any difference between responders and non-responders (p = 0. 536). The survival was significantly shorter in the group of patients with progressive disease than in all other patients included in our study (p = 0. 05). Using each patient as his own control (McNemar test) we attempted to evaluate the value of FAMP in inducing a therapeutic response after failure of previous therapies. Among the 37 patients resistant to CLB the response rate was 40. 3 % with FAMP (p = 0. 037) and only 17. 5 % with CHOP (p = 1. 0). Among 35 patients resistant to a CHOP-like regimen, the response rate was 29. 8 % (p = 0. 066) after FAMP therapy. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: From our results, it seems that FAMP works better than a CHOP-like regimen in patients resistant to CLB although results do not translate into a survival advantage for responders...|$|R

Methods In our retrospective study, 53 patients with SCLC were divided into two groups as follow: patients receiving topotecan-containing regimen as maintenance/consolidation (maintenance/consolidation chemotherapy group) and salvage chemotherapy (salvage chemotherapy group). The Log-rank test was used to assess the difference in OS between two groups. Cox regression model was used for the multivariable analysis of independent prognostic factors. Results Twenty-nine patients received topotecan as maintenance/consolidation treatment, whereas 24 patients salvage chemotherapy. The response rates were 51. 7 % and 41. 7 %, respectively. The median survival time were 20 months and 27 months respectively (P= 0. 89). Multivariate Cox regression analyses identified sex and stage as independent prognostic factors. Conclusion Efficacy of first-line therapy was improved by topotecan maintenance/consolidation treatment, which did not result in any significant survival benefits in SCLC...|$|R

40|$|Proteinuria {{has been}} {{reported}} in several papers after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to Sirolimus (SRL), but this complication has not been analyzed in randomized clinical trials using de novo SRL. It is not known whether de novo use of SRL is a risk factor for proteinuria. We analyzed a series of patients included in a big multicenter randomized trial (RMR trial) corresponding to all patients in Spain and Portugal with respect to this <b>issue.</b> We <b>retrospectively</b> evaluated 24 -hour proteinuria in all the patients during the study period (5 years postransplant) for comparison between treatment arms group A, continuous cyclosporine (CyA) + SRL and group B SRL with CyA elimination at 3 months postransplant. The elimination of CyA after the third month was not followed by significant changes in proteinuria. Nevertheless, during the last year of follow-up (between 48 and 60 months postransplant) an impressive increase in proteinuria was observed in group A. This surprising finding seemed to be a consequence of a protocol amendment that recommended CyA elimination in patients of group A, due to poorer results in the intermediate analysis of the trial. This fact suggests that the hemodynamic changes induced by elimination of the vasoconstrictor CyA might be responsible for the proteinuria but only in the long term probably when significant pathological lesions are already present. This finding argues for earlier conversion...|$|R
