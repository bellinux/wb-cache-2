30|$|Load spectra {{research}} for bogie frame requires establishing the load-stress relationship on working condition, {{which has been}} omitted by the researchers. With the load-stress of the bogie frame of an intercity Electric Multiple Unit (Hereinafter referred to as EMU) as the research object, an optimization model of the load-stress transfer relationship is established. The load-stress coefficient for EMU bogie frame was calibrated in the laboratory bench and online test was arranged on Dazhou-Chengdu line. Comparison of nonlinear and linear neural networks proves that the linear transitive relation between the load and stress of the bogie frame in the operating process is highly suitable. An optimization model of the load-stress transfer coefficient is obtained. The data calculated with the modified coefficient are closer to the dynamic stress results in the actual operating process than the data calculated with the calibration coefficient. The coefficient of the modified transitive relation is unaffected by operating area, <b>empty</b> <b>load,</b> heavy load, or other conditions in the operating process of the intercity EMU. The real loads in actual situations are obtained. The model of online load-stress relationship that is highly suitable for line stress calculation is finally established. The research is helpful for further damage calculation and inferring the time history signal of the load in load spectra research.|$|E
40|$|Heavy-vehicle driving {{involves}} a challenging work environment {{and a high}} crash rate. We investigated the associations of sleepiness, sleep disorders, and work environment (including truck characteristics) with the risk of crashing between 2008 and 2011 in the Australian states of New South Wales and Western Australia. We conducted a case-control study of 530 heavy-vehicle drivers who had recently crashed and 517 heavy-vehicle drivers who had not. Drivers' crash histories, truck details, driving schedules, payment rates, sleep patterns, and measures of health were collected. Subjects wore a nasal flow monitor for 1 night to assess for obstructive sleep apnea. Driving schedules that included the period between midnight and 5 : 59 am were associated with increased likelihood of crashing (odds ratio = 3. 42, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 04, 5. 74), as were having an <b>empty</b> <b>load</b> (odds ratio = 2. 61, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 72, 3. 97) and being a less experienced driver (odds ratio = 3. 25, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 37, 4. 46). Not taking regular breaks {{and the lack of}} vehicle safety devices were also associated with increased crash risk. Despite the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea, it was not associated with the risk of a heavy-vehicle nonfatal, nonsevere crash. Scheduling of driving to avoid midnight-to-dawn driving and the use of more frequent rest breaks are likely {{to reduce the risk of}} heavy-vehicle nonfatal, nonsevere crashes by 2 - 3 times. 8 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of load {{carrying}} methods, stair slopes and walking speeds on heart rate and walking postures. Nine participants climbed up and down stairs with various stair slopes (24 °, 30 ° and 36 °), walking speeds (72, 96, and 132 steps per minute), and using different <b>load</b> carrying methods (<b>empty</b> <b>loads,</b> backpack, and hand-held). The effects of these factors on heart rate, Borg-RPE and flexion angles of knee joints, hip joints and trunk angles were investigated. This study demonstrated that increased stair slopes and walking speed were associated with increased heart rate and RPE. The heart rate for <b>empty</b> <b>loads</b> subjects was lowest, followed by backpack load and hand-held load. Climbing stairs with larger inclination was associated with smaller knee joint flexion angle and larger trunk and hip joint flexion angle. In conclusion, it is easier for subjects to carry a load of the same weight up stairs by backpack than by hand. However, the stair slope should be less than 30 °. Thus, the standard fixed stair slope (30 ° of stair slope) on recommended for riser height and tread depth are 160 mm (6. 5 inches) and tread depth 280 mm (11 inches) ...|$|R

The results can be used for both practical application and inclusion into the design and analysis recommendations where applicable...|$|R
