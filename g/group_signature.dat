The series was won by street-dancer George Sampson, with dual dance <b>group</b> <b>Signature</b> coming in second, and singer Andrew Johnston placing third.|$|E
500|$|Johnston {{was entered}} as a {{competitor}} {{in the second}} series of Britain's Got Talent by his mother. He passed the first public audition, singing [...] "Pie Jesu" [...] from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem. Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that [...] "it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang [...] "Tears in Heaven" [...] by Eric Clapton; judge Holden {{told him he had}} [...] "a gift from God in [...] voice". At the final on 30 May, he again sang [...] "Pie Jesu". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance <b>group</b> <b>Signature.</b> Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he [...] "was upset. But when you see the talent that was there, it was an honour just to be in the final". The day after the final, Cowell's publicist Max Clifford said that it was [...] "quite possible" [...] that Cowell would be offering record contracts to some of the finalists, including Johnston. Johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{define a}} general model for {{consecutive}} delegations of signing rights {{with the following}} properties: The delegatee actually signing and all intermediate delegators remain anonymous. As for <b>group</b> <b>signatures,</b> in case of misuse, a special authority can open signatures to reveal the chain of delegations and the signer’s identity. The scheme satisfies a strong notion of non-frameability generalizing the one for dynamic <b>group</b> <b>signatures.</b> We give formal definitions of security and show them to be satisfiable by constructing an instantiation proven secure under general assumptions in the standard model.

50|$|A <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> {{scheme is}} a method for {{allowing}} {{a member of a}} group to anonymously sign a message on behalf of the group. The concept was first introduced by David Chaum and Eugene van Heyst in 1991. For example, a <b>group</b> <b>signature</b> scheme could be used by an employee of a large company where it is sufficient for a verifier to know a message was signed by an employee, but not which particular employee signed it. Another application is for keycard access to restricted areas where it is inappropriate to track individual employee's movements, but necessary to secure areas to only employees in the group.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Group</b> <b>signatures</b> are {{a central}} {{cryptographic}} primitive where users can anonymously and accountably sign messages {{in the name}} of a group they belong to. Several efficient constructions with security proofs in the standard model (i. e., without the random oracle idealization) appeared in the recent years. However, like standard PKIs, <b>group</b> <b>signatures</b> need an efficient revocation system to be practical. Despite years of research, membership revocation remains a non-trivial problem: many existing solutions do not scale well due to either high overhead or constraining operational requirements (like the need for all users to update their keys after each revocation). Only recently, Libert, Peters and Yung (Eurocrypt’ 12) suggested a new scalable revocation method, based on the Naor-Naor-Lotspiech (NNL) broadcast encryption framework, that interacts nicely with techniques for building <b>group</b> <b>signatures</b> in the standard model. While promising, their mechanism introduces important storage requirements at group members. Namely, membership certificates, which used to have constant size in existing standard model constructions, now have polylog size in the maximal cardinality of the group (NNL, after all, is a tree-based technique and such dependency is naturally expected). In this paper we show how to obtain private keys of constant size. To this end, we introduce a new technique to leverage the NNL subset cover framework in the context of <b>group</b> <b>signatures</b> but, perhaps surprisingly, without logarithmic relationship between the size of private keys and the group cardinality. Namely, we provide a way for users to efficiently prove their membership of one of the generic subsets in the NNL subset cover framework. This technique makes our revocable <b>group</b> <b>signatures</b> competitive with ordinary <b>group</b> <b>signatures</b> (i. e., without revocation) in the standard model. Moreover, unrevoked members (as in PKIs) still do not need to update their keys at each revocation...|$|R
