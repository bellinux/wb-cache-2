Persisters, on the other hand, exhibit a heritable phenotype and can be easily isolated from a normally dividing population that allows their selective growth. Rather than a single subset, they comprise many distinct subgroups each exhibiting different growth rates, colony sizes, antibiotic tolerance and protein expression levels. Clearly, {{they are one of}} the sources of bacterial heterogeneity and noise in protein expression.

The technique {{is based on}} in vivo recombination between genomic DNA and a linearized vector containing homologous sequences, or hooks, to the gene of interest. The recombination occurs during transformation of yeast spheroplasts that results in the generation of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) containing the gene of interest. To further enhance and refine the TAR cloning technology, we determined the minimal size of a specific hook required for <b>gene</b> <b>isolation</b> utilizing the Tg.

When vectors with a specific hook that was ≥ 60 bp were utilized, ∼ 2 % of transformants contained circular YACs with the Tg. AC transgene sequences. Efficiency of cloning dramatically decreased when the TAR vector contained a hook of 40 bp or less. Thus, the minimal length of a unique sequence required for <b>gene</b> <b>isolation</b> by TAR is ∼ 60 bp.

For rapid improvement of genetic yield potential in rice, we need to evaluate and use the previously identified yield-enhancing genes in local favorite cultivar backgrounds. The allele-specific markers for yield-enhancing genes shown in this study will be very helpful for MAS of yield-enhancing traits/genes. Through whole-genome sequencing, we identified some new haplotypes for some yield-enhancing genes such as the SCM 2 -ST 6 allele and SPIKE-ST 6 allele. For the same gene, the alleles superior to the previously identified alleles can be found.

In contrast, we were unable to identify any viruses from hosts outside of mammals and birds which grouped with the other five currently recognized retroviral genera: the lentiviruses, human T-cell leukemia-related viruses, avian leukemia virus-related retroviruses, type D retroviruses, and mammalian type B retroviruses. There was also some indication that viruses isolated from individual vertebrate classes tended to cluster together in phylogenetic reconstructions.
