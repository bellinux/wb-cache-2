5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern <b>images</b> <b>are</b> made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium.
