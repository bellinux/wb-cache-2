5000|$|In August 1951, Kizirian {{was then}} given the task to {{neutralize}} enemy {{forces in the}} vicinity of Hill 440 just south of Seoul. The entire battalion attacked and each of the companies were assigned to take a part of the hill. Kizirian's company took the center of the hill while the other companies were forced to withdraw. By nightfall, Kizirian's company was 5000 yards ahead of the Allied position of the Main Line of Resistance. Kizirian and his unit successfully took the vacated positions of the enemy. On August 27, a Chinese regiment numbering in the thousand's wanted to take back the position and attacked Kizirian's unit of 150 soldiers. During the assault, Kizirian killed a Chinese soldier with his carbine who nearly threw a grenade at him. However, Kizirian was shot in his abdomen and five of his soldiers were killed. Kizirian was carried to a nearby field where he was transferred onto a Jeep and taken to a nearby medical facility. Kizirian, who was reported injured on September 24, was transferred to a field hospital, then to a hospital in Pusan and ultimately airlifted to a convalescent hospital in Japan. It was barely daylight and I walked over to where they had him and I said, [...] "Okay, I'll take him to the rear" [...] and pulled out my '45. [...] "Let me take him. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> search him?" [...] And, about that time this guy pulled a grenade out, threw it and killed a couple of my people, so I shot him to death. As soon as he did it, I was shooting, but it was too late. I was furious, of course, about that. —John Kizirian After making a recovery, Kizirian was sent back to Pusan and rejoined the front. He was made platoon commander of B Company. The B Company participated in the battle of Hill 1243 where it was up against mortar fire from enemy positions. Kizirian was shot in the back while saving a soldier who was injured and laid out in the open. Kizirian was taken to a medical aid station and upon hearing that the platoon was under attack, Kizirian returned to the front. He arrived {{at a time when the}} troops captured a Korean prisoner who was part of the attack. When the prisoner threw a grenade and killed a couple of soldiers, Kizirian killed him. Kizirian became the commander of the company after the initial commander committed suicide. After he became a commander for a month, a new commander reinstated, and Kizirian left the front because it was his due-time. Upon leaving, he was awarded the Army Commendation Medal.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} {{to answer the question}} “Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> always want to twist everything? ” We review the various ways in which twists, twisted actions and twisted crossed products arise, and then discuss some cohomological obstructions to the existence and triviality of twisted actions. Our review begins with the classical problems of classifying group extensions and irreducible unitary representations, and explains how cocycles and twisted actions arise. We then describe the various kinds of twisted actions occurring in the operator-algebra literature. For completeness, we have included brief descriptions of how cocycles arise in quantum mechanics and deformation theory. In § 2, we discuss three cohomological obstructions. These lie in, respectively, a sec-ond cohomology group, a relative cohomology group introduced by Huebschmann and Ratcliffe, and a third cohomology group. All these cohomology groups have descriptions in terms of extensions, and we use these descriptions wherever possible. The groups are related by an eight-term exact sequence which extends the usual five-term restriction-inflation sequence; our main point is that this exact sequence is compatible with our us...|$|R
