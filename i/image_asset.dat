These factors have contributed to use different criteria to recognize the structure of financial statements and the option for different bases of valuation. They also affect the scope and disclosures in the financial statements. Committee IASC is employed in mitigating these differences and seeks to harmonize regulations, standards and procedures for preparing and presenting financial statements. Harmonization requires that financial statements provide useful information for making economic decisions. The elements in balance sheets are recognized according to four basic criteria: definition, measurable character, relevance, reliability. The valuation of the elements in balance sheets {{is one of the most}} difficult accounting issues. The elements presented in financial statements are valued using the rules of „historical cost” or basic accounting procedures.
