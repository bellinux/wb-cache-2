5|$|During {{the penalty}} {{phase of the}} trial, Bundy took {{advantage}} of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, {{in the presence of}} a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near Bundy, had testified on <b>his</b> <b>behalf</b> during both trials, and was again testifying on <b>his</b> <b>behalf</b> as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to the court that they were legally married.|$|E

5|$|By February 1326, it {{was clear}} that Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power.

5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on <b>his</b> <b>behalf,</b> also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex.

Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beauregard was {{reluctant}} to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled him to do so, which he did before the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He {{was one of many}} Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by President Andrew Johnson on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief and the bill on <b>his</b> <b>behalf</b> was signed by President Grant on July 24, 1876.|$|E

In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

5|$|Aqil's {{closeness}} {{with the}} Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His {{relations with the}} kaimakam of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam on <b>his</b> <b>behalf.</b> Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} {{thirteen}} Jervis ran away and joined the navy at Woolwich, London. After a short time he returned home as he had heard his family were very upset at his disappearance.

50|$|Sensing {{imminent}} death, Louis XIII {{decided to}} put his affairs in order {{in the spring of}} 1643, when Louis XIV was four years old.

He did, however, make the concession of appointing her head of the council.|$|R
