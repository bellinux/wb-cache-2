5|$|In any case, {{there was}} not enough artillery, but new pieces could not be brought in. This was because it was very {{difficult}} to move them over land, and {{there was not}} enough <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> bring them over the sea.|$|E
5|$|Natural ice {{was put to}} many uses. The ice trade enabled its {{widespread}} use in medicine in attempts to treat diseases and to alleviate their symptoms, as well as making tropical hospitals more bearable. In Calcutta, for example, part of each ice shipment was specially reserved in the city's ice house {{for the use of}} the local doctors. By the middle of the 19th century, the British Royal Navy was using imported <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> cool the interiors of its ships' gun turrets. In 1864, and after several attempts, salmon eggs were finally shipped successfully from Britain to Australia, using natural <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> keep them chilled on route, enabling the creation of the Tasmanian salmon fishery industry.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of Ice's good looks and dance moves, Public Enemy tried to {{convince}} their producer, Hank Shocklee, to sign <b>Ice</b> <b>to</b> Def Jam, but Ice later {{signed a contract with}} SBK Records in 1990. SBK remixed and re-recorded Hooked under the title To the Extreme. The reissue contained new artwork and music. According to Ice, SBK paid him to adopt a more commercial, conventional appearance. This led <b>Ice</b> <b>to</b> later regret his business agreements with SBK.|$|E

5|$|During the 1999–2000 season, on February 15, 2000, Brodeur was {{credited}} with his second career goal, as Brodeur was the last Devils player on the <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> touch the puck before Daymond Langkow of the Flyers accidentally put the puck into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils. Brodeur had previously stopped an attempted Flyers shot.|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E

Volcanic debris mixed with <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> form massive lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain, killing nearly 23,000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages.|$|E
5|$|Since 2004, new glaciers {{have formed}} on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> Crater Glacier below. In addition, {{there are two}} rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier and one north of the western lobe. Two of these rock glaciers have merged with the Crater Glacier, with one on the west and one on the east. The other rock glacier on the eastern slopes of the crater wall is very close to {{touching}} the glacier.|$|E
5|$|Storhamar {{traditionally}} played {{ice hockey}} on natural ice. In 1977, {{the club was}} promoted to the First Division, where the regulations required that the team play on artificial <b>ice.</b> <b>To</b> avoid having to play all their games on the road, the municipality agreed to finance an outdoor artificial rink at Storhamar. With the increased attendance and interest for hockey following the town's team playing in the top league, Storhamar started planning an indoor venue.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian trade peaked {{during the}} 1890s, {{with a million}} tons (900 million kg) of ice was being {{exported}} from Norway by 1900; the major Leftwich company in Britain, importing much of this, kept a thousand tons (900,000kg) of ice in store at all times to meet demand. Austria entered the European ice market behind Norway, with the Vienna Ice Company exporting natural <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> Germany {{by the end of}} the century.|$|E
5|$|The area drained by Pine Island Glacier {{comprises}} about 10% of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Satellite measurements {{have shown}} that the Pine Island Glacier Basin has a greater net contribution of <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> the sea than any other ice drainage basin in the world and this has increased due to recent acceleration of the ice stream.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade revolutionised the {{way that}} food was {{preserved}} and transported. Before the 19th century, preservation had depended upon techniques such as curing or smoking, but large supplies of natural ice allowed foods to be refrigerated or frozen instead. Although using <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> chill foods was a relatively simple process, it required considerable experimentation to produce efficient and reliable methods for controlling the flow of warm and cold air in different containers and transport systems. In {{the early stages of}} the ice trade there was also a tension between preserving the limited supply of ice, by limiting the flow of air over it, and preserving the food, which depended on circulating more air over the <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> create colder temperatures.|$|E

5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the absence}} {{of support from the}} Royal Navy, the New England {{expedition}} set out in March 1745 for Louisbourg. More than 4,000 men on more than 90 transports (mainly fishing boats and coastal traders), escorted by six colonial guard ships, descended on Canso, where the expedition waited for the <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> clear from Gabarus Bay, the site just south of Louisbourg that had been chosen for the troop landing. Starting on 22 April the expedition was joined by four Royal Navy warships under the command of Commodore Warren, who received orders (issued in January, but not received until after his previous refusal) to assist the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E

5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes {{to solve the}} problem of how to take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer from Maryland, invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice embedded in the top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, taking advantage of the growing supplies of <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or <b>ice</b> <b>to</b> give birth.|$|E
