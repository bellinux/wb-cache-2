5|$|A mill {{was built}} on Welhay stream but this was {{replaced}} by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead {{for access to the}} channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer sea wall was built allowing the local marshes to be drained and increased the land available for farming. The dominant architecture <b>is</b> <b>early</b> Victorian, with some buildings maintaining their original features. The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction of the dock, pier and the rail link to Bristol. The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830, to provide accommodation and catering for travellers on the steamers from Bristol, Wales and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat <b>is</b> <b>early</b> successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E
5|$|Southern Vectis bus route 6 {{links the}} village with {{the towns of}} Newport and Ventnor, {{including}} intermediate villages. The last bus from Newport <b>is</b> <b>early</b> at 18:22 providing no evening service for the village. The seasonal 'Island Coaster' also runs through the village during the summer. Wightbus and Southern Vectis take students to school, which has caused some controversy over two bus companies taking {{a small number of}} students to school.|$|E

Two assembly segments - Merta and Degana <b>were</b> <b>earlier</b> in erstwhile Nagaur constituency. Beawar and Jaitaran assembly segments <b>were</b> <b>earlier</b> in erstwhile Ajmer and Pali constituencies respectively.|$|R

5|$|Stela 5 is {{reasonably}} well preserved and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest {{of these two}} dates is AD126. The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar. This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next. A small seated figure is carved onto each of the sides of this stela along with a badly eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style <b>is</b> <b>early</b> Maya and has affinities with sculptures at Izapa.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage <b>is</b> <b>early</b> in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E
5|$|The present {{structure}} has many traces of great antiquity, being large and {{built in the}} form of a cross, with a door of early Gothic architecture. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain pointed arch prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is thirteenth century, in the tower and the arches supporting it. The external appearance of the church is large and ancient, being erected of rubble stone, with ashlar quoins and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that it <b>is</b> <b>early</b> Gothic, perhaps from early thirteenth century. Internally the church is {{in the form of}} an aisleless cruciform church with substantial transepts. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the thirteenth century after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.|$|E

25|$|The Church of St Philip and St James at Neston {{was opened}} in 1866. Its {{architecture}} <b>is</b> <b>early</b> English, in local stone to designs of J.H. Hakewill. Internal re-ordering {{was completed in}} 1985.|$|E
25|$|The font, of Purbeck Marble, <b>is</b> <b>early</b> medieval but its carvings {{are nearly}} obliterated. The organ was {{installed}} in 1871 with subsequent modernisations. The exterior of the building is of local sandstone, flint and rubble, with evidence of endless repair and reconstruction.|$|E

25|$|The north stub of {{the earlier}} late 13th-century {{transept}} contains a 15th-century Perpendicular window, with four lights divided by slender mullions ending in flat curved arches with trefoils, the centre two lights extending above to a pointed arch. The line of the previous 13th-century north transept is defined by a pointed relief moulding above. The south stub transept window <b>is</b> <b>Early</b> English, incorporating four lancet lights with three quatrefoil rosettes above.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} human {{attempts at}} plant domestication {{occurred in the}} Middle East. There <b>is</b> <b>early</b> evidence for conscious cultivation and trait selection of plants by pre-Neolithic groups in Syria: grains of rye with domestic traits have been recovered from Epi-Palaeolithic (c. 11,050 BCE) contexts at Abu Hureyra in Syria, but {{this appears to be}} a localised phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye, rather than a definitive step towards domestication.|$|E
50|$|Ascaric or Ascarich (Ascaricus) <b>was</b> an <b>early</b> Frankish war leader, who, {{along with}} his co-leader, Merogais, <b>are</b> the <b>earliest</b> known leaders {{explicitly}} called Frankish, although {{the name of the}} Franks <b>is</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|R
50|$|On Saturdays {{the first}} {{southbound}} train leaves at about 6:00 am {{and the first}} northbound train leaves at about 7:00 am. The last northbound train leaves at 12:01 <b>am</b> (<b>early</b> Sunday morning) and the last southbound train leaves at 2:03 <b>am</b> (<b>early</b> Sunday morning). However, the last southbound train only goes {{as far as the}} next station (the Salt Lake Central Station); the last train to the Provo Station leaves at 12:11 <b>am</b> (<b>early</b> Sunday morning). There are also northbound trains arriving, but terminating, at the station as late as about 2:30 <b>am</b> (<b>early</b> Sunday morning). There is no service to Pleasant View on Saturdays.|$|R

25|$|Scientists {{learned about}} {{exposure}} to high level radiation {{from studies of}} the effects of bombing populations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, it is difficult to trace the relationship of low level radiation exposure to resulting cancers and mutations. This is because the latency period between exposure and effect can be 25years or more for cancer and a generation or more for genetic damage. Since nuclear generating plants have a brief history, it <b>is</b> <b>early</b> to judge the effects.|$|E
25|$|One {{traditional}} {{account of}} killing is the Persecution in Lyon in which Christians were purportedly mass-slaughtered by being thrown to wild beasts under the decree of Roman officials for reportedly refusing to renounce their faith according to St. Irenaeus. The sole source {{for this event}} <b>is</b> <b>early</b> Christian historian Eusebius of Caesarea's Church History, an account written in Egypt in the 4th century. Tertullian's Apologeticus of 197 was ostensibly written in defense of persecuted Christians and was addressed to Roman governors.|$|E
25|$|Kabbalah Centre {{teaches the}} Kabbalistic concept of Klippot. The {{idea is that}} {{everyone}} has a direct and clear connection to the upper metaphysical-spiritual world of the Light (Ein Sof, unbounded God), but that this channel is blocked by Klippot, restricting the spiritual energy from entering the physical body. It is through study and practice of Kabbalah teachings and Jewish law (which the Kabbalah Centre says <b>is</b> <b>early</b> Rabbinistic construction to aid in practicing Kabbalah without revealing its secrets) that one removes Klippot, and it is by violence and negative behavior that one adds Klippot.|$|E
50|$|The {{constituency}} in 2008 {{was formed}} after merging the assembly segments of Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, Madurantakam (SC), Uthiramerur and Kancheepuram, which <b>were</b> <b>earlier</b> {{part of the}} now defunct Chengalpattu Lok Sabha constituency, and Alandur, which <b>was</b> <b>earlier</b> part of Chennai South Lok Sabha constituency.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{cross wall}} subdividing each floor. These walls appear to <b>be</b> <b>early</b> insertions. Probably there <b>were</b> <b>earlier,</b> less permanent, cross partitions.

25|$|Risk {{factors for}} RLS include low iron levels, kidney failure, Parkinson's disease, {{diabetes}} mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pregnancy. A number of medications may also trigger the disorder including antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, and calcium channel blockers. There {{are two main}} types. One <b>is</b> <b>early</b> onset RLS which starts before age 45, runs in families and worsens over time. The other is late onset RLS which begins after age 45, starts suddenly, and does not worsen. Diagnosis is generally based on a person's symptoms after ruling out other potential causes.|$|E
25|$|The major {{side effect}} of an {{oophorectomy}} in younger women <b>is</b> <b>early</b> menopause, which can cause osteoporosis. After surgery, hormone replacement therapy can be considered, especially in younger women. This therapy can consist {{of a combination of}} estrogen and progesterone, or estrogen alone. Estrogen alone is safe after hysterectomy; when the uterus is still present, unopposed estrogen dramatically raises the risk of endometrial cancer. Estrogen therapy after surgery does not change survival rates. People having ovarian cancer surgery are typically hospitalized afterwards for 3–4 days and spend around a month recovering at home. Surgery outcomes are best at hospitals that do a large number of ovarian cancer surgeries.|$|E
25|$|The Adena {{provided}} the greatest cultural {{influence in the}} state. For practical purposes, the Adena <b>is</b> <b>Early</b> Woodland period according to West Virginia University's Dr. Edward V. McMichael (1968:16), also among the 1963 Geological Survey. Middle and Late Woodland people include: Middle Woodland Watson pottery people, Late Woodland Wood Phase, Late Hopewell at Romney, Montaine (late Woodland AD 500–1000), Wilhelm culture (Late Middle Woodland, c. AD 1~500), Armstrong (Late Middle Woodland, c. AD 1~500), Buck Garden (Late Woodland AD 500–1200), Childers Phase (Late Middle Woodland c. 400 AD) followed by Parkline phase (Late Woodland AD 750~1000). Adena villages {{can be characterized as}} rather large compared to Late Prehistoric tribes.|$|E
