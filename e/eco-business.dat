Despite the importance, modest is known about the potential of SCI in facilitating GSCM and its dynamic linkages to sustainable performance, particularly in the context of manufacturing companies in Malaysia is scarce. Thus, this paper attempts to bridge the gaps by investigating the potential of SCI in generating sustainable performance of green supply chain management by proposing the theoretical framework and hypotheses development for the study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Survival in a {{continuously}} changing market {{depends on}} its development and not on diversification of the present supply. In this context, to be entrepreneurial is equivalent with having the capacity to create new products that will motivate consumers. The entrepreneur is defined as “somebody who starts his own business of small dimensions. ” It {{is a mistake to}} assume that the entrepreneurial system and innovation are natural and spontaneous phenomena. The good aspect is that the entrepreneurial system can be learnt. This means that the firm has to be receptive to innovation and perceive the change as an opportunity not as a threat. It is believed that the entrepreneurial system is very risky. The <b>eco-businesses</b> are poorly represented in Romania, in comparison with the average of EU. The increase of weight of eco-industries is among the development objectives in medium and long run. Romania has to implement a plan of 28 actions for promotion of eco-technologies and increase their competitiveness. There continue to exist obstacles in the manner of the expansion of eco- market such as the still low-scale production, a reduced range of products, higher prices (up to 150 % more) than for standard products, low level of consumer information and low promotion level. In spite of all these aspects it is a great potential in the medium and long term...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: The South-east Europe (SEE) {{region is}} facing a new market economy era where {{establishing}} new businesses is more than needed in all sectors. The forest sector, faced with new market emerging opportunities, {{is affected by the}} constant increase of a number of forest related enterprises. This paper describes the challenges and opportunities related to the use of marketing tools for improving business of the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) dealing with non-wood forest products (NWFPs) in SEE region. The research on this subject in the SEE region is scarce despite the rich biodiversity as a solid base for establishing <b>eco-businesses.</b> Materials and Methods: The method used in this paper is quantitative, based on survey data collected from enterprises in the NWFPs sector followed by statistical data analyses using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The survey was conducted during 2011 and 2012 in four SEE countries: Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Macedonia. Results: The results showed that developed channels of distribution, branding and advertising of NWFPs are recognized in all countries as important and very important, but these marketing tools are used only few times per year. The majority of respondents pointed out advertising as the most frequently used and as the most successful tool. Interviewees’ future investments are to be focused on improving equipment for drying, packing, refrigerating and transport. Several entrepreneurs from Macedonia pointed out that they would invest in increasing the number of buying points and herb plantations while almost all Croatian entrepreneurs will invest in advertising, branding and promotion. Majority of respondents from Serbia are also of the opinion that financial resources should be invested in new equipment. The reasons for these investments can be summarized in reducing costs and increasing profit or in faster turnover. Conclusions: The use of marketing tools is important because they have positive influence on sale, improve communication and cooperation between enterprises and with consumers, build reliable buyers and increase the number of consumers, which leads to higher profit and creates new opportunities for NWFPs based enterprises. Intensive use of promotion tools should be seen as an opportunity for these enterprises in the SEE region to overcome current challenges and improve their business. The main reason for this situation, as it was stated in the interviews, is {{the fact that most of}} the enterprises do not have a final product. Another reason is lack of funds, because of which the question: “If you have financial sources where you should invest?” was answered with promotion, branding and other marketing tools...|$|R

40|$|The eco-businesses {{are poorly}} {{represented}} in Romania, {{in comparison with}} the average of EU. The increase of weight of eco-industries is among the development objectives in medium and long run. Romania has to implement a plan of 28 actions for promotion of eco-technologies and increase their competitiveness. Economic changes had main impact on ecological protection and on the general public as an entire. Almost all eco-food Romanian products are for export because inside the country it is only a small niche of consumers. The customers are that who used to consume this type of products on European markets, others see it as a trend and a third category is occasional consumers who introduce in their diet about 5 - 10 percent organic products There continue to exist obstacles in the manner of the expansion of this market such as the still low-scale production, a reduced range of products, higher prices (up to 150 % more) than for standard products, low level of consumer information and low promotion level. In spite of all these aspects it is a great potential in the medium and long term. An exploratory research was carried out in order to evaluate the state of Romanian ecological producers. The survey had 18 questions but here will be presented only some of the results. The aim of this exploratory research is to offer information for the set-up of a new <b>eco-business.</b> The Romanian eco-businesses understood the necessity of development and implementation of the latest patterns in order to assure a sustainable development of the business.

40|$|As {{consumers}} {{have become increasingly}} concerned about food safety and food provenance farm animal welfare (FAW) {{has emerged as a}} growing concern. More recently, the business case for FAW has grown considerably on the back of these developments and many global food companies now address FAW in their corporate responsibility strategies. Building on recent work on the big brand takeover of sustainability, this paper examines the alignment of responsible business with the big brand takeover of FAW through <b>eco-business</b> practice (Dauvergne and Lister 2013). 	Despite a growing corporate engagement with FAW in recent years, evidence from the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW) suggests that many global food companies have little or no understanding of why they engage with FAW. While some companies are starting to make commitments that appear to go beyond the usual public relations “greenwashing”, I argue that this new corporate embrace of FAW is part of a big brand takeover aligned with responsible business practice {{at the expense of the}} environmental sustainability concerns generated by industrial animal agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Rural {{agro-industry}} gives {{added value}} to peasant’s agricultural production. In Peru, many small farmers from highland areas are linked {{in this activity}} {{as a means of}} subsistence. These farmers, since ancient times, have performed all their field activities in balance with nature. In fact, the rural agribusiness has mostly been developed under agroecological principles. The main objective of this thesis the description of the characteristics of rural agribusiness and how this activity based on agroecology contributes to the conservation of the environment in the highland areas of Peru. The situation of rural agribusiness is reviewed from the global and local context of organic agriculture. It has also been taken the region of Lurin River Basin as a case study, where environmental, productive, marketing and institutional characteristics are described. Moreover, a study of the current and future situation using the scenario methods, and an analysis of sustainability is carried out for an organic farmers’ organization called “Association of Ecological Producers of the Lurin River Basin ‘Monticielo’”. Results of this thesis indicate that rural agribusiness in highland areas of Peru, specifically in the Lurin River Basin, is crucial sector it contributes to food security and generating income for rural families, conserve biodiversity and farmers` traditional knowledge has been used to address emerging issues of climate change. However, the main problems facing small producers are productivity, technology, marketing and organization. In the scenario analysis it has been identified that "Organic-point of sale" scenario can become a marketing point of <b>eco-business</b> efficiently, which could increase sales and {{improve the quality of life}} for farmers and for the environmental conservation. In conclusion, being closely linked to ecological farming practices, rural agribusiness is an important tool that contributes to the welfare of rural small farmers and environmental conservation...|$|E
40|$|Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) is {{becoming}} an increasing challenge for municipal authorities due to global increases in waste quantities. Other challenges include; changes in waste composition and increasing concern for the environment. As cities continue to grow, so too will the waste. The management of waste therefore becomes critical to municipal planning. Health and sanitation, aesthetics, minimization of pollution and the monitoring of critical resources {{are just some of}} the reasons municipalities must manage and control solid waste. Using the Toronto Pearson Eco Business Zone as a case study, this thesis explores how waste (by-product) exchanges might inform municipal planning and how waste exchanges could advise planners and academics in managing growing amounts of municipal waste. The Toronto Pearson Eco Business Zone is a developing Eco Industrial Park which utilizes theories and concepts of ecology and resource recovery to reduce waste. Utilizing a qualitative research approach, data was obtained from businesses throughout the Park to develop a waste exchange database. The results of this study suggest that the application of concepts underlying Eco Industrial Parks such as a by-product exchange program can assist to drive resource recovery and sustainable waste management practices. However, users of the exchange are highly uneducated or unaware of the links between waste and resources. This was made evident by the fact that companies were more inclined to continue the practice of revenue recycling over the sustainable approach as offered by the exchange. This conclusion suggests that although a waste exchange can help to drive resource recovery, increased education and awareness through mandatory regulations could help to drive resource recovery even further. For the greater success of waste management in Canada, the Government should take action to regulate the planning and organization of waste exchanges in industrial and surrounding areas. The Pearson <b>Eco-Business</b> by-product exchange suggests that cities should not be planned without consideration of solid waste and resource recovery therefore suggesting that concepts related to Eco-Industrial parks should be applied to all municipal and city planning moving forward...|$|E
