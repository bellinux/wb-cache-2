The report stated that the body had been mostly burned, but {{that a number of}} wounds from stabbing and fatal cuts, especially at her neck, signs of trauma resulting from impact with blunt objects at her head and edema and bruises at various places of her body had been found. Her severed hands, which were found later, were also examined and traces of Suphi Altındöken's DNA were found in the nails. However, no signs of rape were detected.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} B.

The manuscript of the workbook report from the Chemical Examination Laboratory shows over-writing in four places. Using a whitener and a different ink, the word ‘‘not’’ has been added to the word ‘‘detected,’. The lab explained that it was quite normal to make corrections in the manuscript. Even Varghese P Thomas, the first investigating officer, said the post mortem and lab reports had ruled out rape, leaving no scope for suspicions on the veracity of the report.|$|E

40|$|This study explores {{whether the}} {{introduction}} of selectively trained radiographers reporting Accident and Emergency (A&E) X-ray examinations of the appendicular skeleton affected the availability of reports for A&E and General Practitioner (GP) examinations at a typical district general hospital. This was achieved by analysing monthly data on A&E and GP examinations for 1993 - 1997 using structural time-series models. Parameters to capture stochastic seasonal effects and stochastic time trends {{were included in the}} models. The main outcome measures were changes in the number, proportion and timeliness of A&E and GP <b>examinations</b> <b>reported.</b> Radiographer <b>reporting</b> X-ray <b>examinations</b> requested by A&E was associated with a 12 % (p= 0. 050) {{increase in the number of}} A&E <b>examinations</b> <b>reported</b> and a 37 % (p= 0. 001) decrease in the time taken to <b>report</b> on these <b>examinations.</b> Radiographer <b>reporting</b> of A&E X-ray examinations was also associated with a 14 % (p= 0. 067) decrease in the time taken for GP <b>examinations</b> to be <b>reported.</b> That is, radiographer <b>reporting</b> A&E X-ray <b>examinations</b> allowed an increase in the time available to radiologists to <b>report</b> on <b>examinations</b> requested by GPs. An increase in the proportion of GP <b>examinations</b> <b>reported</b> by radiologists was associated with longer reporting times for A&E examinations. In conclusion, selectively trained radiographers reporting on A&E X-ray examinations significantly improved the availability of reports for A&E and GP examinations. No Full Tex...|$|R
500|$|Particular {{veins of}} the DVS and the SVS are looked at. The great saphenous vein (GSV), {{and the small}} saphenous vein (SSV) are {{superficial}} veins which drain into respectively, the common femoral vein and the popliteal vein. These veins are deep veins. Perforator veins drain superficial veins into the deep veins. Three anatomic compartments are described (as networks), (N1) containing the deep veins, (N2) containing the perforator veins, and (N3) [...] containing the superficial veins, known as the saphenous compartment,. This compartmentalisation {{makes it easier for}} the examiner to systematize and map. The GSV can be located in the saphenous compartment where together with the Giacomini vein and the accessory saphenous vein (ASV) [...] an image resembling an eye, known as the 'eye sign' can be seen. The ASV which is often responsible for varicose veins, can be located at the 'alignment sign', where it is seen to align with the femoral vessels. Together with the GSV and the CFV these three veins create an image called the 'Mickey Mouse' sign. The <b>examination</b> <b>report</b> will include details of the deep and the superficial vein systems, and their mapping. The mapping is drawn on paper and then drawn on the patient before surgery.|$|E
500|$|On February 27, 1943, Robinson was {{inducted}} into the United States Army, where he was again referred to as Walker Smith. Robinson had a 15-month military career. Robinson served with Joe Louis, and the pair went on tours where they performed exhibition bouts in front of US troops. Robinson got into trouble several times while in the military. He argued with superiors who he felt were discriminatory against him, and refused to fight exhibitions when he was told African American soldiers were not allowed to watch them. [...] In late March 1944, Robinson was stationed at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, waiting to ship out to Europe, where he was scheduled to perform more exhibition matches. But on March 29, Robinson disappeared from his barracks. When he woke up on April 5 in Fort Jay Hospital on Governor's Island, he had missed his sailing for Europe and was under suspicion of deserting. He himself reported falling down the stairs in his barracks on the 29th, but said that he had complete amnesia, and he could not remember any events from that moment until the 5th. According to his file, a stranger had found him in the street on 1 [...] April and helped him to a hospital. In his <b>examination</b> <b>report,</b> a doctor at Fort Jay concluded that Robinson's version of events was sincere. [...] He was examined by military authorities, who claimed he suffered from a mental deficiency. Robinson was granted an honorable discharge on June 3, 1944. He later wrote that unfair press coverage of the incident had [...] "branded" [...] him as a [...] "deserter". Robinson maintained his close friendship with Louis from their time in military service, and the two went into business together after the war. They planned to start a liquor distribution business in New York City, but were denied a license due to their race.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The use of lung {{ultrasound}} (LUS) in ICU {{is increasing}} but ultrasonographic patterns of lung are {{often difficult to}} quantify by different operators. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the accuracy and quality of LUS reporting after the introduction of a standardized electronic recording sheet. Methods Intensivists were trained for LUS following a teaching programme. From April 2008, an electronic sheet was designed and introduced in ICU database in order to uniform LUS <b>examination</b> <b>reporting.</b> A mark from 0 to 24 has been given for each exam by two senior intensivists not involved in the survey. The mark assigned was based on completeness of a precise reporting scheme, concerning the main finding of LUS. A cut off of 15 was considered sufficiency. Results The study comprehended 12 months of observations and a total of 637 LUS. Initially, although some improvement in the reports completeness, still the accuracy and precision of <b>examination</b> <b>reporting</b> was below 15. The time required to reach a sufficient quality was 7 months. A linear trend in physicians progress was observed. Conclusions The uniformity in teaching programme and <b>examinations</b> <b>reporting</b> system permits to improve the level of completeness and accuracy of LUS reporting, helping physicians in following lung pathology evolution. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{convergence of}} the Habermasian paradigm for "ways of knowing" and social cognitive approaches to power relations {{was used to}} analyse PhD <b>examination</b> <b>reports.</b> Previous analyses revealed that even when PhDs were given the highest evaluations, they were frequently accompanied by negative remarks. It is argued that examiners' epistemological beliefs obstruct the emancipation of knowledge and are representative of a conservative academic culture which protects its extant structures. Research in social psychology has demonstrated that people {{in positions of power}} are motivated to maintain their high power base. The combination of these philosophical and psychological tenets guided the analysis of the discourse used in <b>examination</b> <b>reports</b> of PhDs. The study examined 23 reports and showed that while there was evidence of the three hierarchies of power (examiner as expert, examiner as partner and examiner as learner/listener) in the discourse, it was dominated by negative comments and largely indicative of the examiner perceiving his role as that of expert. This was interpreted in light of the literature suggesting those in power are reluctant to relinquish their high power base...|$|R
