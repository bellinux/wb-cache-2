5|$|Cyclone Favio was {{the first}} known {{tropical}} cyclone that passed south of Madagascar to strike Africa as an intense tropical cyclone. Early on February11, 2007, a zone of disturbed weather formed east of Madagascar. Four days later, Favio was named as intensified to a moderate tropical storm while moving southwest. On February18, the storm was upgraded into a severe tropical storm. Then, it turned west <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Mozambique. Continuing to intensify, Favio was upgraded to a tropical cyclone early on February19. Subsequently, the storm began to undergo rapid deepening; the small storm reached intense tropical cyclone status the next day before peaking in intensity. However, the cyclone had weakened somewhat prior to making landfall on February22 in the Inhambane Province in Mozambique. It rapidly weakened over land and dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Judy, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Susang, was the third {{tropical}} cyclone to affect Japan during the 1982 Pacific typhoon season. Forming east of the Philippines in tandem with another system on September4, the disturbance continued to intensify, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on September6 and a typhoon on September8 while tracking northwestward. On September9, Judy attained its peak intensity, with winds of 150km/h (90mph). Thereafter, increased wind shear took a toll on the typhoon, as it turned northward on September11 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Japan {{under the influence of}} a mid-latitude cyclone. Judy passed over southeastern Japan on September12; by this time, the typhoon had weakened considerably. Judy became an extratropical cyclone almost immediately thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Patterson {{engaged in}} a gun duel with the Japanese column. Patterson {{received}} a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit Kinugasa, causing moderate damage. Patterson then {{lost sight of the}} Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island. Bagley, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may have hit Canberra. Bagley played no further role in the battle. Yūnagi exchanged non-damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.|$|E

25|$|Faced with Maj. Gen. William T.

25|$|The {{thylacine}} was exclusively carnivorous. Its {{stomach was}} muscular, and could distend {{to allow the}} animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of it in captivity suggest that it preferred to single out a target animal and pursue that animal until it was exhausted. Some studies conclude that the animal may have hunted in small family groups, with the main group herding prey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> an individual waiting in ambush.

25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as quickly as possible. Along the way, money can be earned by performing stunts such as near misses with other vehicles. The player is directed to a destination by a large green arrow {{at the top of the}} screen. The arrow does not adjust based on obstacles, but rather points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the destination. Once the player arrives near the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, that customer's fare is added to the player's total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to complete the journey. If the customer's timer runs out before the player reaches the destination the customer jumps from the taxi without paying the driver.|$|E

The velocity of the pointer depends on the applied force so increasing pressure causes faster movement.

At the base of The Band the ridge continues as the complex top of Seathwaite Fell, replete with numerous tarns. The largest is Sprinkling Tarn with its beautifully indented shoreline providing perfect foreground for views of the cliff.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} launch mode {{was called}} Bearing-Only Launch (BOL). In this mode, the missile was launched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the target, and its radar activated {{from the beginning}} to scan for the target in a +/- 45° sector in front of the flight path. Once a target was located and the seeker locked the xGM-84A missile climbed rapidly to about 1800m before diving on the target in what was known as a [...] "pop-up maneuver". The 221kg (488lb) WDU-18/B penetrating blast-fragmentation warhead (in the WAU-3(V) /B warhead section) was triggered by a time-delayed impact fuze. When no target was acquired after radar activation, the Harpoon would self-destruct.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{analysis}} from the JMA, Ruby {{was believed to}} have maintained its intensity over land, although the JTWC noted that Ruby weakened substantially over land. During the evening of October25, when it was about [...] west-northwest of Manila, Ruby started a weakening trend. Meanwhile, the storm's forward motion slowed down significantly, and Ruby turned towards the west-northwest late on October26. Around this time, the JMA downgraded Ruby into a severe tropical storm. While moving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> Hainan Island, the JTWC estimated that Ruby lost typhoon intensity {{on the morning of}} October27. Increased northeasterly wind shear took its toll on the storm, resulting in continued weakening. During the afternoon of October27, Ruby struck the island of Hainan, with the JMA estimating winds of [...] Land interaction with the rugged terrain of the island accelerated the weakening trend, and after becoming devoid of deep convection, the JTWC ceased tracking Ruby late on October28. Eighteen hours later, the JMA followed suit.|$|E

500|$|With an upper-level high {{located near}} the cyclone, the {{tropical}} cyclone steadily became better organized and thus Connie began to strengthen rapidly, as previously indicated by many tropical cyclone forecast models.

By 1800UTC on January27, Tropical Cyclone Connie developed a very well defined eye; based on this, MFR upgraded Connie to a very intense tropical cyclone.

After passing around [...] north-northwest of Mauritius, Connie then decelerated east-southeast.
