40|$|Based on data on {{the living}} space of {{dwellings}} compiled by Statistics Denmark and data on housing prices compiled by Realkreditraadet (the Association of Danish Mortgage Banks), we calculate three measures of housing wealth for Denmark in the period from 1981 to 2006. These measures include total housing wealth, the housing wealth of households {{and the value of}} owner-occupied homes with a breakdown by type of dwelling (detached one-family houses, terraced houses, farmhouses, <b>freehold</b> <b>flats,</b> holiday dwellings and multi-family buildings excluding <b>freehold</b> <b>flats).</b> This paper provides a documentation of methodology and presents results. Moreover, we apply the wealth figures when calculating capital gains on housing and the amount of non-mortgaged housing wealth of households (home-equity). Finally, we discuss alternative housing wealth measures that are publicly available...|$|R
50|$|It {{was soon}} learned that <b>freehold</b> <b>flats</b> were an {{unsatisfactory}} form of ownership {{because it was not}} possible to impose essential maintenance requirements. As such, flats became virtually unmarketable because they were an unacceptable form of security to lenders. Thus solicitors, the principal property lawyers in England and Wales in those days, began to use leases instead, where such limitations did not apply.|$|R
50|$|<b>Freehold</b> houses, <b>flats</b> and {{commercial}} premises within the Suburb {{are subject to}} a scheme of management approved pursuant to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 by an Order of the Chancery Division of the High Court, dated 17 January 1974, as amended by a further Order dated 17 February 1983.|$|R
50|$|The {{locality}} {{is mostly}} <b>flat</b> <b>freehold</b> land (approx 70 metres above sea level) used for farming, mostly growing vegetables such as onions, beetroots, broccoli and pumpkin.|$|R
50|$|Kentville is <b>flat</b> <b>freehold</b> farming land, {{used for}} crops and grazing, {{approximately}} 70 metres above sea level. Lockyer Creek forms its south-west boundary. In {{the east of}} the locality is the One Mile Lagoon.|$|R
50|$|The town {{is located}} in the {{south-west}} of the locality. The North Branch of the Condamine River forms the western boundary of the locality. The land is <b>flat</b> <b>freehold</b> farmland (approx 400 metres above sea level) and is used to grow crops, such as sorgum, corn and wheat.|$|R
50|$|When {{the flats}} were {{constructed}} they were rented out, however, the flats gradually moved from rental and were {{sold on the}} standard lease of 99 years. In the 1960s, many owners purchased the <b>freehold</b> for their <b>flat</b> and took 999 year leases - today, very few York Mansions' flats do not own {{a share of the}} freehold.|$|R
5000|$|Law of Property Act 1925, s.153, {{contains}} {{provisions for}} the [...] "enlargement" [...] of leases into freeholds, {{one of the}} effects of which is to preserve the enforceability of positive covenants contained in the lease against the resulting freehold. There are clear, but stringent, requirements. Artificial schemes using the provisions to create enforceable positive covenants in <b>freehold</b> blocks of <b>flats</b> were occasionally mooted but never gained currency.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{introduction}} {{is to provide a}} brief outline of the scope and the progression of the thesis. Since {{the latter part of the}} nineteenth century, it has been a well-established principle of real property law in England and Wales that the burden of a positive covenant cannot run directly with freehold land at law or in equity. The fact that a positive covenant cannot run directly with freehold land has for many years been acknowledged to be a major defect of English land law. In Chapter I, the rules which govern the enforceability of freehold covenants are examined. Further, the chapter identifies why the Judges in the nineteenth century decided not to permit the burden of a positive covenant to run with freehold land. Conveyancers use a number of techniques and devices in order to circumvent the aforementioned principle. However, none of them are foolproof. In Chapter II, a number of devices which are used by conveyancers in order to circumvent the aforementioned principle are examined and evaluated. The difficulties which can arise from the present law's failure to provide a satisfactory means whereby positive covenants may be made to run with freehold land are identified in Chapter III. Local authorities possess a number of statutory powers to impose positive covenants on freehold land and to enforce them against successive owners. In Chapter IV, consideration is afforded to some aspects of their powers in this regard. The need to reform the present law has long been recognised. However, despite the fact that several Reports have been made and one draft Bill produced reform has still not been achieved. In Chapter V, the major proposals made for reform in the 1960 's and 1970 's are considered. Further, reasons are advanced to explain why reform of the law of positive covenants has proved to be so difficult to secure. One of the main consequences of the present law is that the vast majority of flats in England and Wales are held on long leases. The popular preference is for freehold not leasehold ownership. Several common law countries have comprehensive "condominium" legislation making full provision for rights and obligations, etc., in regard to <b>freehold</b> <b>flats.</b> The relevant legislation of New South Wales and Trinidad and Tobago is examined in Chapters VI and VII respectively. One objective of these chapters is to demonstrate that there are viable alternatives to using leasehold schemes for blocks of flats. In 1984, the Law Commission published their Report on Positive and Restrictive Covenants. Chapter VIII deals with this Report and with a number of other relevant recent development...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} a massive development of new housing {{taking place in the}} UK to meet rising demand predominantly being delivered in multi-owned new estates which include a mix of <b>freehold</b> houses, leasehold <b>flats</b> and models of affordable housing. Since the financial constraints imposed by the government on local authorities {{there appears to be a}} growing requirement for the new residents to set up private companies to manage communal space contained within. This is unprecedented at this scale in freehold purchase and binds new owners to service charges for upkeep and maintenance and for permissions for development in addition to those imposed by statutory legislation. Purchasers are advised that a limited company will be set up to manage a selection of: green infrastructure, parking, roads, lighting and drains. Each resident will hold a share in this company and will then be responsible for appointing voluntary directors from the estate who can in turn appoint a property management agents. This paper investigates the back-ground to the current position and uses case studies and interviews with residents of a number of estates where these service charges are payable to determine how this is working in practice...|$|R
