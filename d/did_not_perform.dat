5|$|The film <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> {{well at the}} {{box office}} upon its Australian release, taking in a gross of A$108,330 on its first weekend but only $31,995 on its second weekend at a screen average of $681 on 47 screens.|$|E
5|$|After the deicing {{truck was}} repaired, the pilot {{requested}} a second deicing, though {{the flight crew}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. The flight crew completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi.|$|E

5|$|Burnside fought at {{the battles}} of Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House, where he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> in a {{distinguished}} manner, attacking piecemeal and appearing reluctant to commit his {{troops to the}} frontal assaults that characterized these battles. After North Anna and Cold Harbor, he took {{his place in the}} siege lines at Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Henry VII touched {{seven or}} eight {{infected}} people annually, and there were intervals lasting several years during which he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> the ritual at all. Henry VIII (r. 1509–1547) touched 59 people between early January 1530 and late December 1532. The Protestant Edward VI (r. 1547–1553) apparently <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> the ritual, but the Catholic Mary I (r. 1553–1558) took it somewhat more seriously. Early in her reign, the Protestant Elizabeth I was reluctant {{to participate in a}} ritual whose efficacy she probably doubted. Although she resumed the practice in 1570, after the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated her and alleged that she had lost her healing power, Elizabeth decisively downplayed her own role in the miraculous healing. The Elizabethan surgeon William Clowes, who asserted that the royal touch proved her legitimacy, claimed that Elizabeth could also heal foreigners, citing a Dutchman as an example.|$|E
5|$|On occasions, Kinkladze {{played as}} a second striker, a role with less {{positional}} responsibility. Periods when Kinkladze {{was used in this}} way included Frank Clark's first months as Manchester City manager, and alongside Fabrizio Ravanelli at Derby County. Though a left-footed player, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> well when played as a left winger, and publicly expressed his distaste for playing in the position.|$|E

5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not {{to the extent that}} the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Before spring {{training}} in 2009, there was speculation that if Garko <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> well, he might lose his starting first base job. Garko began practicing the outfield {{position for the}} upcoming season. Eric Wedge stated that Garko would in fact be playing the outfield in {{spring training}}. On June 21, Garko was held {{out of the game}} because of a sprained left wrist.|$|E
5|$|Body of Lies was Alexander Witt's first credit as a {{director}} of photography; he had collaborated with Ridley Scott on six feature films previously, beginning as a second unit camera operator on Black Rain (1989). He shot the film in the Super 35 format with spherical lenses, and explained that these lenses offer more flexibility for interior and night pictures than the anamorphic alternative. They used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 instead of Technicolor's OZ process, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> well in tests in the Moroccan desert.|$|E

5|$|Cerny {{also gave}} input and {{feedback}} on the game's level-design. However, the 3DO <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> as they had expected, and Universal suggested that the team should switched to Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation to increase sales of the game. The game originally ran on a custom engine developed by Alex Hastings, and was upgraded and converted for the PlayStation within a month. The debut title was called Disruptor, and was released worldwide in November 1996.|$|E
5|$|Crowley was a late {{developer}} as a musician, having originally {{spent time}} on other pursuits, such as studying architecture, painting and photography. Alongside this he wrote songs but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> his first show {{until the age}} of 25, some days after finding material he had written in the early 1990s in his attic. He departed from a career in photography around 2004 to enter the music profession on a full-time basis.|$|E

In July 1997, it debuted on the singles chart at number thirteen, but was unable to reach a higher position and dropped off the chart after fourteen weeks.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> {{very well at}} the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically. Hamer expressed some disappointment with this, while hoping that the DVD-release would fare better. Internationally, the film did somewhat better, and was sold to forty countries. By early August 2009, the film had in fact been seen by {{more people in the}} United States than in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Marshall had {{a budget}} {{three times the}} size of his {{previous}} two films, The Descent and Dog Soldiers, and the director filmed the larger-scale Doomsday in Scotland and South Africa. The film was released on 14 March 2008 in the United States and Canada and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008. Doomsday <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> well at the box office, and critics gave the film mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|Rouass' {{involvement}} in the series was first announced in March 2010, with her character name revealed later in May. Because Maya was only a background character, Rouass's role was limited, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> any stunts and had time to perform other projects. The actress liked working with Richard Armitage, who played Lucas, as she knew him for some years prior to working on Spooks. The character was met with generally mixed reviews from critics.|$|E

5|$|The Briscoe Brothers have a {{somewhat}} checkered history with Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG). They have, numerous times, been announced for events {{at which they}} ultimately <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform,</b> such as when they were scheduled for a PWG World Tag Team Championship match against Roderick Strong and PAC at Giant-Size Annual #4, but wound up being replaced by then-PWG World Champion El Generico and Kevin Steen.|$|E
5|$|The T2000 {{operated}} on Line 1 of the T-bane, and replaced the aging HkB 600 teak wagons {{used on the}} Holmenkoll Line. The units were equipped with both third rail and overhead wire collectors, so they could operate on the Common Line and on the Holmenkoll Line. The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> satisfactorily. The T2000 were taken out of service in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The mounted {{police were}} {{established}} to be an armed force, primarily due to the perceived threat from the First Nations on the prairies. The police were initially equipped with the Snider-Enfield Carbine Mark III and the Snider-Enfield Short Rifle, but these were single-shot breechloaders, and inferior to the repeating weapons already being used by Indian groups in the United States. These were replaced with the Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifle from 1878 onwards, but the new guns proved quite delicate and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> effectively during the 1885 rebellion. In 1895, the force began to replace the ageing Winchesters with the Lee-Metford Magazine Carbine, but these weapons <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> as well as hoped. The program was halted and instead the Lee-Enfield Magazine Rifle Mark I was introduced in 1902 as the standard police small arm. The very limited supplies of ammunition held by the force meant {{that the police had}} few opportunities to practice with their weapons, and as a result their marksmanship was typically quite poor.|$|E
