5|$|Any <b>general</b> <b>property</b> of Banach spaces {{continues}} to hold for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E

25|$|Polarization is a <b>general</b> <b>property</b> {{of waves}} that {{describes}} {{the orientation of the}}ir oscillations. For transverse waves such as many electromagnetic waves, it describes the orientation of the oscillations in the plane perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel. The oscillations may be oriented in a single direction (linear polarization), or the oscillation direction may rotate as the wave travels (circular or elliptical polarization). Circularly polarised waves can rotate rightward or leftward in the direction of travel, and which of those two rotations is present in a wave is called the wave's chirality.|$|E

On August 25 the demands had not been met. After a second warning was made to the civilians, French troops overwhelmed the skeleton force and captured Honolulu Fort, spiked the coastal guns and destroyed all other weapons they found (mainly muskets and ammunition). They raided government buildings and <b>general</b> <b>property</b> in Honolulu, causing damage that amounted to $100,000. After the raids the invasion force withdrew to the fort.

More generally, any permutation of the rows or columns multiplies the determinant by {{the sign of}} the permutation. By permutation, it is meant viewing each row as a vector Ri (equivalently each column as Ci) and reordering the rows (or columns) by interchange of Rj and Rk (or Cj and Ck), where j,k are two indices chosen from 1 to n for an [...] square matrix.|$|E
2500|$|In this process, {{the complex}} translocates four protons across the inner {{membrane}} per molecule of oxidized NADH, helping {{to build the}} electrochemical potential difference used to produce ATP. Escherichia coli complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) is capable of proton translocation {{in the same direction}} to the established Δψ, showing that in the tested conditions, the coupling ion is H+. Na+ transport in the opposite direction was observed, and although Na+ was not necessary for the catalytic or proton transport activities, its presence increased the latter. H+ was translocated by the Paracoccus denitrificans complex I, but in this case, H+ transport was not influenced by Na+, and Na+ transport was not observed. Possibly, the E. coli complex I has two energy coupling sites (one Na+ independent and the other Na+dependent), as observed for the Rhodothermus marinus complex I, whereas the coupling mechanism of the P. denitrificans enzyme is completely Na+ independent. It is also possible that another transporter catalyzes the uptake of Na+. [...] Complex I energy transduction by proton pumping may not be exclusive to the R. marinus enzyme. The Na+/H+ antiport activity seems not to be a <b>general</b> <b>property</b> of complex I. However, the existence of Na+-translocating activity of the complex I is still in question.|$|E
2500|$|The Karelian {{question}} arose when Finland {{was forced}} to cede territories to the Soviet Union after the Winter War in the Moscow peace treaty in 1940. Most Finnish citizens were evacuated from the ceded areas. Most of them returned during the Continuation War and eventually were evacuated again in 1944. The Soviet Union insisted the ceded areas be [...] completely evacuated in 10 days. The evacuees were partly compensated for their losses; farmers, for example, received land in proportion to their earlier holdings. Usually, the compensation was about {{one third of the}} original farm. Compensation for movable property was much less. However, all evacuee families had a right to receive a small farm, and/or a plot for a detached house or a flat. The land used for these grants was confiscated by the state from municipalities and private owners. Financial compensation was funded by a <b>general</b> <b>property</b> tax of 10 to 30%, levied {{over a period of several}} years. Because the vast majority of the evacuees who had to settle in the rest of Finland were from ceded Karelia, the question was labeled The Karelian Question. After the Winter War, Karelian municipalities and parishes established Karjalan Liitto (the Karelian Association) to defend the rights of Karelians in Finland.|$|E

In the final chapter of his Evolution the modern synthesis he defines evolutionary progress as [...] "a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency, this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment," [...] Evolution in action discusses evolutionary progress at length: [...] "Natural selection plus time produces biological improvement… 'Improvement' {{is not yet a}} recognised technical term in biology … however, living things are improved during evolution… Darwin was not afraid to use the word for the results of natural selection in general… I believe that improvement can become one of the key concepts in evolutionary biology.""Can it be scientifically defined? Improvements in biological machinery… the limbs and teeth of grazing horses… the increase in brain-power… The eyes of a dragon-fly, which can see all round [...] in every direction, are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye-spots of early forms of life." [...] " [...] the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance—improvement in all the main properties of life, including its general organization. 'Advance' is thus a useful term for long-term improvement in some <b>general</b> <b>property</b> of life. [...] improvement is not universal. Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher". These excerpts are much abbreviated, but give some idea of his way of thinking. He addresses the topic of 'persistent types' (living fossils) later in the same book (pp 126–28).|$|E
