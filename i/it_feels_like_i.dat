Sixteen-year-old Claire Chitham auditioned for the role and ended up winning it. After several months on the show, producers decided the character of Waverley had run her desired course and she was written off. Chitham believed her time on the soap was over and finished school, started a degree and began acting in other jobs. However, in 1998 Chitham was contacted by the show with a pitch that would see Waverley return in a 3-month stint. Chitham was hugely surprised as nothing of that calibre had happened before in the show and she happily accepted. She stated, [...] "It’s good to be back.

5000|$|Six {{had success}} with the film The Human Centipede. Although met with mixed reviews and reactions, The Human Centipede {{garnered}} widespread attention. The first film's success gave Six the flexibility he needed {{to work on a}} sequel, The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence), eventually leading to a trilogy. He made the first film to get viewers comfortable with the idea of the Human Centipede. Both the controversial content of the first film and the second's brutal depictions of sexual violence have generated controversy. In the United Kingdom, the BBFC declined to issue an 18 certificate for The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence), highlighting the antagonist's [...] "total degradation, humiliation, mutilation, torture, and murder of his naked victims". Six then submitted a new cut with two minutes and 37 seconds removed and received the 18 certificate. Six responded with mixed feelings. On one hand, he was devastated that he had to cut his film, on the other hand, the decision of the BBFC gained a lot of press and notoriety. About cutting the film he says: [...] "In the UK, censors cut many minutes from The Human Centipede 2 by law. <b>It</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> made a comedy and they cut out all the good jokes. It’s appalling. Nobody is forced to see a movie." ...|$|E

Wigmore quit the role in 2008 to travel overseas, she stated, [...] "it was sad to say goodbye, {{to a lot of people}} on Shortland Street, I’ll be sad to say goodbye to a regular job too.

[...] Following her departure from the soap on 11 September 2008, the media began to speculate that Justine would return to finish off [...] "loose-ends".

I have always been {{in the middle of}} everything in life and much of my writing stems from these experiences. I feel as if I am making something coherent and even beautiful out of what was, in reality, a messy and inarticulate floundering. Some of these poems are culled from my life, but all of them are fictions in one way or another. My most recent experimentation with poetry has turned me towards prose poems. They appeal to me more because <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> 2 ̆ 7 m writing fiction. The longer lines allow me a greater freedom in using images and phrases that with line breaks might be constrained. The prose poems I write now are more like mini-stories to me.

Sounds are distorted – a sound from my head lies like a layer over all the sounds around me. To be in the real world but not belonging, a place where sounds and movements feel different and strange. It´s a quiet state, a secret panic that doesn’t show itself outwards. You must wait, it will eventually pass.   My bachelor project is about a psychological state, which I call bathroom-psychosis. It’s about being traumatised by sexual abuse. My work is about what happens afterwards, when the trauma is not present. It’s about the human mind's ability to shut off and block difficult states but its lacking ability {{to take care of the}} mind fully. It’s a silent panic, turned inwards – inside the own body.
