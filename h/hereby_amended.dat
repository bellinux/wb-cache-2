5000|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, Little Bear {{returned}} to Montana, his native country, and began to follow Rocky Boy. In 1905, Little Bear contacted Canadian leaders to request allowing the Cree from Montana to relocate to Canada. Officials agreed and the Cree settled primarily with the Onion Lake First Nation and the Samson First Nation (this reserve includes the Ermineskin, Louis Bull, and Montana First Nations). In 1908, Little Bear again contacted Canadian leaders requesting permission for more landless Chippewa and Cree to relocate from Montana to Canada. After the Rocky Boy Reservation was officially established in 1916, Little Bear followed Rocky Boy and his band there, bringing about 200 of his own people. He took over as leader of the new Reservation after Rocky Boy's death in 1916. Little Bear died in 1921.

These excessive testing requirements are unnecessary to maintain adequate assurance of system operability, and may result in unintended consequences, such as premature wear of components. Other surveillance requirements provide adequate assurance that redundant systems and components are operable and capable of performing their intended safety function.

Attachment 3 provides the marked-up version of the current Technical Specification pages. Attachment 4 is the retyped Technical Specification pages.

40|$|Gentlemen: In {{accordance}} with 10 CFR 50. 90, Entergy Operations, Inc. (EOI) is <b>hereby</b> proposing to <b>amend</b> Operating License NPF- 38 for Waterford 3 by requesting the NRC Staff {{review and approval}} of the attached change to the Technical Specifications (TS). The proposed change relaxes the allowable cooldown rate in TS 3. 4. 8. 1, "RCS Pressure / Temperature Limits". Specifically, this change will eliminate the limitation of a 1 00 F per hour cooldown rate when the RCS temperature is below 135 OF. The proposed limitations permit a 100 OF per hour cooldown rate to continue down to an RCS temperature of 110 OF, {{at which point the}} rate is reduced to 30 OF per hour. The attached description and safety analysis support the proposed change to the Waterford 3 TS. This change is desirable in order to improve outage efficiency. This proposed change has been evaluated in {{accordance with}} 1 OCFR 50. 91 (a) (1), using the criteria in 1 OCFR 50. 92 (c), and it has been determined that this request involves no significant hazards consideration. The circumstances surrounding this change do not meet the NRC Staff criteria for exigent or emergency review.
