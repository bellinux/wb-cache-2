40|$|Sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets {{are exposed}} to AC {{magnetic}} fields in many applications, e. g. in permanent magnet electric motors. We have measured the AC losses of sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets in a closed circuit arrangement using AC fields with root mean square-values up to 80 mT (peak amplitude 113 mT) over the frequency range 50 to 1000 Hz. Two magnet grades with different dysprosium content were investigated. Around the remanence point the low grade material (1. 7 wt% Dy) showed significant hysteresis losses; whereas the losses in the high grade material (8. 9 wt% Dy) were dominated by classical eddy currents. Kerr microscopy images revealed that the hysteresis losses measured for the low grade magnet can be mainly ascribed to grains at the sample surface with multiple domains. This was further confirmed when the high grade material was subsequently exposed to DC and AC magnetic fields. Here {{a larger number of}} surface grains with multiple domains are also present once the step i n the demagnetization curve attributed to the surface <b>grain</b> <b>reversal</b> is reached and a rise in the measured hysteresis losses is evident. If in the low grade material the operating point is slightly offset from the remanence point, such that zero field is not bypassed, its AC losses can also be fairly well described with classical eddy current theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between the microstructure, observed using an electron probe microanalyzer, and the domain structure, observed using a Kerr microscope, was established to evaluate the effects of hot rolling {{and the addition of}} Ti-C on the c-axis orientation and the magnetization process of hot-rolled Nd-Fe-B-Ti-C melt-spun ribbons. The addition of Ti-C promotes the c-axis orientation and high coercivity in the ribbons. Elemental mapping suggests a uniform elemental distribution; however, an uneven distribution of Ti was observed in an enlarged grain with Ti-enriched points inside the <b>grain.</b> The <b>reversal</b> domains that nucleated at the Ti-enriched point inside the grain cause low coercivity...|$|R
40|$|Anomalous' {{magnetic}} fabrics in dikes {{that appear}} to indicate flowinto thewall confound many workers. Here, we present extensivemagnetic data on five dikes from Tenerife, Canary Islands, and use these to interpret {{the causes of the}} anomalous fabrics. Comparison of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and anhysteretic magnetization (AARM) results show that, in some cases, the anomalous fabrics are caused by single-domain grains, which produce AMS fabrics perpendicular to the grain elongation, whereas AARM fabrics are parallel. To check this, hysteresis experiments were used to characterize the domain state. These show most are mixtures of pseudo-single-domain or single-domain plus multi-domain particles, but many have wasp-waisted hysteresis loops, likely indicating mixed populations of stable singledomain and superparamagnetic <b>grains.</b> First-order <b>reversal</b> curves were used to better characterize this and show mixtures of stable single-domain and superparamagnetic grains dominate the magnetic signal. Magnetic particles at the stable single-domain/superparamagnetic threshold are unstable at timespans relevant to the analytical techniques, so they produce complicated results. This suggests that anomalous AMS fabrics in dikes cannot simply be attributed to elongated stable single-domain particles and that mixtures of the different grain types can produce hybrid fabrics, in which the fabrics are neither perpendicular or parallel to the dike plane, that are difficult to interpret without extensive magnetic analysis.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the reversal of magnetisation in sintered anisotropic Nd-Fe-B, isotropic melt-spun Nd-Fe-B powder, and in Sm-(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr) 2 : 17 anisotropic powder. Magnetisation measurements have been performed using vibrating sample magnetometers, a permeameter, and an adapted pulsed field magnetometer. Magnetisation reversal is explained in terms of domain wall formation and motion, and irreversible switching of moments across energy barriers. For sintered Nd-Fe-B, consisting of multi-domain grains in the virgin state, it is suggested that the pinning of domain walls at grain boundaries {{plays an important role in}} hindering <b>reversal</b> of magnetised <b>grains.</b> The type of pinning mechanism appears to depend on the initial magnetic state of the material. In the melt-spun Nd-Fe-B and in Sm-(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr) 2 : 17 powders, it is suggested that since domains remain correlated across several <b>grains,</b> the <b>reversal</b> mechanism is best described as bulk pinning of domain walls by grain boundaries. The nature of this mechanism is investigated. In Sm-(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr) 2 : 17 an unexpected variation of remanent coercivity and fluctuation field with magnetic orientation and texture is observed. Data on magnetic interactions and their effects on the reversal mechanisms is analysed. Weight changes of melt-spun Nd-Fe-B powders during ageing in different environments are related to the observed changes in the reversal mechanism. A preliminary study physically modelling the alignment of anisotropic polymer bonded Sm-(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr) 2 : 17 powders is outlined and related to a simple analytical model...|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} the anatomical, chemical and physics characteristics of candeia wood (Eremanthus erythropappus (DC.) Macleish). Five trees {{were collected from}} Carrancas-MG, and disks were obtained at the breast high (DBH) to sample preparation. The description and mensuration were performed at the principal anatomical structures (fibers, vessel and radial parenchyma). For chemical analysis, the extractives content, hollocelulose, lignin and inorganic components were determined. The physical properties included the basic specific gravity, specific gravity at 12 % moisture content as well as tangential, radial and volumetric shrinkage and coefficients of shrinkage and anisotropy. The main results found for macroscopic characteristics were: awkward odor due to presence of oil-resin; <b>reversal</b> <b>grain</b> and hardness to the cut; microscopical characteristics: scarce parenchyma axial and radial very thin, elements of vases with numerous and very small pits, short plates of simple perforation, libriforms fibers with thick cellular wall and presence of oil cells in the ray. Chemical composition: 20. 89 % total extractives; 50. 52 % holocelulose; 28. 59 % lignin and 0. 39 % of inorganic constituents. The specific gravity at 12 % was of 0. 98 g/cm 3 and the basic specific gravity of 0. 79 g/cm 3. The anisotropy coefficient was 1. 91 and the coefficient of volumetric retratibility was 0. 28 %...|$|R
40|$|Reversible {{magnetization}} measurements, micromagnetic modeling, {{the temperature}} dependence of coercivity, and magnetic viscosity measurements {{have been used}} to clarify the magnetic reversal mechanism of Nd 2 Fe 14 B particles contained in a Nd matrix. The coercivity was observed to increase markedly as the dilution of the Nd 2 Fe 14 B phase was increased. The increase in coercivity was accompanied by a change in the reversal mechanism. In the least dilute samples, domain wall motion involving several grains governed by intergrain interactions was active. In the most dilute samples nonuniform <b>reversal</b> of individual <b>grains</b> was dominant, <b>reversal</b> occurring particle by particle and resembling the behavior of isolated Stoner- Wohlfarth particles. The value of the coercivity in the most dilute sample was in excellent agreement with micromagnetic modeling results for isolated particles when the effect of thermal activation of magnetization reversal was accounted for. Despite the single particle reversal mechanism of the most dilute samples, a linear dependence of coercivity on packing fraction was not observed. This is attributed to a clustering of the grains in the samples and changes in grain shape with composition. In all samples, regardless of dilution, the initial magnetic state after thermal demagnetization was found to be one in which a substantial proportion of grains were in a multidomain state. However, micromagnetic simulations for isolated particles of similar shape to those in the most dilute sample showed that the single domain state is the lowest energy state. It is concluded that thermal demagnetization can result in the system remaining in a local metastable state and not the global energy minimum. Micromagnetic calculations showed that one or more domain walls can arise in a grain during thermal demagnetization and that magnetostatic effects provide a significant energy barrier in zero field to the removal of a domain wall once it is formed...|$|R
