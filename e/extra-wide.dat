As a result, the station has an <b>extra-wide</b> southbound platform, the longest escalators on the Underground network and the fourth-longest escalators in Western Europe. It is a candidate station on the proposed Crossrail 2 line from north Surrey and south-west London to south-east Hertfordshire.|$|E

25|$|MD 201 {{begins at}} the District of Columbia {{boundary}} near Cheverly as Kenilworth Avenue, which continues into Washington as DC 295. The six-lane freeway enters Maryland by passing under Eastern Avenue, which has an <b>extra-wide</b> bridge over the freeway. MD 201 heads north paralleled by unsigned MD 965 (Kenilworth Avenue), a one-way service road to and from Eastern Avenue that parallels the freeway along a horseshoe path; there are ramps from MD 965 to northbound MD 201 and from southbound MD 201 to MD 965. The freeway crosses over MD 965 and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and enters the Kenilworth Interchange, which connects MD 201, US 50 (John Hanson Highway), the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295), and MD 459, which is also named Kenilworth Avenue. Just north of MD 201's bridges over US 50, two-lane ramps split from MD 201 to join the BaltimoreWashington Parkway. MD 201 becomes a non-freeway four-lane divided highway and has ramps to and from MD 459, which is used for access from northbound MD 201 to westbound US 50 and from westbound US 50 to northbound MD 201.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} {{protection}} {{provided by the}} reinforced concrete base, {{a number of other}} safety features were included in the building's design, so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack. Like 7 World Trade Center, the building has [...] thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells, elevator shafts, risers, and sprinkler systems. There are also <b>extra-wide,</b> pressurized stairwells, along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters, and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system. In comparison, the original Twin Towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions, protected only by lightweight drywall panels.|$|E

2500|$|The Electra, {{along with}} all other 1959 Buicks, {{featured}} all new styling not shared with other GM divisions that included slanted headlights in front along with a highly chromed square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and [...] "Delta-Fins" [...] back along with round taillights. The [...] "slanted" [...] headlights were also shared with the 1958-60 Lincoln Continental. Exterior distinction from other Buicks came from <b>extra-wide</b> moldings, with a massive Electra emblem on the front fender extension. The Electra 225 script {{was found on the}} front fenders ahead of the wheelhouse. The 4-door models had a lower bright rear fender molding as well.|$|E
2500|$|One {{method for}} {{reducing}} potential friction between cyclists and motorized vehicles {{is to provide}} [...] "wide kerb", or [...] "nearside", lanes (UK terminology) or [...] "wide outside through lane" [...] (U.S. terminology). These <b>extra-wide</b> lanes increase the probability that motorists pass cyclists {{at a safe distance}} without having to change lanes. This is held to be particularly important on routes with a high proportion of wide vehicles such as buses or heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). They also provide more room for cyclists to filter past queues of cars in congested conditions and to safely overtake each other. Due to the tendency of all vehicle users to stay in the center of their lane, it would be necessary to sub-divide the cycle lane with a broken white line to facilitate safe overtaking. Overtaking is indispensable for cyclists, as speeds are not dependent on the legal speed limit, but on the rider's capability.The use of such lanes is specifically endorsed by Cycling: the way ahead for towns and cities, the European Commission policy document on cycle promotion. The UK Cyclists Touring Club argues for a marked lane width of 4.25m (14ft). It is argued that, on undivided roads, this width provides cyclists with adequate clearance from passing wide vehicles while being sufficiently narrow to deter motorists from attempting to [...] "double up" [...] and form two lanes. This [...] "doubling up" [...] effect may be related to junctions. At non-junction locations, greater width might be preferable if this effect can be avoided.|$|E
