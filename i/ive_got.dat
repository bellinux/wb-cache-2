5000|$|Charles <b>Ives</b> <b>got</b> {{the idea}} to write a holiday symphony {{during the summer of}} 1905. He wanted to write each {{movement}} as if it were based on a grown man’s memory of his childhood holidays. “Here are melodies like icons, resonating with memory and history, with war, childhood, community, and nation.” Ives constructed these movements based on personal memories from his past, including his father, George Ives, and the town of Danbury. His father had a huge impact on Ives’s compositions, especially after he died in November 1894. Ives lived in Danbury throughout his childhood, a town which holds many of the life experiences that inspired him to compose a Holiday Symphony.|$|R
60|$|At half-past eight <b>Ives</b> <b>got</b> into {{a cab and}} {{was driven}} to a number {{in one of the}} correct West Seventies. His card {{admitted}} him to the reception room of an old-fashioned house into which the spirits of Fortune, Chance and Adventure had never dared to enter. On the walls were the Whistler etchings, the steel engravings by Oh-what's-his-name?, the still-life paintings of the grapes and garden truck with the watermelon seeds spilled on the table as natural as life, and the Greuze head. It was a household. There was even brass andirons. On a table was an album, half-morocco, with oxidized-silver protections on the corners of the lids. A clock on the mantel ticked loudly, with a warning click at five minutes to nine. Ives looked at it curiously, remembering a time-piece in his grandmother's home that gave such a warning.|$|R
5000|$|During the offseason, Roh gained 20 {{pounds to}} {{increase}} his weight to 251 pounds. In an interview with ESPN.coms Adam Rittenberg, Roh described himself as [...] "tiny" [...] among Big Ten defensive linemen. Accordingly, he spent the offseason bulking up {{in the weight room}} and [...] "followed a diet most people would dream about: six meals and more than 4,000 calories a day." [...] Roh told Rittenberg, [...] "I have crazy metabolism, and putting on weight was tough for me. Its something <b>Ive</b> really <b>got</b> to concentrate on. Some meals, youre like, I really dont want to eat this right now, but you have to." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{started out}} playing {{clarinet}} and, I think when I was younger, {{a lot of}} my influences were horn players - like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, or John Gillmore, who played with Sun Ra," [...] Grasshopper explained in 2001. [...] "Then as I started playing more and more guitar, as a kid I liked laughs The Allman Brothers and Neil Youngs guitar playing. Then I got into, obviously, Sterling Morrison of The Velvet Underground, and Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd - I love that stuff. I like Robert Quine, who played with Richard Hell, and Lou Reed. <b>Ive</b> also <b>got</b> some jazz and punk rock influences, but Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd the big ones." ...|$|R

50|$|Rachel Stamp {{were formed}} in 1994 when David Ryder Prangley met Will Crewdson before {{recruiting}} Cliff Harris and Mike Rowe. The band signed to WEA Records, but were dropped without releasing the album they had recorded for the label. Their debut album Hymns For Strange Children {{was recorded in}} two weeks with John Fryer (HIM, Nine Inch Nails, White Zombie) as record producer, and upon its release went {{to the top of}} the NMEs Independent Chart. The band next signed to Pure Stirling Records, who released their second album Oceans Of Venus in the UK. It was subsequently released in the US by Captiva Records, and in Germany through Sony Music. The band was inactive for a few years despite never officially splitting up, and reformed in 2009, initially to support their best of compilation album, Now Im Nailed To Your Bedroom Wall, <b>Ive</b> Only <b>Got</b> Myself To Blame. This was followed by a short UK tour in late 2009.|$|R
6000|$|DORA. Oh, {{everybody}} {{calls me}} Darling: it's {{a sort of}} name <b>Ive</b> <b>got.</b> Darling Dora, you know. Well, he says, [...] "Darling, {{if you can get}} Holy Joe to sprint a hundred yards, I'll stand you that squiffer with the gold keys." ...|$|E

60|$|HYPATIA. Well, {{what else}} can you call him? If I'd been deaf or he'd been dumb, I could have married him. But living with father, <b>Ive</b> <b>got</b> {{accustomed}} to cleverness. Jerry would drive me mad: you know very well hes a fool: even Johnny thinks him a fool.|$|E
5000|$|Jim Walker (2001): “Once {{during a}} break I stayed on my kit, you know, fooling around, when {{suddenly}} Keith jumped up and shouted to me to repeat {{whatever it was that}} Id been playing. It was just some hi-hat thing. Id always focused on developing my left hand side, in other words my hi-hat side. Anyway, I repeated it. Wobble instinctively came up with the perfect bassline part. Then Keith, who had heard exactly what he wanted through the thing Id started, played the most blistering guitar part I think I ever heard him play. That was how PIL wrote: through the subconscious. That song ended up being named You Stupid Person. It was meant to be our second single. ... It was actually a lot better than Public Image. It would have been impossible to keep from being a number one hit, and probably would have broke us in America all by itself. We managed to demo it, <b>Ive</b> still <b>got</b> a copy.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Martyn Williams {{remained}} {{in the dressing room}} for 90 minutes after the game, and when he emerged opted not to speak to the media. He later did give his reaction, expressing his opinion that the format {{was a bit of a}} lottery and observed [...] "somebody was going to miss - <b>Ive</b> just <b>got</b> to live with the fact that it was me." [...] He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him. Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick, as Williams miss meant that in the event Crane also missed, the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue. Tom James who had missed a kick earlier in the shoot-out which would have won the match for Cardiff said that [...] "gutted is the only word that properly describes how I am feeling".|$|R
5000|$|The {{founder of}} The New Yorker Harold Ross told his friend, author Irwin Shaw: [...] "I dont think <b>Ive</b> ever <b>got</b> as much {{satisfaction}} out {{of anything else}} in my life." [...] But The New Yorkers publication of Herseys article caused trouble with respect to Herseys relationship with Henry Luce, the co-founder of Time-Life and Herseys first mentor, who felt Hersey should have reported the event for one of Luces magazines instead. Despite Luces misgivings about Herseys choice of The New Yorker to print the Hiroshima story, the magazines format and style allowed the author much more freedom in reporting and writing. The Luce publications - Time, Life and Fortune - had nothing similar. Moreover, The New Yorker went to unprecedented lengths to keep the Hersey story secret. The weekly magazines top editors observed complete secrecy about the printing of the article. While editors Harold Ross and William Shawn spent long hours editing and deliberating every sentence, the magazines staff was not told anything about the forthcoming issue. Staffers were baffled when the normal weekly proofs were not returned, and their inquiries were not answered. Even the advertisement department was deliberately not informed.|$|R
