Theroux asks Fred Phelps, [...] "Isn't it an act of presumption, when you don't have all the information about all the other churches, to assume you have privileged access to Grace?"; Phelps responds, [...] "Oh, I know all {{there is to know about}} 'em." [...] When Theroux asks him how <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this,</b> Phelps answers, [...] "I'm not going to keep on talking to you. I know what you are. [...] you're an evil. [...] I don't even wanna go there. Good luck to ya!" ...|$|E

In the far future, River Song, {{recently}} made a Doctor of Archaeology, reviews eyewitness accounts made by those children when they were adults, and also notes the date and location of the Doctor's death. She is interrupted by Madame Kovarian and agents of the Silence. [...] Kovarian tells River that she is still theirs, and will be the one to kill the Doctor. Against River's will, they place her in an augmented astronaut's suit and submerge her in Lake Silencio to await the Doctor.|$|E

2500|$|Snape's role in {{the fourth}} novel, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, is not {{substantially}} {{different from that of}} the previous three books. He is apoplectic when Harry is unexpectedly entered into the Triwizard Tournament. Later Harry accidentally falls into Dumbledore's Pensieve and views memories of several Death Eater trials from years before. At one point, Snape is named as a Death Eater by Igor Karkaroff, but Dumbledore comes to Snape's defence, claiming that although Snape had indeed been a Death Eater, he changed sides before Voldemort's downfall and turned spy against him. Later, Dumbledore assures Harry that Snape's reformation is genuine, though he refuses to tell Harry how <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this,</b> saying the information [...] "is a matter between Professor Snape and myself".|$|E
2500|$|The third {{episode of}} Losts fifth season, [...] "Jughead," [...] {{reveals that the}} United States {{military}} brought a hydrogen bomb called Jughead to the island in 1954; the military troops {{were killed by the}} Others and the bomb was seized. A time-traveling Daniel Faraday convinces the Others that he is part of a military science team sent to defuse the bomb, which is leaking radioactive material, but eventually confides to one of their members that the bomb must be buried underground after being sealed with lead or concrete, explaining that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> will work because the island is still intact 50 years later, having never been destroyed in a nuclear blast. However, in 1977, the bomb was used in an attempt to stop the Incident, in the hope of changing the future.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{continues}} to demonstrate psychic abilities and superhuman intelligence, {{coupled with a}} childlike naïveté. [...] When Harshaw tries to explain religion to him, Smith understands the concept of God only as [...] "one who groks", which includes every extant organism. This leads him to express the Martian concept of life as the phrase [...] "Thou art God", although <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> is a bad translation. Many other human concepts such as war, clothing, and jealousy are strange to him, while {{the idea of an}} afterlife is a fact he takes for granted because Martian society is directed by [...] "Old Ones", the spirits of Martians who have [...] "discorporated". It is also customary for loved ones and friends to eat the bodies of the dead, in a rite similar to Holy Communion. Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no applicability to a planet already inhabited by intelligent life.|$|E

2500|$|Eve and Fred {{arrive with}} Mrs. Van Brugh, {{and the young}} couple {{go out to the}} garden together. Mrs. Van Brugh confesses to Smailey that she {{believes}} that a flaw in the will may have left her penniless. Smailey reveals that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> and accuses her of being part of wilful bigamy with her [...] "husband", as his first wife died after Mrs. Van Brugh married him. She tearfully confesses that she had never married him, but merely lived with him as his wife. Smailey is shocked at this and leaps to the attack, insisting, despite her pleas for mercy, that he [...] "will spare her nothing" [...] and that she must confess all, even to her own daughter. She pleads with him, offering to sign any deed he asks, to spare her the shame, but he holds a public announcement of her acts over her head if she does not submit to his will. She pleads further, holding up all her good deeds as evidence of her atonement. Smailey retorts that all her good works spring from her desire for forgiveness and taunts her with her previous criticisms of his own hard-heartedness. She cries [...] "enough", and, rallying, takes the shame onto herself in her own terms: [...] "So let it be. You are strong – for you have the world on your side. I am weak – for I am alone. If I am to die this moral death, it shall be by my own hand." [...] She calls everyone to her, asks Eve to kiss her once more before the truth is revealed, then confesses all. Eve faints into Ted's arms. Ruth recoils, and Smailey and Fred watch, emotionless.|$|E
2500|$|Two other novelists {{should be}} mentioned, for they, like Fielding and Richardson, were in {{dialogue}} through their works. [...] Laurence Sterne's and Tobias Smollett's works offered up oppositional {{views of the}} self in society and the method of the novel. The clergyman Laurence Sterne consciously set out to imitate Jonathan Swift with his Tristram Shandy (17591767). Tristram seeks to write his autobiography, but like Swift's narrator in A Tale of a Tub, he worries that nothing in his life can be understood without understanding its context. [...] For example, he tells the reader that {{at the very moment}} he was conceived, his mother was saying, [...] "Did you wind the clock?" [...] To clarify how <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this,</b> he explains that his father took care of winding the clock and [...] "other family business" [...] on one day a month. [...] To explain why the clock had to be wound then, he has to explain his father. [...] In other words, the biography moves backward rather than forward in time, only to then jump forward years, hit another knot, and move backward again. [...] It is a novel of exceptional energy, of multi-layered digressions, of multiple satires, and of frequent parodies. Journalist, translator, and historian Tobias Smollett, on the other hand, wrote more seemingly traditional novels. [...] He concentrated on the picaresque novel, where a low-born character would go through a practically endless series of adventures. Sterne thought that Smollett's novels always paid undue attention to the basest and most common elements of life, that they emphasized the dirt. [...] Although this is a superficial complaint, it points to an important difference between the two as authors. [...] Sterne came to the novel from a satirical background, while Smollett approached it from journalism. [...] In the 19th century, novelists would have plots much nearer to Smollett's than either Fielding's or Sterne's or Richardson's, and his sprawling, linear development of action would prove most successful.|$|E

60|$|There are few animals which {{prove this}} {{assertion}} {{more frequently than}} the stag. As his home is generally somewhere near the abodes of men, and as his flesh is so highly prized by them, it is absolutely necessary that he should take every possible precaution to preserve his life from their guns and dogs. Accordingly, he has devised a great many plans by which he endeavors--often successfully--to circumvent his hunters. And to do this certainly requires reflection, {{and a good deal}} of it, too. He even finds out that his scent assists the dogs in following him. How <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> I have not the slightest idea, but he does know it.|$|E

There are those three eldest, little better than squireens, never doing a thing but loafing about with their guns.

60|$|The North American Indian has no {{religion}} {{worthy of}} the name; {{but he has a}} conscience, like other men, which tells him that it is wrong to murder and to steal. Yet, although <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>this,</b> he seldom hesitates to do both when he is tempted thereto. Mr Wilson was one of those earnest missionaries who go to that wilderness and face its dangers, as well as its hardships and sufferings, for the sake of teaching the savage that the mere knowledge of right and wrong is not enough--that the love of God, wrought in the heart of man by the Holy Spirit, alone can enable him to resist evil and do good--that belief in the Lord Jesus Christ alone can save the soul.|$|E
