5000|$|In 1961, the Chicago Auto Show {{moved from}} the International Amphitheatre to the {{original}} McCormick Place. The latter facility was destroyed by fire just a month prior to the 1967 show, so the International Amphitheatre resumed its role as the Chicago Auto Show's venue between 1967 and 1970. The show returned to McCormick Place in 1971, when a replacement building was constructed at the site. Additional expansions to McCormick Place {{toward the end of}} the 20th century allowed the Chicago Auto Show to become the largest auto show in the United States. The event currently encompasses more than 1 million square feet in the North and South exhibit halls of McCormick Place. [...] Due to the vast amount of space available, several auto manufacturers have implemented creative uses of their exhibit space in recent years. For example, FCA US, Toyota, and Mercedes-Benz have all configured <b>indoor</b> <b>test</b> <b>track</b> experiences adjacent to their respective vehicle displays.|$|E
40|$|Made {{available}} {{here with}} {{permission of the}} publisher, Baywood Publishing Company. This paper addresses wayfinding and orientation by visually impaired people. First, the characteristics of visually impaired people and several common orientation and mobility strategies are reviewed. Then, two research studies are discussed: In Study I an <b>indoor</b> <b>test</b> <b>track</b> was developed to explore what qualities of paving materials make them detectable by long cane users. Twenty-four visually impaired people were tested. It {{was found that the}} noise the cane made when it struck the surface was the best predictor of detectability. Study II was a field study in which sixteen subjects traversed a one-half mile (800 m) test route both before and after various countermeasures were added. It was found that six countermeasures improved the subjects' performances: wooden shoreline, tweeter, metal plates, wooden plate, rubber mats and carpet mats. Several problems and solutions are proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{precision}} test of {{an infrared}} search and track system usually need field trial. It’s unsuitable for short-distance and <b>indoor</b> <b>test.</b> This paper presents an <b>indoor</b> <b>test</b> technique for infrared search and <b>track</b> precision. The <b>indoor</b> <b>test</b> system {{design and implementation}} are described in detail. The experimental results and analysis are provided. The movement of the small target dial was driven by a high-precision stepper motor in this system. A blackbody was used to simulate the radiation of targets. Controlling Computer connects to the stepper motor via RS- 232 serial port. The software interface written by Visual Basic sets the stepper motor’s running speed, direction and the operating angle value. The target’s track coordinate is translated into azimuth and elevation angles through the algorithm of angle measurement. Then the value recorded by the <b>tested</b> search and <b>track</b> system compare to the theoretical value given by the test system. The search and track precision are analyzed and test...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a validation method for <b>indoor</b> <b>testing</b> of a passenger car suspension. A study {{was done to}} design a supporting modular structure with comparable inertances {{with respect to a}} vehicle's actual suspension and body connection points. For the <b>indoor</b> <b>test,</b> the rear axle is positioned on a rotating drum. The suspension system is excited as the wheel passes over cleats fixed on the drum and transient wheel motions are recorded. The <b>indoor</b> <b>test</b> rig outputs (i. e., wheel and chassis accelerations) were compared with experimental data measured on an actual vehicle running at different speeds on the same set of cleats along a flat road. The comparison results validate the <b>indoor</b> <b>testing</b> method. The forces and moments acting at each suspension and chassis connection point were measured with a set of patented six-axis load cells. The forces, moments, wheel and subframe accelerations were measured up to 120 Hz. This study yielded a set of performance indexes by analyzing the forces and acceleration measured on the suspension system (the force measure is possible only on the <b>indoor</b> <b>test</b> rig). The influence of the running conditions and suspension settings on the indexes for vibration behaviour of the tire and suspension system was assessed and a global sensitivity analysis has been completed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAim of {{the present}} study was to develop an {{integrated}} protocol consisting on drum <b>indoor</b> <b>tests</b> and road outdoor tests to quantify the compression of the cyclist perineal zone. During <b>indoor</b> <b>tests</b> 5 cyclists performed 3 trials with different shorts on a cycling drum simulator: the pressure distribution between the saddle and the bottom of the cyclist, and the 3 D pelvic motion were synchronously recorded. In the outdoor tests three of the five cyclists performed 5 trials for each shorts at the same speed and cadence of the <b>indoor</b> <b>tests</b> on a flat tarmac road including three potholes in each trial. Finally the pads were mechanically tested with a cyclic fatigue test. Results allowed to have more precise information about the pressure distribution acting on the perineal area in different conditions and to define significant loading cycles for the fatigue testing of the shorts padding material...|$|R
40|$|Mounted police horses have to {{cope with}} challenging, {{unpredictable}} situations when on duty and it is essential to gain insight into how these horses handle stress to warrant their welfare. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate physiological and behavioral responses of 12 (six experienced and six inexperienced) police horses during police training. Horses were evaluated during four test settings at three time points over a 7 -week period: outdoor <b>track</b> <b>test,</b> street <b>track</b> <b>test,</b> <b>indoor</b> arena <b>test</b> and smoke machine test. Heart rate (HR; beats/min), HR variability (HRV; root means square of successive differences; ms), behavior score (BS; scores 0 to 5) and standard police performance score (PPS; scores 1 to 0) were obtained per test. All data were statistically evaluated using a linear mixed model (Akaike's Information criterium; t > 2. 00) or logistic regression (P < 0. 05). HR of horses was increased at <b>indoor</b> arena <b>test</b> (98 ± 26) and smoke machine test (107 ± 25) compared with outdoor track (80 ± 12, t = 2. 83 and t = 3. 91, respectively) and street <b>track</b> <b>tests</b> (81 ± 14, t = 2. 48 and t = 3. 52, respectively). HRV of horses at the <b>indoor</b> arena <b>test</b> (42. 4 ± 50. 2) was significantly lower compared with street <b>track</b> <b>test</b> (85. 7 ± 94. 3 and t = 2. 78). BS did not show significant differences between tests and HR of horses was not always correlated with the observed moderate behavioral responses. HR, HRV, PPS and BS did not differ between repetition of tests and there were no significant differences in any of the four tests between experienced and inexperienced horses. No habituation occurred during the test weeks, and experience as a police horse does not seem to be a key factor in how these horses handle stress. All horses showed only modest behavioral responses, and HR may provide complimentary information for individual evaluation and welfare assessment of these horses. Overall, little evidence of stress was observed during these police training tests. As three of these <b>tests</b> (excluding the <b>indoor</b> arena <b>test)</b> reflect normal police work, it is suggested that this kind of police work is not significantly stressful for horses and will have no negative impact on the horse's welfare...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a plug-in for the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol with the Expected Transmission Time (ETT) metric and experiments in an <b>indoor</b> <b>testbed.</b> The ETT metric is implemented as a plug-in, keeping portability and facilitating its deployment on operational networks. Our design identifies important implementation issues. Additionally, we run experiments in an <b>indoor</b> <b>testbed</b> to verify the performance of our ETT plug-in. Our results show that the ETT metric has the lowest packet loss rate and the lowest round trip time among the analyzed metrics, because it reproduces link quality conditions and also takes into account physical transmission rates.

40|$|The {{distributions}} of endosulfan (ED) residues (α-, β-isomers, and sulfate-metabolite) in cucumbers grown in soils treated with ED at concentrations of 20 and 40 mg kg- 1 were assessed using {{indoor and outdoor}} experiments. In all treatments, degradation rates of the α-isomer in soils were {{higher than that of}} the β-isomer. In the <b>indoor</b> <b>tests,</b> uptake amounts of total ED by cucumbers, after 15 d of growth, were 7. 8 and 14. 5 mg kg- 1 in 20 and 40 mg kg- 1 -treated pots, respectively. For growth time from 15 to 30 d, uptake amounts in 20 and 40 mg kg- 1 -treated pots were 3. 8 and 7. 9 mg kg- 1, respectively. Outdoor tests resulted in smaller ED residues in cucumbers than those in <b>indoor</b> <b>tests.</b> In both <b>indoor</b> and outdoor <b>tests,</b> ED residues absorbed were highest in roots, and the α-isomer was the more frequently absorbed isomer.
