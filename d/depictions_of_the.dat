5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dogs of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dogs surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above.|$|E
5|$|Mere <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> festival do not {{necessarily}} imply a long reign; for example, a relief showing pharaoh Sahure in the tunic of the Sed festival was found in his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest Sahure ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.|$|E

25|$|In 1902 <b>the</b> heraldic <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Imperial Crown was {{standardised}} to the (symbolic) Tudor Crown. Following 1953, {{this was}} {{switched to a}} <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual St. Edward's Crown.|$|R

5|$|An {{engraving}} by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck from 1727 {{is one of}} {{the earliest}} <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle, with later depictions from antiquarian William Close (1805), artist William Green (1809), and Edwin Waugh (1860). The Buck brother’s engraving showed the castle in a state of ruin, and Waugh's depiction in particular shows that from the mid-19th century the castle has remained in a similar state of ruin until the present.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Madonna, {{her head is}} {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Erens {{would use}} the film still of the pawnbroker, claimed by Mirsalis to be Lon Chaney, {{as an example of}} the common <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jews in her book The Jew in American Cinema. The film is now {{considered}} lost. It is unknown when the film was lost, but if it was in Universal's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E

5|$|The 15th-century cloisters {{have many}} small bosses ornamenting the vault. Two of these carvings {{in the west}} cloister, near the {{location}} of the gift shop and café, have been described as sheela na gigs, i. e. female figures displaying their genitals and variously considered to be associated with <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sin of lust or with ancient fertility cults.|$|E
5|$|The author Sylvia Townsend Warner cited Murray's {{work on the}} witch-cult as an {{influence}} on her 1926 novel Lolly Willowes, and sent a copy of her book to Murray in appreciation, with the two meeting for lunch shortly after. There was nevertheless some difference in their <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witch-cult; whereas Murray had depicted an organised pre-Christian cult, Warner depicted a vague family tradition that was explicitly Satanic.|$|E
5|$|The {{event was}} recounted in Dexter Masters' 1955 novel The Accident, a fictional {{account of the}} last few days of the life of a nuclear {{scientist}} suffering from radiation poisoning. <b>Depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criticality incident include the 1989 film Fat Man and Little Boy, in which John Cusack plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman based on Slotin, and the Louis Slotin Sonata, a 2001 off-Broadway play directed by David P. Moore.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains elements}} typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions. But {{in other respects}} it conforms to the then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. Typical of <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms he is as wide as he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.|$|E
5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E
5|$|Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency is a 2003 book by W. Thomas Smith, Jr. It is an encyclopedic {{work on the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), {{the only}} {{independent}} agency of the United States federal government that is tasked with intelligence-gathering. The work chronicles {{the history of the}} agency from its founding in 1947 through the War on Terror, which began after September 11, 2001. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in 2003. It provides approximately 550 entries across 282 pages on topics including notable contributors, intelligence operations, historical events, and <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CIA in fictional media.|$|E

5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{memorial}} stone was erected at Black River, Jamaica, near where Zong would have landed. A sailing ship representing Zong was sailed to Tower Bridge in London in March 2007 {{to commemorate the}} 200th anniversary of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, {{at a cost of}} £300,000. The vessel housed <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zong massacre and the slave trade. It was accompanied by HMS Northumberland, with an exhibition on board commemorating the role of the Royal Navy after 1807 in the suppression of the slave trade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E

5|$|It is salient to {{note that}} in {{taxonomy}} and binomial nomenclature, the genus name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is Progne, a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag Martins Ptyonoprogne, and Saw-wings Psalidoprocne. Coincidentally, {{although most of the}} <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nightingale and its song in art and literature are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the position of a tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
5|$|Mon Calamari Star Cruisers are starships in {{the fictional}} Star Wars universe. These starships were first {{depicted}} in Return of the Jedi {{as part of}} the Rebel Alliance fleet that attacks the second Death Star. Industrial Light and Magic designed the vessels to visually contrast the Imperial Star Destroyers. Various Mon Calamari cruisers also appear in literature and video games of the Star Wars expanded universe. Replicas, toys and other <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships have been released by several merchandise companies.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to <b>the</b> gestural painting <b>of</b> Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphical <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|R
