IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, explaining {{he enjoyed the}} [...] "classic Fringe" [...] opening scene, the [...] "decent [...] job" [...] by Ruck, and John Noble's performance; he also thought the script was [...] "very clever [...] it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks". Isler wasn't sure {{what to make of}} the Bell-Olivia plot twist however, commenting that [...] "this new William Bell thing is either going to end up as the best plot device of the season, or the cheesiest thing in recent sci-fi history".|$|E

60|$|Of course, in sailing from Geneva to {{the other}} end of the lake, we go from the west towards the east; and this renders it rather more {{agreeable}} to make the excursion by an afternoon boat than by a morning one; for in the afternoon, the sun, being then in the western part of the sky, will be behind you, and so will not shine in your face; but, instead of shining in your face and dazzling your eyes, it will be shining upon and illuminating brilliantly the slopes of the mountains that you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>In</b> other words, in the morning the mountains are in shadow and the sun in your eyes; in the evening your eyes are shaded, and the mountains glow with brilliancy and beauty.|$|E

60|$|Then I {{tried to}} get his mind away from the subject to more mundane things, so I {{produced}} supper, and made him share it with me, including {{the contents of the}} flask. After a little he braced up, and when I lit my cigar, having given him another, we smoked a full hour, and talked of many things. Little by little the comfort of his body stole over his mind, and I could see sleep laying her gentle hands on his eyelids. He felt it, too, and told me that now he felt all right, and I might safely leave him; but I told him that, right or wrong, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the daylight. So I lit my other candle, and began to read as he fell asleep.|$|E

Johnson compared working with Beyer on the comic to {{his work on the}} Star Trek: Countdown comic, a tie-in to the 2009 Star Trek film that he wrote with Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, saying that her position as a staff writer on the Discovery show [...] "means we have all the inside access that we need.

5000|$|On 15 January 2011, {{during the}} course of a {{television}} interview Ross announced that he would stand as candidate at the 2011 general election, running in the Dublin South constituency. He had refused an offer to run for the resurgent Fine Gael party and become an [...] "insignificant backbencher", and was determined instead to stand as an Independent candidate, declaring: [...] "I think you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> this election a huge number of similar independents who want to put an end to cronyism, who want to see a change in the political system, who want to put an end to Civil War politics in Ireland, who want to see an end to the kind of tribal politics we've got, who are going to stand in the election as well".In the general election campaign Fine Gael TD Alan Shatter attacked Ross, [...] saying the senator 'was a cheerleader for Sean FitzPatrick and Michael Fingleton' and had 'reserved his criticism of bankers for AIB and Bank of Ireland and celebrated the enormous profits earned by Anglo and Nationwide'. In the election Ross got the second highest vote in the country when he polled 17,075 votes in Dublin South to head the poll.|$|E
5000|$|On July 25, 2017, {{the creators}} {{confirmed}} that the series will now {{take place in the}} Seattle neighborhood of Hyperion Heights, which was supposedly created under a new and darker curse by Lady Tremaine, and this time around the cursed fictional characters now blend in with the real world, thus making it harder to find out who is among those from our world and who isn't. According to EP David H. Goodman, “We’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Hyperion Heights that the role Lady Tremaine has taken is very similar in terms of getting to the top, in terms of being a developer, who is this character, who is trying to push out the fairy tale characters who are living in Hyperion Heights, gentrifying the neighborhood, and bringing other people in,” with Horowitz adding “Hyperion Heights is part of Seattle the way Brooklyn is part of New York. It’s more densely populated and it’s filled with fairy tale characters and non-fairy tale characters and that’s another interaction and vibe that we didn’t really have in Storybrooke, where it was all the cursed people.” Kitsis also points out that “Lady Tremaine learned the lesson that Regina didn’t, which is don’t keep them all together where one day they can find themselves, push them the hell out! You push them the hell out and you gentrify the neighborhood and you bring in a cold press juicer and they can’t afford it anymore, then you won’t worry about the Pied Piper finding, you know, Alice.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were {{generally}} positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly praised guest actor Alan Ruck's [...] "sustained, understated" [...] performance, and also called Olivia being revealed as Bell's vessel [...] "a clever development," [...] especially praising actress Anna Torv's imitation of Nimoy's voice rather than [...] "doing the obvious thing and having her lip-synch Nimoy reading the lines." [...] The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that unlike Tucker, he thought the idea of [...] "soul magnets" [...] was [...] "just so goofy that it's almost {{too much for me}} to handle". VanDerWerff also felt there wasn't much of a connection between the episode and the ongoing storyline [...] "until the show tries to force one in a way that doesn't feel as elegant as the show usually makes this stuff feel". He did however praise Ruck as [...] "well-cast," [...] and wrote the episode [...] "very nearly managed" [...] to parallel Walter's [...] "desperate measures to the desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science," [...] which the reviewer considers the strongest asset of the show. [...] "There are a lot of great ideas, {{and there are a lot}} of terrible ones, but the show's consistent, rock solid execution keeps it from embarrassing itself too much. It's only as I sit down to write about it now that I realize how dangerously close this episode came to being utterly ridiculous. And to a degree, that's what's so great about Fringe this season: It walks the line between perfect and ridiculous so well and walks it with such a straight face that it almost deserves points just for trying."

40|$|Abstract. We propose {{steering}} behavior {{model to}} simulate virtual char-acters (NPC) which {{walk around in}} virtual exhibition environment and see exhibits one by one just like humans do. Steering behavior model of such environment has its significance in that it would raise the re-ality level of virtually recreated exhibition space such as museums or city area with points of attraction. However, currently available steering behavior models and techniques are improper to generate such behav-ior patterns. Our model is autonomous and individual–centric; virtual characters autonomously determine what exhibit they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> <b>in</b> what order, at which view point, and how long, based on their per-sonal preferences. We also describe the implementation of our model and provide the graphical results of simulations. ...|$|E
