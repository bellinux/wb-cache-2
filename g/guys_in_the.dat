Boonen, meanwhile, {{turned his attention to}} Paris–Roubaix the following week. Van Avermaet described himself as [...] "really disappointed" [...] following his crash, which ruled him out of Paris–Roubaix. Luke Rowe's fifth place was Team Sky's best ever performance in the Tour of Flanders; he praised Kwiatkowski's move, but said [...] "there’s not much you can do when someone has better legs"; he described Sagan, Cancellara and Vanmarcke as [...] "the three strongest <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race".

50|$|A {{particularly}} distinct {{feature of}} the main characters {{is the presence of}} a heavy, somewhat exaggerated Brabantian dialect, which is especially noticeable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> characters' pronunciation of 'jongen' (dude, <b>guy).</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> German synchronisation the actors voice themselves with a heavy Dutch accent.|$|R
500|$|In May 1958, the Browns traded Ford to the Green Bay Packers in {{exchange}} for a draft choice. [...] Green Bay coach Ray McLean said {{at the time that he}} acquired Ford for his talent at putting pressure on the quarterback and noted that [...] "he's one of the toughest <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league to block because of his speed, size and agility." [...] The 1958 Green Bay team won just one game in Ford's lone season there. Ford suffered multiple broken fingers before the last game of the 1958 season, and, because he was unable to play, the Packers refused to pay Ford the final $916.66 due on his contract.

[...] LaPlante emphasized Robinson's [...] "quickness":"One thing in football that you don't see in track is quickness. He's incredibly quick and his lateral movement is unbelievable and his ability to go in one direction and get in another. The perception people have is that's speed.

There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E

500|$|Anderson's strong {{performance}} in {{his rookie season}} helped him participate in a three-day tryout for the NBA's Indiana Pacers in June 2008. He expected {{to take part in}} the team's training camp, but a trade involving Jarrett Jack and T. J. Ford led him to never receive the invite. On August 9, 2008, Anderson signed a contract with AEK Larnaca B.C. of the Cyprus Basketball Division 1. He finished the season averaging 17.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 4.2 assists, with the second-most assists in the league and the most points. In an interview with SLAM Online, Anderson said, [...] "It was very good competition. It's just like when you see European <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NBA. There are a lot of skilled and crafty players, not overly athletic but very skilled." [...] He played against players such as Bradley Buckman while in Cyprus. After the season concluded, Eurobasket.com named Anderson 2nd Team All-Cyprus League.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "The Brothers Grimm looks terrific, yet it remains {{essentially}} inert. You keep {{waiting for something}} to happen, and after a while your mind wanders from the hollow frenzy up there with all its filigrees and fretwork." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle felt [...] "despite an appealing actor in each role, the entire cast comes across as repellent. Will and Jake Grimm are two <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods, surrounded by computerized animals, putting audiences to sleep all over America." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, largely enjoyed The Brothers Grimm. He explained that [...] "if you're a Gilliam junkie, as I am, you go with it, even when the script loses its shaky hold on coherence." [...] Travers added, [...] "even when Gilliam flies off the rails, his images stick with you." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday called the film [...] "a great compound of rip-snorting Gothic fantasy and Python-esque dark comedy".|$|E
500|$|Cole Waterman of PopMatters {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} eight out of ten, finding the record to be the group's [...] "most {{accessible}} by far". Waterman described the album's composition as [...] "catchy", finding {{it to be an}} appropriate response to the band's previous album Anonymous; he also highlighted the [...] "absurdist" [...] tone of the record's lyrics—pointing out [...] "South Paw" [...] and [...] "Waratorium" [...] as particular examples of this. Pitchfork Media's Paul Thompson scored Oddfellows 6.8 out of ten, considering it [...] "Tomahawk's most straightforward, stripped-down release to date". Thompson considered the group's main dynamic to consist of Denison's compositions and Patton's vocals, finding that bass player Dunn [...] "hangs back here, ably holding down the low end without overasserting himself". Thompson also debated the effect that the album's short germination period had on its overall composition, believing that the brief recording time lent the record [...] "a feeling that, whenever you get these <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same room, this music [...] just comes tearing out".|$|E
2500|$|Richard Cantarella and Robert Perrino spoke {{freely in}} his office about {{racketeering}} matters. He was also {{a close friend of}} Bonanno crime family capo Albert Embarrato.

500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.". [...] "The Regulator" [...] by Clutch was the song used as the closing title sequence.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 interview, Corey Taylor {{said that}} he only met Rubin four times during the entire {{recording}} process of Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses and that Rubin barely ever showed up to the studio: [...] "...we were being charged horrendous amounts of money. And for me, if you're going to produce something, you're fucking there. I don't care who you are." [...] He also added: [...] "He is overrated, he is overpaid, and I will never work with him again." [...] Conversely, Slipknot's guitarist Jim Root had said in that same interview that [...] "A lot of the <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band say Rick was unavailable. And yeah, he takes {{on a lot of}} projects at one time, but he also does things that are beneficial. He would listen to what we'd done, then have us retrack things that needed work. He's kind of like Big Brother up on the hill. Even though he wasn't there physically every day, he was. That's my favorite record we've done." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig {{spoke about}} the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that [...] "the great {{challenge}} is the destruction of Hogwarts.

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and the <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E
