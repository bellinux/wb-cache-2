5000|$|Rafael Yossef Herman (born 1974 in Be'er Sheva רפאל י. הרמן) is {{an artist}} {{best known for his}} {{breakthrough}} photography project Bereshit - Genesis. Recalling the Genesis Creation story, this photography research project, of Israeli desert Negev trees, marked {{for the first time in}} photography history, a nocturnes photos that looks like taken in day light, using just the [...] "moon-light", with no electronic or digital manipulation. The night, like never seen before, with monochromatic but full colored of its [...] "colors of the night". This lighted night, nearly divined, without shadow, creates a new surreal reality, one that our eye can not see and does not know. The Bereshit project was exposed for the first time to public in Dec. 2006, in Milano Italy, in the prestigious [...] "Sala delle Cariatidi" [...] of Palazzo Reale's museum of art. Bereshit photos, were one out of four fragments of Israel, that Rafael showed, under the title Magà. The exhibition attracted the attention of the public and media, and above all, of the Milan's assessor of culture, Vittorio Sgarbi, that wrote: [...] "...His images are mirror of Creation, beyond which there is no more to say, revelation that only conceives the contemplative dimension, mixing spirit, mystery and material. Like this Herman wins the darkness." [...] This occasion brought to Herman the invitation present the project to Pompidou Center, Paris. In November 2007, in a personal exhibition titled Bereshit, in Studio Guastalla, Rafael Y. Herman discovered by the prestigious art historian, writer and collector Arturo Schwarz that wrote on Herman's project [...] "...this black light, is the responsible of the intense poetical aura, of this photos serial...". Newspaper and Magazine titled the exhibition like; The Voice Of The Moon (Arte), Symbolic Research (Elle), The Trees Of Herman (TG), The Beginning Of All (Bolletino). During this exhibition period, Rafael lost his father Maxim (b. 1937 Bucharest d. 2007 19 Kislev [...] ) just before <b>finishing</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> documentary/romance book on his father's family story during the second world war.|$|E

60|$|Towards {{the end of}} July he went to Shanklin and there, in {{collaboration}} with Brown, <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> play, Otho the Great. Brown tells us how they used to sit, one {{on either side of}} a table, he sketching out the scenes and handing each one, as the outline was <b>finished,</b> <b>to</b> Keats <b>to</b> <b>write.</b> <b>As</b> Keats never knew what was coming it was quite impossible that the characters should be adequately conceived, or that the drama should be a united whole. Nevertheless there is much that is beautiful and promising in it. It should not be forgotten that Keats's 'greatest ambition' was, in his own words, 'the <b>writing</b> of <b>a</b> few fine plays'; and, with the increasing humanity and grasp which his poetry shows, {{there is no reason to}} suppose that, had he lived, he would not have fulfilled it.|$|R
40|$|This {{grant was}} {{to support the}} {{reduction}} and analysis of our approved SAX observation of the high redshift (z= 3. 2) blazar PKS 2126 - 158. This is the brightest quasar at z greater than 3 and has been intensively studied in X-ray, since the first Einstein detection. In 1994 Elvis et al., discovered a strong low energy cutoff in this object, which could imply either quasar frame photoelectric absorption by a column of 0. 8 - 2. 7 x 1 e 22 cm- 2 cold gas, or a lower column of cold gas at z= 0. Subsequent ASCA observations of this object, could not definitely address this issue, nor could establish whether the curvature of the low energy portion of the spectrum was due to pure photoelectric absorption (considerably exceeding the Galactic value {{along the line of}} sight) or to an intrinsic continuum curvature. We proposed to observe PKS 2126 - 158 with BeppoSAX, to try to solve this puzzle (thanks to the broadband of BeppoSAX: 0. 1 - 250 keV). PKS 2126 was observed by BeppoSAX on May 1999, with a MECS exposure of 100 ks. We have reduced and analyzed the BeppoSAX data, and compared them with a Chandra ACIS observation of the same object, taken only 6 months apart (Nov. 1999). We have recently <b>finished</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> paper on the BeppoSAX data only, that concentrate on the properties of the X-ray absorber, which is highly requested by our SAX data, independently on the continuum model adopted. The paper (P. I. F. Fiore) will be submitted to APJ in the next few days. A second paper on the combined BeppoSAX and Chandra data, and based on the broad band spectral energy distribution of this quasar, is currently in preparation. Our main results, on the X-ray absorber, are: (a) the presence of an X-ray absorber is confirmed, indipendently on the continuum adopted (simple power law, or curved continuum); (b) if the absorber is not significantly ionized, then the BeppoSAX data do prefer a low redshift absorber; (c) if the gas is ionized, then it can be located in the quasar environment, but its metal abundances must be lower than 0. 2 times solar (because of the absence of a strong FeK absorption edges that would follow at approx. 2 keV, where the MECS response is the highest) ...|$|R

2500|$|Cao Cao often praised Xun You and said, [...] "Gongda is {{intelligent}} but appears foolish; he is courageous but appears cowardly; he is resilient but appears weak. He neither flaunts {{his talents}} nor brags about his achievements. You {{can be as}} intelligent as him, but you can't pretend to be foolish {{as well as he}} does. Even Master Yan and Dou Wu cannot be compared to him." [...] When Cao Pi was still Cao Cao's heir apparent, his father told him, [...] "Xun Gongda is a role model for people. You should treat him courteously and respectfully." [...] When Xun You was ill, Cao Pi visited him and knelt down beside his bed; such was Cao Pi's level of respect for Xun You. Zhong Yao also once said, [...] "Every time I plan something, I'll carefully think through it again and again until I'm certain that I can't make any more changes. However, after consulting Gongda, he always has new insights to offer." [...] Xun You created 12 strategies for Zhong Yao. Zhong Yao died before he managed <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> book about the 12 strategies, hence some of them were lost. The historian Pei Songzhi thought it was a huge pity that Xun You's strategies were lost because Zhong Yao {{died at the age of}} 79 – some 16 years after Xun You's death – so he probably should have had ample time <b>to</b> <b>finish</b> <b>writing</b> the book.|$|R
