25|$|Positive {{experiences}} that had {{gained from the}} earlier Ariel experimental tip <b>jet</b> <b>helicopter</b> had given French aviation company Sud-Ouest {{a strong desire to}} pursue development of a practical light helicopter that would harness this technology. Out of their efforts towards this aim emerged the design of a light twin-seat rotorcraft, which was promptly designated as the S.O.1221 Djinn. While this newer design did not share an identical tip jet system to the Ariel, the type did rely upon the same basic concept of feeding compressed air, which was generated by an onboard pump, to the tips of the vehicle's rotor blades to drive the movement of the blades.|$|E

5000|$|Hasbro did {{not produce}} many {{vehicles}} for the early series G.I. Joe. The [...] "Five Star" [...] Jeep illustrated {{was one of the}} few offered, beginning in 1965. It was of sturdy construction, available with a trailer, in which the searchlight was mounted; an M40 105 mm recoilless rifle was mounted in the position occupied by the searchlight in the provided photographs. The Sears exclusive version of the jeep did not have the green rims, but was otherwise identical. There was also a sand colored variant sold as Desert Patrol. Hasbro also produced a Crash Crew Fire Truck. Hasbro granted a licence to Irwin in 1967 to manufacture seven vehicles; a small jet fighter, <b>jet</b> <b>helicopter,</b> motorcycle and side car (in a couple of color combinations), DUKW amphibious truck, armored car, personnel carrier with mine sweeper, and a German staff car. These were of the blow-mold variety, and suffered from lack of detail, disproportionate scaling, and longevity as a result of the cheaper production method.|$|E
5000|$|In the RAF, aircrew 'wings' {{are awarded}} upon the {{completion}} of a significant stage of flying training. Aircrew first undertake Elementary Flying Training, and are then streamed to either fast <b>jet,</b> <b>helicopter</b> or multi-engine pipelines. The award of wings usually occurs upon completion of the secondary phase of training; for example, in the fast jet stream, wings are awarded upon completion of the Basic Fast Jet Course (BJFT), currently at RAF Linton-on-Ouse; for helicopter pilots, wings are awarded after they complete helicopter training at RAF Shawbury pre-OCU, and for multi-engine aircrew, wings are awarded upon completion of their Multi-Engine Advanced Flying Training (MEAFT) training at RAF Cranwell. Aircrew therefore are posted to their Operational Conversion Units having gained their wings, but they still have a good deal of training and type familiarisation to complete before they are considered operational or front-line aircrew.Pilots wear the letters [...] "RAF" [...] in a brown wreath, surmounted by a crown, with a swift's wing on each side. UAV pilots have similar wings except with a light blue wreath. From April 2003, weapons systems officers/operators are awarded a similar brevet with a single wing. Other aircrew wear a letter or letters (denoting speciality) in a wreath, with a single wing. The only other brevets currently worn are [...] "E" [...] (air engineer), [...] "AT" [...] (airborne technician), [...] "IA" [...] (imagery analyst) and [...] "FC" [...] (fighter controller). Parachute Jumping Instructors (PJIs) wear an open parachute instead of a letter. [...] "AS" [...] (air steward) was replaced with a brevet with [...] "CC" [...] (cabin crew); this brevet is unusual for aircrew as it is worn on the right sleeve in the same location as parachute qualification, has two up turned wings (similar to Royal Navy ratings' aircrewman badges) and has cream stitching for the wings, lettering and laurels (other brevets have bronze or blue laurels).|$|E

40|$|Accurate data is {{important}} in the aviation planning process. In this project we consider systems for measuring aircraft activity at airports. This would include determining the type of aircraft such as <b>jet,</b> <b>helicopter,</b> single engine, and multiengine propeller. Some of the issues involved in deploying technologies for monitoring aircraft operations are cost, reliability, and accuracy. In addition, the system must be field portable and acceptable at airports. A comparison of technologies was conducted and it was decided that an aircraft monitoring system should be based upon acoustic technology. A multimedia relational database was established for the study. The information contained in the database consists of airport information, runway information, acoustic records, photographic records, a description of the event (takeoff, landing), aircraft type, and environmental information. We extracted features from the time signal and the frequency content of the signal. A multi-layer feed-forward neural network was chosen as the classifier. Training and testing results were obtained. We were able to obtain classification results of over 90 percent for training and testing for takeoff events...|$|E
