5|$|Temporary repairs began immediately, {{but due to}} {{the limited}} drydock space in the port, repairs to the hull were not {{effected}} until 11 September. Dunkerque was refloated on 27 September and her propulsion system was returned to operational status. A major <b>fire</b> <b>broke</b> <b>out</b> on 5 December, however, which slowed down the repair effort. Repair work lasted for the entirety of 1941, and on 25 January 1942 another <b>fire</b> <b>broke</b> <b>out.</b> The temporary repairs were completed by 19 February, which permitted the ship to depart Mers-el-Kébir, under heavy escort, bound for Toulon. She arrived the following day, and entered the large Vauban drydock for comprehensive repairs.|$|E

Smith and his partner narrowly escaped.|$|E
5|$|The Clifford family took {{possession}} of Brough after the Second Barons' War in the 1260s; they built Clifford's Tower and undertook {{a sequence of}} renovations to the castle, creating a fortification in a typical northern English style. In 1521, however, Henry Clifford held a Christmas feast at the castle, after which a major <b>fire</b> <b>broke</b> <b>out,</b> destroying the property. The castle remained abandoned until Lady Anne Clifford restored the property between 1659 and 1661, using {{it as one of}} her northern country homes. In 1666 another <b>fire</b> <b>broke</b> <b>out,</b> once again rendering the castle uninhabitable. Brough Castle went into sharp decline and was stripped first of its fittings and then its stonework. The castle's masonry began to collapse around 1800.|$|E

After a magazine explosion, the ship sank, with major loss of life. The wreck remains {{on the bottom of the}} Oslofjord.|$|E
5|$|A further <b>fire</b> <b>broke</b> <b>out</b> {{during the}} early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, {{so it would be}} better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, a <b>fire</b> <b>broke</b> <b>out</b> that {{destroyed}} over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted {{the need for}} proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated {{by the lack of}} political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.|$|E
