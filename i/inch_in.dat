5|$|In New York, Edouard {{produced}} strong {{waves and}} storm tides {{of one to}} twoft (0.3 to 0.6m), causing overwash along southern Long Island due to high tide. Coastal flooding occurred, including in Hampton Bays where the waves flooded one road and covered another with sand. The flooding trapped six cars, while the strong waves forced several beaches to close. Because the hurricane moved through the New York Shipping Channel, numerous ships reported winds of over hurricane status, though winds remained below tropical storm force on land. A boat capsized {{off the coast of}} Jones Beach Island, though its passengers were not injured. A Celebrity Cruises cruise ship, the MV_Zenith suffered damage from 30 to 50ft (nine to 15m) waves, injuring several passengers and crew members. Rainfall was minimal, peaking at less than a half of an <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> eastern Long Island.|$|E

25|$|Desirable actions such as enrolling {{children}} in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a form of aid known as conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families {{to stay at home}} rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.|$|E

25|$|Unintentional small jumps are {{ubiquitous}} to billiards. In most billiards shots, a player's cue {{is slightly}} elevated. Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, {{no matter how}} slight, occurs. An oft-used way to illustrate this principle is to lay a coin on the table approximately an <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> front of the cue ball. When shot very softly, the player will audibly hear the coin being struck and see the cue ball's reaction to that collision. When the same shot is performed {{with any degree of}} speed no sound or collision is evident, and {{it is clear that the}} coin is being jumped.|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} {{claimed a}} reported 1,335 lives and injured 199; {{although it is}} known that more perished than the official records show. The seven barangays that existed on the island previous to the eruption were completely wiped out. Post mortem examination of the victims seemed to show that practically all had died of scalding by hot steam or hot mud, or both. The devastating effects of the blast reached the west shore of the lake where a number of villages were also destroyed. Cattle to the number of 702 were killed and 543 nipa houses destroyed. Crops suffered from the deposit of ashes that fell to a depth of almost half an <b>inch</b> <b>in</b> places near the shore of the lake.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{clear-cut}} incision on the neck.

The cut was very clean and deviated only a little downwards. The arteries and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through. The cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial, and tailed off to about two inches below the right angle of the jaw. The deep vessels on that side were uninjured. From this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left cartoid artery.|$|E
