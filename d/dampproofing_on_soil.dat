40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine potentially differential effects of day and night warming <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> respiration in a temperate steppe in northern China. A full factorial design with day and night warming was used in this study, including control (C), day (6 a. m. – 6 p. m., local time; D) warming, night (6 p. m. – 6 a. m.; N) warming, and diurnal warming (W). Day warming showed neutral effect <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> respiration, whereas night warming significantly increased soil respiration by 7. 1 % over the first 3 growing seasons. The insignificant effect of day warming <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> respiration could be attributable to the offset of the direct positive effects by the indirect negative effects via aggravating water limitation and suppressing ecosystem C assimilation. The positive effects of night warming <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> respiration were largely due to the stimulation of ecosystem C uptake and substrate supply via over-compensation of plant photosynthesis. In addition, day and night warming showed antagonistic effects <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> respiration, which could be ascribed to their contrasting effects on ecosystem C assimilation. The results suggest differential and non-additive effects of day and night warming <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> respiration, which was driven by the treatment-induced changes in substrate supply...|$|R
30|$|Even though, the {{consequences}} of converting forest land to farmland and grazing are well known, the study of these effects <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> {{physical and chemical properties}} with an evaluation of soil fertility status in north central highlands of Ethiopia is less adequate.

40|$|Analyses {{of plant}} sap from organic {{greenhouse}} tomato crops {{show that the}} levels of phosphorus (P) are frequently low, {{despite the fact that}} soil analyses indicate P status in the soil to be good. In the present study, two soils (A and B) with a pH of just over 6 and a high total content of N and P were investigated with respect to release of P and uptake in a tomato crop. The fertilisers primarily used <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> A was silage and blood meal, and <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> B Vinasse and blood meal. An incubation experiment showed that the release of P per unit time was greater from soil A than soil B. This difference between the two soils may be due to lower soil organic matter concentration, with less P sorbed by Al and Fe <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> A, and a fertiliser regime which favours a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon in this soil. Tomato plants grown for 10 weeks in the soils had greater DW production, total uptake of P and concentration of P in the leaves <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> A than <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> B. Addition of citric acid to the soils in order to mobilise P increased plant yield and uptake of N and P <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> A. Despite the increased growth, the concentration of P in plant leaves increased and the N concentration was unchanged. <b>On</b> <b>soil</b> B addition of citric acid decreased Zn uptake in the tomato plants despite good availability, resulting in a lower concentration of this micronutrient in the leaves. The plants <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> A maintained their concentrations of all micronutrients analysed, but the ratio of P to micronutrients increased. Thus for commercial organic tomato growers, adding citric acid with the irrigation water offers a possibility to increase P availability...|$|R

The evaluation of ecological soil function is based on scoring {{of a set of}} soil quality indicators and computing a soil quality class for each remediation alternative. In order to evaluate the effects of remediation alternatives <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> functions, a soil quality class for each alternative is compared against the soil quality class in the reference alternative. By doing so, the SF Box tool provides a summary of the effects caused by remediation alternatives <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> functions, where the effects are scored between - 2 representing “very negative effect” and + 2 representing “very positive effect”.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{a review of the}} {{literature}} on the effects of no-ploughing <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> structure, porosity and stability. In the second part, we discuss the consequences <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> erosion in a temperate environment. The effect of reduced tillage <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> physical properties has firstly to be evaluated <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> structure. If carbon accumulation <b>on</b> the <b>soil</b> surface improves aggregate stability, no-ploughing also greatly affects soil porosity. Not only does it decrease during the period following adoption of no-ploughing, but it also changes in nature and connectivity due to weathering, roots and biological activity. However, the efficiency of these factors is site-dependent and varies with the duration of no-ploughing and the crop sequence. Under tropical climates, reduced tillage systems have been proposed to prevent soil erosion while in temperate areas the present increase of no-till is motivated firstly by the decrease of production and mechanization costs. However, the efficiency of the numerous no-plough tillage systems on erosion control is not systematic. The soil must be sufficiently covered by crop residues and the infiltration rate has to remain high enough. This note critically assesses the available results on these two aspects of the effect of reduced tillage <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> physics...|$|R

Digestate also has a long-term effect <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> fertility due to the interaction of its organic fraction with the biochemical dynamics of the soil (Saveyn and Eder 2014). After anaerobic digestion, digestate frequently undergoes separation into a solid fraction used as a manure substitute and a clarified fraction containing nitrogen as ammonia, a fast-acting nutrient for crops (Adubaker et al. 2012).|$|R

This species aestivates deep in the soil during the dry season. Fibre glass netting was used to prevent colonisation of the top soil {{at the onset of}} the humid season. Effects of earthworm absence <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> properties and plant biomass were analysed with principal component analysis. Experimental manipulation succeeded in preventing #M. carimaguensis$ activity in the top soil. The larger part of the variance in our data (29. 35 %) was explained by the effect of pasture type and age <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> structure and organic matter. A lesser part (10. 81 %) was due to the effect of legumes <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> physical properties. The effect of earthworm absence <b>on</b> <b>soil</b> properties and plant growth explained 16. 50 % of the total variance. #M. carimaguensis$ biomass was associated with low soil compaction, high C contents, low Al saturation, high herbaceous biomass and low weed biomass.
