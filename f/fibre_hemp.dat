The aim {{of this study was to}} screen the hygienic quality, determined as microbial content, of mechanically fractionated <b>fibre</b> <b>hemp</b> and linseed plants harvested in the autumn before frost, after early frost and in spring. In addition, the possible correlation between microbes and ash was investigated. Two plant species, <b>fibre</b> <b>hemp</b> and linseed were studied. The plants were cultivated in Siuntio in southern Finland during the years 2002 and 2003, harvested in autumn or in spring and mechanically fractionated. The microbial contents of the fractions were examined by measuring the total number of microbes using Hygicult® growing slides. The microbial content of fractions of <b>fibre</b> <b>hemp</b> and linseed varied between 103 and 109 cfu/gdw. The fibre of hemp harvested after early frost or in spring had the lowest amount of moulds, but during winter and spring the amounts of bacteria and yeasts increased in hemp. Mechanically separated fibre and shive contained less microbes than the stalk. Ash contents of all examined samples of stems and stem fractions varied between 1 % and 14 %. The fibre after fractionating had a lower ash content (2. 33. 3 %) than that of stems (4. 46. 9 %) harvested in the autumn. The ash content of stem and shive decreased to 1. 6 % during winter, the ash content of fibre being even somewhat lower (0. 9 %).

Westerhuis, W. (2016) Hemp for textiles: plant size matters, PhD thesis. Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands, 234 pp. With English and Dutch summaries.   <b>Fibre</b> <b>hemp</b> (Cannabis sativa L.) {{may be an}} alternative to cotton and synthetic fibres as a raw material for textile yarn production in the European Union. The agronomic options to manipulate plant development and crop growth with the aim to optimise hemp long fibre production were investigated. Field trials with factors sowing density, sowing date, harvest time and variety were conducted. Stems were traditionally processed by retting, drying, breaking, and scutching. Following standard protocols, almost 1500 hemp stem samples were analysed. Varieties differ widely in their fibre content, but this thesis shows that when variety and plant size are known, the amounts of fibres, wood, and retting losses are known. The dry weight of the stems at harvest, not the factors underlying this weight, are determinant. In retted stems the dry matter is split–up into fibres and wood in a fixed way. The options to manipulate this ratio by crop management, given variety, are very small and for practical reasons they can be neglected. In <b>fibre</b> <b>hemp</b> two bast fibre types occur. Primary or long fibres are valuable for yarn spinning. Secondary fibres are too short and their presence hampers the production of fine yarns. This thesis shows that the secondary fibre front height increases with plant weight. Although a causal relationship between secondary fibre formation and flowering does not exist, the secondary fibre front is found higher in flowering plants when compared to non–flowering plants of the same height. This {{is likely to be}} caused by the higher weight or momentum of flowering plants as compared with non–flowering plants of the same height. Consequently, a harvest before flowering is preferable. This was shown in a greenhouse experiment, in which the short–day response of hemp was used to create size ranges of flowering and non–flowering plants. To produce high–quality raw materials for textile production, short crops should be grown. The options to produce plants with the desired size are manifold. Since sowing density, sowing date, and harvest time do not have an additional effect on the primary fibre content besides the indirect effect through stem weight, any combination of these factors could be chosen to optimize plant size.    ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The use {{of energy}} crops and {{agricultural}} residues {{is expected to}} increase to fulfil the legislative demands of bio-based components in transport fuels. Ensiling methods, adapted from the feed sector, are suitable storage methods to preserve fresh crops throughout the year for, for example, biogas production. Various preservation methods, namely ensiling with and without acid addition for whole crop maize, <b>fibre</b> <b>hemp</b> and faba bean were investigated. For the drier <b>fibre</b> <b>hemp,</b> alkaline urea treatment was studied as well. These treatments were also explored as mild pretreatment methods to improve the disassembly and hydrolysis of these lignocellulosic substrates. Results The investigated storage treatments increased the availability of the substrates for biogas production from hemp and in most cases from whole maize but not from faba bean. Ensiling of hemp, without or with addition of formic acid, increased methane production by more than 50 % compared to fresh hemp. Ensiling resulted in substantially increased methane yields also from maize, and the use of formic acid in ensiling of maize further enhanced methane yields by 16 %, as compared with fresh maize. Ensiled faba bean, in contrast, yielded somewhat less methane than the fresh material. Acidic additives preserved and even increased the amount of the valuable water-soluble carbohydrates during storage, which affected most significantly the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of maize. However, preservation without additives decreased the enzymatic hydrolysis yield especially in maize, due to its high content of soluble sugars that were already converted to acids during storage. Urea-based preservation significantly increased the enzymatic hydrolysability of hemp. Hemp, preserved with urea, produced the highest carbohydrate increase of 46 % in enzymatic hydrolysis as compared to the fresh material. Alkaline pretreatment conditions of hemp improved also the methane yields. Conclusions The results of the present work show that ensiling and alkaline preservation of fresh crop materials are useful pretreatment methods for methane production. Improvements in enzymatic hydrolysis were also promising. While all three crops still require a more powerful pretreatment to release the maximum amount of carbohydrates, anaerobic preservation is clearly a suitable storage and pretreatment method prior to production of platform sugars from fresh crops. </p...|$|E

The effect of crop management decisions such as cultivar choice, sowing date, plant density, and harvest date on the value of these parameters is discussed. A simple crop growth model was used to assess the yield potential of hemp for the climate of the Netherlands. Calculations made for a non-stressed late-flowering hemp crop sown on 15 April and harvested on 15 September give a stem dry matter yield of 17. 1 t ha- 1. The effects of advancing or delaying sowing or harvest date on stem yield were calculated. Crop physiological characteristics of hemp are compared to those of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.). Radiation use efficiency and dry matter partitioning coefficients of the two crops are similar. Base temperatures for development and growth are lower in hemp than in kenaf. In a temperate climate with cool springs, canopy establishment will be more rapid in hemp than in kenaf. Hemp seems an excellent candidate to fill the niche for an annual fibre crop in a temperate climate. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the possibility}} of <b>fibre</b> <b>hemp</b> shives (FHS) {{to be used as}} lightweight aggregate in composite with cement binding material. Cement and plant origin aggregates are hardly compatible, because water-soluble or alkaline environment soluble compounds inhibit cement hydration. To avoid harmful effect on cement hydration, it is necessary to mineralize FHS aggregates with complex mineralizer (which consists of Al 2 (SO 4) 3 and Ca(OH) 2) in order to minimize the impact of hydration retarders on cement hydration. Rational amount of super plasticizer for forming mixture is selected in accordance with viscosity of cement paste. Amount and ratio of mineralizer was selected according to kinetics of hydration temperature of forming mixture, compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). It was determined that the increase in the amount of mineralizer from 27 % to 54 % (estimated based on FHS mass) promotes the cement hydration, shortens the time needed to reach EXO maximum and increases its temperature, because the higher content of the Ca(OH) 2 participates in the process of dissolution and makes the EXO reaction faster. The highest acceleration of cement hydration in a composite sample is caused by optimum amount of component mineralizer which is 54 %. The lower content of component mineralizer did not completely bind sugar released from FHS, therefore, causing inhibition of cement hydration. Optimal amount and ratio of mineralizer allow obtaining the compressive strength after 28 days of curing of 8. 03 MPa as well as thermal conductivity of 0. 179 W/(m K). Microstructure analyses show that cement matrix with optimal amount of complex mineralizer is dense enough and well bonded with new monolithic hydration products...|$|E
