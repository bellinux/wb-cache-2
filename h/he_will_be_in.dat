5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a little help from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E

5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham blow up another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can blow up all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E

25|$|Socrates gets Hippias {{to agree}} that the more a man knows about a subject, the better {{position}} <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> to lie about it.

500|$|Ron Swanson {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation, where he repeatedly denies Leslie's requests to pursue turning a construction pit into a park {{because he does not}} believe the parks department should build parks at all.
