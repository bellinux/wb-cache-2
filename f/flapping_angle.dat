The {{lack of understanding}} the flight dynamics of gyroplanes during sideslip has been the trigger to start a flight test program in order to gather objective data. For this purpose DLR used an MTOsport gyroplane by AutoGyro GmbH – the D-MTOS. This lightweight gyroplane, which has an MTOW of 450 kg, is a two-seater tandem configuration driven by a Rotax 912 ULS engine with a propeller in pusher configuration. The D-MTOS has been equipped with a special Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) by messWERK GmbH. The design of the FTI has been optimized {{with respect to the}} limited space and payload of a small aircraft. This enabled the use of highly accurate sensors and an advanced real-time data-acquisition system that is usually used in larger aircraft. As only the pilot was on board, the system was set up to require a minimal workload. In order to deliver high-quality measurements of the airflow, a nose boom with a length of more than two meters has been installed. At its tip special vanes for measuring the Angle of Attack and sideslip were installed. Compared to fixed-wing aircraft, the measurement range of the airflow angle is a real chal-lenge as the Angle of Attack (AoA) reached values of up to 80 °. Static and dynamic pressures were measured to provide airspeed and altitude. Beside the control inputs and forces also the attitude and inertial data were measured. The measurement of the rotor blade <b>flapping</b> <b>angle</b> has been also a challenge. Two laser sensors were mounted {{at the top of the}} rotor mast, providing distance measurements that may be used to determine the blade <b>flapping</b> <b>angle</b> at two positions (forward and right hand side).

A {{number of cases}} were simulated in steady state to get {{an understanding of the}} interaction between the wing, the front wheels, the car body (monocoque) and the ground. Three different flap settings were simulated in three different heights in combinations with and without the following elements: Front wheels, monocoque, ground, front wing. The SST k-omega turbulence model was used with a polyhedral mesh. Chord Reynolds numbers were between 545 000 [...] 600 000. It was found that both the front wing operating isolated from other components and the wing operating in interaction with the front wheels and the monocoque responded with increased downforce in ground effect. Optimal ground height was dependent on flap setting: The mild configuration did not stall at any of the simulated heights, while the flaps on the aggressive configuration stalled close to the ground in the isolated case. Ground effect improved the downforce produced by the wing in free stream by up to 50. 7 %. Comparisons of the wing in mild and high downforce settings were done with and without the wheels. The wing-wheel interaction reduced the downforce produced in the mild <b>flap</b> <b>angle</b> setting by 20. 5 % by obstructing the flow, but increased the downforce of the high <b>flap</b> <b>angle</b> setting by 2. 2 % by introducing surface normal adverse pressure gradients, preventing boundary layer separation.

The monocoque caused increased velocity and suction {{on the bottom of the}} symmetric center section, thus reducing the 3 D effects across the span toward the high-downforce section.

Insects flap their wings in a complexmotion {{that enables them to}} generate several unsteady aerodynamicmechanisms, which are extremely beneficial for lift production. A flapping wing MAV that can reproduce these aerodynamic mechanisms in a controlled manner is likely to outperform alternative flight platforms such as rotary wing MAVs.

Unlike several existingflappingmechanisms (which are comparedusing an original classification method), the PCR mechanism has an integrated flapping and pitching output motion which is not constrained.

This application, which holds {{good for the}} full flight envelope control, {{is an extension of}} a backstepping algorithm for general rigid body velocity control. The nonlinear RUAV model used in this paper includes the flapping and servo dynamics. The backstepping-based controller takes advantage of the ‘decoupling ’ of the translation and rotation dynamics of the rigid body, resulting in a two-step procedure to obtain the RUAV control inputs. The first step is to compute desired thrusts and flapping angles to achieve the commanded position and the second step is to compute control inputs, which achieve the desired thrusts and flapping angles.
