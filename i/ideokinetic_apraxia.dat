Problems in the ability to comprehend or communicate with symbols, asymbolia, was first established by Finkelnburg. This idea of representational disturbance instead of disturbance in movement is still present in the current discussion of aphasia and BPO pantomimes. In 1905, Liepmann conducted a study of brain injured patients. He wrote of <b>ideokinetic</b> <b>apraxia,</b> the dissociation between the idea of movement of a real or imagined object and its implementation. Problems with gestures and pantomimes were considered to be a category of apraxia. He concluded that the control of effortful movements was in the left hemisphere and that aphasia could indicate lesions in the brain. Various other theories regarding gestural deficits of aphasics have been put forward since then, including intellectual degradation, and the inability to carry out pretended actions. Denny-Brown [...] takes a more holistic approach and suggested ideational apraxia results from diffuse brain damage.|$|E
40|$|One {{disturbance}} of motility in schizophrenia is the blocking of voluntary action, or ambitendency. Although the traditional {{explanation for this}} disorder is psychological, the documentation of psychomotor slowing in the literature suggests {{the possibility of a}} neurologic pathogenesis. It was hypothesized that disconnection between the ideatory and motor components of a voluntary action described as ambitendency is similar to the <b>ideokinetic</b> <b>apraxia</b> of disease of the left frontal cortex. It was also hypothesized that because of this presumed anatomical locus, manifestation of <b>ideokinetic</b> <b>apraxia</b> in schizophrenia would be correlated with corticomotor slowing of the dominant hand. To test these hypotheses, {{a modified version of the}} Motor Scale of the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Examination and the Finger Tapping Test of the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery were administered to 10 chronic undifferentiated schizophrenics, 10 paranoid schizophrenics, 10 patients with major depressive disorders, 10 patients with mixed personality disorders, and 10 normals. Both chronic schizophrenics and major depressives demonstrated a significant frequency of <b>ideokinetic</b> <b>apraxia</b> in comparison with the other groups. Age was found to correlate positively with <b>ideokinetic</b> <b>apraxia</b> in the depressives, suggesting that such symptoms may be an artifact of the aging process in these subjects. <b>Ideokinetic</b> <b>apraxia</b> was correlated with slowing of the dominant hand in the chronic schizophrenics, suggesting a neurologic rather than a psychologic basis for their blocking of voluntary action. No group demonstrated a significant incidence of ideational apraxia...|$|E
