30|$|The fifth {{generation}} (5 G) cellular {{infrastructure is}} envisaged as a dense and heterogeneous deployment of small cells overlapping with existing macrocells in the Radio Access Network (RAN). Densification and heterogeneity, however, pose new challenges such as dealing with interference, accommodating massive signaling traffic, and managing increased energy consumption. Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks (H-CRAN) {{emerges as a}} candidate architecture for a sustainable deployment of 5 G. In addition, the application of SDN concepts to wireless environments motivated recent research in the so-called Software-Defined Wireless Networking (SDWN). In this article, we discuss how SDWN can support {{the development of a}} flexible, programmable, and sustainable infrastructure for 5 G. We also present a case study based on SDWN to perform frequency assignment, <b>interference,</b> and <b>handover</b> control in an H-CRAN environment.

Therefore, the X 2 interface is more suitable to support the signaling exchange in our power adjustment strategy as the S 1 interface will enduce longer delays. In fact, power adjustments and several context information (i.e., RSS, SINR, …, etc) have to be periodically exchanged between the MBS and femtocell local REMs, and the delay imposed by the interface should be at a shorter timescale compared to this periodicity {{in order to allow}} a real-time response of the operations.|$|R

30|$|The fifth {{generation}} (5 G) wireless {{networks are}} required to satisfy the increasing user population and their traffic demands. The most substantial amount of this system performance gains will be obtained by means of network infrastructure densification [1]. Thus, UDN {{has been identified as}} one of pillar technologies in 5 G to significantly improve system capacity and coverage [2]. In theoretical analysis, UDN can bring significant benefits in terms of proximal transmission. However, the densely deployed BSs and irregular network topology introduce a huge amount of problems. More complex <b>interference</b> and frequent <b>handover</b> will offset gains. To meet these challenges, the user-centric virtual cell concept has been proposed [3].|$|R
40|$|Upcoming LTE {{networks}} have basically two different modes for scheduling {{data in the}} down-link by the base station. Dynamic scheduling brings the advantage of exploiting instantaneous channel state information while it puts {{on the other hand}} a significant burden on the system in terms of overhead and computation requirements. Especially for small packets that show up periodically, the overhead is typically too high. Therefore, the base station can serve such packet flows by the semi-persistent scheduling mode. In this mode, a certain resource allocation is fixed to a periodic schedule. While this does not allow any longer to exploit instantaneous channel states, it requires much less overhead. In this paper, we address the problem of selecting a modulation and coding scheme for such semi-persistent scheduling grants. The problem lies here in the stochastic characterization of the resource blocks over the next few seconds while on the other hand estimating based on such a characterization the blok error rate (and hence the average goodput). We provide a novel scheme, which outperforms all previously presented schemes significantly. The underlying model that we provide can also be used for any other long-term decision in an LTE system with semi-persistent scheduling such as <b>interference</b> coordination, <b>handover</b> decision etc. QC 20131212 </p...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the main}} trends in the fifth {{generation}} (5 G) cellular network is the bifurcation of systems that enable network densification. With this trend, ultra-dense networks (UDN) become a pillar technology to provide high data rates gains. However, these gains {{come at the expense of}} more complex <b>interference</b> and higher <b>handover</b> frequency. The user-centric virtual cell conception has been proposed to solve these problems. But it still has encountered some challenges in practical application. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based virtual cell design to balance data rates and resource overhead in order to improve virtual cell applicability. In our design, we consider a practical UDN scenario with imperfect channel state information (CSI) feedback and model it by stochastic geometry theory. Then, we find the optimal radius of virtual cells by maximizing the system spectral efficiency. On the basis, we propose a fuzzy logic-based activation strategy selection (FASS) algorithm to rationally choose the virtual cell activation threshold and resources allocation scheme under different traffic loads and quality of service (QoS) requirement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution can effectively eliminate the interference, obviously improve the user’s system spectral efficiency and dynamically adapt to different traffic loads.|$|R
30|$|Femtocell is a {{low-power}} and low-cost {{data access}} point that provides high-quality coverage with voice and data services. It communicates with {{the core network}} through a wired broadband connection such as cable modem or digital customer line (DSL). The femtocell has a broad prospect in offices and residences as it can handle higher data traffic with less resources allocated than the macrocell. It extends the macrocell coverage at the cell edge regions. However, in dense femtocell network, under existing macrocell coverage, <b>interference</b> and unwanted <b>handover</b> events cause complicacy. In areas with multiple femtocell coverage, signaling congestion increases along with the incessant handover and handoff events. Therefore, disparate solution is required to avoid unwanted <b>handover</b> and <b>interference</b> due to overlapping of coverage. In indoor environment, the performance optimization of the femtocell is mainly dependent on its relative position and allocated resources. The femtocell is usually placed in corners of any residence or apartment, where {{it is easy to}} plug in the internet cable (DSL) and the power port. Conventional single-element omnidirectional antenna is less suitable for femtocell coverage optimization as it radiates in all direction at the same intensity. Using multi-element microstrip patch, the antenna mounted on the square/round surface of the femtocell device can be more effective to reduce coverage overlapping.|$|R
30|$|In {{cellular}} networks, centralized solutions turn {{feasible to}} achieve optimized objectives {{because of the}} availability of the overall state of the network [14]; however, they are impracticable to be implemented on the current distributed architecture of the RAN, regarding complexity and latency constraints [15]. In contrast, H-CRAN already envisions a topologically centralized architecture based on resource pools to perform signal processing of the distributed RAN. Therefore, SDWN can exploit this concept to tackle complexity and latency constraint by using these pools and the existing optical backhaul [10]. In this case, SDWN controllers can take part as an enabling technology to perform centralized processing, becoming responsible for different wireless functions coordination [16, 17]. For example, SDWN controllers can be reprogrammed to analyze, allocate, and redistribute radio resources, in addition to controlling the <b>handover,</b> <b>interference,</b> energy, and radio resource sharing [18]. Also, SDWN controllers can serve as a framework to design novel solutions, for example, based on artificial intelligence to predict user handover mobility in a more harmonized manner, avoiding the need of specialized protocols and network middle-boxes, such as IEEE 802.21 and LTE’s Mobility Management Entity (MME). Although, H-CRAN can benefit from SDWN to reach, for example, optimized solution for each different supported wireless function, the definition of which wireless functions an SDWN controller must control and how, remains undefined.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} the {{frequency division duplex}} (FDD) mode of the downlink of UMTS terrestrial radio access (UTRA) focusing on the signal to interference ratio (SIR) estimation for the closed loop power control (CLPC), diversity exploitation in both spatial and temporal domains and the suppression of multi-access interference that is encountered in handover regions, {{with the aid of}} a calibrated link-level simulator. Firstly, SIR estimation methods are studied for single and two-antenna transmissions and it is shown that when the common pilot channel (CPICH) is available, SIR could be estimated on that and related to the SIR for the dedicated physical channel (DPCH) through a simple relation. This way, a reduction in the overhead of the slot formats specified by the 3 GPP, could be obtained. Secondly, factors influencing the handover performance such as the multipath fading correlation between radio channels of the two links, limited number of Rake fingers in a UE and imperfect channel estimation that cannot be modeled adequately at the system-level are investigated via link-level simulations. It is shown that the geometry factor has an influence on the handover performance and exhibits a threshold value (which depends on the correlation of the two links) above which the capacity starts degrading. The variation of the handover gain with the CLPC step-size, space-time transmit diversity (STTD) and receive antenna diversity is also quantified. Thirdly, blind interference suppression techniques are studied for the rejection of multi-access <b>interference</b> in <b>handover</b> regions. It is shown that the CLPC acts as an effective solution to the mismatch problem associated with the minimum output energy (MOE) detector. Furthermore, two methods are proposed for increasing the convergence speed of the MOE detector. Finally, chip-interleaved induced time diversity is investigated for multimedia broadcast / multicast services (MBMS) in UMTS, as a method of enhancing the downlink capacity. It is shown that the chip block interleaving with a block length of half the spreading factor provides similar diversity gain (by using only one transmit antenna) as that provided by STTD, but at the cost of an additional delay that is equal to the interleaving depth. Simulation results are presented for both the terrestrial and satellite modes of MBMS delivery for a range of mobile velocities...|$|R

The use of frequencies that are too much without being followed by the frequency setting is good, it will lead to an indirect interference that can degrade the quality of the signal.

40|$|Future {{wireless}} communication systems will utilize the spatial {{properties of the}} wireless channel to improve the spectral efficiency and thus increase capacity. This is realized by deploying multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver. Utilizing the spatial properties of the channel demands channel models that properly reflect these characteristics. Due to the unpredictable nature of the wireless channel, a common approach is to model its effects in a statistical fashion. A few large world wide cooperations, like the 3 GPP or WINNER projects, have developed channel models intended for reference and standardization use. These models are partly based on bulk parameters which describe {{the characteristics of the}} channel over larger areas of several wavelengths. These parameters include shadow fading, angle spread, and delay spread among others, and are within the WINNER project called large scale (LS) parameters. Considering the variations of these parameters, it is likely that they are correlated between closely located areas. Therefore it is of key interest to model their correlation properties instead of randomizing them independently for each new simulation. In multi-cell scenarios, when considering macro diversity or evaluation other properties such as <b>interference</b> and/or <b>handover</b> schemes, the intra site correlation of the shadow fading parameters should be taken into account for proper simulations. Neglecting this correlation the interference could be over/under estimated, hence the system capacity can be over/under estimated. Further, reliable estimations of the interference levels will increase the frequency reuse, and may even permit reuse within the same cell, on spatially separated links. The thesis focuses on modelling the statistics and variations of these parameters to increase accuracy of channel models. Previous studies have looked at the autocorrelation properties of the shadow fading in outdoor environments and found it to follow an exponential decay. This means that an first order autoregressive function would be sufficient to model this effect. Research of the angular spread parameter is more scarce, and therefor this issue is studied herein. In addition to the autocorrelation properties the intra-site correlation between the different large scale parameters is of interest. It is herein found that the shadow fading is negatively correlated with angle spreads, while the angle spread at the base station and the angle spread at the mobile show positive correlation. Finally, the inter site correlation between one mobile and multiple base stations is studied {{as a function of the}} angular separation between the links. For closely located base station, ie with small angular separation as seen from the mobile, substantial inter-site correlation is found. It is further seen that the correlation of the shadow fading is more prominent than the correlation of angle spread. QC 2010110...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{mobile data}} traffic demands have been {{increased}} exponentially, and the conventional cellular systems {{can no longer}} support the capacity demands. A potential solution for meeting such demands may be Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) techniques. A HetNet may integrate diverse radio access technologies (RAT) such as UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Networks (UTRAN), GSM/EDGE Radio Access and Network (GERAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) as well as possibly Visible Light Communication (VLC) networks. The improved channel gain of the HetNet techniques is achieved by employing the small cells and by reduced transmission distance. However, the deployment of HetNet techniques also impose several technical challenges, for example the <b>interference</b> management, <b>handovers,</b> resource management and modelling of HetNets. A HetNet relies on multiple types of access nodes in a wireless network. These access nodes can use either the same technology or different technologies. When the access nodes employ the same technology and use the same frequency band, a major problem is the Co-Channel-Interference (CCI) between these access nodes. We firstly investigate a Radio-Frequency (RF) based HetNet in Chapter 3, which is constituted by the macrocells and the femtocells. More explicitly, the impacts of femtocells on traditional macrocells are studied, when the macrocells are relying on Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR). The design, performance analysis and optimization problems of this FFR aided two-tier HetNet is investigated. We found the advantage of FFR eroded in dense femtocell scenarios and the optimized network tends to become a Unity Frequency Reuse (UFR) aided system. In order to mitigate the cross-tier interference, we proposed a statics spectrum allocation scheme, namely Swapping Spectrum Access (SSA). Both the Outage Probability (OP) of femtocell Mobile Terminals (MTs) in cell centre region {{and that of the}} macrocell MTs in the cell edge region is reduced by the proposed SSA. The optimized network using our SSA is more robust to the detrimental impact of femtocells. Another constitution of a HetNet may rely on integrating different technologies of wireless communication networks. We focus on our attentions on a HetNet composing by a RF femtocell and a VLC network in Chapter 4 and 5. An important component of this architecture is its Resource Management (RM). We investigate the Resource Allocation (RA) problems, under the diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of data rate, fairness and the statistical delay requirements. Two types of MTs, multi-homing MTs and multi-mode MTs are considered, where multi-homing MTs have the capability of aggregating resources from different networks, while the multi-mode MTs always select a single network for their connection. We proposed a sub-optimal decentralized method for solving the RA problems of both the multi-homing MTs and multi-mode MTs. The simulation results confirm the conceived method is capable of satisfying the QoS requirements. Furthermore, we employ more sophisticated transmission strategies for the VLC network and study their performance in Chapter 5. Again, the RA problems of the HetNet relying on different transmission strategies are investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} way of increasing capacity in a wirelesscommunication system has been cell splitting and fixedchannel-allocation based on prediction tools. However, theplanning complexity increases rapidly {{with the number of}} cellsand the method is not suitable for the large temporal andspatial traffic variations expected in the future. A lot ofresearch has therefore been performed regarding adaptivechannel allocation, where a channel can be used anywhere aslong as the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is acceptable. Acommon opinion is that these solutions must be decentralizedsince a centralized one would be overly complex. In this thesis, we study the locally centralizedbunch conceptfor radio resource management (RRM) in aManhattan environment and show that it can give a very highcapacity both for outdoor users and for indoor users covered byoutdoor base stations. We show how measurement limitations anderrors affect the performance and wepropose methods to handlethese problems, e. g. averaging of measured values, robustchannel selection algorithms, and increased SIR margins. Wealso study the computational and signaling complexities andshow that they can be reduced by splitting large bunches, usingsparse matrix calculations, and by using a simplified admissionalgorithm. However, a reduction of the complexity often means areduction of the system capacity. The measurements needed for RRM {{can also be used to}} find amobile terminal's geographical position. We propose and studysome simple yet accurate methods for this purpose. We alsostudy if position information can enhance RRM as is oftensuggested in the literature. In the studied scenario, thisinformation seems to be of limited use. One possible use is toestimate the mobile user's speed, to assist handover decisions. Another use is to find the location of user hotspots in anarea, which is beneficial for system planning. Our results show that the bunch concept is a promisingcandidate for radio resource management in future wirelesssystems.

In {{the last}} few years, {{the development of new}} methods on digital signal processing by one hand, and the technological outcomes in microelectronics, which made that possible, by another, carried out the decrease {{in the size of the}} mobile terminals when compared with the ones used in the analogue networks of the first generation systems. This effect, which allowed a significant improvement on the transmission of quality voice and data, coupled with an increasing mixture of new services madeavailable to the subscriber, provoked an explosion of the service penetration rate. By the same way, the offered traffic, which was in its whole of mobility type in the past, since the terminal sets were designed for in-car use, turned out to be a stationary one. The smaller size, longer batteries life and ease of portability of the new handsets allow subscribers to carry out calls in a mixture of places: inside home, in shopping centres or even while on the move on the streets. The final result of this whole changing process was a tremendous increase on the traffic being offered. This process impose restrictions on the quality of the service made available to the subscriber and brought up new challenges in the design and implementation of these new networks. The main purpose of this work is to analyse the implications that the increasing demand on the offered traffic have in the design and implementation of second generation mobile cellular networks, particularly to the maintenance of the quality of the service made available to the subscriber. For this reason a detailed analysis of a group of techniques and methods of cellular planning is camedout. Some of these techniques are already being implemented by many operators. Some signal propagation models are analysed, since these models allow the calculation and derivation of the parameters that describe the network performance, thus being used in the network planning process: CO-channel and adjacent channel interference factors. A few planning techniques are analysed and compared to each other: cell splitting, sectorization, overlaid/und. erlaid, implementation of frequency hopping, load sharing, implementation of hierarquical networks (microcells and picocells), discontinuous transmission - uplink and downlink). Some models for the calculation of the probability of blocking of new calls for different methods of channel allocation: fixed (fixed channel allocation), dynamic (dynamic channel allocation) and hybrid (hybrid channel allocation) allocation methods.

40|$|This thesis {{shows how}} online {{management}} of both {{quality of service}} (QoS) and provider revenue can be performed in third generation (3 G) mobile networks by adaptive control of system parameters to changing traffic conditions. As a main result, this approach {{is based on a}} novel call admission control and bandwidth degradation scheme for real-time traffic. The admission controller considers real-time calls with two priority levels: calls of high priority have a guaranteed bit-rate, whereas calls of low priority can be temporarily degraded to a lower bit-rate in order to reduce forced termination of calls due to a handover failure. A second contribution constitutes the development of a Markov model for the admission controller that incorporates important features of 3 G mobile networks, such as code division multiple access (CDMA) intra- and inter-cell <b>interference</b> and soft <b>handover.</b> Online evaluation of the Markov model enables a periodical adjustment of the threshold for maximal call degradation according to the currently measured traffic in the radio access network and a predefined goal for optimization. Using distinct optimization goals, this allows optimization of both QoS and provider revenue. Performance studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that QoS and provider revenue can be increased significantly with a moderate degradation of low-priority calls. Compared with existing admission control policies, the overall utilization of cell capacity is significantly improved using the proposed degradation scheme, which can be considered as an 'on demand' reservation of cell capacity. To enable online QoS/revenue management of both real-time and non real-time services, accurate analytical traffic models for non real-time services are required. This thesis identifies the batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP) as the analytically tractable model of choice for the joint characterization of packet arrivals and packet lengths. As a key idea, the BMAP is customized such that different packet lengths are represented by batch sizes of arrivals. Thus, the BMAP enables the 'two-dimensional', i. e., joint, characterization of packet arrivals and packet lengths, and is able to capture correlations between the packet arrival process and the packet length process. A novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is developed, and it is shown how to utilize the randomization technique and a stable calculation of Poisson jump probabilities effectively for computing time-dependent conditional expectations of a continuous-time Markov chain required by the expectation step of the EM algorithm. This methodological work enables the EM algorithm to be both efficient and numerical robust and constitutes an important step towards effective, analytically/numerically tractable traffic models. Case studies of measured IP traffic with different degrees of traffic burstiness evidently demonstrate the advantages of the BMAP modeling approach over other widely used analytically tractable models and show that the joint characterization of packet arrivals and packet lengths is decisively for realistic traffic modeling at packet level...|$|R
