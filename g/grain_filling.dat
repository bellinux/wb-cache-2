25|$|Wheat {{normally}} needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, {{depending upon}} climate, seed type, and soil conditions (winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal crop management {{requires that the}} farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In particular, spring fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and growth regulators are typically applied only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1cm in size (Z31 on Zadoks scale). Knowledge of stages {{is also important to}} identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example, pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between anthesis and maturity are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made worse by water stress. Farmers also benefit from knowing when the 'flag leaf' (last leaf) appears, as this leaf represents about 75% of photosynthesis reactions during the <b>grain</b> <b>filling</b> period, and so should be preserved from disease or insect attacks to ensure a good yield.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{nitrogen}} availability {{has a large}} {{influence on}} wheat grain protein concentrations. However, influence of soil nitrogen on protein deposition and protein quality may vary among wheat genotypes. A {{study was conducted to}} evaluate soil N response of hard red winter wheat genotypes in terms of: (1) Concentrations of N in tillers and <b>grain</b> during <b>grain</b> <b>fill,</b> and (2) Changes in protein quality during <b>grain</b> <b>fill.</b> ^ Fifteen wheat genotypes were grown at Mead, Nebraska in 1989 and 1990 under four fertilizer treatments: 0, 45, and 90 kg/ha N; 39 kg/ha N with 45 kg/ha sulphur. Plant samples were obtained weekly during the <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> period. Tillers were dried, and evaluated for N concentration. Heads were removed, freeze dried, and grains extracted for estimation of N concentration and protein quality. Protein quality was measured based on solubility in salt water, ethanol, KOH, and SDS solutions. Flour from harvested grain was used for mixograph analyses. ^ Increasing soil N increased N concentrations in tillers and grain, and improved mixing properties. However, grain protein quality, as measured by protein solubility characteristics, was not altered with increasing soil N. Addition of sulphur to the soil had no influence on tiller or grain N levels, protein quality, or mixing properties. ^ Wheat genotypes differed for tiller and grain N concentrations, protein solubility characteristics, and mixing quality. However, all genotypes responded similarly to soil N treatments; genotype by treatment interactions were non-significant for tiller and grain N and most measures of protein quality. Among the genotypes, tiller and grain N concentrations were shown to be unrelated. ^ Salt water, ethanol, and KOH soluble proteins were deposited in an asynchronous manner during <b>grain</b> <b>fill.</b> As <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> progressed, salt water soluble proteins decreased, whereas alcohol and KOH soluble proteins increased as a proportion of total protein. Soil N treatments did not alter the relative proportions of proteins at any stage of <b>grain</b> <b>fill.</b> Significant differences in protein deposition were observed among genotypes.

The purpose of this study was to identify changes in <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> characteristics and their interaction with plant density in a closed population and identify a model that accurately predicts <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> in this population. We hypothesize that recurrent selection for increased yield indirectly impacted the <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> characteristics of maize including final kernel weight, kernel fill duration, and kernel fill rate in the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic maize population. We also hypothesize that recurrent selection for yield has indirectly improved maize tolerance to high plant density stress for these <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> characteristics. Populations representing different levels of advancement from the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic maize population were compared to at two different locations near Ames, Iowa in 2009 and 2010. Populations were compared at plant densities of 5. 3 and 7. 7 seeds m- 2. Treatments were replicated three times per location in a split plot design. Recurrent selection for yield has led to changes in final kernel weight and kernel fill duration, as well as the response of kernel weight to increased planting densities. This supports our hypothesis that recurrent selection for yield changed <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> characteristics and the effect of high plant density stress in the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic maize population.

Field research was conducted at the Maricopa Agricultural Center using the durum varieties Duraking, Minos, and Turbo. The field was treated uniformly until pollen shed when nitrogen was applied at rates of 0, 30, and 60 lbs /acre. During <b>grain</b> <b>fill,</b> the plots were irrigated based on 30, 50, or 70 % moisture depletion. In a separate experiment, nitrogen fertilizer was applied at a rate of 30 lbs N /acre at pollen shed only, pollen shed and the first irrigation after pollen shed, and pollen shed and the first and second irrigation after pollen shed. Increased irrigation frequency during <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> decreased HVAC from 93 to 81 %. Increasing nitrogen rate at pollen shed from 0 to 30 and 30 to 60 lbs N /acre increased protein from 11. 6 to 12. 5 % and 12. 5 to 13. 3 % and increased HVAC from 79 to 89 % and 89 to 94 %. Nitrogen fertilizer application at the first irrigation after pollen shed increased grain protein content from 12. 9 to 13. 6 % and application at the first and second irrigation after pollen shed increased grain protein content further to 14. 1 % averaged over varieties.

Breeding nitrogen efficient cultivars without sacrificing rice yield potential, improving <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> in later-flowering inferior spikelets and enhancing harvest index are three important approaches to achieving the dual goal of high grain yield and high resource use efficiency.

40|$|High oil corn (HOC) is {{essentially}} dent corn {{that has been}} selected for high oil content in the scutellum. It is a value-added crop that can potentially offer a premium price for producers. Though southeastern U. S. producers have not had problems achieving sufficient yields, the oil content necessary for premium prices has been elusive. One of the most evident differences between these growers and their northern counterparts is the climate. Temperatures during the reproductive growth and <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> periods are higher in southern latitudes. A two-part research project was conducted to further investigate the significance of temperature on oil content. The field project consisted of three different plantings; the first being planted May 11 th, 2000, the second three weeks later on June 1 st, 2000, and the third {{three weeks after the}} second, on June 22 nd, 2000. The intention of the three plantings was to force the reproductive period and <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> to occur during different times in the growing season. Ambient temperature data was supplied by the WKU Weather Center. Each planting was harvested and analyzed for oil content. The project resulted in a significant difference in oil content between the first planting and the last two plantings. The laboratory project began in the field. Sixteen ears per planting were hand pollinated and then harvested ten days after pollination. Six to twelve kernels, still attached to the cob, were removed from each ear.

Crop productivity can benefit from increased ambient CO 2 as similar assimilation rates can be maintained with smaller canopy conductance, resulting in modestly reduced crop water requirement.

50|$|After the {{irrigation}} in the crop field, the water depth gradually decreases because of evapotranspiration, seepage, and percolation. Because of the installed tubes in the field, {{it is possible}} to monitor the water depth below the soil surface up to 15-20 cm. When the water level drops 15 cm below the soil surface, irrigation should be applied in the field to re-flood to a depth of 5 cm. During the flowering stage of the rice, the field should be kept flooded. After flowering, during the mid-season and late season (<b>grain</b> <b>filling</b> and ripening stages), the water level is allowed to drop below the soil surface to 15 cm before re-irrigation. To suppress the growth of weeds in the rice field, AWD method should be followed 1-2 weeks after the transplantation. In the case of many weeds in the field, AWD needs to be started after three weeks of transplantation. Usually, the fertilizer recommendations are as same as continuous flooding method. Application of nitrogen fertilizer is preferable on dry soil just before re-irrigation. To ensure a similar dry or wet condition throughout the crop field, which is essential to maintain good yield, it is important to level the rice field properly.|$|E

Nonetheless, finger millet blast, {{caused by the}} fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea (anamorph Pyricularia grisea), can locally cause severe damages, especially when untreated. In Uganda, yield losses up to 80% were reported in bad years. The pathogen leads to drying out of leaves, neck rots and ear rots. These symptoms can drastically impair photosynthesis, translocation of photosynthetic assimilates and <b>grain</b> <b>filling</b> and therefore reduce yield and grain quality. Finger millet blast can also infest finger millet weeds such as the closely related Eleusine indica, Eleusine africana or Digitaria spp., Setaria spp. and Doctylocterium spp. Finger millet blast can be controlled with cultural measures, chemical treatments {{and the use of}} resistant varieties. Cultural measures to control finger millet blast suggested by ICRISAT for Eastern Africa include crop rotations with non-host crops like legumes, deep ploughing under of finger millet straw on infected fields, washing of field tools after use to prevent dissemination of the pathogen to non-infected fields, weed control to reduce infections by weed hosts and avoiding of too high plant densities to impede the pathogen dispersal from plant to plant. Chemical measures can be direct spraying of systemic fungicides, such as the active ingredients pyroquilon or tricyclazone or seed dressings with fungicides like trycyclozole.|$|E

Opposite to GAs, abscisic acid (ABA) in the grains was low at early <b>grain</b> <b>filling</b> but WS remarkably enhanced its accumulation. The peak values of ABA were significantly correlated with the maximum <b>grain</b> <b>filling</b> rates (r = 0. 92 **, P < 0. 01) and the partitioning of fixed 14 C into grains (r = 0. 95 **, P < 0. 01). Exogenously applied ABA on pot-grown HN rice showed similar results as those by WS. Results suggest that an altered hormonal balance in rice grains by water stress during <b>grain</b> <b>filling,</b> especially a decrease in GAs and an increase in ABA, enhances the remobilization of prestored carbon to the grains and accelerates the <b>grain</b> <b>filling</b> rate...|$|E

But in {{one family}} of plants, the {{contents}} {{also of the}} seed, not the envelope of it merely, are prepared {{for the support of}} the higher animal life; and their <b>grain,</b> <b>filled</b> with the substance which, for universally understood name, may best keep the Latin one of Farina,--becoming in French, 'Farine,' and in English, 'Flour,'--both in the perfectly nourishing elements of it, and its {228} easy and abundant multiplicability, becomes the primal treasure of human economy.|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{fertilisation}} boosts {{the grain}} yield of wheat through {{its influence on}} yield components, phenology and leaf traits. Both crop growth and senescence are dependent on N supply, as are the number of kernels set per unit area and per ear, and the mean kernel size. A two-season trial of four semi-dwarf durum wheat cultivars, grown at two levels of N, was used to illustrate the effects of N on canopy temperature, leaf resistance and flag leaf senescence pattern under irrigated conditions in a Mediterranean climate, and to explore the consequences of these effects on the crop phenology, its yield and its yield components. The well-fertilised crop developed a larger leaf area index at anthesis and a lower leaf resistance, thus generating a lower canopy temperature and delayed anthesis. Its <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> duration was shorter, {{in spite of its}} lower canopy temperature, presumably because the increased N availability resulted {{in the development of a}} stronger sink (more kernels per unit area and per ear), which was associated with earlier senescence, thereby shortening the duration of <b>grain</b> <b>fill,</b> and led to reduced kernel weight...|$|R
40|$|The Biomass Production Chamber at John F. Kennedy Space Center is {{a closed}} plant growth chamber {{facility}} {{that can be}} used to monitor the level of biogenic emissions from large populations of plants throughout their entire growth cycle. The head space atmosphere of a 26 -day-old lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann's Green) stand was repeatedly sampled and emissions identified and quantified using GC-mass spectrometry. Concentrations of dimethyl sulphide, carbon disulphide, alpha-pinene, furan and 2 -methylfuran were not significantly different throughout the day; whereas, isoprene showed significant differences in concentration between samples collected in light and dark periods. Volatile organic compounds from the atmosphere of wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Yecora Rojo) were analysed and quantified from planting to maturity. Volatile plant-derived compounds included 1 -butanol, 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, nonanal, benzaldehyde, tetramethylurea, tetramethylthiourea, 2 -methylfuran and 3 -methylfuran. Concentrations of volatiles were determined during seedling establishment, vegetative growth, anthesis, <b>grain</b> <b>fill</b> and senescence and found to vary depending on the developmental stage. Atmospheric concentrations of benzaldehyde and nonanal were highest during anthesis, 2 -methylfuran and 3 -methylfuran concentrations were greatest during <b>grain</b> <b>fill,</b> and the concentration of the tetramethylurea peaked during senescence...|$|R
