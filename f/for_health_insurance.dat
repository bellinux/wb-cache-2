5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> as a result.|$|E

5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E
5|$|Mills booked {{herself into}} the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food vegan diet, using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills {{discovered}} {{that she had been}} previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type, when in fact she was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called blood type diet. As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she had the idea to collect thousands of discarded prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance,</b> which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia's prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.|$|E

25|$|Some American {{states have}} made medical {{underwriting}} illegal {{as a prerequisite}} for health coverage, which means anyone who asks <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and pays for it will get it.

25|$|Health {{insurance}} benefits are an attractive way for employers {{to increase the}} salary of employees as they are nontaxable. As a result, 65% of the non-elderly population and over 90% of the privately insured non-elderly population receives health insurance at the workplace. Additionally, most economists agree that this tax shelter increases individual demand <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> leading some to claim that it is {{largely responsible for the}} rise in health care spending.|$|E
25|$|So, {{shortly after}} HealthCare.gov's launch, the {{problems}} {{still did not}} affect the legal requirement for Americans to have health insurance by December 15, which remained on the books as stated.

25|$|There was {{a renewed}} push <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> reform in 1974. In January, representatives Martha Griffiths and James C. Corman {{introduced}} the Health Security Act, a universal {{national health insurance}} program providing comprehensive benefits without any cost sharing backed by the AFL-CIO and UAW. The following month Nixon again proposed the Comprehensive Health Insurance Actan employer mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April, Kennedy and Mills introduced the National Health Insurance Act, a bill to provide near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes and with lower cost sharing. Both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizens organizations, and neither gained traction. That summer, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan, but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise.|$|E
25|$|The October 1, 2013 {{roll-out}} of HealthCare.gov {{went through}} as planned, despite the concurrent partial government shutdown. However, the launch {{was marred by}} serious technological problems, {{making it difficult for}} the public to sign up <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> The deadline to sign up for coverage that would begin January 2014 was December 23, 2013, by which time the problems had largely been fixed. The open enrollment period for 2016 coverage ran from November 1, 2015 to January 31, 2016. State exchanges also have had the same deadlines; their performance has been varied.|$|E
25|$|The {{pension benefit}} is not {{insignificant}} {{because it is}} estimated to cost 25% of salary over the entire 25-year period to fund a pension benefit of half the salary at age 55 for someone who starts employment at age 30. While this estimate {{is based on a}} 5% interest rate for discounting present values, a 3.5% annual salary growth rate and mortality according to the Annuity 2000 Merged Gender Mod 1 Table with ages set back 2.0 years. The key point to use the same assumptions to compare the annual yearly cost as a percent of salary for a half pay pension for someone starting at age 30 and retiring at age 62. The additional seven-year wait would drive the cost down to under 17% of salary annual cost. In essence, the MTA's proposal was a greater than 8% salary cut across the board. Using a slightly worse mortality table, the effective salary cut is still within the 7% to 6% salary cut range in terms of value given up. By not accepting the MTA pension offer, Local 100 of the TWU was not forced to a cut. Citing the rising cost of health care, the MTA wanted new employees to contribute 1% of their salary to pay <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Transit workers currently do not pay <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b>|$|E
40|$|The U. S. is {{the only}} {{developed}} country without some form of national <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Yet, public opinion polls have consistently reported solid majorities in favor of such a system. In this paper, we examine whether attitudes toward different roles of government and beliefs that {{may be related to}} those attitudes are consistent with widespread support <b>for</b> national <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Our analysis is {{based on the premise that}} a system of national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> would require government redistribution and government intervention in health care markets. We find that people who have favorable attitudes toward government economic intervention are 27 percentage points more likely and those with favorable attitudes toward government economic intervention are 18 percentage points more likely to favor national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> than those with unfavorable attitudes. The most intense support <b>for</b> national <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> strongly favoring as opposed favoring it, is among people with favorable attitudes toward both roles of government. Consistent with research from other social programs, we find that the beliefs regarding racial minorities, as well as beliefs regarding individual control over life, limit support <b>for</b> national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> in the U. S. On the other hand, negative beliefs regarding businesses are an important source of support <b>for</b> national <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> We conclude that significant changes in either attitudes and beliefs or their relationship with support <b>for</b> national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> are probably necessary to create a strong majority in support of such legislation. ...|$|R
