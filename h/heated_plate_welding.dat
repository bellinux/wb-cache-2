50|$|Butt welding {{is usually}} {{performed}} {{using one of}} several methods. The first, and most common, is butt welding or butt fusion, which {{is a type of}} hot <b>plate</b> <b>welding.</b> This technique involves heating two planed surfaces of thermoplastic material (typically polyethylene) against a heated surface. After a specified amount of time, the <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> is removed and the two pieces are pressed together and allowed to cool under pressure, forming the desired bond. Butt welding outside of manufacturing is usually performed to join pipes.|$|R
40|$|The ASTM {{standard}} B 575 {{provides the}} requirements for the chemical composition of Nickel-Chromium-Molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) alloys such as Alloy 22 (N 06022) and Alloy 686 (N 06686). The compositions of each element are given in a range. For example, the content of Mo is specified from 12. 5 to 14. 5 weight percent for Alloy 22 and from 15. 0 to 17. 0 weight percent for Alloy 686. It was important {{to determine how the}} corrosion rate of <b>welded</b> <b>plates</b> of Alloy 22 using Alloy 686 weld filler metal would change if heats of these alloys were prepared using several variations in the composition of the elements even though still in the range specified in B 575. All the material used in this report were especially prepared at Allegheny Ludlum Co. Seven <b>heats</b> of <b>plate</b> were <b>welded</b> with seven heats of wire. Immersion corrosion tests were conducted in a boiling solution of sulfuric acid plus ferric sulfate (ASTM G 28 A) using both as-welded (ASW) coupons and solution heat-treated (SHT) coupons. Results show that the corrosion rate was not affected by the chemistry of the materials in the range of the standards...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to {{improving}} the heating to oil shale particles and in turn the yield and quality of shale oil in fixed bed reactors indirectly heated through use of internals. Metallic <b>heating</b> <b>plates</b> were vertically <b>welded</b> on the reactor wall as heating enhancement internals to provide extra heating surfaces inside the oil shale bed and to increase the high-temperature heating surface area by 35 % to 210 %. Comparison of heating rate to particles and shale oil yield was made between the reactors without and with the plate internals. Utilizing internals evidently enhanced the heating to oil shale particles and shortened pyrolysis time by 30 % to 50 %. The shale oil yield increased by 7 % to reach 90 % of the Fischer Assay oil yield (8. 98 wt. %, dry base) when the heating surface area was increased by 70 - 110 %. With increased heating surface area above 110 %, the shale oil yield manifested conversely a slight decrease. Nonetheless, the fraction of light oil (boiling point < 350 degrees C by analysis in simulation GC) was increased to about 66 wt. % from 60. 94 wt. % for the reactor without any <b>heating</b> <b>plate.</b> Characterizing the char samples at different lateral positions of the oil shale bed justified that the flow of gaseous pyrolysis product in the reactor was guided to the vicinity of <b>heat</b> transfer <b>plates</b> to speed up gas exhaust and selective cracking. Consequently, adding <b>heat</b> transfer <b>plates</b> into an indirectly heated reactor would obviously intensify the heating to the oil shale bed and also elevate the pyrolysis oil yield and quality.

50|$|A third {{method of}} {{thermoplastic}} welding is called sidewall fusion, or saddle fusion. Sidewall fusion is, like butt fusion and socket fusion, another process based on hot <b>plate</b> <b>welding.</b> Sidewall fusion differs from either socket, or butt fusion methods by performing fusion {{into the side}} of the pipe wall in a transverse orientation to the main pipe, rather than in line with the pipe. Sidewall fusion is typically employed in conjunction with either socket or butt fusion methods as a complementary process and many fusion machines designed for butt fusion are also equipped for sidewall fusion. Adaptor plates that match the outside diameter of the main pipe are applied to the <b>heating</b> <b>plate</b> to perform this type of fusion.|$|R
