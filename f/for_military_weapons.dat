As a result, the military depends on the commercial sector for increased capabilities in many systems. The Commercial Item and Non- Developmental item procurement strategy has been utilized to capitalize on this development. Using pre-existing systems to provide additional capabilities <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>weapon</b> systems results in a shorter procurement time and enables new technology to be used sooner. However, the logistics support of these items suffers since there is less time to test and plan for spare parts, training facilities, and support equipment. More assets are needed during the initial planning stages for these items to identify and produce the support structures needed {{for the life of the}} system. Finally, the shift of logistics support from an organic, military support system to a commercial support system has certain cost savings that are realized early in the program, but may have long-term effects in terms of security risk and overall life-cycle cost.

However, the cult is attacked by an unseen enemy, killing all of the members and stealing the weapons, while also kidnapping Justin Kenyon, the cult's leader, who they later kill. Afterwards, a series of vans, filled with explosives, appear near Washington D.C., being manned by children, which grants Liz and the task force a warrant to raid the Kenyon private property. However, Liz and Ressler are kidnapped by the same people who attacked the cult, who turn out to be boys that Justin had thrown into the wilderness because of his belief that there were too many boys, who have banded together under the leadership of David Kenyon, Justin's son. Liz and Ressler are later saved by the FBI, who have managed to track them, resulting in the death of David. Cooper receives a job offer to become a director of the FBI, but turns it down because of health issues and focuses on trying to get in on a trial for his illness, which he is denied. Reddington teams up with a reluctant Glen (a DMV contact) to track down the contents of Alan Fitch's safe in St. Petersburg. The pair arrive to find a card with an unknown telephone number, which Red tries to trace to no avail. Returning to the Post Office, he surprises Liz with a key to her brand new apartment, which annoys her. Cooper finds out that he has been accepted as an 'extra' for the trial, thanks to his friend Thomas Connolly, who has powerful connections. After the Kenyon compound threat is neutralized by the FBI, Red goes back there to a secret bunker which houses what appears as an old '60's-'70's Lincoln Continental Presidential vehicle perfectly preserved. Red opens the trunk and takes out a silver briefcase. Red then calls the telephone number, which is answered by a mysterious man.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains four {{chapters of}} my research. In chapter 1, I show that higher military spending leads to higher exports of weapons. This is {{a manifestation of}} the home market effect - the prediction that countries with higher demand for a differentiated good will be net exporters of that good. The home market effect is specific to monopolistic competition models of international trade, and serves to distinguish empirically between these and comparative advantage-based models. I construct a monopolistic competition model with a military sector and a continuum of civilian industries, and derive empirical implications of the home market effect for arms and ammunition. I then use military expenditure as a measure of demand <b>for</b> <b>military</b> <b>weapons</b> to show that, indeed, countries with higher military spending as a share of GDP export more arms and ammunition relative to homogeneous, cheap-to-ship civilian goods. In my setup, military spending serves to introduce variation in demand across countries. This is an innovation over the typical approach in the literature, whereby consumers in different countries are assumed to have identical preferences, and home market effects stem from differences in goods' characteristics and country size alone. Chapter 2 tests the existence of the home market effect for construction materials, by using public infrastructure spending as a measure of demand. I construct a theoretical model that suggests goods with high transport costs and high differentiation are most likely to display home market effects. I test this prediction empirically for a handful of construction materials that meet the necessary criteria. As expected, I find that the home market effect holds for alloy steel and construction machinery. However, cement and glass display the opposite trade pattern, whereby increased domestic demand leads to reduced exports. I discuss potential explanations for this result. In the next two chapters, I examine the determinants of firm success. In chapter 3 (co-authored with Sarada) we find that new firms with higher network concentration, i. e. wherein initial employees have worked together previously, are on average larger, have higher wages and survive longer. This association increases with the initial size of the newly founded firm. However, we find a negative relationship between network concentration and initial firm growth. Finally, chapter 4 (co-authored with Marc Muendler and James Rauch) gauges the prevalence and performance of firms founded as employee spinoffs relative to other entrants. We find that size at entry is larger for employee spinoffs than for new firms without parents but smaller than for diversification ventures of existing firms. Similarly, survival rates for employee spinoffs are higher than for new firms without parents and comparable to those for diversification ventures of existing firm...|$|E

50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the People's Republic, Mao traveled to Moscow to negotiate the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

China acceded, at least initially, to Soviet leadership of the world communist movement and took the Soviet Union as the model for development. China's participation in the Korean War (1950-53) seemed to strengthen Sino-Soviet relations, especially after the UN-sponsored trade embargo against China. The Sino-Soviet alliance appeared to unite Moscow and Beijing, and China became more closely associated with and dependent on a foreign power than ever before.|$|R

This thesis reports the impact of these defense related mergers on the cost of <b>military</b> <b>weapons</b> systems. The Selected Acquisition Reports (SARs) provided the data for this research. The analysis of the data suggests that the {{defense industry}}'s consolidation did not result in higher costs <b>for</b> DoD's <b>military</b> <b>weapons</b> in the post-merger period. This report concludes that on average approximately 76. 4 percent of the weapons systems produced by Lockheed Martin, Boeing, or Northrop Grumman, the three largest defense contractors respectively based on 2006 -awarded contracts, experienced a statistically significant change in their cost estimates. Weapon systems in the fixed wing aircraft category were most impacted by defense related mergers. About 72. 7 percent of the systems in this category showed a statistically significant change in cost estimates, of which 63. 6 percent exhibited a statistically significant decrease in cost estimates.

5000|$|The {{dividing}} line between machine pistols and compact submachine guns is difficult to draw. Originally, [...] "Maschinenpistole" [...] was simply the German word <b>for</b> personal, automatic <b>military</b> <b>weapons,</b> while [...] "submachine gun" [...] was a term coined by John T.

The 1960s CZ-Scorpion, a Czechoslovak 7.65 mm weapon, for example, is often labeled a submachine gun.
