5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel.</b> If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> wall and turbulence increase the risk of thrombosis (the formation of blood clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked the men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> with grenades, the casualties mounted, {{with a number of}} men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E

5|$|Monte Testaccio has {{provided}} archaeologists {{with a rare}} insight into the ancient Roman economy. The amphorae deposited in the mound were often labelled with tituli picti, painted or stamped inscriptions which record information such as {{the weight of the}} oil contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> the names of the people who weighed and documented the oil {{and the name of the}} district where the oil was originally bottled. This has allowed archaeologists to determine that the oil in the vessels was imported under state authority and was designated for the annona urbis (distribution to the people of Rome) or the annona militaris (distribution to the army). Indeed, some of the inscriptions found on mid-2nd century vessels at Monte Testaccio specifically record that the oil they once contained was delivered to the praefectus annonae, the official in charge of the state-run food distribution service. It is possible that Monte Testaccio was also managed by the praefectus annonae.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} known {{experiments}} {{on the relationship between}} combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd centuryBCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of thrombosis is classically {{due to a}} group of causes named Virchow's triad (alterations in blood flow, factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> wall and factors affecting the properties of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present.|$|E

25|$|Aneurysm {{means an}} outpouching of a blood vessel wall that {{is filled with}} blood. Aneurysms occur at a point of {{weakness}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> wall. This can be because of acquired disease or hereditary factors. The repeated trauma of blood flow against the vessel wall presses against the point of weakness and causes the aneurysm to enlarge. As described by the Law of Young-Laplace, the increasing area increases tension against the aneurysmal walls, leading to enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Kitchener's great fame, the suddenness of his death, and its {{apparently}} convenient timing for {{a number}} of parties gave almost immediate rise to a number of conspiracy theories about his death. One in particular was posited by Lord Alfred Douglas (of Oscar Wilde fame), positing a connection between Kitchener's death, the recent naval Battle of Jutland, Winston Churchill, and a Jewish conspiracy. Churchill successfully sued Douglas in what proved to be the last successful case of criminal libel in British legal history, and the latter spent six months in prison. Another claimed that the Hampshire did not strike a mine at all, but was sunk by explosives secreted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> by Irish Republicans.|$|E
25|$|In 1831 the Admiralty issued {{orders for}} Victory {{to be broken}} up and her timbers reused in other vessels. A public outcry against the {{destruction}} of so famous a ship led to the order being held in abeyance and Victory was left, largely forgotten, at a Portsmouth mooring. Admiralty officially designated the ageing vessel as a ship's tender for the Port admirals flagship , and permitted civilian visitors to come aboard for tours. The ship briefly returned to the public gaze on 18 July 1833 when the queen in waiting, Princess Victoria, and her mother, the Duchess of Kent, made a visit to her quarterdeck to meet with veterans of the Trafalgar campaign. This generated a surge of interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel,</b> {{and an increase in}} civilian visitor numbers to between 10,000 and 12,000 a year. Victoria returned for a second visit on 21 October 1844, creating a further burst of interest that lifted annual visitors to more than 22,000.|$|E

25|$|It was {{believed}} that around 23:00 JST, the 4 m long fuel rods in the reactor were fully exposed for the second time. At 00:30 JST on 15 March, NHK ran a live press conference with TEPCO stating that the water level had sunk under the rods once again and pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> was raised. The utility said that the hydrogen explosion at Unit 3 might have caused a glitch in the cooling system of Unit 2: Four out of five water pumps being used to cool the Unit 2 reactor had failed after the explosion at Unit 3. In addition, the last pump had briefly stopped working when its fuel ran out. To replenish the water, the contained pressure {{would have to be}} lowered first by opening a valve of the vessel. The unit's air flow gauge was accidentally turned off and, with the gauge turned off, flow of water into the reactor was blocked leading to full exposure of the rods. As of 04:11 JST on 15 March, water was being pumped into the reactor of Unit 2 again.|$|E
500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} modalities {{exist to}} demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The gold standard is cerebral angiography (with or without digital subtraction angiography). This involves puncture {{of a large}} artery (usually the femoral artery) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the aorta towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, radiocontrast is injected and its downstream flow captured on fluoroscopy (continuous X-ray imaging). The vessel may appear stenotic (narrowed, 41–75%), occluded (blocked, 18–49%), or as an aneurysm (area of dilation, 5–13%). The narrowing may be described as [...] "rat's tail" [...] or [...] "string sign". Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure, and it requires large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as kidney damage. Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> wall, as opposed to more modern modalities. The only remaining use of angiography is when endovascular treatment is contemplated (see below).|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{operational}} and maintenance obstacles, {{construction of the}} pump enabled Boyle to conduct a great many experiments on the properties of air, which he later detailed in his New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects, (Made, for the Most Part, in a New Pneumatical Engine). In the book, he described in great detail 43 experiments he conducted, on occasion assisted by Hooke, {{on the effect of}} air on various phenomena. Boyle tested the effects of [...] "rarified" [...] air on combustion, magnetism, sound, and barometers, and examined the effects of increased air pressure on various substances. He listed two experiments on living creatures: [...] "Experiment 40," [...] which tested the ability of insects to fly under reduced air pressure, and the dramatic [...] "Experiment 41," [...] which demonstrated the reliance of living creatures on air for their survival.
