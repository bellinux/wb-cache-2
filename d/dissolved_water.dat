25|$|Until the 1960s, {{interpretation}} of the igneous rock record was largely qualitative. Ian Carmichael wanted to determine quantitative information such as the temperature and pressure of the magma when crystals were formed as well as <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> and oxygen content. For this, thermodynamic models were needed. Although attempts to apply rigorous thermodynamics to igneous processes go back to at least 1949, they were hindered {{by a lack of}} experimental data. Using tools such as a drop calorimeter and wet chemistry, Carmichael and colleagues set out to systematically explore thermodynamic properties of magma at high temperatures.|$|E

The SS nanofibers were completely <b>dissolved</b> in <b>water</b> after a short immersion time (1 h), while the SF nanofibers were not <b>dissolved</b> in <b>water.</b> The SS/SF blend nanofibers, containing higher amounts of SS, were more easily <b>dissolved</b> in <b>water.</b> The SS/SF (100 / 0, 75 / 25, and 50 / 50) blend nanofibers were completely <b>dissolved</b> in <b>water</b> within 1 h. However, when the SF component was greater than the SS component, as in the SS/SF blend nanofibers (25 / 75), {{they could not be}} completely <b>dissolved</b> in <b>water.</b> Over the same time period, the SS/SF blend nanofibers could not be dissolved in methanol.|$|R

50|$|Fuel system icing {{inhibitor}} (FSII) is an additive to aviation fuels that prevents {{the formation of}} ice in fuel lines. FSII is sometimes referred to by the registered, genericized trademark Prist. Jet fuel can contain {{a small amount of}} <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> that does not appear in droplet form. As an aircraft gains altitude, the temperature drops and Jet fuel's capacity to hold water is diminished. <b>Dissolved</b> <b>water</b> can separate out and could become a serious problem if it freezes in fuel lines or filters, blocking the flow of fuel and shutting down an engine.|$|E

50|$|Oxygen {{enters the}} water through diffusion. The amount of oxygen {{that can be}} <b>dissolved</b> in <b>water</b> depends on the {{atmospheric}} pressure, the water temperature and whether the water is salty. For example, at 20 °C (68 °F) and one atmosphere of pressure, a maximum of 8 mg/l of oxygen can <b>dissolve</b> in sea <b>water</b> (35 mg/l salinity) while a maximum of 9 mg/l of oxygen can <b>dissolve</b> in fresh <b>water.</b> The amount of oxygen that can be <b>dissolved</b> in the <b>water</b> decreases by about 1 mg/l for each 10 °C increase in water temperature above 20 °C.|$|R

5000|$|Physicochemical {{methods are}} based on the use of coagulants and {{adsorbents}} [...] Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of sulphonic acid. In addition, clay treatment leads to higher resistance to oil oxidation at high temperatures and increased colour stability. This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste oil re-refining and transformer oil regeneration systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.|$|E
50|$|FSII is {{an agent}} that {{is mixed with}} jet fuel as it is pumped into the aircraft. The mixture of FSII must be between 0.10% and 0.15% by volume for the {{additive}} to work correctly, and the FSII must be distributed evenly throughout the fuel. Simply adding FSII after the fuel has been pumped is therefore not sufficient. As aircraft climbs after takeoff, the temperature drops, and any <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> will separate out from the fuel. FSII dissolves itself in water preferentially over the jet fuel, where it then serves to depress the freezing point of water to -43 °C. Since the freezing point of jet fuel itself is usually in this region, the formation of ice is now a minimal concern.|$|E
50|$|It is very {{important}} that jet fuel be free from water contamination. During flight, the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases, due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere. This causes precipitation of the <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> from the fuel. The separated water then drops {{to the bottom of the}} tank, because it is denser than the fuel. Since the water is no longer in solution, it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0 °C. If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes. This was the cause of the British Airways Flight 38 accident. Removing all water from fuel is impractical; therefore, fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{key factors}} in {{generating}} a Hawaiian eruption are basaltic magma {{and a low}} percentage of <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> (less than one percent). The lower the water content, the more peaceful is the resulting flow. Almost all lava that comes from Hawaiian volcanoes is basalt in composition. Hawaiian basalts that make up {{almost all of the}} islands are tholeiite. These rocks are similar but not identical to those that are produced at ocean ridges. Basalt relatively richer in sodium and potassium (more alkaline) has erupted at the undersea volcano of Lōihi at the extreme southeastern end of the volcanic chain, and these rocks may be typical of early stages in the [...] "evolution" [...] of all Hawaiian islands. In the late stages of eruption of individual volcanoes, more alkaline basalt also was erupted, and in the very late stages after a period of erosion, rocks of unusual composition such as nephelinite were produced in very small amounts. These variations in magma composition have been investigated in great detail, in part to try to understand how mantle plumes may work.|$|E
5000|$|Relatively {{small and}} compositionally {{distinct}} plutons, {{known as the}} Roosevelt Gabbros, {{are found in the}} eastern and central Wichita Mountains. Like the layered complex, these are dark rocks. Unlike the layered complex, they contain appreciable amounts of biotite, a mineral that forms in magmas with elevated <b>dissolved</b> <b>water.</b> One of these bodies, the Mount Sheridan Gabbro, is exposed in roadcuts at Meers and underlies the Mount Scott Granite {{on the north side of}} the wildlife refuge. Weathered gabbroic soils are thicker and support more vegetation than those generated on weathered granite, so the tree line on the north side of Mount Sheridan approximates the contact between the Mount Sheridan Gabbro and the Mount Scott Granite. Geologic relationships suggest that the granites and gabbros intruded at depths no greater than half a kilometer in the crust. Minor uplift ensued, and magmatism concluded with the intrusive emplacement of subvolcanic features: rhyolite and diabase dikes. [...] These are poorly exposed, with the exception of a large diabase dike in the Mount Scott Granite revealed during the recent widening of Oklahoma State Highway 49, just west of Interstate 44. Following the cessation of magmatism, the region subsided and was inundated by a shallow sea, resulting in the deposition of detrital sediments followed by carbonates. The light-colored rocks exposed in the Slick Hills are lower Paleozoic marine sediments.|$|E
40|$|We have {{conducted}} some field experiments to study CO 2 sequestration in solid minerals by injecting CO 2 <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> into a high temperature borehole, OGC- 2, at the Ogachi Hot Dry Rock geothermal site in Japan. OGC- 2 was drilled into granitic rock {{to a depth}} of 1, 100 m and the bottom-hole temperature was measured around 210 degree C. Ca concentration of the water sampled at 1, 030 m depth in OGC- 2 increased to a maximum of 85. 2 mg/L in a few hours after CO 2 <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> (3 weight %) injection. Then the Ca concentration decreased in a few days.

40|$|New {{experiments}} {{on the effect}} of <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> on the ferric–ferrous ratio of silicic melts have been performed at 200 MPa, between 800 °C and 1000 °C and for fO 2 between NNO− 1. 35 and NNO+ 6. 6. Water-saturated conditions were investigated. Compositions studied include six metaluminous synthetic melts, with FeOtot progressively increasing from 0. 47 to 4. 25 wt. %, two natural obsidian glasses (one peraluminous and the other peralkaline) and a synthetic rhyolitic glass having the composition of the matrix glass of the June 15, 1991 Pinatubo dacite. Ferrous iron was analyzed by titration and FeOtot by electron microprobe. Variation of quench rate was found to have no detectable effect on the ferric–ferrous ratio of the hydrous silicic melts investigated. At NNO, no dependence of the ferric–ferrous ratio with temperature is observed. At fO 2 NNO+ 1, the experimental ferric–ferrous ratios are equal or lower than calculated. The peralkaline samples show the same type of behaviour. A non-linear relationship between XFe 2 O 3 /XFeO and fO 2 implies that a term for <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> must be added to the KC equation {{if it is to be}} applied to the calculation of ferric–ferrous ratios of hydrous silicic melts. Above NNO+ 1, the ferric–ferrous ratio is essentially controlled by the anhydrous melt composition and fO 2. However, differences exist between measured and calculated ferric–ferrous ratios of silicic melts that are not all attributable to the effect of <b>dissolved</b> <b>water.</b> Additional work is needed to describe more precisely the dependence of the ferric–ferrous ratio on anhydrous melt composition. The oxidizing effect of water is restricted to relatively reduced magmatic liquids. In oxidized calk-alkaline magma series, the presence of <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> will not largely influence melt ferric–ferrous ratios...|$|E
40|$|This study {{details the}} steps {{involved}} in fabrication, deployment and retrieval of mainly polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) passive sampling devices deployed {{in a number}} of locations in and around Ireland in an attempt to derive <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> concentrations of contaminants in-situ. PDMS samplers were initially deployed in the Burrishoole catchment, Co. Mayo in conjunction with the collection of biological tissues and sediment to investigate the source of elevated dioxins in the catchment. Passive samplers were used to generate <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and also to successfully screen for the presence of dioxins in the water column. The dioxin profile present was also found in sediment and biological tissue and through statistical profiling potential sources were identified as being possibly related to the use of technical pentachlorophenol in the catchment though no direct evidence was found. Passive samplers (PDMS and SPMD) were then deployed at various depths on the M 6 weather buoy, 400 miles off the West Coast of Ireland, in conjunction with temperature and salinity monitors to test how the technology would fare over a long period deployment (585 days) in a harsh, dynamic environment. The PDMS samplers were almost completly lost where the SPMDs last better (80 % recovered). <b>Dissolved</b> <b>water</b> concentrations estimated using both sampler types were found to be very low (<ppb) with polyaromatic hydrocarbons found in higher levels than polychlorinated biphenlys, and organochlorine compounds. The use of statistical analysis suggests that passive samplers {{can also be used to}} differentiate different water masses by investigating contaminant loadings at each depth sampled. Finally passive samplers were deployed in various inshore and inland waters across Ireland with the results indicating that the remote West of Ireland had the lowest levels of <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> concentrations estimated. Many estuaries and inland water bodies had levels of contaminants higher than the west of Ireland with the heavily industrialised Cork and Dublin sites having the highest levels estimated. The separation of sites based on concentrations found indicated that assessment criteria could be generated in an Irish context (IRef) which could be used to classify a site in relation to ‘background’ levels found in the West of Ireland and at M 6. The results generated during this study were then assessed based on various legislative requirements and assessment criteria such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Oslo Paris convention (OSPAR). Results from the WFD assessment indicate that concentrations found at all sites were below the EQS values set down. However this EQS value is based on total water concentration hence the EQS was modified to a <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> concentration basis. This reduced the total water EQS values by up to 80 % for some analytes however in most locations the <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> concentrations found were at or below this <b>dissolved</b> <b>water</b> EQS value indicating that the levels of contaminants from across Ireland are below the EQS values generated as part of the WFD. Assessments were also made on the concentrations found across Ireland using background assessment criteria (BAC) suggested by OSPAR. The results indicate that the levels across Ireland are above the BAC for most compounds with the M 6 weather buoy faring better. Concentrations from “pristine” Irish sites were then chosen to generate reference criteria on an Irish basis (IRef) which were found to be below the concentration levels suggested as part of the BAC assessment criteria in the majority of locations.
