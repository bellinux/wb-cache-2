5|$|Back at Berkeley from Johns Hopkins, Stratton stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> {{department}} as its second faculty member and first psychology specialist until the psychology department broke off in 1922. The new department started with four people: Stratton as chair; Edward Chace Tolman, with a Harvard degree, and an initiator of rodent experiments soiling {{the rooms of}} the philosophy department and hastening the split of the psychology division; Brown, Stratton's earlier student and Berkeley faculty member from 1908 onward; and Olga Bridgman, the first Berkeley psychology PhD awardee, albeit from the philosophy department. Before the split Stratton had set up Berkeley's first psychology lab <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> department and taught psychology courses with Brown. The courses included sensation, perception, emotion, memory, and applications of psychology to professions such as law, medicine, schooling and clerical work by priests.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{corporeal}} beings and, as such, {{they are}} subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of mind. There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: biology, computer science, cognitive science, cybernetics, linguistics, medicine, pharmacology, and psychology.|$|E
5|$|Stratton then {{obtained}} an A.M. {{degree from}} Yale in 1890. He {{was a fellow}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> department at Berkeley from 1891 to 1893. The chair of the philosophy department, George Holmes Howison, whom he met as an undergraduate, would become a significant influence on his life. He taught two philosophy courses, both with Howison. On March 14, 1893 he was appointed an instructor {{in the department of}} philosophy. As an instructor, he began teaching psychology and logic courses, in addition to a philosophy course.|$|E

5|$|There are countless {{subjects}} that {{are affected by}} the ideas developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of death and its definitive character, the nature of emotion, of perception and of memory. Questions about what a person is and what his or her identity consists of also {{have much to do with}} the philosophy of mind. There are two {{subjects that}}, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: free will and the self.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{eventually}} {{applied for}} a Rhodes Scholarship and learned in December of his senior year at West Point {{that he had been}} accepted. He spent his summer at the United States Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philosophy,</b> Politics, and Economics (PPE) program during his Rhodes Scholarship, completing his degree at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in August 1968. While he was at Oxford, a Jewish cousin of Clark's who lived in England telephoned him and informed him of his Jewish heritage, having received permission from Veneta Clark. Clark spent three months after graduation at Fort Knox, Kentucky, going through Armor Officer Basic Course, then went on to Ranger School at Fort Benning. He was promoted to captain and was assigned as commander of the A Company of the 4th Battalion, 68th Armor, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Rona {{was born}} on 20 March 1890 in Budapest, Hungary, to Ida, (née Mahler) and Samuel Róna. Her father was a prosperous Jewish {{physician}} who worked with Louis Wickham and Henri-August Dominici, founders of radium therapy, to introduce the techniques to Budapest, and installed {{one of the first}} x-ray machines there. Elizabeth wanted to become a physician like her father, but Samuel believed that it would be too difficult for a woman to attain. Though he died when she was in her second year of university, Rona's father had encouraged her and spurred her interest in science from a young age. She enrolled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philosophy</b> Faculty at the University of Budapest, studying chemistry, geochemistry, and physics, receiving her PhD in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Howison {{obtained}} a fellowship from the University of California for his protege {{to study at}} the University of Leipzig. On May 17, 1894, Stratton married Alice Miller at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Berkeley, while being an instructor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> department. Immediately after, the couple left for the East {{on their way to}} Europe, with Stratton taking a leave of absence from Berkeley. He then spent two years at Wundt's Institute for Experimental Psychology at Leipzig, from where he received an M.A. and a PhD in 1896. He received his degree summa cum laude, with a thesis submitted to Wundt's publication, Philosophische Studien.|$|E
5|$|Impressed with Abovian's {{thirst for}} knowledge, Parrot {{arranged}} for a Russian state scholarship for Abovian to study at the University of Dorpat in 1830. He entered the university directly without additional preparation and studied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philosophy</b> faculty of the Philological-Historical department from September 3, 1830 until January 18, 1836. The years in Dorpat were very fruitful for Abovian who studied social and natural sciences, European literature and philosophy, and mastered German, Russian, French and Latin. At this time Abovian fell {{under the influence of}} German Romanticism. In addition, Abovian established numerous contacts with European intellectuals of the time. At the university he became friends with the sons of Nikolay Karamzin who studied with him. In 1834 Abovian visited his cousin Maria (daughter of melik Sahak Aghamalian) in St. Petersburg, then married to the Georgian Prince Alexander. Prior to graduation, Abovian learned his mother Takuhi had died.|$|E
5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the early}} Church Fathers sought to {{incorporate}} the until then pagan concept of natural law into Christianity.

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using {{the tools of the}} philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{initially}} attended Palatine Joseph Technical University in Budapest, but his {{engineering studies}} were interrupted by {{service in the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He left Hungary for Germany in 1919, enrolling at Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, but became bored with engineering and transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he studied physics. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Maxwell's demon, a long-standing puzzle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of thermal and statistical physics. Szilard {{was the first to}} recognize the connection between thermodynamics and Information theory.|$|E
5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} book {{mentioned}} above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A Letter to a Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Arévalo Bermejo {{was born}} into a middle-class family in 1904. He became a primary school teacher for a brief while, and then earned a {{scholarship}} to a university in Argentina, where he earned a doctorate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophy</b> of education. He returned to Guatemala in 1934, and sought a position in the Ministry of Education. However, he was denied the position he wished for, and felt uncomfortable under the dictatorship of Ubico. He left the country and held a faculty position in Argentina until 1944, when he returned to Guatemala. In July 1944 the Renovación Nacional, the teachers' party, had been formed, and Arévalo was named its candidate. In an unexpected surge of support, his candidacy was endorsed by many of the leading organizations among the protesters, including the student federation. His lack of connection to the dictatorship and his academic background both worked in his favor among the students and teachers. At the same time, {{the fact that he had}} chosen to go into exile in conservative Argentina rather than revolutionary Mexico reassured landowners worried about socialist or communist reform.|$|E
50|$|Although {{condemned}} in 1277, many Averroistic theses {{survived to}} the sixteenth century, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> University of Padua, {{and can be}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>philosophies</b> of Giordano Bruno, Pico della Mirandola, and Cesare Cremonini. These theses talk about the superiority of philosophers to the common people and the relation between the intellect and human dignity.|$|R
