Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>when</b> you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

She wrote: [...] "He {{was a great}} letter writer. Endless letters, and <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> he wrote you a letter he wrote pages." [...] His correspondence with Eleanor Jacques (London) was more prosaic, dwelling on a closer relationship and referring to past rendezvous or planning future ones in London and Burnham Beeches.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents {{and opponents}} have been both criticized for overstating the {{benefits}} or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. [...] A 2007 Nuffield Council on Bioethics report concluded that good evidence for or against water fluoridation is lacking. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy. John Doull, chairman of the 2006 National Research Council committee report on fluoride in drinking water, has stated a similar conclusion regarding {{the source of the}} controversy: [...] "In the scientific community, people tend to think this is settled. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>when</b> the U.S. surgeon general comes out and says {{this is one of the}} 10 greatest achievements of the 20th century, that’s a hard hurdle to get over. But when we looked at the studies that have been done, we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should, considering how long this [...] has been going on. I think that’s why fluoridation is still being challenged so many years after it began. In the face of ignorance, controversy is rampant." ...|$|E

2500|$|For nearly 30 years, Kiedis and Faith No More/Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton {{have been}} {{involved}} in an ongoing feud. Faith No More (then fronted by Chuck Mosley) and The Red Hot Chili Peppers prior to the feud had toured together in support of their 1987 funk metal albums The Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Introduce Yourself. However things turned ugly between the two in 1989 when Kiedis accused Mosley's replacement Patton of imitating his style on stage and in their music video for their biggest hit [...] "Epic" [...] (from 1989's follow up to Introduce Yourself, The Real Thing). Kiedis stated “I watched [...] “Epic” video, and I see him jumping up and down, rapping, and it looked like I was looking in a mirror. I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>when</b> I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?'". The feud between the two was reignited in 1999 when Mr. Bungle was scheduled to release their album California on June 8, 1999 but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back a week so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Mr. Bungle claimed that Kiedis had them removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe claiming that as the headlining act at the festivals, the Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of The Real Thing, Faith No More {{developed}} somewhat of a rivalry with fellow Californian funk rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, whom they had previously played with on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour. Singer Anthony Kiedis accused Mike Patton of stealing his [...] "style" [...] in the [...] "Epic" [...] music video. He told Kerrang! magazine [...] "My drummer says he’s gonna kidnap , shave his hair off and cut off one of his feet, just so he’ll be forced to find a style of his own". In a separate interview, he clarified his comment, remarking [...] "I love The Real Thing, and I liked his vocals on that record. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>when</b> I heard the record I noticed subtle similarities, but when I saw that video it was like, 'Wait a second here, what the fuck?.'" [...] Roddy Bottum responded by saying [...] "To me, our band sounds nothing like Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you're talking about long hair, rapping with his shirt off, then yeah, I can see similarities. But beyond that, I can't see any. I haven't talked to them since this whole thing started. We're really good friends with that band and i'd like to think they're doing it... like as a favour". Mike Patton finally addressed the allegations from Kiedis in 1990, commenting that [...] "It just kind of {{came out of the}} blue. It doesn't bother me a bit. I got a real big kick out of it to tell you the truth. I mean, if he's gonna talk about me in interviews, that's fine - it's free press! Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does. And if he would stop doing drugs I think he could outdance me. Maybe one day we'll have a breakoff, just breakdance." ...|$|E
