60|$|Mrs. Cluppins was a little, brisk, busy-looking woman; Mrs. Sanders was a big, fat, <b>heavy-faced</b> personage; and the {{two were}} the company.|$|E
60|$|Another man {{was with}} the Baron, a <b>heavy-faced</b> fellow clad in a leathern jerkin over which was drawn a short coat of linked mail.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you talking}} about? What matter?" [...] asked D'Hubert with a sidelong look at the <b>heavy-faced,</b> gray-haired figure seated on a wooden chair.|$|E
60|$|Thus invited, the man {{spoke at}} once, and with {{unexpected}} vigour. He was a stupid-looking, <b>heavy-faced</b> man, but when roused, as he then was, his face lighted up amazingly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By your leave, zur!' said a burly, <b>heavy-faced</b> {{man in a}} {{velveteen}} jacket, {{riding up}} upon my bridle-arm. 'Can you tell me whether his Grace of Beaufort is in Bristol or at his house o' Badminton?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Pratt came {{in quite}} briskly, a <b>heavy-faced,</b> white-bearded man, wearing a sack-suit and an old-fashioned turn-down collar. He greeted Britt with a casual hand-shake, looking at Kate suspiciously. [...] "And who is this?" [...] he asked, bluffly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This raillery, sir,' {{said the}} elder of the three, a squat, brown, <b>heavy-faced</b> man, 'is not undeserved, and yet might perchance be {{dispensed}} with. I am free {{to say that}} our friend attacked you somewhat hastily, and that a little more deference should have been shown by so young a soldier to a cavalier of your experience.' ...|$|E
60|$|The American, that curious {{compound}} of impudence and sensitiveness, was annoyed. He felt {{a strong desire}} to hustle them all along a bit and teach them business habits; the hoary old dog and the grizzled, <b>heavy-faced</b> old butler with his prehistoric shirt-front, and the drowsy old moon, and above all the scatter-brained old philosopher who couldn't keep an appointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "That may be it, {{or perhaps}} he will be buried in one; at any rate he is strangely mixed up with baskets. Well, there are others with you, a middle-aged, <b>heavy-faced</b> man, is he not Dirk van Goorl, your stepfather? And--wait--a young fellow with rather a {{pleasant}} face, also a relation. I see his name, but I can't spell it. F--F--o--i, faith in the French tongue, odd name for a heretic." ...|$|E
60|$|Next {{appeared}} the Prince of Kesh himself, a short, stout, broad-shouldered young man, thick-featured, <b>heavy-faced,</b> and having large, rolling eyes. He was clad in festal garments, and hung about with heavy chains of gold fastened with clasps of glittering stones, while from his crisp, black hair rose a tall plume of nodding ostrich feathers. Fan bearers walked beside him, {{and the train}} of his long cloak was borne by two black and hideous dwarfs, full-grown men but no taller than a child of eight.|$|E
6000|$|We dined {{that night}} at a table-d'hote, and I found myself next to an Englishwoman who began a {{conversation}} that was resumed presently in the hotel lounge. She was a woman of perhaps thirty-three or thirty-four, slenderly built, with a warm reddish skin and very abundant fair golden hair, {{the wife of a}} petulant-looking <b>heavy-faced</b> man of perhaps fifty-three, who smoked a cigar and dozed over his coffee and presently went to bed. [...] "He always goes to bed like that," [...] she confided startlingly. [...] "He sleeps after all his meals. I never knew such a man to sleep." ...|$|E
60|$|These quiet {{proceedings}} {{took place}} {{just before the}} <b>heavy-faced</b> Eskimo began the speech which we have detailed. Notwithstanding the serious-- it might be bloody--work which was presently to engage all his physical energies, the spirit of Angut was deeply stirred by the string of objections which the man had flung out so easily. Most of the points touched on had often engaged his thoughtful mind, and he felt--as many reasoning men have felt before and since--how easy {{it is for a}} fool to state a string of objections in a few minutes, which it might take a learned man several hours fully to answer and refute.|$|E
60|$|We {{had broken}} {{suddenly}} into a lovely glade of greensward surrounded by ancient trees. On the farther side of it, {{under the shadow}} of a mighty oak, there stood a singular group of three people. One was a woman, our client, drooping and faint, a handkerchief round her mouth. Opposite her stood a brutal, <b>heavy-faced,</b> red-moustached young man, his gaitered legs parted wide, one arm akimbo, the other waving a riding crop, his whole attitude suggestive of triumphant bravado. Between them an elderly, gray-bearded man, wearing a short surplice over a light tweed suit, had evidently just completed the wedding service, for he pocketed his prayer-book as we appeared, and slapped the sinister bridegroom upon the back in jovial congratulation.|$|E
60|$|She was wonderfully apparelled in a low-cut garment {{of white}} silk, over which fell a mantle of the {{imperial}} purple, and I noted that on her dazzling bosom hung that necklace of emerald beetles separated by golden shells which she had caused to be copied from my own. On her fair hair that grew low upon her forehead and was parted in the middle, she wore a diadem of gold in which were set emeralds to match the beetles of the necklace. The Augustus was arrayed in the festal garments of a CÃ¦sar, also covered with a purple cloak. He was a <b>heavy-faced</b> and somewhat stupid-looking youth, dark-haired, like his father and uncles, but having large, blue, and not unkindly eyes. From his flushed face I gathered that he had drunk well of the strong Greek wine, and from the sullen look about his mouth that, as was common, he had been quarrelling with his mother.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is Lord Grey of Wark,' said he; 'the little middle-aged {{lean man}} at the King's bridle arm. He hath been in the Tower once for treason. 'Twas he who fled with the Lady Henrietta Berkeley, his wife's sister. A fine leader truly for a godly cause! The man upon his left, with the red swollen face and the white feather in his cap, is Colonel Holmes. I trust that he will never show the white feather save on his head. The other upon the high {{chestnut}} horse is a lawyer, though, by my soul, he is a better man at ordering a battalion than at drawing a bill of costs. He is the republican Wade who led the foot at the skirmish at Bridport, and brought them off with safety. The tall <b>heavy-faced</b> soldier in the steel bonnet is Anthony Buyse, the Brandenburger, a soldado of fortune, and a man of high heart, as are most of his countrymen. I have fought both with him and against him ere now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are cavaliers of Spain {{who have}} {{followed}} {{him in his}} exile. The one at his elbow is Fernando de Castro, who is as brave and true a man as heart could wish. In front to the right are the Gascon lords. You may well tell them by their clouded brows, for there hath been some ill-will of late betwixt the prince and them. The tall and burly man is the Captal de Buch, whom I doubt not that you know, for a braver knight never laid lance in rest. That <b>heavy-faced</b> cavalier who plucks his skirts and whispers in his ear is Lord Oliver de Clisson, known also as the butcher. He it is who stirs up strife, and forever blows the dying embers into flame. The man with the mole upon his cheek is the Lord Pommers, and his two brothers stand behind him, with the Lord Lesparre, Lord de Rosem, Lord de Mucident, Sir Perducas d'Albret, the Souldich de la Trane, and others. Further back are knights from Quercy, Limousin, Saintonge, Poitou, and Aquitaine, with the valiant Sir Guiscard d'Angle. That is he in the rose-colored doublet with the ermine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Foolish fellow!" [...] he said, turning with {{a blazing}} {{gaze to the}} <b>heavy-faced</b> man. [...] "You talk like a child {{of what you do}} not understand. You ask to see God, else you won't believe. You believe in your life, don't you? Yet you have never seen it. You stab a bear, and let its life out. You know when the life is there. You have let it out. You know when it is gone. But you have not seen it. Then why do you believe in it? You do not see a sound, yet you believe in it. Do not lift your stupid face; I know what you would say: you hear the sound, {{therefore}} it exists. A deaf man does not hear the sound. Does it therefore not exist? That which produces the sound is there, though the deaf man neither sees nor hears, nor feels nor tastes, nor smells it. My friend, the man of God, says he thinks the cause of sound is motion in the air passing from particle to particle, till the last particle next my ear is moved, and then--I hear. Is there, then, no motion in the air to cause sound because the deaf man does not hear? ...|$|E
6000|$|August 18th.--There {{has come}} {{one of the}} proprietors, or superintendents, of a caravan of animals,--a large, portly paunched, dark-complexioned, brandy-burnt, <b>heavy-faced</b> man of about fifty; with a {{diminutive}} nose {{in proportion to the}} size of his face,--thick lips; nevertheless he has the air {{of a man who has}} seen much, and derived such experience as was for his purpose. Also it is the air of a man not in a subordinate station, though vulgar and coarse. He arrived in a wagon, with a span of handsome gray horses, and ordered dinner. He had left his caravan at Worcester, and came from thence and over the mountain hither, to settle stopping-places for the caravan. The nearest place to this. I believe, was Charlemont; the penultimate at Greenfield. In stopping at such a village as this, they do not expect much profit, if any; but would be content with enough to pay their travelling expenses, while they look to gather gain at larger places. In this village, it seems, the selectmen had resolved not to license any public exhibition of the kind; and it was interesting to attend to the consultations whether it were feasible to overcome the objections, and what might be the best means. Orrin S------ and the chance passers-by took part in the discussion. The scruple is that the factory-girls, having ready money by them, spend it for these nonsenses, quitting their work; whereas, were it a mere farming-town, the caravan would take little in proportion to their spendings. The opinion generally was that the license could not be obtained; and the portly man's face grew darker and downcast at the prospect; and he took out a travelling-map, and looked it carefully over, to discover some other station. This is something like the planning of the march of an army. It was finally resolved to enlist the influence of a brother-in-law of the head selectman, and try to gain his consent. Whereupon the caravan-man and the brother-in-law (who, being a tavern-keeper, was to divide the custom of the caravan people with this house) went to make the attempt,--the caravan-man stalking along with stiff, awkward bulk and stature, yet preserving a respectability withal, though with somewhat of the blackguard. Before he went, he offered a wager of [...] "a drink of rum to a thaw of tobacco" [...] that he did not succeed. When he came back, there was a flush in his face and a sparkle in his eye that did not look like failure; but I know not what was the result. He took a glass of wine with the brother-in-law,--a grave, thin, frosty-haired, shrewd-looking yeoman, in his shirt-sleeves,--then ordered his horses, paid his bill, and drove off, accompanied still by the same yeoman, perhaps to get the permission of the other two selectmen. If he does not get a license here, he will try at Cheshire.|$|E
