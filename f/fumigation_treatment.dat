Plants for the chemical analyses and feeding trials were harvested from the understory of control (ambient air), elevated CO 2 (560 µl CO 2 l(- 1)), and elevated O 3 (ambient × 1. 5) rings at the Aspen FACE (Free Air CO 2 Enrichment) site near Rhinelander, Wisconsin. We assigned individual voles to receive plants from only one FACE ring and recorded plant consumption and weanling body mass for seven days. Elevated CO 2 and O 3 altered the foliar chemistry of both forbs, but only female weanling voles on the O 3 diet showed negative responses to these changes. Elevated CO 2 increased the fiber fractions of both plant species, whereas O 3 fumigation elicited strong responses among many phytochemical components, most notably increasing the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio by 40 % and decreasing N by 26 %. Consumption did not differ between plant species or among <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatments.</b> Male voles were unaffected by the <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatments,</b> whereas female voles grew 36 % less than controls when fed O 3 -grown plants.

30|$|Irrespective {{of storage}} conditions, {{the rates of}} {{respiratory}} CO 2 release of log sections remained high {{during the first two}} weeks post harvest and declined rapidly within the next a few weeks as logs become dehydrated. A logical recommendation for the forestry industry would be to apply <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatments</b> after 4 – 6 weeks post harvest to reduce the interference with insecticides. The respiration rate increased nearly 50 % for every 10 °C increase in temperature so the CO 2 issue is exacerbated during the warm summer months when a temperature-driven stimulation of respiratory processes will result in very high CO 2 concentrations in ship holds. Also, because respiratory processes are strongly dependent on moisture availability, any actions that can be taken to accelerate moisture loss will mitigate the CO 2 issue.|$|R

40|$|Oxygenated {{phosphine}} fumigations (fumigations under superatmospheric oxygen levels) {{were found}} to be significantly more effective than fumigations under the normal oxygen level against different life stages of insect pests (Liu 2011). This new finding has a potential to be used to develop more effective and shorter <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatments</b> for postharvest pest control. Both advantages and disadvantages of oxygenated phosphine fumigation are discussed. Phosphine emerges as an alternative to methyl bromide for postharvest pest control as methyl bromide is being phased out globally. However, phosphine acts slowly in killing insects and it may take over 10 days to kill tolerant ones. Phosphine is also less effective at lower temperatures and takes much longer to control pests as compared with treatments at higher temperatures. Therefore, more effective phosphine fumigations would be desirable to shorten treatment times and reduce fumigation costs. Carbon dioxide enhances phosphine toxicities to a limited extent. However, many fresh products such as lettuce are sensitive to CO 2 and therefore a phosphine-CO 2 mixture may not be a suitable fumigant for sensitive commodities, especially when fumigations may last for several days at low temperatures. Oxygen is essential to the toxicity of phosphine against insects in the past (Bond 1963, Bon...|$|R

We identiﬁed 1531 females and 2 males of 7 diﬀerent Culicoides species in nests, with C. simulator being the most abundant species, followed by C. kibunensis, C. festivipennis, C. segnis, C. truncorum, C. pictipennis and C. circumscriptus. We conducted a medi- cationrfumigation experiment randomly assigning bird’s nests to diﬀerent treatments, thereby generating groups of medicated and control pairs breeding in fumigated and control nests. Medicated pairs were injected with the anti-malarial drug Primaquine diluted in saline solution while control pairs were injected with saline solution. The <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatment</b> was carried out using insecticide solution or water for fumigated and control nests respectively. Brood size was the main factor associated with the abundance of biting midges probably because more nestlings may produce higher quantities of vector attractants.

C. globosum was exposed to the gas both as colonies and as ascospores without asci and perithecia. After treatment, all organisms were tested for colony growth using an agar plating technique. Colonies of S. chartarum were also tested for toxicity using a yeast toxicity assay with a high specificity for trichothecene mycotoxins. Results showed that chlorine dioxide gas at both concentrations completely inactivated all organisms except for C. globosum colonies which were inactivated an average of 89 %. More than 99 % of ascospores of C. globosum were nonculturable. For all ascospore counts, mean test readings were lower than the controls (P < 0. 001), indicating that some ascospores {{may also have been}} destroyed. Colonies of S. chartarum were still toxic after treatment.

An irradiation dose of 2. 0 kGy resulted in the maximum inhibition of C. gloeosporioides and P. expansum spore germination. The gamma irradiation dose required to reduce the spore germination by 90 % was 0. 22 and 0. 35 kGy for C. gloeosporioides and P. expansum, respectively. Microscopic observations revealed that when the fungal spores were treated with gamma irradiation (4. 0 kGy), conidial germination was stopped completely resulting in no germ tube formation in C. gloeosporioides.

We measured the effects of CO 2 and O 3 on nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen (C:N), and condensed tannin levels in aspen and birch leaves and senescent litter {{and also in the}} frass of folivores fed aspen or birch green leaves. Overall, the effects of elevated CO 2 on foliar chemistry were less pronounced than those of elevated O 3, and aspen responded more strongly than birch.

30|$|Soil {{respiration}} {{measurements were}} repeated after the chloroform <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatment</b> of soil.

In fact, the re-emergent microbial activity had more accessible carbon to respire. Despite the enhanced respiration due to fumigation, the oxidative treatment with water-soluble Fe-Pha catalyst still enabled a reduction of about 50 % of CO 2 emission respect to control. Again, this finding confirms that the catalyzed oxidative polymerization of SOM phenolic components reduced CO 2 emission from soil because of the increased difficulty of soil microbial communities to mineralize SOM, due to either an enhanced chemical stabilization or physical protection in less accessible micro-aggregates.|$|E

Four candidate fumigants are investigated: sulfuryl fluoride (SF), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), phosphine (PH 3) and cyanogen (EDN) in conjunction with five standard metals: silver (Ag), tin (Sn), iron (Fe), lead (Pb) and copper (Cu). The applied procedure is detailed including the fumigation protocol and the description of a specific electrochemical twin cells device.

Sulfuryl fluoride (SF) can be recommended for cultural heritage but care has to be taken in presence of Pb, Sn and Cu. DMDS is also a good alternative candidate, however, it affects greatly Cu coloration and promotes Pb corrosion. Phosphine (PH 3) is dramatic for Cu and has to be avoided while the efficient biocide EDN increases corrosion of Ag and Cu even if low color variation is observed.

40|$|Market {{demand for}} {{milkfish}} (C. chanos Forskåll, 1775) is continually to increase, {{since it is}} used for consumption and live bait for tuna and skipjack. The purpose {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of the Divine cigarette fumigation in fish feed on the growth of milkfish (C. chanos Forskåll, 1775). This research used experimental laboratories method with 4 treatments and 3 replications. The first treatment (A) was fumigation the Divine cigarette on fish feed for 5 minutes, the second treatment (B) for 10 minutes, the third treatment (C) for 15 minutes, and the fourth treatment (K) for without fumigation (control). Results of this research showed the highest specific growth rate was obtioned in treatment C which was equal to 2. 51 % daily. The lowest of mercury content was on the treatment A and C, resulting in decreased levels of mercury in milkfish (C. chanos Forskåll, 1775). Based on the result it can be concluced that the <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatment</b> of Divine cigarette for 15 minutes in fish feed can increased the specific growth rate of the milkfish (C. chanos Forskåll, 1775) ...|$|E
40|$|Sulfuryl {{fluoride}} (SF) {{is being}} investigated {{as an alternative to}} methyl bromide (MB) for use on certain commodities and in structures such as flour mills. Unlike MB it is inorganic and harmless to the ozone layer. The gas is almost insoluble in water, is non-flammable, and has a high vapour pressure (boiling at- 55 oC). It has potential advantages over many other candidate chemicals; it is non reactive with structural materials and electronic equipment and, although high doses are needed to kill eggs, it has a rapid action against pests. Furthermore, it seems that eggs may be able to continue development during exposure to the gas and that their susceptibility increases towards hatching. This suggests that increasing the duration of the exposure or raising the temperature to speed development may help to improve efficacy against eggs (Bell and Savvidou, 1999). Unpublished research (Dow AgroSciences) indicates that SF penetrates wheat flour much more efficiently than MB, which is a significant benefit in situations where insect infestations are located deep within flour-packed cracks or machinery. If a control agent lacks these penetrating capabilities, re-infestation of other areas occurs very rapidly, severely undermining the value of a <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{loamy sand}} soil sampled from a species- rich {{permanent}} grassland at a long- term experimental site (Wildekamp, Bennekom, The Netherlands) was used to construct soil microcosms in which the microbial community compositions had been modified by fumigation at different intensities (depths). As expected, increasing depth of fumigation was shown to result in progressively increasing effects on the microbiological soil parameters, as determined by cultivation- based as well as cultivation- independent (PCR- DGGE, PLFA) methods. Both at 7 and at 60 days after fumigation, shifts in the bacterial, fungal and protozoan communities were noted, indicating that altered community compositions had emerged following a transition phase. At the level of bacteria culturable on plates, an increase of the prevalence of bacterial r- strategists was noted at 7 days followed by a decline at 60 days, which also hinted at {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatments.</b> The survival of a non- toxigenic Escherichia coli O 157 : H 7 derivative, strain T, was then assessed over 60 days in these microcosms, using detection via colony forming units counts as well as via PCR- DGGE. Both data sets were consistent with each other. Thus, a clear effect of fumigation depth on the survival of the invading strain T was noted, as a progressive increase of depth coincided with a progressively enhanced inoculant survival rate. As fumigation depth was presumably inversely related to community complexity, this was consistent with the hypothesis that soil systems with reduced biological complexity offer enhanced opportunities for invading microbial species to establish and persist. The significance of this finding is discussed {{in the light of the}} ongoing discussion about the complexity - invasiveness relationship within microbial communities, in particular regarding the opportunities of pathogens to persist...|$|R
40|$|The future {{capacity}} of forest ecosystems to sequester atmospheric carbon {{is likely to}} be influenced by CO 2 -mediated shifts in nutrient cycling through changes in litter chemistry, and by interactions with pollutants like O 3. We evaluated the independent and interactive effects of elevated CO 2 (560 ll l) 1) and O 3 (55 nl l l) 1) on leaf litter decomposition in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) at the Aspen free air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) site (Wisconsin, USA). <b>Fumigation</b> <b>treatments</b> consisted of replicated ambient, +CO 2, +O 3, and +CO 2 +O 3 FACE rings. We followed mass loss and litter chemistry over 23 months, using reciprocally transplanted litterbags to separate substrate quality from environment effects. Aspen decayed more slowly than birch across all treatment conditions, and changes in decomposition dynamics of both species were driven by shifts in substrate quality rather than by fumigation environment. Aspen litter produced under elevated CO 2 decayed more slowly than litter produced under ambient CO 2, and this effect was exacerbated by elevated O 3. Similarly, birch litter produced under elevated CO 2 also decayed more slowly than litter produced under ambient CO 2. In contrast to results for aspen, however, elevated O 3 accelerated birch decay under ambient CO 2, but decelerated decay under enriched CO 2. Changes in decomposition rates (k-values) were due to CO 2 - and O 3 -mediated shifts in litter quality, particularly levels of carbohydrates, nitrogen, and tannins. These results suggest that in early-successional forests of the future, elevated concentrations of CO 2 will likely reduce leaf litter decomposition, although the magnitude of effect will vary among species and in response to interactions with tropospheric O 3...|$|R
40|$|Summary Effects of {{elevated}} {{concentrations of}} tropospheric ozone ([O 3]) {{and carbon dioxide}} ([CO 2]) on leaves of two silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) clones were monitored for three growing seasons (1998, 1999, 2000) by means of electrical im-pedance spectroscopy (EIS). The field trial with open-top chambers (OTCs) was conducted on two clones (Clone 4 and Clone 80) with five treatments and four independent replicates. Treatments were: (1) outside control, (2) chamber control, (3) 2 × ambient [O 3], (4) 2 × ambient [CO 2] and (5) 2 × ambient [CO 2] + 2 × ambient [O 3]. Fumigations started in 1999 and con-tinued in 2000. Measurements were made in 1998 before the fumigations and thereafter EIS was carried out four times in each season. The impedance spectra of about 10 leaves from each tree at each time were measured at 42 frequencies be-tween 80 and 1 MHz. Leaf spectra were modeled by a distrib-uted circuit element model (DCE) (one DCE in series with a resistor), which yields the extracellular and intracellular resistances, the relaxation time and the distribution coefficient of the relaxation time. The EIS properties of the leaves changed significantly {{during the growing season}} when new leaves were expanding. The clones differed in their EIS properties. Clone 4 had a significantly higher extracellular resistance and distribu-tion coefficient than Clone 80. The clones responded similarly to the <b>fumigation</b> <b>treatments.</b> Differences between treatments emerged especially during the second fumigation season in 2000. Elevated [O 3] reduced both the relaxation time and the extracellular resistance, indicating cell membrane damage. El-evated [CO 2] increased the intracellular resistance, indicating changes in symplastic composition. The biological interpreta-tion of the EIS parameters in birch leaves is discussed...|$|R
