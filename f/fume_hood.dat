5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour.

It can cause severe damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only small quantities {{of a few}} grams in a <b>fume</b> <b>hood.</b> Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol. The alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because even {{a small amount of}} air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E

25|$|Sodium amalgam {{containing}} 2–6% sodium (prepared by {{the treatment}} of ribbons of sodium metal with mercury(0)) is the most commonly employed reagent for the reductive desulfonylation and reductive elimination processes. Disodium hydrogen phosphate is used to buffer the solution at a pH of 7–8, meaning that base-labile functionality is stable under the reduction conditions. Reductions employing aluminum amalgam (prepared by immersion of aluminum foil into a 2% aqueous solution of HgCl2) often require higher temperatures than the corresponding sodium amalgam reactions. Mercury and mercury compounds are poisonous and teratogenic, and should be used only in a properly functioning chemical <b>fume</b> <b>hood.</b> Mercury cannot be destroyed {{but it can be}} removed from aqueous solutions by using ion-exchange resins or by amalgamation with iron.|$|E

25|$|Reductions {{employing}} {{an excess}} of alkali metals in ammonia or amines are extremely rapid and should be quenched {{after a minute or}} so of reaction time—longer reaction times promote side reactions. When lithium or sodium in ammonia is used, the persistence of a deep blue color in the solution (due to solvated electrons) is a sign that the reaction is complete. Reductions employing alkali metal arene radical anion complexes similarly require a large excess of the reducing agent, very low temperatures and short reaction times. Reductive desulfonylations and reductive eliminations employing alkali or alkaline earth metals in ammonia present a high fire hazard and should be conducted in a properly functioning chemical <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> away from flammable solvents. Ammonia is a corrosive gas with a pungent odor. Alkali metals react violently with water or even moist air to generate hydrogen, which can then be ignited by the heat of the reaction.|$|E

[...] Priestley left no written description of his laboratory, but much is known of his experiments and late-18th-century laboratories. Extensive research on the laboratory within the house was completed in 1996, including excavations that revealed two underground ovens, as well as evidence of a primitive <b>fume</b> <b>hood.</b> The 1998 renovations also included work to restore the laboratory to a condition as close to its original state as possible.|$|E

500|$|Fingerprint {{recovery}} {{from the surface of}} firearms is done with cyanoacrylate (more commonly known as superglue) fuming. Firearms are placed in a specially designed <b>fume</b> <b>hood</b> designed to evenly distribute fumes instead of removing them. Liquid superglue is placed in a container and heated until it is in a gaseous state. The circulating fumes adhere to the oils left behind by the fingerprint, turning the print white. The resulting white print can be enhanced with fingerprint powder to increase the contrast of the white print against the weapon's finish. While using the fuming technique on recovered guns is commonplace, the recovery of fingerprints from the surfaces of a firearm is challenging due to the textured grip and the general condition of recovered weapons. [...] If fingerprints are recovered, they can be processed through fingerprint databases such as the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). Various parts of the recovered weapon can also be tested for touch DNA left by whomever handled it. However, the low levels of DNA that can be recovered presents numerous issues such as contamination and analysis anomalies such as allele drop-out and drop-in.|$|E
