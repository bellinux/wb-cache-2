25|$|After she {{remarried}} in America, Suyuan {{has high}} hopes for her new daughter June, but June constantly fails to meet her expectations out {{of a lack of}} interest. She performs badly during a piano recital at age nine (Melanie Chang), and when Suyuan pushes her to continue training to be a concert pianist, June refuses, saying that she wishes herself dead like Suyuan's other daughters, an action that offends Suyuan. When June grows into adulthood, at a dinner party a year before Suyuan's passing, Waverly, June's long-time rival whom she is freelancing for, turns down her business ideas, and Suyuan remarks that Waverly and June are not alike and that style is something one's born with and cannot be taught implying Waverly has style. June feels humiliated, believing her mother had betrayed her for being a failure <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> Lindo shows sympathy for June. The following day, June berates Suyuan for her remarks and admits she could never live up to her high expectations. June laments that Suyuan has always been disappointed with June because June dropped out of college, is not married, and has an unsuccessful career. However, Suyuan gives her a jade necklace and assures June that she is the one who has the unteachable style and that while Waverly was the best in competitions, June always had the best heart which made her mother prouder than she would have been otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Ahalyoddharaṇam (Sanskrit: अहल्योद्धरणम्). Janaka fixes {{the day of}} Sītā's Svayaṃvara after {{counseling}} {{with his}} ministers and priests. Meanwhile, in Ayodhyā, Daśaratha starts thinking about Rāma's marriage. The sage Viśvāmitra is interrupted {{again and again in}} his sacrifice by the female demon Tāṭakā. Viśvāmitra arrives in Daśaratha's court and asks for Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa for protecting his sacrifice from demons. Daśaratha is reluctant and desolate at the thought of Rāma leaving him, but Vasiṣṭha convinces him to relent. Viśvāmitra takes Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to his forest where Rāma kills Tāṭakā when she attacks the three by raining trees and rocks at them. Viśvāmitra grants the two Vidyās names Balā and Atibalā to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, which will enable them to survive without drinking, eating or sleeping. Viśvāmitra also surrenders all his divine weapons to Rāma. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa protect the sacrifice of Viśvāmitra for six days and six nights. On the seventh day, the demon brothers Mārīca and Subāhu attack the sacrifice with a large army. Rāma uses the Mānavāstra to throw the elder brother Mārīca across the ocean, while he burns Subāhu to death by the Āgneyāstra. In the meantime Lakṣmaṇa kills the entire army of demons. Viśvāmitra is freed from the fear of demons and decides to take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Mithilā for the Svayaṃvara of Sītā. On the way, Rāma sights Ahalyā, who has been cursed by her husband Gautama for her adulterous transgression, {{in the form of a}} rock. Viśvāmitra narrates the history of Ahalyā to Rāma. Rāma touches Ahalyā by his foot and Ahalyā is freed of her curse and sin. Ahalyā praises Rāma with tears <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> departs to the abode of Gautama.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Russell did {{not believe}} Lawrence's age was {{suitable}} for the role. He thought Lawrence (21 {{at the time of}} filming) was too young to play against Cooper (38), but her audition changed his mind, admitting that the [...] "expressiveness <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> in her face" [...] was [...] "ageless". Russell compares Lawrence to the character Tiffany, describing her as confident but one of the least neurotic people he knows, with the confidence and glimpses of vulnerability needed to play Tiffany. Tiffany went through several iterations. She was initially meant to be a goth. Lawrence dyed her hair black and did test shoots in heavy goth makeup, but Weinstein disapproved. The final version of her character remained messed-up yet confident, with small goth touches such as the dark hair and a cross. Specifically for the role, Lawrence was asked by Russell to put on weight and to speak in a lower register.|$|E
2500|$|Luahine {{was born}} in 1915 {{in the village of}} Nāpoʻopo'o, near Captain Cook, Hawaii. Her given name was Harriet Lanihau Makekau, and she was the {{youngest}} of five daughters in a pure Hawaiian family that traced its genealogy to dancers and keepers of ancient Hawaiian rituals and chants. Iolani was raised by her great aunt Julia Keahi Luahine (18771937), who began educating her in the ancient Kauai school of hula when she was four years old. Her aunt Keahi was [...] "the foremost hula instructor of her day and one of the last royal dancers from King Kalākaua's and Queen Lili’uokalani's court." [...] When she was a child, she was afflicted with an illness <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> a kahuna nui (seer) said she had to be renamed Iolani, heavenly, or royal hawk, after the `io, native Hawaiian hawk. Her eyesight reportedly cleared shortly after her name was changed. Iolani attended the Kamehameha Schools, but her aunt removed her after learning that dancing hula was forbidden by the [...] "missionary" [...] institution. After leaving the Kamehameha Schools, Luahine attended St. Andrew's Priory, at St. Andrew’s Cathedral, where hula dancing was permitted. Iolani later attended the University of Hawaii where she began hula classes with Mary Kawena Pukui. As Iolani's mentor, Pukui steered her away from the commercialized hula forms popularized by Hollywood films.|$|E

2500|$|Hilarie Burton portrays Peyton Sawyer, whose two {{greatest}} passions in {{life are}} music and art; she uses her art to express the issues that play out in her life. After Burton auditioned unsuccessfully for the part of Ed Harris's daughter in the film Radio, the casting department remembered her {{and asked her to}} audition for One Tree Hill. Schwahn said, [...] " [...] is an old soul. She's great. She's always just thrilled to do the job, even though she's kind of new to acting. She's just a joy to be around." [...] When talking about casting the role of Peyton, 'Mark Schwann (I)' said: [...] "They asked why I wanted Hilarie Burton, and my answer was, 'She has a lot of pain <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>And</b> I want that pain in Peyton's eyes'. We always laugh about it, because Hilarie is like, 'It's a good thing a lot of crummy things happen to me in my life'."
