The effect was confined to less than 10 ism depth. Micropitting was associated with surface asperities and their plastic deformation; higher running-in load gave more micropitting, also after identical <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests.</b> Running-in increased unequal compressive residual stresses in both profile and axial directions, while after <b>efficiency</b> <b>testing</b> they approached equal levels. Deformation induced martensite is considered to form during running-in only at high load, still the amount after <b>efficiency</b> <b>testing</b> increased with running-in load.

40|$|Linear {{permanent}} magnet (PM) machines are applicable {{to a number}} of prototype renewable energy devices and therefore are candidates for deployment. Synthetic loading for efficiency evaluation of linear PM synchronous machines is described and evaluated. Synthetic loading is a technique that eliminates the need for an external mechanical load to absorb generated shaft power during rated load <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests.</b> As such it is a technique ideally suited to the large linear PM generators proposed for renewable applications. Mathematical expressions for synthetic loading are derived for the linear PM synchronous machine using the dq machine model that includes core loss. Synthetic loading and standard <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests,</b> as methods of efficiency evaluation, are simulated using MATLAB and SIMULINK. Simulation data are verified by experiment for both the synthetic loading test and the standard <b>efficiency</b> <b>test.</b> Simulation and experimental results show that the synthetic loading method is capable of evaluating the efficiency of linear PM synchronous machine under test. The results show good agreement with standard <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests.</b> The key contribution of this work includes the mathematical expressions of synthetic loading applied to linear PM synchronous machines, the hardware and software implementation of the technique and the validation of the synthetic loading as a technique for efficiency evaluation of linear PM synchronous machines...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of thermoelectrics (TE) for energy conversion {{is in the}} transition phase from laboratory research to device development. There is an increasing demand to accurately determine the module efficiency, especially for the power generation mode.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} exact likelihood-based {{mean-variance}} <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests</b> {{of the market}} portfolio {{in the context of}} Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), allowing for a wide class of error distributions which include normality as a special case. These tests are developed in the framework of multivariate linear regressions (MLR). It is well known, however, that despite their simple statistical structure, standard asymptotically justified MLR-based tests are unreliable. In financial econometrics, exact tests have been proposed for a few specific hypotheses [Jobson and Korkie (Journal of Financial Economics, 1982), MacKinlay (Journal of Financial Economics, 1987), Gibbons, Ross and Shanken (Econometrica, 1989), Zhou (Journal of Finance, 1993) ], most of which depend on normality. For the gaussian model, our tests correspond to Gibbons, Ross and Shanken's mean-variance <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests.</b> In non-gaussian contexts, we reconsider mean-variance <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests</b> allowing for multivariate Student-t and gaussian mixture errors. Our framework allows to cast more evidence on whether the normality assumption is too restrictive when testing the CAPM. We also propose exact multivariate diagnostic checks (including tests for multivariate GARCH and multivariate generalization of the well-known variance ratio tests) and goodness of fit tests as well as a set estimate for the intervening nuisance parameters. Our results [over five-year subperiods] show the following: (i) multivariate normality is rejected in most subperiods, (ii) residual checks reveal no significant departures from the multivariate i. i. d. assumption, and (iii) mean-variance <b>efficiency</b> <b>tests</b> of the market portfolio are not rejected as frequently once they are allowed for the possibility of non-normal errors. capital asset pricing model, CAPM, mean-variance efficiency, nonnormality, multivariate linear regression, uniform linear hypothesis, exact test, Monte Carlo test, bootstrap, nuisance parameters, specification test, diagnostics, GARCH, variance ratio test...|$|R
