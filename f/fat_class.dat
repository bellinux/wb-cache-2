50|$|In the UK, the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC Services Ltd) is {{responsible}} for the classification of over 80% of the cattle slaughtered in Britain. The EUROP grid consists of a 5-point scale in which each conformation and <b>fat</b> <b>class</b> is subdivided into low medium and high classes resulting in 15 classes. In the UK, the fat classes range from 1-5 with classes 4 and 5 having a high and low sub-class which results in a seven-point scale for fatness (figure 1). It is argued by the MLC that this subdivision allows a more precise description of the carcase.|$|E

The object of the study was beef of Limousin bulls (25 to 27 months, hot carcass weight - 432 ± 31 kg, “U” conformation class, “ 2 ”–“ 3 ” <b>fat</b> <b>class).</b> Analysed cuts were Infraspinatus muscle from the blade and Longissimus dorsi muscle from the cube roll and the striploin. Tenderness was analysed with universal testing machine, colour - chromometer analysis, sarcomere length - microscopic method, basic chemical composition - near-infrared spectroscopy and marbling - computer image analysis. No differences in tenderness and sarcomere length were observed within the age groups of Limousin bulls (age of 25, 26, 27 months) (p> 0. 05). Moisture (p = 0. 0123) and fat (p = 0. 0250) content were significantly different for meat of animals slaughtered at the age of 25 and 27 months. No influence of pH value on tenderness was observed, but at the same time, influence on sarcomere length (p = 0. 039) and b* component of colour (0. 045) was found. For “U” conformation class, in subclasses, as well as for fat classes “ 2 ”–“ 3 ”, there were no differences in tenderness, sarcomere length and colour components.

Analysis of variance revealed that breed, {{sex and the}} year of birth were significant sources of variation (P£ 0. 05) for weaning weight. Suffolk sired lambs were significantly heavier than the Texel sired lambs at weaning (35. 78 ± 0. 18 versus 35. 16 ± 0. 18 kg), whereas they were not significantly heavier than the Charollais sired lambs (35. 78 ± 0. 18 versus 35. 37 ± 0. 18 kg). There {{was no significant difference}} between the weaning weights of Texel and Charollais sired lambs.

40|$|Abstract Background Our {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} the effect of two myostatin (MSTN) mutations in Norwegian White Sheep, {{one of which is}} close to fixation in the Texel breed. Methods The impact of two known MSTN mutations was examined in a field experiment with Norwegian White Sheep. The joint effect of the two MSTN mutations on live weight gain and weaning weight was studied on 644 lambs. Carcass weight gain from birth to slaughter, carcass weight, carcass conformation and carcass <b>fat</b> <b>classes</b> were calculated in a subset of 508 lambs. All analyses were carried out with a univariate linear animal model. Results The most significant impact of both mutations was on conformation and <b>fat</b> <b>classes.</b> The largest difference between the genotype groups was between the wild type for both mutations and the homozygotes for the c. 960 delG mutation. Compared to the wild types, these mutants obtained a conformation score 5. 1 classes higher and a fat score 3. 0 classes lower, both on a 15 -point scale. Conclusions Both mutations reduced fatness and increased muscle mass, although the effect of the frameshift mutation (c. 960 delG) was more important as compared to the 3 '-UTR mutation (c. 2360 G>A). Lambs homozygous for the c. 960 delG mutation grew more slowly than those with other MSTN genotypes, but had the least fat and the largest muscle mass. Only c. 960 delG showed dominance effects. </p...|$|R

The aims of this study were to investigate the polymorphism in the 5 ′ flanking region of the IGF-I gene and evaluate associations between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this gene and growth, body size, carcass and meat quality traits in Coloured Polish Merino sheep. In total 78  live and post mortem traits were investigated. Polymorphism in the IGF-I gene was identified {{with the use of the}} polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 305  Coloured Polish Merino sheep. In association studies, traits of interest were analysed with the use of the MIXED and GENMOD procedures of the SAS statistical package. Two alleles named A and B, and two IGF-I genotypes – AA and AB – were detected. The A allele and the AA genotype were predominant, with the frequencies of 91. 6  and 83. 3  %, respectively.

We used 42 adult cows, all with eight teeth at slaughter, and average live body weight of 530 kg. The experimental design was completely randomized. After slaughter, the carcasses were classified in relation to fat cover, and separated into fat 1 (absent), fat 2 (scarce), fat 3 (median) and fat 4 (uniform), according to the “Sistema Nacional de Tipificação e Classificação de Carcaças Bovinas”. Body weights at origin were higher for cows of <b>fat</b> <b>class</b> 4 in relation to class 2 and 1, being 571. 9, 517. 6, and 488. 1 kg, respectively, not differing from <b>fat</b> <b>class</b> 3 (536. 6 kg).

The cut of the rib is the cut with the largest increase in weight when the fat level increases. Considering the commercial cuts prices at the wholesale markets of São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, the industry could pay better prices for cows with fat 2 in relation to the other classes.

One-hundred pigs of four genetic types - Large White or Duroc x (Landrace x Large White), GOLAND and DANBRED - were considered. They were randomly chosen during the slaughtering of 21 lots of heavy animals, in groups of four to eight subjects, balanced by sex, female and castrated males, and carcass leanness, U and R classes following the European grading system. Principal components (PCs) analysis showed that 94. 3 % of lot-diets’ FA variability was accounted for a five PCs model. The diet effect on the lard composition was weighted using the PCs scores as covariates in a tri-factorial (genotype, carcass leanness, sex) covariance design. Diet had a great effect on lard composition, indeed every examined back fat FA co-varied with the extracted PCs. On the other hand, sex effect never reached a significance threshold, as well as the interactions between factors.

Carcass measures included: cold carcass weight (CCW), EUROP conformation and <b>fat</b> <b>class</b> scores (MLC-CF), primal joint weights predicted using MLC-CF and several carcass linear and area measures obtained by Video Image Analysis (VIA-DM). Heritability estimates for subjective carcass traits (MLC-CF and primal joint weights predicted using MLC-CF) were low (0. 05 ? 0. 17), whereas those for objective carcass traits (linear and area measurements on the carcass from VIA) were moderate to high (0. 20 ? 0. 53). Phenotypic correlations between MLC-CF and VIA-DM were in general low (0. 01 ? 0. 51) and genetic correlations were slightly higher (? 0. 04 ? 0. 81), when interpreting their absolute value. The results suggest that selection for shorter carcasses (VIA lengths) will be associated with improved conformation but a reduction of the total CCW. Likewise there was a trend in the genetic correlations between conformation and carcass widths which indicated that conformation could also be improved by selection for wider carcasses as measured by VIA which in turn will also imply an increase in CCW. The genetic correlations between VIA-DM and <b>fat</b> <b>class</b> score were only significantly different from zero for the VIA measurement for the leg area (rg = ? 0. 73).

Samples were analysed both raw (left side cuts) and cooked (right sides) using accredited methodologies for nutrient content namely proximate composition, vitamin B and minerals. There was no significant difference in the iron and zinc values between the cooked cuts. Results showed differences in both trace elements and B vitamins among different cooked cuts, although the differences were not statistically significant. Cooked SA lamb (A age class, <b>fat</b> <b>class</b> 2) contains an average of 60. 5 % less total fat and 5. 28 % less protein, resulting in 1891 kJ less per 100 g edible portion energy, if compared to the previous values in the food composition tables. Quantitative descriptive sensory analyses were performed by a trained panel on the M. longissimus lumborum (loin) from lambs of the same age. Aroma intensity, initial impression of juiciness, first bite, sustained impression of juiciness, muscle fibre and overall tenderness, amount of connective tissue (residue), overall flavour intensity and off-flavour intensity were measured, as well as cooking related measurements and resistance to shear. With the exception of juiciness, the results in this study showed that contrary to expected carcass fatness (in the same age over five fat classes), as portrayed in the South African Classification system, does not have a significant effect on the sensory qualities of M. longissimus lumborum (loin) from lambs of the same age. This investigation provides important scientific insight into the physical, nutrient and sensory quality of South African lamb. The results obtained show that subcutaneous carcass fat that increased significantly with an increase in <b>fat</b> <b>class</b> can be trimmed to represent leaner cuts to the discerning consumer. This study found unique values for South African lamb cuts, almost 40 % lower in fat content than the previously-believed-to-be-accurate values, as published by the Medical Research Council for health workers. Contrary to expected it was found in this study that increased fatness did not improve lamb tenderness as popularly believed in the United States. Therefore, the study justifies greater scope for further research into all these aspects, as it provides valuable information for the Red Meat Industry.

40|$|Abstract – The {{quality of}} {{extra virgin olive}} oil (EVOO) is deeply related to the amount of its minor compounds, chiefly {{volatile}} and phenolic compounds, which confer the sensory note and the remarkable nutritional and biological properties of this traditional Mediterranean fruit juice. Several agronomic aspects and technological factors affect the qualitative and quantitative composition of these compounds in EVOO. The most abundant natural antioxidants of EVOO are tocopherols, carotenoids and hydrophilic phenols. The EVOO phenols represent a group of secondary plant metabolites not often present in other oils and <b>fats.</b> The <b>class</b> of the hydrophilic phenols includes phenolic alcohols and acids, flavonoids, lignans and secoiridoids. The latter group is exclusively found in the Oleacease family plants of which the olive is the only edible fruit and it is considered as the most important fraction from a biological point of view. In particular, the secoiridoids are the most relevant phenols associated to health and biological proprieties and, at the same time, they are responsible for the bitter and pungency sensory notes of EVOO. The new approach to the EVOO extraction technologies is oriented towards the improvement of the virgin olive oil healthy and sensory properties by optimizing the oil mechanical extraction process conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} feeding and {{management}} options for early lambing flocks were evaluated at the Knockbeg Sheep Unit, Carlow. Results {{and recommendations for}} on-farm adoption are summarised in this report. The ultimate objective was to develop cost-effective early lamb production systems in synchrony with the high price season from late March to early May. Studies were focused on the two main phases of lamb growth. Firstly, the period from birth to 6 weeks of age which coincides with the critical period of lamb survival and peak lactation in the ewe and, secondly, the finishing stage from 6 weeks until slaughter. Flock size was 230 to 250 ewes sponged in July/August for lambing in January and managed on 12. 6 ha of grass and forage. The results provide options in feeding and management for programmed lamb production in synchrony with early season prices. The production technologies are effective, e. g. out-of-season breeding, grass utilisation, planned schedules for achieving high levels of feed intake and lamb performance, drafting procedures for selecting high quality lambs (<b>Fat</b> <b>class</b> 3, Conformation classes U and R). On-farm planning for feeding, housing and labour is essential. End of Project ReportsEuropean Union Structural Funds (EAGGF...|$|E
40|$|Genes {{involved}} in the physiological control of energy and triglyceride synthesis, such as malic enzyme 1, NADP(+) -dependent, cytosolic (ME 1) and nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR 0 B 2), are key candidates that may have effects on meat and carcass quality traits. These genes were sequenced in Aberdeen Angus beef cattle, {{and the possibility of}} associations between SNPs and economically important carcass and meat quality traits was tested. Six novel SNPs, five in ME 1 and one in NR 0 B 2, were identified. A SNP in exon eight of ME 1 resulted in a non-synonymous amino acid change from valine to isoleucine. Phenotypic data were recorded on 536 commercial Aberdeen Angus-cross beef cattle, which comprised 28 carcass quality, tenderness and sensory traits. The majority of the SNPs were associated with {{at least one of these}} traits, including an association between the NR 0 B 2 SNP and <b>fat</b> <b>class,</b> and associations between at least one of the ME 1 SNPs and eye muscle area, sirloin weight before maturation, sirloin steak tail length, and juiciness.

40|$|Crossbreeding of Holstein–Friesian {{dairy cows}} with both early {{maturing}} (e. g. Aberdeen Angus (AA)) and late maturing (e. g. Belgian Blue (BB)) beef breeds is commonly practised. In Ireland, genetic merit for {{growth rate of}} beef sires is expressed as expected progeny difference for carcass weight (EPDCWT). The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the progeny of Holstein–Friesian cows, sired by AA and BB bulls of low (L) and high (H) EPDCWT for performance and carcass traits. A total of 118 spring-born male progeny from 20 (9 AA and 11 BB) sires (8 L and 12 H) were managed together from shortly after birth to about 19 months of age. They were then assigned to one of two mean slaughter weights (560 kg (light) or 620 kg (heavy)). Following slaughter, carcasses were graded for conformation class and <b>fat</b> <b>class,</b> the 6 th to 10 th ribs joint was dissected as an indicator of carcass composition, and samples of subcutaneous fat and musculus longissimus were subjected to Hunterlab colour measurements. A sample of m. longissimus was also chemically analysed. Slaughter and carcass weights per day of age for AAL, AAH, BBL and BBH were 747, 789, 790 and 805 (s. e. 10. 5) g, and 385, 411, 427 and 443 (s. e. 4. 4) g, respectively. Corresponding carcass weight, kill-out proportion, carcass conformation class (scale 1 to 5) and carcass <b>fat</b> <b>class</b> (scale 1 to 5) values were 289, 312, 320 and 333 (s. e. 4. 0) kg, 516, 522, 542 and 553 (s. e. 3. 5) g/kg, 2. 5, 2. 4, 3. 0 and 3. 1 (s. e. 0. 10), and 3. 4, 3. 5, 2. 9 and 2. 8 (s. e. 0. 11). There were few breed type 3 genetic merit interactions. Delaying slaughter date increased slaughter weight, carcass weight and all measures of fatness. It also reduced the proportion of carcass weight in the hind quarter and the proportions of bone and muscle in the ribs joint. None of these effects accompanied the increase in carcass weight due to higher EPDCWT. It is concluded that BB have superior production traits to AA. Selection of sires for higher EPDCWT increases growth rate, kill-out proportion and carcass weight of progeny with little effect on carcass or muscle traits. The extra carcass weight due to higher EPDCWT is more valuable commercially than a comparable carcass weight increment from a delay in slaughter date because it comprises a higher proportion of muscle. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Di-(2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (DEHP) {{and three}} structurally related side-chain analogs were fed to laying hens to determine relationships of structure to effects on lipid metabolism. Hubbard broiler breeder hens were fed either a standard laying mash control diet or the control diet containing DEHP, 2 -ethylhexanol (2 -EH), 2 -ethylhexanal (2 -EHALD), or 2 -ethylhexanoic acid (2 -EHA). Experimental treatments lowered feed consumption, body weight, and egg production. The DEHP and side-chain analog diets lowered plasma total lipids. DEHP, 2 % 2 -EH, and 1 % 2 -EHA diets lowered plasma free cholesterol. Liver weights {{were not significantly}} changed, but liver fat was reduced. Lipid classes were measured by quantitative thin layer chromatography densi-tometry. The decreases observed in plasma lipids occurred primarily in the triglyceride fraction. Liver lipid decreases occurred mainly in triglyceride and free fatty acid classes. Hen egg yolk percent <b>fat,</b> lipid <b>classes,</b> and free and total cholesterol were unaffected by any DEHP or side-chain analog diets. Plasma and liver hypolipidemic effects were observed {{with all of the}} oxidation state structural analogs of DEHP's side chain, but 2 % 2 -EH was the most effective treatment. These results suggest that the active portion of DEHP may be the metabolite, 2 -EH, formed in vivo by hydrolysis of DEHP's ester bond...|$|R

30|$|MR-based {{attenuation}} correction {{is still}} a challenge. In this paper, we have shown that incorrect identification of <b>fat</b> and water <b>classes</b> has a strong impact on the PET images following AC. We {{have shown that the}} inversion occurs frequently and is not predictable. An automatic method to detect fat/water inversions seems possible when the full volume is inverted, {{but in the case of}} inversion in only a subset of the slices, a manual inspection of the attenuation maps is required. As the non-inverted attenuation map cannot be calculated directly from the inverted, it is important to inspect the attenuation map if the PET images should be used quantitatively. In the brain, this might also be the case even if the PET images are only read visually as indicated in our simulated inversion study.|$|R
