After de-bottlenecking the pipeline to obtain more flow, the motor driver for this pump began overloading at the new, higher flowrates. Horse power calculations suggested that the electric motor driver should have been adequate for the new hydraulic conditions. However, we began to suspect there was an internal pump design problem once {{it was found that}} the field performance diata did not match the original test data. We discovered that the pump was producing 20 % more head than expected at the end-of-curve conditions (900 gpm). Upon disassembly, we found that 8 of the 9 <b>impellers</b> have 8 <b>vanes</b> instead of the expected 7 vanes. (The pump OEM provides both 7 and 8 <b>vane</b> <b>impeller</b> designs.) the OEM?s 4 x 6 x 9 D 8 vane design produces more head past the best efficiency point than the corresponding 7 vane design and does not continuously rise to shutoff.

30|$|As {{has been}} noted, the α- ω dynamo mechanism, and the {{decomposition}} {{of the magnetic}} and velocity fields into poloidal and toroidal components, provides a useful conceptual framework for laboratory dynamos. As far as the experimental challenge of achieving a dynamo in an Earth-like geometry is concerned, in spherical Couette flow, strong differential rotation means it {{is relatively easy to}} obtain a large ω effect (as seen in MDE, 3 m and DTS), but so far a strong α effect (necessary to close the feedback loop) has proved more elusive. In the Riga and Karlsruhe dynamos, the α effect was achieved by organizing the overall flow pattern in pipes. In the VKS experiment, the only dynamo to date in an open geometry, the α effect seems to be present near the ferromagnetic impellers, possibly due to turbulent eddies coming off the <b>impeller</b> <b>vanes.</b> However, since dynamo action is only achieved with impellers that are ferromagnetic, which allows the build-up of strong toriodal fields within the impellers, it appears that these provide a necessary seed for the α effect to be sufficiently strong for dynamo action. In this view, for the case of non-ferromagnetic impellers, while the velocity fluctuations that could result in the α effect are still present, the toroidal field present is much weaker, and thus the poloidal field generated by the α effect near the <b>impeller</b> <b>vanes</b> is no longer sufficient for dynamo action.|$|E

50|$|Discharge {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes {{the majority of the}} fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a venturi), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the <b>impeller</b> <b>vane</b> tips and the pump housing.

PULSATILE OR NONPULSATILE FLOW In the early 1980 s, people did not know whether a nonpulsatile pump could support the circulation partly or totally. Most medical doctors preferred to use pulsatile flow pumps, but the serious problems resulted in the application of diaphragm pumps forced the researchers to change the pumping principle. It followed thereafter two tendencies that some one tried to maintain the animal circulation with nonpulsatile flow as long as possible and others made efforts to develop a pulsatile rotary pump. The conflict of nonpulsatile or pulsatile perfusion lasted to the end of 1990 s. As the author published a pulsatile impeller pump with low hemolysis (Artificial Organs, 1989 / 13 / 02 P 162 - 169), the nonpulsatile pump could make the animal experimental survival only few weeks. Then the author received over 20 international invitations for giving lectures, sending reprints or writing new papers. In the following 10 years, however, nonpulsatile pump achieved long-term survival in animal experiments worldwide [1], and now a patient has lived by a nonpulsatile pump for about 7 years [2]. Thereby, nobody concerns pulsatile rotary pump any more. Fig. (1).

30|$|Pumps: {{there are}} non-{{occlusive}} and occlusive pumps [25, 26]. Occlusive pumps are generally reserved for perioperative techniques in extracorporeal circulation. Non-occlusive pumps are centrifugal pumps comprising an electrically powered motor which spins a magnetic driver {{which in turn}} propels the blood by means of <b>impeller</b> <b>vanes</b> or a cone (vortex effect) or by an Archimedes screw. They are pre- and afterload-dependent and are currently the only ones used in Europe. These centrifugal pumps are driven by a magnetic force which can generate speeds of up to 7, 000 rotations/minute. This magnetic force drains the venous blood and produces a centrifugal force, which ensures a continuous and non-pulsatile flow. Centrifugal pumps maintain extracorporeal life support for a prolonged period, with a low risk of blood stagnation and hemolysis [27].

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands of economical, reliable and durable hydraulic and pneumatic systems, {{it is necessary}} to minimize the material damage from cavitation erosion (CE) when systems are handling cavitating and corrosive fluids. Cavitation erosion is a nausea for many engineering components, such as ship propellers & rudders, turbine, diesel engine, cylinder liner, pump <b>impeller</b> <b>vanes,</b> control valves, hydraulic turbines, bearings, pipes, ultrasonic cleaners and mechanical heart valves, which are exposed to the high-speed flowing or vibratory fluids.

Inevitably the variation in the manufacturing process will lead to variation in natural frequency of blade <b>vanes</b> in an <b>impeller</b> which usually termed as Mistuning. The variation in natural frequency will increase the forced frequency response of the vanes than the tuned vanes. In-service deterioration of vanes dimension due to erosion, corrosion and FOD also adds to further variation in natural frequency.

40|$|Many pumping {{stations}} in drainage & irrigation applications are currently equipped with conventional (not fish friendly designed) pumps. Field tests {{have been performed}} [1] for several pump types of a certain size at certain pumping conditions to assess survival rates of fish passing through pumps. In order to compare different pump types of different sizes at different pumping conditions, a general criterion is required. Testing of fish friendliness of pumps is expensive and involves animal tests with living fish for which permits are required. Therefore, pump manufacturers prefer to perform fish friendliness tests for a single pump size. In order to convert such results to other pump sizes, a scaling law is desired. Van Esch [2, 3] made a first attempt to address scaling principles for fish friendliness of pumps. In {{the current study a}} general criterion is described to predict fish friendliness of pumps by means of models of mortality rates of fish passing through pumps. The criterion is validated with literature data [1 – 3] and experimental full-scale test data from the newly developed fish-friendly axial flow concrete volute pump by Flowserve with an impeller diameter of 850 mm. The full-scale tests involved a total of 1800 roach, perch and eel deployed over 7 pumping conditions, including 3 different heads and 5 different rotational speeds. The fish-friendliness criterion includes different aspects that together predict the survival rate of fish passing through pumps. The first and most important contributor is the impeller, which can have an axial, mixed or radial flow design. The criterion involves the leading edge shape of the blades. Secondly, the diffuser or volute is considered, which provides a strike probability with diffuser vanes or volute tongue(s). In case the gap between the trailing edge of the <b>impeller</b> <b>vanes</b> and {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes or volute tongue(s) is small relative to the fish size, there is the possibility of a “scissor” effect. Research in the USA for fish friendliness of hydropower turbines [4 – 7] showed that shear velocity and pressure drops can be of importance. Also cavitation (involves pressure drop & vapor bubble implosions), recirculation and turbulence can influence survival rates. At this stage these flow effects are roughly captured using the pump performance curve. This way, extensive CFD calculations to evaluate detailed flow effects can be avoided. For open impellers, the gap between the <b>impeller</b> <b>vanes</b> and wear ring is included in the criterion. In addition, fish species-dependent effects are taken into account, since fish vary widely in their internal and external building plan. For instance salmonid, percid and cyprinid fish respond differently to the same pump design than for example eel. Sharp edges and rough surfaces (for example caused by cavitation, erosion or corrosion) can also be harmful to fish but are not included at this stage...|$|E

Compared with the original design, in which impellers were replaced/repaired after less than one year of operation, the new impeller lifetime was calculated to be improved by at least a factor of eight, on the basis of cavitation bubble length. The NPSH required for the new design proved to be much better than for the original design, and, additionally the efficiency was established to be improved by one to two percent. Furthermore, a suction box splitter vane modification has led to less (cavitation) bubble activity in the eye area...|$|R
