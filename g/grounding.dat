5|$|By 8:30 am {{a request}} went out {{summoning}} all available tugs {{to the site}} of the <b>grounding</b> with the hope that they would be able to free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the <b>grounding</b> met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had run aground during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's <b>grounding</b> as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E

5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological <b>grounding</b> to the text - a <b>grounding</b> that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The <b>grounding</b> of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the <b>grounding</b> of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E

5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough <b>grounding</b> in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that <b>grounding,</b> Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E

5|$|Two days later, the {{starboard}} propshaft seal sprung a major leak in the after engine room. A makeshift locking clamp was jury-rigged {{to contain the}} leak. On 12 March, the trouble-plagued fathometer ceased operation when its transducer header flooded, <b>grounding</b> out the entire system. Since the transducer head was located outside the boat's pressure hull, {{it could not be}} repaired except in drydock. Without an operational fathometer, Triton could be vulnerable to <b>grounding</b> or collision with uncharted submerged formations. It was subsequently determined that the cabling to the Tritons fathometer head, located in the bulbous forefoot of her bow, had not been properly insulated, and the constant buffeting from Tritons high speed caused these cables to rupture, rendering the fathometer inoperable.|$|E

5|$|Initial rescue {{operations}} were hampered by inclement weather. Attempts to move New Carissa under her own power failed, and tugboat assistance {{was not available}} immediately after the <b>grounding.</b> Only one tugboat was available locally, but {{she was unable to}} cross the Coos Bay bar because of safety concerns. It was also uncertain whether or not the locally available tugboat could have successfully rescued New Carissa. The nearest salvage tugboat capable of towing a large ship off a beach, Salvage Chief, was moored at her home port of Astoria, Oregon, 200statutemiles(320km) to the north, a 24-hour journey away. Salvage Chief had not sailed in over a year, and it took 18hours to fuel, provision, and find a crew for the ship. Once mobilized, poor weather in the Astoria area prevented the tugboat from crossing the treacherous Columbia River bar for an additional two days. Salvage Chief did not arrive in the area until 8 February four days after the <b>grounding</b> occurred.|$|E
