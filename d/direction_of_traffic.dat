5|$|Construction was {{approved}} in April 1971, {{with an initial}} expected opening date in 1976. Work was delayed {{due to a lack}} of funds, which was resolved by EEC funding granted in 1974. The second tunnel opened in May 1980, allowing each tunnel to handle one <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic,</b> by which time the joint capacity of the two tunnels had increased to 65,000 vehicles per day. Connection of the crossing to the M25 was completed on the northerly Essex side in September 1982 (Junction 31), and to the southerly Kent side in September 1986 (Junction 1a). Following the completion of the M25 in 1986, the daily demand had grown to 79,000 vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} traffic capacity and safety, a route may have two or more separate roads for each <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> Alternatively, a given road might be declared one-way.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the U.S. Department of Transportation's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), since the early 1970s all divided {{highways}} are striped by color to show the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flow. Two-way undivided roads have an amber center line, with a broken line indicating passing zones and a solid line indicating no passing zones and solid white baseline shoulder stripes.|$|E
50|$|If the limited-access highway {{passes over}} the local road, the bridge (or bridges) must be longer, to span four <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> and two {{sidewalks}} below. If the local road passes over the limited-access highway, the bridge must be wider, to carry four <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> and two sidewalks over the highway.|$|R

25|$|A turn on red is a {{principle}} of law permitting vehicles at a traffic light showing a red signal to turn into the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> nearer to them (almost always after a complete stop) when the way is clear, without having {{to wait for a}} green signal. It is intended to allow traffic to resume moving, with minimal risk provided that proper caution is observed.|$|E
25|$|From January to July 2010 {{there were}} 237 {{accidents}} involving TransJakarta buses, resulting in 57 injuries and eight deaths. Accidents occurred due to pedestrians crossing the busway and cars making u-turns. In 2011, {{in an effort}} to stop non TransJakarta vehicles using the bus lanes, the Jakarta Police Chief suggested that TransJakarta buses should run against the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flow. Usually non-TransJakarta vehicles used busway lanes during peak hours between 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.|$|E
25|$|The {{second section}} of NY153 from NY31F to Commercial Street was entirely rebuilt. As {{part of the}} project, new sidewalks, curbing, and {{drainage}} systems were constructed along the roadway. During the course of construction, only one <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> was allowed on the road. NY153 northbound was closed first; travelers heading north were instructed to follow NY31F, Lincoln Road and Linden Avenue to traverse the village. Construction paused in November 2007 for the winter months, at which time the highway was reopened to two-way traffic. On March31, 2008, NY153 northbound was closed again and the detour was reinstated; however, the detour now utilized NY31F, the service roads of I-490 between exits24 and25, and West Commercial Street instead. From May26 to June28, both directions of NY153 between NY31F and Commercial Street were closed to traffic {{to allow for a}} larger scale of construction. The project was completed in October 2008.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S. the {{expression}} [...] "undivided highway" [...] {{is likely to}} mean a multi-lane road with only striping (paint) (but no median) between the two <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flow. A road with two lanes <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> moving in opposite directions is specifically called a two-lane road.|$|R
25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on top of concrete slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes {{up and over the}} westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights from the opposing <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E
500|$|As I-74 and US6 {{head down}} a hill towards the Mississippi River, a series of exit and {{entrance}} ramps connect the freeway to US67, which runs northbound along State Street and southbound along Grant Street. [...] The interstate passes over US67 and railroad tracks belonging to the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad on an elevated highway, which serves as the approach to the Interstate 74 Bridge over the Mississippi River. [...] Despite the singular name, the crossing is actually two twin bridges which each carry one <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to and from Moline, Illinois.|$|E

E.332 {{is the only}} CFBS locomotive which cannot be turned {{on any of the}} turntable except Saint-Valery Port.|$|R
500|$|Not {{only did}} the Department of Information art advisors {{consider}} these new works dull, but the War Office censors also objected to three of the paintings. Nevinson was quite happy to reverse the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> in the painting The Road from Arras to Bapaume but {{was not prepared to}} compromise over the other two paintings. The censor objected to A Group of Soldiers on the grounds that [...] "the type of man represented is not worthy of the British Army". Amid the sarcasm and vitirol of Nevinson's response, he did make the point that the soldiers in the painting were sketched from a group home on leave from the Front that he had encountered on the London Underground. The canvas was eventually passed for display. Not so Paths of Glory, Nevinson's painting of two fallen British soldiers in a field of mud and barbed wire. Told at the beginning of 1918 that the painting would not be passed for exhibition Nevinson insisted on displaying it with a brown strip of paper across it, with the word 'Censored' scrawled on it. This earned Nevinson a reprimand not just for displaying the painting but using the word 'Censored' without authorisation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{streets and}} {{sidewalks}} {{were also in}} need of repair. In 2008 Rep. Maurice Hinchey helped the city secure $1.3 million in federal grants to rehabilitate uptown and the Stockade District. $1.7 million had been set aside to restore the Pike Plan canopies, which were in need of repair. The following spring the city announced it would {{use some of the}} money to reverse the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> on several of the one-way streets within the district to ease travel through and around it. Later that year City council debated whether to restore the traffic light at North Front and Wall or keep the stop signs. They ultimately decided in favor of the traffic light. [...] Just prior to completion of the canopy project, graffiti artists painted red goats on eleven of the new sidewalk planters, raising a furor. The two suspects face up to four years in prison for felony criminal mischief.|$|E
