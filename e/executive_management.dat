5|$|O'Malley was {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} HBO documentary film , which chronicled his <b>executive</b> <b>management</b> of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. The documentary focuses on the post World War II glory years of the franchise and presents a compelling case that O'Malley truly {{wanted to keep the}} Dodgers in Brooklyn in a stadium near a railroad station, but he was unable to get the proper support from Moses.|$|E

5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Brazilian {{football}} clubs, Atlético Mineiro's by-law defines the club as a not-for-profit public utility organization, formed by associates (sócios). The club's administrative powers are the General Assembly, the Deliberative Council, the Board, the Fiscal Council and the Ethics and Discipline Council. The General Assembly, composed of all associates, elects the Deliberative Council among its members every three years, which in turn elects and removes the club's Board, responsible for the <b>executive</b> <b>management</b> of the club. Season ticket-holders and participants of the Galo na Veia affiliation programme, called sócios-torcedores, are not full club associates and cannot vote or be elected.|$|E

5|$|In 1877, McClellan was {{nominated}} by the Democrats for Governor of New Jersey, {{an action that}} took him by surprise because he had not {{expressed an interest in}} the position. He accepted the nomination, was elected, and served a single term from 1878 to 1881, a tenure marked by careful, conservative <b>executive</b> <b>management</b> and minimal political rancor. The concluding chapter of his political career was his strong support in 1884 for the election of Grover Cleveland. He sought the position of secretary of war in Cleveland's cabinet, for which he was well qualified, but political rivals from New Jersey were able to block his nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{was the fifth}} fatal accident with a Twin Otter in Norway and the fourth fatal accident by Widerøe in eleven years. The company's <b>executive</b> <b>management</b> met in Bodø {{the evening of the}} accident before chief executive officer Bård Mikkelsen and others traveled to Namsos to investigate the crash site of the third fatal accident since Mikkelsen started in his position in 1988. Widerøe stopped all advertisements in the period after the accident. Widerøe announced in November that they would accelerate the replacement of their Twin Otter and de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft with new de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, but denied that the accident influenced the decision and instead cited financial reasons. Widerøe's chief operating officer, Per-Helge Røbekk, announced in July 1994 that he would step down because of the strain of the three accidents.|$|E
5|$|A naming {{exception}} was Huge Viking, {{which was used}} for a Boeing 747. Huge was the quickest being in Norse mythology, but the name also played on the words English meaning. SAS reuses the names from retired aircraft, except for those of crashed aircraft. Because of oversights, the name Agnar and Rane have however been reused. A similar naming convention, albeit using the full name of kings, was used by Braathens SAFE of Norway and Loftleiðir of Iceland. As Carlzon was opposed to the Viking references, he also proposed that the names be abolished. The <b>executive</b> <b>management</b> reverted its decision following massive protests from within the airline. Female aircraft names were introduced by Scanair in 1980, who gave them to all their Douglas DC-8s. SAS followed suit in 1989, when the entire series of Boeing 767 were named for prominent female Vikings. Scandinavian letters were introduced from the 1990s. SAS Commuter's Norwegian Fokker 50 aircraft were given names for places in Norway, such as Lakselv.|$|E

25|$|In private for-profit corporations, {{shareholders}} elect {{the board}} of directors to represent their interests. In the case of nonprofits, stakeholders may have some role in recommending or selecting board members, but typically the board itself decides who will serve on the board as a 'self-perpetuating' board. The degree of leadership that the board has over the organization varies; in practice at large organizations, the <b>executive</b> <b>management,</b> principally the CEO, drives major initiatives with the oversight and approval of the board.|$|E
