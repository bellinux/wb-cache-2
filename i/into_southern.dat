5|$|July 29, 1975- A {{tropical}} depression moves <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Mississippi after creating a strong convergence zone with a ridge over the western Atlantic Ocean. The convergence zone produces heavy rainfall {{of up to}} 20inches (510mm) along the western Florida Panhandle, resulting in moderate stream flooding and $8.5million in damage in the state (1975USD, $34million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Moving east-southeast <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Middlesex County, it {{continued}} producing severe winds (gusting up to 90mph; 145km/h) and very heavy rain. Another tornado touched down very briefly in Norfolk County, {{followed by two}} more brief touchdowns in Plymouth County near 5:30PM. The storm then weakened, but still managed to produce 60mph (95km/h) winds on Cape Cod, before finally moving out into the Atlantic and dissipating.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflicts}} with Pyrrhus {{would have a}} great effect on Rome. Rome had shown it was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Italia, subjugating and dividing the Greek colonies. Now, Rome effectively dominated the Italian peninsula, and won an international military reputation.|$|E

5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate {{due to a}} combination of jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, the storm was downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved <b>into</b> <b>Southern</b> California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
5|$|After {{the losses}} of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, {{northern}} Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. Johnston established his base at Corinth, Mississippi, {{the site of}} a major railroad junction and strategic transportation link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River, but left the Union troops with access <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Tennessee and points farther south via the Tennessee River.|$|E

5|$|Buffalo Creek {{begins in}} Hartley Township, in Union County, near the Union County/Centre County border. It flows east and {{slightly}} north between Buffalo Mountain and Branch Mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features {{known as the}} Gooseneck and Buffalo Gap. The creek then turns southeast and flows out of Hartley Township. Upon leaving Hartley Township, the creek enters Lewis Township and meanders eastward, south of Jones Mountain. It passes through the Mifflinburg Reservoir. The creek then flows <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> West Buffalo Township and northern Mifflinburg. Shortly before exiting West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek picks up its tributary North Branch Buffalo Creek and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again and leaving the township.|$|E
5|$|By early afternoon, the {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while the warm front had moved northward <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Minnesota. The atmosphere {{to the south}} of the warm front was strongly capped, meaning that the best chance of thunderstorm development was in areas along and slightly north of the front. By the time the thunderstorms started developing, CAPE values were 2000J/kg, indicating moderate atmospheric instability. Also present were low-level and deep-layer wind shear values of , respectively. All of these factors combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Crossing <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Otsego County, I-75 {{continues}} northward through Northern Michigan forests. It {{passes to}} the east of the community of Waters and Otsego Lake. North of exit279, I-75 proceeds by the Gaylord Regional Airport and crosses the 45th Parallel, the halfway mark between the Equator and the North Pole by latitude. The freeway then traverses the west side of Gaylord and continues through forests in the northern sections of the county. North of Vanderbilt, I-75 enters southern Cheboygan County, assuming the G. Mennen Williams Freeway name.|$|E

5|$|Duncan initiates {{the player}} into the Grey Wardens through a {{dangerous}} ritual called the Joining, which involves imbibing Darkspawn blood. The recipient is either killed or imbued with the powerful darkspawn essence, the Taint, granting them {{the ability to}} sense Darkspawn and a rudimentary connection into their hive mind. Afterwards, the player and fellow Grey Warden, Alistair, are tasked with lighting a beacon {{at the top of}} the fortress to signal Loghain's men into charging the horde's flank. However, upon arriving, Loghain abandons the battlefield with his army, leaving Cailan, Duncan, and their army to be overwhelmed and slain by the Darkspawn, who seize control of Ostagar and begin advancing <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Ferelden.|$|E
5|$|Eremoryzomys {{is now one}} {{of about}} 28 genera in the tribe Oryzomyini, which {{includes}} well over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America, including nearby islands such as the Galápagos Islands and some of the Antilles. Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> North America.

5|$|FFH16 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with County Road 436 (CR436, Smokey Lake Road) near Horseshoe Lake in rural Iron County's Stambaugh Township. The roadway runs north from this location east of Smokey Lake through forest lands {{that are part}} of the Ottawa National Forest. Near Golden Lake and the Golden Lake National Forest Campground, FFH16 and US Highway 2 (US2) intersect. FFH16 continues north and curves to the northwest around the end of Golden Lake. The routing of the road provides access to several more lakes in rural Iron County such as Paint, Silk and Hehe lakes, as well as an older routing of US2, before crossing <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Houghton County.|$|E

5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats. Some {{farmers in the}} valley of Chamonix joined their counterparts from the neighbouring valleys of Maurienne, Beaufortain and Tarentaise and crossed the Alps <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> Germany, Austria and northern Italy to sell their products and bring back goods for sale in local markets.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing <b>into</b> <b>southern</b> waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
