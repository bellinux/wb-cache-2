5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It {{is very difficult}} to exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow/infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections (e.g., from roof <b>downpipes),</b> cross connections, around manhole covers or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes.|$|E

There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century addition of a north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, {{on the north side}} of the chancel, is less certain. Externally, the nave <b>downpipes</b> on the south side are dated 1884.|$|E
5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic {{in their use of}} this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. The house itself had metal fenestration, tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater <b>downpipes.</b> The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of alternative overflow systems for roof structures that are drained siphonically. Many buildings that have siphonic roof drainage systems currently incorporate a separate secondary overflow system, {{which is quite}} often also siphonic. An alternative low-cost technique that is explored {{in this study is}} to connect each overflow outlet to a single, vertical <b>downpipe.</b> Seven different overflow configurations, each with five different <b>downpipe</b> lengths, are investigated in terms of maximum flowrate and corresponding water depth in the gutter. The results of this study are significant in that they do not support the common theoretical assumption that there is a limiting length of a siphonic <b>downpipe</b> over which pipe-full flow may occur before gravity causes the water to accelerate enough for it to no longer occupy the full cross-sectional area. Instead, this study has found that once a <b>downpipe</b> is flowing full, it is possible for pipe-full flow conditions to be maintained over the entire pipe length...|$|R

5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and <b>downpipes.</b> Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, <b>downpipes</b> should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
5|$|From 1889 to 1902, an {{extensive}} programme of conservation {{was carried out}} on the bridge and gate, directed by Monmouthshire County Council, which retained responsibility for maintenance. This began with the prevention of the potential collapse of the gatehouse by the insertion of metal tie rods to hold the two faces of the tower together; the four round plates {{at the ends of}} these two rods can still be seen. In 1892, conservation work began on the arches and piers of the bridge following the discovery that riverbed erosion had seriously undermined the piers. Maintenance was carried out on the gatehouse exterior from the mid-1890s to 1897. Roof guttering and <b>downpipes</b> were added, badly eroded stone was replaced with squared blocks of Old Red Sandstone, and the cruciform arrowslit on the left-hand side of the west elevation of the gatehouse was restored to make it symmetrical. Concluding the 1889–1902 renovations, improvements were made to the interior of the gatehouse, and it was opened to the public in 1902.|$|E

25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The <b>downpipes</b> taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|E

A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now hidden behind a freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original chrome-plated ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating ticket window remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white terrazzo tiles, while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel downpipe marks {{the top of the stairs}} and the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four <b>downpipes</b> in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E
2500|$|The reactor has two {{independent}} cooling circuits, each having four main circulating pumps (three operating, one standby). The cooling water is fed to the reactor through lower water lines {{to a common}} pressure header (one for each cooling circuit), which is split to 22 group distribution headers, each feeding 38–41 pressure channels through the core, where the feedwater boils. The mixture of steam and water {{is led by the}} upper steam lines, one for each pressure channel, from the reactor top to the steam separators, pairs of thick horizontal drums located in side compartments above the reactor top; each has [...] diameter, [...] length, wall thickness of , and weighs [...] Steam, with steam quality of about 15%, is taken {{from the top of the}} separators by two steam collectors per separator, combined, and led to two turbogenerators in the turbine hall, then to condensers, reheated to , and pumped by the condensate pumps to deaerators, where remains of gaseous phase and corrosion-inducing gases are removed. The resulting feedwater is led to the steam separators by feedwater pumps and mixed with water from them at their outlets. From the bottom of the steam separators, the feedwater is led by 12 <b>downpipes</b> (from each separator) to the suction headers of the main circulation pumps, and back into the reactor. There is an ion exchange system included in the loop to remove impurities from the feedwater.|$|E
50|$|Savery's engine had no piston, and no {{moving parts}} except from the taps. It was {{operated}} by first raising steam in the boiler; the steam was then admitted {{to one of}} the first working vessels, allowing it to blow out through a <b>downpipe</b> into the water that was to be raised. When the system was hot and therefore full of steam the tap between the boiler and the working vessel was shut, and if necessary the outside of the vessel was cooled. This made the steam inside it condense, creating a partial vacuum, and atmospheric pressure pushed water up the <b>downpipe</b> until the vessel was full. At this point the tap below the vessel was closed, and the tap between it and the up-pipe opened, and more steam was admitted from the boiler. As the steam pressure built up, it forced the water from the vessel up the up-pipe {{to the top of the}} mine.|$|R

50|$|The railway {{platform}} has tall sash windows, {{some of which}} have been painted out, and timber panelled doors with fanlights open from the adjoining offices and service rooms. Rainwater heads, draining the box gutter between the station building and the carriage shade, protrude into the platform area, with the <b>downpipe</b> inset into the station building wall. The signal box protrudes from the station building on a raised concrete base, and has sliding multi-paned windows to three sides.|$|R
2500|$|Problems {{with the}} Savoyes caused {{by all the}} {{requests}} for additional payment from the contractors for all the changes were compounded by the requirement for early repairs to the new house. Each autumn the Savoyes suffered problems with rainwater leaks through the roof. By refusing <b>downpipes</b> and sills which would interrupt their aesthetic, the white surfaces were more susceptible to staining and erosion due to the water pour-down. Additionally, these building was also scarred with cracks because the material was not designed for structural durability. The Savoyes continued {{to live in the}} house until 1940, leaving during World War II. It was occupied twice during the war: first by the Germans - when it was used as a hay store - and then by the Americans, with both occupations damaging the building severely. The Savoyes returned to their estate after the war, but, no longer in position to live as they had done before the war, they abandoned the house again shortly after. The villa was expropriated by the town of Poissy in 1958, which first used it as a public youth center and later considered demolishing it {{to make way for a}} schoolhouse complex. Protest from architects who felt the house should be saved, and the intervention of Corbusier himself, spared the house from demolition. A first attempt of restoration was begun in 1963 by architect Jean Debuisson, despite opposition from Corbusier. The villa was added to the French register of historical monuments in 1965, becoming the first modernist building designated as historical monument in France, and also the first to be the object of restoration while its architect was still living. In 1985, a thorough state-funded restoration process, led by architect Jean-Louis Véret, was undertaken, being completed in 1997. The restoration included structural and surface repairs to the facades and terraces because of deterioration of the concrete, [...] the installation of lighting and security cameras, and the reinstatement of some of the original fixtures and fittings.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} <b>downpipes</b> and {{rainwater}} heads fixed to this facade. Two frame the northernmost bay, while two more are centred on the apexes of the southernmost facade sections. A final downpipe is fitted {{at the southern}} end of the facade. Given that the northernmost bay corresponds to the part of this building that was constructed first in 1894-95, and the position of the <b>downpipes,</b> it is likely that its roof between East Street and Quay Lane was a gable. The only other visible facade is that which faces the north-western allotment. It is rendered in a similar fashion to the rear facade and has no windows.|$|E

50|$|It {{is easy to}} install, economical, {{lightweight}} requires minimum {{maintenance and}} has a life expectancy of 50 years. The material has a disadvantageous {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} 0.06 mm/m°C, so design allowances have to be made.

As a rule of thumb a 4 in gutter with a single 68 mm <b>downpipe</b> will drain a 600 sq ft roof.|$|R
40|$|To have {{knowledge}} about the gas and material temperatures in the exhaust system of today's vehicles is of great importance. These temperatures need to be known for component protection, control- and diagnostic purposes. Today mostly map-based models are used which are not accurate enough and difficult to tune since it consist of many parameters. In this thesis physically based models are developed for several components in the exhaust system. The models are derived through energy balances and are more intuitive compared to the current map-based models. The developed models are parameterized and validated with measurements from wind tunnel experiments and driving scenarios on an outdoor track. The engine out model is modeled theoretically and is therefore not parameterized or validated. The model for the temperature drop over the exhaust manifold could not be validated due to the pulsations occurring in the exhaust manifold, however {{suggestions on how to}} solve this problem are given in this report. The models for the turbocharger, the catalyst and the <b>downpipe</b> are parameterized and validated with good results in this thesis.
