50|$|Karoondinha Music & Arts Festival was a {{music festival}} {{which was to}} be held at Penn's Cave & Wildlife Park in Centre Hall, Pennsylvania. The festival was officially {{announced}} on December 9, 2016. The inaugural festival's full lineup was unveiled May 2, 2017, and featured Chance the Rapper, John Legend, ODESZA, Paramore, and Sturgill Simpson as headliners. On June 27, 2017 the festival's official website and social media went dark signaling the festival had been cancelled. Compounded with the festival's reported financial struggles, an overarching factor in the closing of the festival was a result of the May 22nd terrorist attack of an Ariana Grande concert in London. Many consumers feared the possibility of a similar attack taking place at the venue in Penn's Cave, <b>forcing</b> <b>ticket</b> sales to plummet, and subsequently, contributing to the cancellation of the festival.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the problem}} of a {{shortage}} of energy {{is becoming more and}} more serious. This has resulted in the global governments' appeal to people to take public transportation systems as much as possible. But, the public transportation system has a lot of problems that cause people's interest in taking the public transportation system to get lower and lower. For example, many passengers use many kinds of management loopholes to avoid buying <b>tickets.</b> This action <b>forces</b> the companies involved in providing the public transportation system to strengthen manpower for inspecting tickets. Hence, the companies will shift cost to the customers <b>forcing</b> <b>ticket</b> prices higher and higher as well as passengers becoming more frustrated with the increase in inspecting tickets. In this paper, we take the Taiwan Railways Administration (it owns different ticket types and different train types in the same public transportation system) as our implement environment and we use Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) methods conforming to EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 (C 1 G 2) standards to solve this train-jumping problem and reduce the manpower cost of the public transportation system companies. And most importantly, our scheme also enhances higher security. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

500|$|When {{the media}} {{discovered}} that Nixon had received reimbursement for political expenses from a fund {{set up by}} a private group, the nominee was severely criticized, and he was pressured {{to give up his}} place on the ticket.

Chotiner told Nixon that if he were <b>forced</b> off the <b>ticket,</b> Chotiner would hold a press conference and reveal the behind-the-scenes machinations that led to the candidate's departure, the ensuing furor being of no consequence to them, as both Nixon and Chotiner would be through in politics.

McGovern initially supported Eagleton, in part because he saw parallels with his daughter Terry's battles with mental illness, and on the following day, July 26, stated publicly, [...] "I am 1,000percent for Tom Eagleton and have no intention of dropping him from the ticket." [...] Though many people still supported Eagleton's candidacy, an increasing number of influential politicians and newspapers questioned his ability to handle the office of vice president and, potentially, president or questioned the McGovern campaign's ability to survive the distraction. The resulting negative attention – combined with McGovern's consultation with preeminent psychiatrists, including Karl Menninger, as well as doctors who had treated Eagleton – prompted McGovern to accept, and announce on August 1, Eagleton's offer to withdraw from the ticket. It remains the only time a major party vice-presidential nominee has been <b>forced</b> off the <b>ticket.</b> Five prominent Democrats then publicly turned down McGovern's offer of the vice presidential slot: in sequence, Kennedy again, Abraham Ribicoff, Humphrey, Reubin Askew, and Muskie (Larry O'Brien was also approached but no offer made). Finally, he named United States Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. McGovern's 1,000 percent statement and subsequent reneging made him look both indecisive and an opportunist, and has since been considered one of the worst gaffes in presidential campaign history. McGovern himself would long view the Eagleton affair as having been [...] "catastrophic" [...] for his campaign.|$|R

He was called the [...] "salt water Barnum" [...] by the local newspaper. The pier hosted dance bands, three movie theaters, exhibits, operas, children's shows, a water circus, stunts and other attractions. He signed John Philip Sousa {{for a series of}} annual concerts. The General Motors Exhibit opened in 1926, continuing through 1933, when it was replaced by Ford. (General Motors returned in 1947, continuing until 1968.) From 1935 through 1938, Steel Pier was where Miss America was crowned. It was described as [...] "An Amusement City at Sea" [...] and [...] "A Vacation in Itself." [...] It also was once called the [...] "Showplace of the Nation" [...] and included such acts as the High Diving horse; Rex the Wonder Dog, a water-skiing canine in the 1930s; the diving bell; and musicians, Frank Sinatra and Al Jolson among others. Diana Ross and The Supremes played week-long engagements during the summer in 1965, 1966 and 1967, to sold-out business in the Steel Pier's Music Hall Theater and the Marine Ballroom. [...] "Rain or Shine ... There's Always a Good Show on Steel Pier" [...] was another phrase used to describe the venue's varied entertainment. In 1945, the pier was purchased by George Hamid, who operated the competing Million Dollar Pier. He brought popular and rock and roll music to the pier starting with Bill Haley and the Comets in 1955. Parts of the pier were damaged or lost during the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. The Beatles were booked in 1964, but overwhelming demand for <b>tickets</b> <b>forced</b> them to move to Boardwalk Hall. The pier used to be much longer, but a December 1969 fire six months before the opening of the 1970 season shortened its size by about a third. [...] By the end of the 1960s, the pier was feeling the effects of declining tourism in Atlantic City. The pier was sold to a group of local businessmen in 1973. After gambling was legalized, a developer proposed turning the pier into a hotel-casino. However, the necessary governmental approvals could not be obtained, and the pier was sold to Resorts International in 1978, which mainly used the pier for storage. The original wooden pier with steel underpinnings was destroyed in a 1982 fire; the current concrete structure dates from 1993. Trump Entertainment acquired ownership of the pier when it acquired the Trump Taj Mahal in the late 1980s. The Trump Steel Pier opened in 1992, but had been reduced to about [...] and featured mainly amusement rides. The Steel Pier continues to operate as an amusement park to this day.|$|R
