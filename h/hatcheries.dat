5|$|Fish <b>hatcheries</b> provide larval and {{juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in <b>hatcheries</b> include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and Pacific salmon, herring, capelin and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish <b>hatcheries</b> in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the <b>hatcheries.</b> Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{introduce}} H.gammarus to New Zealand, alongside other European species such as the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. Between 1904 and 1914, one million lobster larvae were released from <b>hatcheries</b> in Dunedin, but the species did not become established there.|$|E
50|$|Wolf Creek National Fish <b>Hatchery</b> is a National Fish <b>Hatchery</b> {{located just}} below Wolf Creek Dam in Russell County, Kentucky. The <b>hatchery</b> {{is a federal}} <b>hatchery</b> and {{is a part of}} the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.|$|R

50|$|Jackson National Fish <b>Hatchery</b> is a National fish <b>hatchery</b> in Jackson, Wyoming. The <b>hatchery</b> {{is run by}} the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The <b>hatchery</b> is {{physically}} located on the National Elk Refuge, a protected feeding ground for elk that winter in the Jackson Hole valley. The fish <b>hatchery</b> produces fish for a 18000 sq mi distribution area in Wyoming and Idaho.|$|R
5|$|Based on {{variations}} {{in the size of}} the yearly catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the <b>hatcheries,</b> recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial fishing on the Rogue, but this decision was reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to commercial fishing in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the species from {{becoming}} extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen <b>hatcheries</b> and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these areas is required if the species is {{to survive in the}} wild.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of <b>hatcheries</b> and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of natural pearls. The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hatchery</b> {{closed in}} 1983 after budget cuts forced {{the closure of}} the site. The <b>hatchery,</b> still managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, still allowed {{visitors}} but could not continue operations. The <b>hatchery</b> reopened in 1989 as the D.C. Booth Historic National Fish <b>Hatchery,</b> in honor of Booth, and after forming new partnerships. The <b>hatchery</b> was renovated in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Elisha and R.D. Pike owned {{a private}} fish <b>hatchery</b> in Bayfield County from the 1860s to 1895. The Wisconsin State Legislature {{mandated}} {{the construction of}} a fish <b>hatchery</b> in northern Wisconsin in 1895, so R.D. Pike donated 405 acre from his <b>hatchery</b> to serve as the state <b>hatchery.</b> The state built the main <b>hatchery</b> building in 1897 using brownstone from nearby Pike's Quarry. The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway built a siding to the <b>hatchery,</b> and a special railcar known as The Badger brought fish from the <b>hatchery</b> to Wisconsin waterbodies. In 1974, new buildings and wells were constructed to modernize the <b>hatchery.</b> The <b>hatchery</b> was renamed in honor of longtime Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources secretary Les Voigt in 2006, and the main building was named for R.D. Pike in 2011. The <b>hatchery</b> currently spawns five types of trout and salmon and also includes a visitor's center and aquarium.|$|R

5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish <b>hatcheries</b> have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Relative {{growth and}} {{survival}} of offspring from matings of <b>hatchery</b> and wild Deschutes River (Oregon) summer steelhead trout, Salmo gairdneri, were monitored to determine if <b>hatchery</b> fish differ genetically from wild fish in traits which can affect the stock-recruitment relationship of wild populations. Four natural streams and a <b>hatchery</b> pond were each stocked with genetically marked eyed-eggs or unfed fry from each of three matings: <b>hatchery</b> x <b>hatchery</b> (HH), <b>hatchery</b> x wild (HW) and wild x wild (WW). In the <b>hatchery</b> pond, HH fish exhibited the greatest survival and were larger than fish in the other groups. WW fish had the greatest survival and HW fish were largest in streams where {{there were significant differences}} in survival or length. The <b>hatchery</b> fish were genetically different from wild fish and can have an adverse effect on the stock-recruitment relationship of the wild population when they interbreed with wild fish. <b>Hatchery</b> procedures can be modified to lessen this effect by minimizing the genetic differences between <b>hatchery</b> and wild fish...|$|R
5|$|In Nebraska, a {{small number}} of pallid {{sturgeon}} have been captured along the lower reaches of the Platte River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from <b>hatcheries,</b> have been captured from the Platte River. A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have been captured, the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, the {{southern}} two-thirds of Georgia was declared a disaster by President Bush. The state lost 50percent of its pecan crop due to Frances, {{which led to}} a price rise in pecans by late October. Lost peach trees were expected to lower output during 2005, and increase peach prices. A disaster declaration was made for the northeast section of South Carolina on October 7. On September 10, President Bush declared 34 counties within North Carolina a disaster area, making them eligible for US$6.5million (2004 dollars) in public assistance. A Wildlife Commission removed its North Carolina Mountain State Fair exhibit due to Frances midway through the fair. Over 100,000 trout were lost due to the storm in the Pisgah, Table Rock, Marion, and Armstrong state fish <b>hatcheries.</b> Red Cross volunteers distributed over 200,000 gallons of water by its 600 volunteers in four days. After Frances and Hurricane Ivan, Asheville determined that it needed $14million in order to buy out willing businesses and homes within the floodplain.|$|E
5|$|The Conservation Priority List (CPL) is the Conservancy's list of breeds {{for which}} {{conservation}} is a priority. Published annually, {{the list is}} used {{as the foundation for}} all conservation work done by the organization. Each year, it gathers population data on all breeds of livestock, including registration data and, for poultry, census numbers gathered from members, <b>hatcheries</b> and breeders. This data is then used to divide breeds into five categories: critical, threatened, watch, recovering and study. Breeds are placed in the first three categories based on annual registrations with breed registries in the United States and estimated global populations. Recovering breeds are those that have exceeded the numbers needed for the watch category but that the organization still wishes to monitor. Breeds in the study category lack genetic or historical documentation but are still considered to be of genetic interest. Population numbers may be lacking on these breeds, or proof that they are a true breed, instead of a type or non-true-breeding cross.|$|E

5|$|Otters do not {{dramatically}} reduce prey {{populations in}} the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey. When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in <b>hatcheries</b> or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). Resolution of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the river otter, the deciding factor whether the river otter can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.|$|E
25|$|Fish <b>hatcheries</b> {{are common}} {{due to the}} {{abundance}} of springs and waterways. The Neosho National Fish Hatchery was built in 1888; {{it was the first}} Federal hatchery.

25|$|Declines in the {{abundance}} of wild salmon due to over fishing placed greater pressure on <b>hatcheries</b> to increase production and restore the wild salmon stock to supply fisheries. The problem is that <b>hatcheries</b> can never truly replicate the environment of wild salmon, an issue which often results in physiological and behavioral differences between wild salmon and those reared in <b>hatcheries.</b> These differences are often the product of genetic changes associated with inbreeding, artificial selection, and natural selection as well as different environmental pressures acting on hatchery fish than wild populations. Due to the size selective nature of fishing favoring larger fish, a reduction in average size of the adult salmon has been observed over time. The smaller salmon make {{a greater proportion of}} the remaining individuals continuing the population, and problems arise when these hatchery-reared fish are introduced into the wild populations. Unlike wild salmon, larger salmon are selected for in <b>hatcheries</b> and are typically much larger than wild salmon. The result is that hatchery-produced salmon tend to out-compete wild salmon for space, food, and other resources. Some salmon species in <b>hatcheries</b> exhibit predatory behavior toward wild salmon because they grow to be much larger. Regardless of whether predation is observed, natural social interactions are disturbed by the release of large numbers of hatchery-reared salmon where wild populations are low because salmon in <b>hatcheries</b> naturally have a higher propensity towards aggressive behavior. Overall, natural salmon populations are put at risk when hatchery-reared salmon populations are introduced due to competition for resources, predation by larger individuals, and negative social interactions that upset the natural order observed in wild salmon populations. As a result, wild salmon populations are steadily dropping as the pressure to continue breeding salmon in <b>hatcheries</b> increases. Conservation efforts that work to place limitations on <b>hatcheries</b> to increase the wild salmon populations are hindered by financial pressures because <b>hatcheries</b> effectively support many states economically by accounting for over 70% of the salmon harvested for recreational and commercial purposes.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Gyrodactylus, a monogenean parasite, was {{introduced}} with live trout and salmon from Sweden (Baltic stocks {{are resistant to}} it) into government operated <b>hatcheries</b> in Norway.

50|$|The Nimbus Fish <b>Hatchery</b> was {{established}} {{as part of}} a greater habitat mitigation network. Currently in the system small Chinook fry from the <b>hatchery</b> are being released lower down river in the American and Sacramento river to avoid predation from larger fish, such as bass. The small fry are often targets of other fish and water fowl in the environmental corridor. A goal of the <b>hatchery</b> is to increase the annual salmon return by releasing closer up river near the <b>hatchery.</b> With this comes a further distance to the ocean, but it may be a safer one. By doing so it would imbed in the <b>hatchery</b> salmon the migratory route {{to come back to the}} <b>hatchery</b> from which they came.
