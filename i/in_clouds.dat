5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens most often <b>in</b> <b>clouds</b> above freezing, {{and is also}} known as the warm rain process. <b>In</b> <b>clouds</b> below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>cloud</b> {{computing}} environments, one of {{the most}} important barriers to the adoption of software as a service systems is interoperability. Generally, <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments at software as a service level, interoperability refers to the ability of software as a service systems on one cloud provider to communicate with software as a service systems on another cloud provider. The current software as a service systems <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments have not been built with interoperability as a primary concern. Software as a service systems <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments are poorly developed to meet the interoperability challenges. A common tactic for enabling interoperability is the use of an interoperability framework or model. During the past few years, at software as a service level, various interoperability frameworks and models have been developed to provide interoperability between systems. The syntactic interoperability of software as a service systems have already been intensively researched. However, not enough consideration has been given to semantic interoperability issues. Both syntactic and semantic interoperability are necessary prerequisites to achieve interoperability. Achieving semantic interoperability is a challenge within the world of software as a service <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments. Therefore, a semantic interoperability framework for software as a service systems <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments is needed. In this thesis, we develop a semantic interoperability framework for software as a service systems <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments. For this purpose, we illustrate how current technologies, such as service oriented architecture, can represent an adequate foundation for implementing such framework. The capabilities and value of service oriented architecture for semantic interoperability between software as a service systems <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments will be studied and demonstrated. iv In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic interoperability framework for software as a service systems <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments, extensive experimentation and statistical analysis have been performed. Overall, the effectiveness of semantic interoperability of software as a service systems <b>in</b> <b>cloud</b> computing environments with the proposed framework shows a significant improvement in comparison with the existing models and frameworks...|$|R

500|$|It {{is thought}} that global dimming is {{probably}} due to the increased presence of aerosol particles in the atmosphere caused by human action.

[...] Increased pollution causes more particulates and thereby creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets (that is, the same amount of water is spread over more droplets). The smaller droplets make clouds more reflective, so that more incoming sunlight is reflected back into space and less reaches the Earth's surface. This same effect also reflects radiation from below, trapping it in the lower atmosphere. In models, these smaller droplets also decrease rainfall.|$|E
