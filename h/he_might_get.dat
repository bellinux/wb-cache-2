5|$|Raskolnikov is at {{this point}} {{completely}} torn; he is urged by Sonya to confess, and Svidrigaïlov's testimony could potentially convict him. Furthermore, Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him that confession would substantially lighten his sentence. Meanwhile, Svidrigaïlov attempts to seduce Dunya, but when he realizes that she will never love him, he lets her go. He then spends a night in confusion and in the morning shoots himself. This same morning, Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya, who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience. He makes his way to the police station, where he is met by the news of Svidrigaïlov's suicide. He hesitates a moment, thinking again that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> away with a perfect crime, but is persuaded by Sonya to confess.|$|E
5|$|The Marsh family celebrates Grampa Marsh's 102nd birthday, but he {{is tired}} of living and tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide. He tries to {{convince}} Stan to kill him, but Stan refuses because he fears <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> in trouble. Meanwhile, Kyle watches the cartoon Terrance and Phillip, which revolves largely around fart jokes. Kyle's mother gets outraged by the foul language and crude humor, and contacts other South Park parents to organize a boycott at the Cartoon Central headquarters in New York City. Later at school, Stan asks Mr. Garrison, Chef and Jesus whether he should help his grandpa kill himself, but they avoid discussing the issue, much to Stan's anger.|$|E
5|$|Before Moffat left Pola Jones for Hartswood, Ptaszynski {{produced}} Chalk, {{the series}} {{that the writer}} had pitched {{to him at the}} beginning of the decade. Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis, the show was based on Moffat's three years as an English teacher. The studio audience responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the first had aired. However, it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997, who had taken exception to the BBC's publicity department comparing the show to the highly respected Fawlty Towers. In an interview in the early 2000s, Moffat refuses to even name the series, joking that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> attacked in the street.|$|E

25|$|Froch faced former IBF middleweight {{champion}} hard hitting King Arthur Abraham in {{the third}} stage in Helsinki, Finland at the Hartwall Finland fearing that if he fought in Abraham's adoptive home country <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> mugged. However, since an eye injury forced Mikkel Kessler to relinquish his WBC title and resign from the tournament, Froch-Abraham was for the vacant WBC super-middleweight title. Both Froch and Abraham came off of a loss in stage two of the Super Six. Abraham lost after a disqualification against former Froch victim Andre Dirrell.|$|E
25|$|Burnside {{dispatched}} some cavalry reinforcements to Rosecrans {{and made}} preparations for {{an expedition to}} clear the roads and gaps from East Tennessee to Virginia and if possible secure the saltworks beyond Abingdon. During this time, the Battle of Chickamauga loomed, and frantic requests from Washington, D.C., to move south and reinforce Rosecrans were effectively ignored by Burnside, {{who did not want}} to give up his newly occupied territory and its loyal citizens. Furthermore, Burnside was encountering difficulties in moving supplies through the rugged territory and was concerned that if he moved even farther from his supply base, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> into serious difficulty.|$|E
500|$|An early {{version of}} the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as {{it seemed to be}} the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an {{evaluation}} screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film. While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all. He soon reached a breakthrough: that emotions are meant to connect people together, and that relationships are the most important things in life. He decided to replace Fear with Sadness, which he felt is crucial to renewal. He met with Rivera and Del Carmen that night to explain his change of plans, and to his surprise, they reacted positively to it. At the screening, he informed his superiors that new plans for the film were in order. Although it was a [...] "scary moment", the film remained in production.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in the early 2000s, Moffat refused to even mention Chalk, joking that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> attacked in the street. The first series received criticism from some teachers and teaching unions, who criticised the representation of their professions. Letters were printed in specialist publications such as the Education Guardian. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers labelled Chalk as [...] "perverse" [...] and [...] "vapid", and its leader called upon the show to be axed. [...] Teachers, according to the Daily Record, complained that the show portrayed teachers as [...] "mentally unstable", and deterred people from entering the profession. John Grillo, who played Mr Carkdale, recalls that he was appearing in a West End play {{at the time he}} was auditioning for the role; a fellow actor in the play was meant to be auditioning for Chalk but, having been a deputy head teacher earlier in his career, was so disgusted by the material that he refused to attend. The unions' derision actually inspired The Timess [...] Matthew Bond to like the show. However, despite identifying [...] "genuine humour" [...] such as Slatt's rant against French teachers, Bond's review is largely critical. He concedes, [...] "the teaching organisations, you see, are half right. Slatt has no credible basis in the teaching profession, but far more importantly he has no credible basis in the human race. And what we don't believe in, we rarely find funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ambedkar {{considered}} {{converting to}} Sikhism, which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes. But {{after meeting with}} Sikh leaders, he concluded that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> [...] "second-rate" [...] Sikh status, as described by scholar Stephen P. Cohen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{claim was}} evidently {{believed}} {{by a local}} auctioneer named [...] "Mr Kay", who on March 13 presented him with a [...] "massive silver cup, as a mark of appreciation of his pluck". This was perhaps his only financial reward from the jump, having no bets laid, but hoping [...] "that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> something out of it".|$|E

Then he signed for him to follow, {{and led the way}} into the Ark, where <b>he</b> <b>might</b> pursue the subject unheard by those whose {{feelings}} <b>he</b> feared <b>might</b> <b>get</b> the mastery over their reason.

According to Robertson [...] "This was no accidental arrest, no fortunate stumbling across a news team. They [...] had planned this all along." [...] The taxi driver, who was driving the crew and Robertson, was also held. According to Robertson the taxi driver had [...] "done nothing more than give us a ride. He had no idea <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> into trouble." [...] Robertson {{and his crew}} were released later the same day.|$|E
2500|$|These early fights {{were not}} without trials. Clay was knocked down both by Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook {{at the end}} of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the {{predicted}} 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963 was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number-two and -three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring (watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> locked up for murder). The fight was later named [...] "Fight of the Year" [...] by The Ring magazine.|$|E

[...] Illinois Speaker of the House Michael Madigan reacted by saying, [...] "He is a star...For Barack, the sky's the limit," [...] while Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said, [...] "He hit a grand slam home run." [...] Senate President Emil Jones responded, [...] "It was such a moving speech that I had tears in my eyes...It was electrifying. When I looked around the room, all across the people were so emotional, tears in their eyes. They're crying. A great individual, a great Illinoisan." [...] Governor Rod Blagojevich stated, [...] "After the speech last night, I would think {{that even if he}} had an opponent, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> 100 percent of the vote." [...] Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley Braun said, [...] "Obama {{represents}} the best of what we brought from our generation...he represents a kind of division within the Democratic Party. It's not the old left." ...|$|E
