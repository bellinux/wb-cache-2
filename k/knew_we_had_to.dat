500|$|Columbus Crew goalkeeper Andy Gruenbaum commented {{after the}} match, [...] "We {{knew it was}} going to be a tough place to play, their fan base is great. Anytime you have a {{championship}} match on your own pitch, the odds are going to be against you. We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> defend and take advantage of any opportunity. We came out and scored the first goal and they were able to capitalize on two weird bounces." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{knew it was}} bad, but didn't {{know just}} how bad until I {{received}} their full report by email Monday morning," [...] Clark said. [...] "Once I saw their weight-load calculations, I <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> shut it down right away. We couldn't wait until May 29." [...] The thirteen toll booth employees were laid off. As of the closure there are $49,015 in toll tickets {{that have not been}} used. Refunds were [...] given for thirty days from the closure. The closure of the New Harmony Bridge as reported in the Evansville Courier would {{have a significant impact on}} farmers in the area and the oil industry. The bridge's closure increases the distance between New Harmony and Crossville, Illinois by about ten miles.|$|E
500|$|They {{thought of}} using David Glen Eisley's song [...] "Sweet Victory" [...] {{for the final}} act. He said [...] "It was {{different}} than what we were looking for, {{but it was so}} amazing that we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> use it. So we boarded the sequence to the music, and it felt like such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a freeze-frame shot for the ending. Greenblatt's favorite part was director Springer's drawings of Patrick on the electric drums and SpongeBob saying, [...] "It's the thrill of one more kill" [...] (an excerpt from [...] "Sweet Victory"). [...] The live action Bubble Bowl crowd is footage from a United States Football League game featuring the Memphis Showboats and the Tampa Bay Bandits.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One {{of the interesting things}} for the concept for this video is that we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E
500|$|As {{a senior}} in 1971, Bell led Troy High to a 10–0 record. [...] In the season opener, Bell broke off tackle and rushed 70yards for a {{touchdown}} {{the first time he}} got the ball. [...] He scored touchdowns in three of his first four carries, though one was nullified by a penalty. [...] Bell rushed for 190yards and threetouchdowns in the season opener. [...] The opposing coach said, [...] "It was the same old story. [...] We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stop Bell and yet we still couldn't do it. [...] That boy is a great football player." [...] Bell again won first-team All-Ohio honors, but he lost the Associated Press 1971 Ohio AAA high school back of the year award. [...] The award instead went to a high school senior from Columbus, Archie Griffin. [...] Bell and Griffin would continue their rivalry in college.|$|E
500|$|Ford {{continued}} to excel as a pass-rusher in 1951, when the Browns again {{advanced to the}} NFL Championship Game but lost to the Rams. He recovered four fumbles during the season and was named a first-team All-Pro by both the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). He was also named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game. Ford's dominating play allowed Brown to assign him to two offensive linemen, giving Cleveland the latitude to put four men {{on the line and}} use three linebackers in what is now known as the 4–3 defense. Cleveland's defensive coach Blanton Collier later recalled the thinking behind moving Ford: [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get him in closer where his talents as a pass rusher could best be utilized. [...] So we moved both tackles in and dropped the linebackers off the outside. [...] It may have been the beginning of today's 4–3 defense." [...] Collier also noted that [...] "Len was very aggressive and had that touch of meanness in him that you find in most defensive players." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Billboard.com, Halford described the album's sound as [...] "hard. It's heavy. It's something we think our Priest fans will be thrilled with. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a reputation <b>to</b> maintain, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deliver something really strong and solid.

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> answer that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 January 2015 the Prodigy {{released}} [...] "Nasty" [...] as {{the lead}} single off their upcoming album along with the title track on 26 January 2015. Howlett found that [...] "violent is the word that keeps on coming up" [...] when describing the album. The entire recording process took almost six years taking {{in a number of}} studios and a few restarts to establish that [...] "angry, energetic sound”. Unlike previous efforts The Day Is My Enemy became a band-album where Flint and Maxim worked in tandem with Howlett. This created a degree of friction although Flint noted that “four years ago we sat down and talked about where the next album was gonna go, and we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> bust out the most ‘band’ album we could create".|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{continued}} {{to pay the}} annual tribute to Virginia's governor. This consists of game, usually a deer, and pottery or a [...] "peace pipe". The Pamunkey have been paying such tribute since the treaty of 1646. Making this annual payment {{has not always been}} easy. Chief Miles remembers one year that was particularly hard, [...] "We couldn't find anything, no deer, no turkeys--nothing. My dad was chief then, and we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have something to present to the governor; so we went to a turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it. That way we were able to fulfill the terms of the treaty--after all it was killed on the reservation." [...] As far as anyone knows, they have not missed a payment in 331 years.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{draft of the}} screenplay, the {{original}} series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations. The opening shot {{would have been the}} entire original series cast crammed into an elevator aboard the Enterprise-B, happy to be back together. The Enterprise-D's end also appeared—the saucer crash had first been proposed as the cliffhanger for Moore's original seventh-season finale [...] "All Good Things...", which eventually became the series finale. Kirk's death was initially developed in Braga, Moore and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that [...] "we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list." [...] After the idea of killing off a Next Generation cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. Moore recalled that [...] "we all sorta looked around and said, 'That might be it.' [...] " [...] The studio and Shatner himself had few concerns about the plot point.|$|E
