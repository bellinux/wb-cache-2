5000|$|The Colne is a {{river in}} England {{which is a}} {{tributary}} of the River Thames. Just over half its course is in south Hertfordshire. Downstream, the Colne is the boundary between Buckinghamshire (specifically the South Bucks district) and London (specifically the London Borough of Hillingdon) and finally between corners of Berkshire and Surrey. On leaving Hertfordshire, the watercourse splits off into several separate branches, a few of which rejoin it, and its main branch flows into the River Thames on the reach above Penton <b>Hook</b> <b>Lock</b> at Staines-upon-Thames.|$|R
5000|$|Back / Rear mount - <b>Hooks</b> are <b>locked</b> into {{opponent}}'s mid-thighs {{to prevent}} the opponent from escaping or reversing the position, hooks are also used in this position to add leverage to chokes.|$|R
50|$|In its {{south is}} Laleham Park by the River Thames. Across green belt {{farmland}} to its {{north and south}} east are Ashford and Shepperton, to its east are woods then Queen Mary Reservoir. Penton <b>Hook</b> <b>Lock</b> is {{on the border with}} Staines and Laleham Burway is directly across the river. Centred 1 mi south along the towpath or the humped river road is Chertsey Bridge, just within the boundaries of Shepperton, marking the easternmost point of the town of Chertsey. The north of the area has a number of sports fields, including the Staines and Laleham Sports Ground, and two family pubs, on the Laleham and Ashford Roads respectively.|$|R
50|$|In part {{designed}} by Sir Edwin Lutyens in the 1940s {{this is a}} single-span arch bridge built of brick opened in 1961 to carry the A30's Staines Bypass, near the uppermost end of the Staines upon Thames and Egham reach of river above Penton <b>Hook</b> <b>Lock</b> and below Bell Weir Lock. It is an arch bridge which is specifically of the spandrel arch design supported by two outer walls (spandrels) in red brick infilled with looser material such as gravel. Until the 2013 construction of the present Walton Bridge {{this was the first}} single span (without piers) across the River Thames heading upstream from the river's mouth.|$|R

5000|$|Half guard - <b>Hooks</b> are <b>locked</b> {{on one leg}} of the {{opponent}} {{to prevent them from}} advancing to full mount or side control, generally a last defensive position before {{the opponent}} gains a dominant position, such as side control or full mount.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} the natural course of the river forms {{naturally}} almost a complete loop, a hook shape of a peninsula which {{is attached to the}} towpath (here, northerly) bank in the form of walk-over, relatively wide, lock gates. The long hook or spit of land forms today a series of three weir-divided islands in the River Thames in England, adjacent to Penton <b>Hook</b> <b>Lock.</b> It has been since at least the medieval period the southern extremity of Staines upon Thames. Across the river is neighbours Penton Hook Marina, Penton Hook Yacht Club and riverside homes of Thorpe, Surrey, to the west and riverside homes of Laleham Reach, Chertsey to the south and east, the latter being the most distant part of Chertsey from the town itself.|$|R
50|$|The Kandahar design offered two {{advantages}} over the earlier designs. The {{use of a}} spring to provide tension allowed fine control over the mechanics, and a smooth action that did not suddenly increase tension {{at the end of}} the stroke. It also allowed the skier to adjust the tension by moving the spring or turning a control knob, allowing for different conditions and skiing style and stride. More important was the addition of two small hooks on either side of the ski near the heel. When skiing downhill, the skier could clip the cable under the <b>hooks,</b> <b>locking</b> down the heel and providing much greater control. Now the ski could be turned by rotating the leg, forcing the ski to stem. When it was time to climb back up the hill, the cable was unhooked and returned to being a normal cross-country binding.|$|R
5000|$|X-guard - <b>Hooks</b> are <b>locked</b> in {{opposition}} around one leg (creating the X shape {{for which the}} position is named), while the practitioner traps other leg with his arm. Hooks change position to sweep opponent in different directions, giving the practitioner the ability to vary his attacks and set up several different submission attempts.|$|R
5000|$|Butterfly guard - Butterfly <b>hooks</b> are <b>locked</b> in {{the inner}} thigh of {{opponent}}, and are used to keep opponent off balance. They {{also can be used}} to sweep an opponent, in order to advance to a more dominant position. Butterfly hooks are generally used in tandem with some combination of overhooks and/or underhooks to secure the butterfly guard.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{upstream}} of the lock, {{the river}} is crossed by the M3 Chertsey Bridge carrying the M3 motorway high overhead. The Middlesex bank has gravel pits {{out of sight and}} then park land until it reaches Laleham, where there are riverside houses. From an inlet at Laleham, [...] of water are pumped into the Queen Mary Reservoir each day.The Surrey bank is wild and open with a very small reservoir and pumping station beyond it. There is then a stretch of housing interspersed with boatyards, until short of Penton Hook. Before Penton <b>Hook</b> <b>Lock,</b> the backwater curves round Penton Hook Island to some marinas. This is the start point of the Abbey River backwater which rejoins the Thames below Chertsey Lock. Burway Rowing Club is based at Thameside at Laleham on the reach and Burway Junior Regatta and Burway Head races take place from the area beneath the M3 Motorway Bridge.|$|R
50|$|On 22 February, at Ellapur {{railway station}} in Hasanparty mandal, trains were {{stranded}} {{for an hour}} after pro-Telangana agitators removed <b>hook</b> <b>locks</b> from the rail tracks. Pro-Telangana activists halted the Delhi-bound AP Express at Kazipet railway station for 15 minutes on the same day. Before the train reached Kazipet, a few students rained stones on the AP Express at Ellapur in Hasanparty mandal. As many as 114 cases were booked under Section 151 of the CrPc and 1,978 persons were taken into custody. Pro-Telangana students and lawyers ransacked the MMTS station on Necklace road and the reservation office was set afire. A car showroom was ransacked at Habsiguda and {{an attempt was made}} to burn a train at Jamia Osmania station. On 23 February pro-Telangana protesters set one bogie of the Kazipet-Manguru passenger on fire near Kesamudram railway station in Karimnagar district. Three buses of a private engineering college parked near Habsiguda were set ablaze by suspected Telangana activists on 24 February. On 2 March, Pro-Telangana activists disrupted a film shooting by burning down the set.|$|R
25|$|Democritus, {{along with}} Leucippus and Epicurus, {{proposed}} the earliest {{views on the}} shapes and connectivity of atoms. They reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded {{to the shape of}} the atoms involved. Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with <b>hooks</b> that <b>lock</b> them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials.|$|R
5000|$|Spider guard <b>Hooks</b> are {{generally}} <b>locked</b> against arms of opponent to prevent strikes and limit guard passing, sometimes {{used to set}} up shoulder and armlocks. Spider guard also uses hooks to control other areas {{but this is one}} of the most common.|$|R
50|$|The USP is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol with a {{mechanically locked}} breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system {{has a large}} rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug {{on the underside of}} the barrel chamber comes into contact with a <b>hooked</b> <b>locking</b> block at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide stop lever’s axis pin and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the locking surface on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This tapered surface produces a camming action which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.|$|R
40|$|Animal {{attachment}} to a substrate {{is very different}} in terrestrial and aquatic environments. We discuss variations in both the forces acting to detach animals and forces of attachment. While in a terrestrial environment gravity is commonly understood {{as the most important}} detachment force, under submerged conditions gravity is nearly balanced out by buoyancy and therefore matters little. In contrast, flow forces such as drag and lift are of higher importance in an aquatic environment. Depending on the flow conditions, flow forces can reach much higher values than gravity and vary in magnitude and direction. For many of the attachment mechanisms (adhesion including glue, friction, suction and mechanical principles such as <b>hook,</b> <b>lock,</b> clamp and spacer) significant differences have to be considered under water. For example, the main principles of dry adhesion, van der Waals forces and chemical bonding, which make a gecko stick to the ceiling, are weak under submerged conditions. Capillary forces are very important for wet adhesion, e. g., in terrestrial beetles or flies, but usually do not occur under water. Viscous forces are likely an important contributor to adhesion under water in some mobile animals such as torrent frogs and mayflies, but there are still many open questions to be answered. Glue is the dominant attachment mechanism of sessile aquatic animals and the aquatic realm presents many challenges to this mode of attachment. Viscous forces and the lack of surface tension under submerged conditions also affect frictional interactions in the aquatic environment. Moreover, the limitation of suction to the pressure difference at vacuum conditions can be ameliorated under water, due to the increasing pressure with water depth...|$|R
