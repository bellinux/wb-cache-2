5|$|When Rand {{published}} {{her version}} of the play in 1968, she wrote that although she <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> Broadway title, it was too well known to change it again. She agreed to using Penthouse Legend as the title for the 1973 revival production.|$|E

He attempted to join a group called Songfellows who sang at the local church, but he was unsuccessful.

5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E
5|$|Balcon <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> {{film and}} his initial thought was {{to cut its}} running time down to an hour and {{classify}} it as a second feature. He did not provide Mackendrick with another directoral role, but assigned him to second unit work. Another of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage at Ealing Studios and re-edited the film; this version was the one released into cinemas.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{received}} mixed reviews; {{some critics}} liked the Forerunner culture and suspense that Bear created, but others <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> characters, found the plot too slow {{and concluded that}} the novel was suited only to existing fans of the Halo series. Cryptum appeared on multiple bestseller lists after promotion on Halo Waypoint, a website that serves as a hub for Halo-related information.|$|E

5|$|Eddie {{eventually}} {{decided that}} he wanted to become a Roman Catholic priest, {{following in the footsteps of}} his uncle, Father Michael. He received Catholic confirmation in early 1961, and in September of that year he began his studies at the Monsignor McClancy Memorial High School in East Elmhurst. Bullied for being effeminate and homosexual, Eddie <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> school, and was ultimately expelled for being overly critical of their religious instruction.|$|E
5|$|Eon again {{turned to}} Richard Maibaum for the script, {{although}} Paul Dehn was later introduced for rewrites. After missing From Russia with Love, Ken Adam returned as production designer. Adam's imagination provided {{the idea of}} gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars for the scenes in the United States Bullion Depository. Saltzman <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built.|$|E
5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> Prince of Wales, {{and took}} little {{interest}} in his grandchildren.

Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E

5|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, the episode garnered 2.35 million viewers and generally negative reviews from television critics, with many criticizing the case-of-the-week as cliché and moralistic. Eric Goldman of IGN compared the episode negatively to an after school special, while Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> portrayal of Rashad.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Hitler's reprimand, Goebbels {{launched a campaign}} to promote the antisemitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an antisemitic film. Hitler preferred films such as Der ewige Jude which presented the Nazi antisemitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> crudeness of such straight-forward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching antisemitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|Lucas' initial {{idea for}} Indiana's sidekick was a {{virginal}} young princess, but Huyck, Katz and Spielberg <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> idea.

5|$|The album {{consists}} of songs performed by Powderfinger in concerts at Sydney Entertainment Centre, and Fox Studios in Sydney.

These Days: Live in Concert earned a mixed response from reviewers; some enjoyed the energy and flair of the live performances, while others <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> lack of dynamism.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the K Foundation's publicist, Mick Houghton, {{claimed that}} the voting for the K Foundation's award was {{supposed}} to produce a tie, to illustrate the hypocrisy of the Turner award committee, but that strangely the result had been a huge margin of victory for Whiteread. He speculated that the few thousand voters had just liked or rather <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> sound of her name.|$|E

5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|After reigning two years, Amon {{was assassinated}} by his servants, who conspired against him, and was succeeded {{by his son}} Josiah, {{who at the time}} was eight years old. After Amon's {{assassination}} his murderers became unpopular with the people, and were ultimately killed. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated because people <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> heavy influence that Assyria, an age-old enemy of Judah responsible for the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.|$|E
5|$|As King William {{intensely}} <b>disliked</b> <b>the</b> Duchess and Conroy, {{he vowed}} to wait until Victoria came of age to die simply {{to keep them from}} a regency. In 1831, the year of William's coronation, Conroy and the Duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with Victoria to expose her to the people and solidify their status as potential regents. On one trip Conroy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford. Their efforts were ultimately successful and, in November 1831, it was declared that the Duchess would be sole regent in the event of Victoria's young queenship, while Conroy could claim to be the closest adviser to the Duchess and her daughter.|$|E
