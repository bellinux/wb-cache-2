On August10, a tropical wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean. Some organization of shower and thunderstorm activity initially took place, but dry air soon <b>impinged</b> upon the system and imparted weakening. The wave trekked westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean for several days. On August19, an area of low pressure consolidated within the wave west of Central America. With favorable atmospheric conditions, convective activity and banding features increased around the system and by August22, the system acquired enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E while situated about 370mi (595km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Development was initially fast-paced, as the depression acquired tropical storm-force winds within sixhours of formation and hurricane-force by August23. However, due to some vertical wind shear its intensification rate stalled, and for a time it remained a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|Just after 9:00 PM CST (0300 UTC), a {{supercell}} {{that had}} spawned tornadoes over northern Mississippi {{as well as}} a deadly EF4 in Hardin County, Tennessee, moved to the northeast over Nashville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported there and no significant damage was reported in Nashville or Davidson County, though funnel clouds were sighted during the storm's passage. At the time the supercell moved over Nashville, a National Hockey League game between the Nashville Predators and the Carolina Hurricanes, which was nationally televised on Versus, was being played at the Sommet Center. With just over nine minutes left in the third period, Predators head coach Barry Trotz was told that the game may have to be stopped. Although the game continued to completion, at the game's end fans were not allowed to leave the arena until the storm had passed. National Weather Service Meteorologist Bobby Boyd theorized that cold air downbursts <b>impinged</b> on the development of a strong, low-level circulation as the storm moved through the Nashville area, forcing the area of rotation to remain aloft as it crossed over Davidson County and downtown Nashville.|$|E
5|$|The Second Symphony, and Livre pour orchestre and the Cello Concerto which followed, were {{composed}} during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His {{mother died in}} 1967, and in 1967–70 {{there was a great}} deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they <b>impinged</b> on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the Cello Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.|$|E
40|$|The {{flow and}} {{temperature}} fields {{caused by a}} two-dimensional heating air jet obliquely <b>impinging</b> on a flat plate are experimentally characterized. Whilst the jet flow is discharged at Re(Dh) = 8. 2 X 10 (3) based on the hydraulic diameter of the orifice, D(h), and the jet exit-to-plate spacing (separation distance) is fixed at 8 D(h). the impingement angle (inclination) is systematically decreased from 90 degrees (normal <b>impinging)</b> to 30, (oblique <b>impinging).</b> A separate experiment is carried out for a two-dimensional cooling jet obliquely <b>impinging</b> on a heated plate (constant heat flux). The results demonstrate that the response of local surface temperature to plate inclination behaves {{in a completely different}} manner. For <b>impinging</b> jet cooling, the inclination (from normal <b>impinging</b> position) reduces the local effective temperature values at corresponding points about actual stagnation point, inclusive of it. For <b>impinging</b> jet heating, the inclination causes, conversely, an increase in local surface temperature including the stagnation point temperature. However, the shifting of the actual stagnation point towards the uphill side of the plate is consistently observed for both hot and cold jet cases. This newly found feature for an obliquely <b>impinging</b> jet is attributed to the combined effects of asymmetric entrainment and momentum redistribution (i. e., thickening/thinning of hydraulic boundary layers {{on each side of the}} plate with respect to the actual stagnation point).

30|$|In the {{application}} of jet impingements, circular or slot jets are the main jet configurations. For these two configurations, flow and heat transfer mechanics are significantly different. It seems that greater research activity on heat and mass transfer with circular <b>impinging</b> jets has been predominantly published [1 – 3, 15, 16]. However, investigations on heat and mass transfer with slot jet impingement have attracted more attention recently. In fact, slot jet impingements offer many more beneficial features, such as higher cooling effectiveness, greater uniformity and more controllability, as underlined in [17]. For example, these factors allow for fulfillment of the increasing heat flux and decreasing dimensions in electronics packages [17 – 24]. The common types of <b>impinging</b> jets are with or without confinement. Confined <b>impinging</b> jets have the advantages of smaller space design, while unconfined <b>impinging</b> jets have an advantage of simple design and easy fabrication. The two types of <b>impinging</b> jets have their own merits, and they are both commonly used as the cooling solutions, and the literature reviews on the subject have been provided in [2, 3, 6]. The effects of confinement on <b>impinging</b> jet heat transfer have been considered in [25 – 27]. Moreover, several studies show {{the importance of the}} subject and different cases have been investigated, such as confined slot-jet impingement on a moving plate [28], <b>impinging</b> jet on obliquely a flat surface [29], <b>impinging</b> jet on a porous medium [30] and slot jet impingement cooling on a semi-circular concave [31].|$|R

Effects of an external perturbation on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the transitional <b>impinging</b> jet have been examined.

The external perturbation leads to the large-scale vortical structures in the primary jet stream, which subsequently lead to the strong oscillatory behaviour of the <b>impinging</b> jet. The vortical structures lead to flow transitional behaviour that enhances mixing of the hot jet with the ambient fluid.
