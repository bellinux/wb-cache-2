40|$|High {{technology}} {{firms are}} often {{considered to be}} one of the drivers of structural change in Eastern Germany. With regard to the possible benefits of <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms,</b> the focus is on employments effects in particular. In a first step, the article investigates the regional distribution of firms from high technology sectors in Eastern Germany. Furthermore, within the framework of a case study of firms from business incubators, it is investigated whether <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms</b> in fact show a high growth potential, as it is often postulated. Empirical results concerning the spatial pattern show a highly heterogeneous distribution, with a strong North-South divide. In particular, path dependency seems to be relevant in explaining the high-tech patterns/agglomerations identified. In addition, the case study results demonstrate the strong growth potential of <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms</b> compared to low-tech firms and firms from rather traditional sectors respectively, whereby a higher R&D intensity (within the sample of <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms)</b> is found to be associated with higher growth. However, the article warns against “high-tech euphoria”, since the total number of existing <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms</b> as well as the number of newly founded high technology ventures is modest, and therefore the overall employment effect is rather limited. ...|$|R

The number of women starting and owning a business has increased dramatically and female entrepreneurs are entering non-traditional sectors such as high technology, construction and manufacturing. This paper investigates the trends in high-tech entrepreneurship by women in four US metropolitan regions (Silicon Valley, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Washington, DC; and Portland, Oregon). The research examines the sectoral and spatial segmentation patterns of women-owned <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms.</b> Although women are entering non-traditional sectors, the research finds that women entrepreneurs tend to own businesses in female-typed high-tech sectors. In established high-tech regions like Silicon Valley and Boston, male-typed and female-typed women-owned <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms</b> differ significantly in terms of sectoral and spatial segmentation regardless of firm age. While differences between male-typed and female-typed firms are not significant at the regional level for Washington, DC, the analysis shows significant intra-metropolitan differences for the female-typed <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms.</b> The paper concludes that sectoral and spatial segmentation are powerful dynamics that shape business ownership by women in high technology...|$|R

The negative effect of the threat of termination on innovation is statistically significant only for <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms.</b> For low-tech firms there is no statistically significant relation between the threat of termination and firm innovation. One plausible explanation is that <b>high-tech</b> <b>firms</b> are inherently risky and have higher rates of project failure. Adding the risk of higher threat of termination makes the manager more risk averse and forces her to avoid investing in value increasing innovations.
