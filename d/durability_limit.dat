40|$|In reliability-based {{durability}} {{design of}} reinforced concrete (RC) structures, the depassivation of reinforcing steels is often taken as the <b>durability</b> <b>limit</b> state, {{and the target}} reliability index is a key parameter controlling the long-term durability performance of RC members. This study investigates the impact of target reliability of durability design in design phase on the life-cycle performance and the maintenance cost of RC structures. For this purpose, a chloride diffusion model for steel depassivation of RC members is firstly established; and then the cost models for maintenance of RC beam members are proposed. Based on the detailed section design and the <b>durability</b> <b>limit</b> state of steel depassivation, Monte-Carlo simulation {{is used to calculate}} the reliability index for the durability design of RC beam members; and then according to the defined maintenance inventions and associated costs, the maintenance costs for the whole service life are evaluated for different durability reliability indices.

Article 8 provides that the term <b>Durability</b> <b>limit</b> state, produced by physical and chemical actions, different loads and actions of structural analysis, which can degrade the concrete and reinforcement to unacceptable limits. The verification of this limit state can be done through a procedure {{set out in the}} provisions of the Standard. This procedure is based on the use of tables that, depending on the aggressiveness of the environment in which the structure is the concrete strength and the life of the project, setting the quality of the concrete cover (minimum thickness and maximum water cement ratio of concrete used) and the maximum crack width.

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has {{initiated}} studies to assess alternative durability options that may {{provide access to}} compositional regions of interest {{in support of the}} accelerated cleanup mission at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). One of the options being pursued is the redefinition of the <b>durability</b> model acceptability <b>limits.</b> Some of the conservative steps used in establishing the current limits without comprising the high confidence required for meeting the specification on the wasteform quality were identified and eliminated.

Although these limits are available for implementation, there is currently no driving force to do so (i. e., the current Frit 418 - Sludge Batch 3 (SB 3) system is liquidus temperature (TL) limited).

The objectives of this task were to investigate (and generate) the incentive of applying the proposed <b>durability</b> <b>limits</b> in the Product Composition Control System (PCCS) from a glass formulation perspective. Glass compositions were identified or developed to transition into and through the region of GP acceptability as defined by the current and proposed <b>durability</b> <b>limits.</b> The progression through the newly defined acceptability region was accomplished by increasing the total alkali in the glass via higher alkali frits and/or waste loading (WL). The focus of this report is on the measured durability response as it compares to model predictions to assess the applicability and/or potential conservatism of the various <b>limits</b> or <b>durability</b> approaches. The normalized boron release values (NL [B] g/L) for the study glasses ranged from approximately 1. 0 g/L to 2. 0 g/L. The Product Consistency Test (PCT) responses provide evidence that implementation of the proposed GP limits will provide access to higher alkali compositional regions without compromising product quality. In fact, the data provide evidence that the proposed limits may still be overly conservative. These results also provide continued incentive to assess the index system and other durability alternatives to provide access into compositional regions of interest to improve melt rate and waste loading which {{play a major role in}} defining waste throughput for DWPF.

To date, platinum (Pt)-loaded carbon is considered as the most effective ORR electrocatalyst [6, 7, 8, 9]. However, Pt-based catalysts still have several shortcomings, such as poor <b>durability,</b> <b>limited</b> reserves, high cost, and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning [10, 11]. Currently, metal-free heteroatom-doped carbons are widely considered as promising catalysts to replace Pt-based carbon catalysts {{in the near future}} because of their high electrocatalytic activity toward ORR, cost effectiveness, long-term cycling stability, and excellent tolerance to methanol and CO oxidations [12, 13]. Among these materials, nitrogen (N)-doped carbons are extensively studied because the electronegativity of N (3.04) induces charge redistribution of adjacent atoms in an N-doped carbon surface layer, which greatly enhances the ORR activity of carbon electrocatalysts [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Besides N, other nonmetal atoms with different electronegativities, such as boron (B) [19, 20], sulfur (S) [21, 22], phosphorus (P) [23, 24], and fluorine (F) [25, 26, 27, 28, 29], can enhance the ORR activity of carbon catalysts.|$|R

This paper deals with the quay-wall of the new container terminal at Zeebrugge Harbor, Belgium, which is protected against chloride ingress by means of a water repellent agent immediately after construction in 1993, using Protectosil® BHN (former Dynasylan® BH N, an alkyltriethoxysilane), pre-evaluated in a preliminary research program. To judge the in site effectiveness of the hydrophobic agent as a water repellent treatment, three subsequent in site surveys have been conducted in 1996, 1998 and recently in 2005. Based on the cores drilled, the chloride profiles are determined as a function of time, both in a non-treated and treated location. The obtained data are used to feed the deterioration models related to the chloride ingress into the structure and to the increase of carbonation depth. The environmental loading originating from the tidal effect of the North Sea will differ for the parts of the quay-wall in tidal zone, above tidal zone or on top of the quay-wall, were the test samples have been taken. As a result, the failure probability for the <b>durability</b> <b>limit</b> state function related to the preset service life is estimated.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Engineering composites and especially long fibre carbon composites have been in high demand not only in aerospace and automotive applications, but also in high end everyday applications. In aerospace, carbon composites are used predominantly for secondary structures attached by joints or fasteners to various alloys or even different composites, and are exposed to service loads and repetitive impacting. Impact fatigue (IF) is not studied adequately for long cycles and relevant literature is investigating mainly drop weight tests and high speed projectile experiments. The main aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the behaviour long fibre CFRP’S exposed to repeated low-velocity, low energy impacts, and to observe the damage effects of this regime on the structural integrity of these materials. Two types of specimen configurations using CFRPS’s were used and exposed to loading conditions relevant to the Izod impact fatigue test (IIFT), and the tensile impact fatigue test (TIFT), {{in order to determine the}} fatigue behaviour of the specimens for each of these load conditions. For the IIFT, the fatigue life was investigated using IM 7 / 8552 unidirectional specimens and T 700 /LTM 45 cross-ply specimens were utilised for the TIFT. The specimen thicknesses were altered in both cases and parametric studies were carried out, where it was seen that IF results in high level of scatter and the apparent decrease in life was seen at relatively modest levels of maximum force after relatively few cycles. In the case of the IIFT, a <b>durability</b> <b>limit</b> was not apparent which increases the complications when designing against IF. In the case of the TIFT the stiffness deterioration was reflected as an increase of the loading time, in the force vs time graph, over the total fatigue life span. Fatigue crack growth was investigated using fractography and X-ray micro-CT at the micro and macro level. It was seen, that IF had the potential to initiate cracks and to cause their propagation at low levels of loading. For the IIFT, a single crack was growing substantially in the fibre direction and across the sample width causing matrix cracking and probably breaking of some fibres, which acted as impact wave guides since matrix cracks were propagating initially along the length of the fibres. In the case of the TIFT multiple damage modes were presented (matrix cracks, axial splits and delaminations). Their sequence and progression was successfully v captured and contrasted against the number of impacts. Axial splits governed the damage scenario, with delaminations extending between them and the free edges. For the TIFT, IF was studied using the force-life (F-Nf) and energy-life (E-Nf) curves. The tests undertaken showed that when halving the thickness of the laminates the fatigue life presented a 10 -fold decrease as well as higher scatter. Finite element modelling was undertaken to validate the experimental data of the TIFT test. Successful simulation of a single impact was carried out using a fully transient 3 -D model of the actual experiment configuration which involved geometric non-linearities in addition to the multiple contact conditions. The analysis was undertaken using the Abaqus 6. 11 explicit solver. Since the numerical single impact results (force vs time response) was in agreement with the experimental results, the crack modes, experimentally observed, were also incorporated in the model utilising the use of the cohesive zone elements (CZE) ...|$|E

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{evaluated}} a {{large number}} of Sludge Batch 6 (SB 6) composition projections to support frit optimization for SB 6 vitrification at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The evaluations discussed in this report occurred over a period of about 4 months, and included about 40 composition projections, developed by both Savannah River Remediation (SRR) and SRNL. Paper study assessments were used to evaluate the sludge composition projections with arrays of potential frit compositions using the predictive models in the DWPF Product Composition Control System (PCCS). Both nominal sludge compositions and sludge compositions with anticipated compositional variation were considered. The model predictions were used to identify candidate frit compositions for each SB 6 projection and to provide some guidance to SRR on washing and blending strategies for SB 6 preparation. This report presents a chronological review of this process and summarizes the findings at each stage. Following initial feedback from this work, the number of washes in Tank 51 was reduced to increase the projected sodium concentration in SB 6. Analyses of predicted frit performance before and after a potential decant of Tank 40 showed that the post-decant SB 6 composition would be difficult to process with any frit composition and that this scenario should be avoided. Based on the most recent SB 6 projections (February 2010 SB 6 composition projections developed at SRNL using the measured SB 6 qualification sample composition and the revised Tank Farm washing plan), Frit 418 appears to be viable for SB 6 processing at a target waste loading of 36 %. A Nominal Stage PCCS Measurement Acceptability Region (MAR) assessment gave projected operating windows of 25 - 41 % waste loading, limited by predictions of nepheline crystallization. The projected operating window is reduced to 25 - 38 % waste loading when anticipated compositional variation is considered, again limited by predictions of nepheline crystallization. Blend points between 62 and 40 inches of Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) heel in Tank 40 had no practical impact on the projected performance of Frit 418. This assessment is made from a paper study approach only and assumes that no decant of Tank 40 will occur during SB 6 processing. A decant of Tank 40 would reduce the Na 2 O concentration in Tank 40 to a point where {{it would be very difficult}} to target a waste loading of 36 % for SB 6 with Frit 418. The performance of Frit 418 with SB 6 is limited by predictions of nepheline crystallization, which is a <b>durability</b> <b>limiting</b> constraint.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{geosynthetic}} products {{has been}} steadily increasing {{in the construction of}} structures such as retaining walls, steepened slopes, and landfills for the containment of hazardous waste. The lack of information on <b>durability</b> has <b>limited</b> the full utilization of geosynthetics. To assess the durability of polyester (PET) geosynthet-ics, an accelerated testing protocol was developed and a test program implemented. The test results indicated that low-tenacity PET commercial geosynthetic products were more susceptible to hydrolytic degradation than high-tenacity geosynthetics due to lower molecular weight and a high number of carboxyl end groups (CEG). Tests con-ducted in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions exhibited the same trends...|$|R
40|$|This book {{counteracts}} {{the claim}} that luxury and sustainability are conflicting concepts, and contends that they can successfully co-exist. Discussing key characteristics of luxury such as craftsmanship and preservation of artisan skills, product quality and <b>durability,</b> and <b>limited</b> quantities of luxury goods, {{the authors argue that}} luxury brands are inherently sustainable from economic, social and environmental perspectives. Sustainable Luxury Brands gives a comprehensive overview of luxury to demonstrate this claim, also focusing on sustainable luxury from a consumer perspective. The authors furthermore compare and contrast sustainability within the mass market to the luxury sector, and present insights into current and upcoming topics in luxury research...|$|R
40|$|Salt {{crystallization}} {{damage is}} one of the most common causes of decay for bedding, pointing and plastering mortar. Attempts to tackle the problem showed to often a <b>limited</b> <b>durability</b> to salt decay and a low compatibility with historical buildings. Recent research has shown new possibilities for improving the durability of mortars by engineering of the pore size, adding organic water repellent substances and salt crystallization inhibitor...|$|R
50|$|Many {{plastics}} {{are considerably}} sensitive to atomic oxygen and ionizing radiation. Coatings resistant to atomic oxygen {{are a common}} protection method, especially for plastics. Silicone-based paints and coatings are frequently employed, due to their excellent resistance to radiation and atomic oxygen. However, the silicone <b>durability</b> is somewhat <b>limited,</b> as the surface exposed to atomic oxygen is converted to silica which is brittle and tends to crack.|$|R
40|$|Thin Bituminous Surface Overlay and Surface Treatments are {{typically}} protective intervention in pavement maintenance {{with a minimum}} thickness of around 12 - 15 mm, or about half the thickness of similar sized conventional asphalt wearing course mixes. The Ultra Thin Overlays have minimum thickness of around 3 - 4 mm and, as thin overlays and surface treatments, but in different way, they allow to extend the <b>durability</b> with <b>limited</b> costs, reducing the points of weakness, sealing cracks and voids, improving water removal and reducing aging and raveling. The paper describe how opportune and targeted mix design can increase the skid resistance, the optic performances, acoustics and the superficial outflow, the resistance to the abrasion, high temperatures, etc. ...|$|R
