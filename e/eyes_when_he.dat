5|$|Returning to Tennessee {{after his}} presidency, Johnson sought {{political}} vindication, and gained {{it in his}} <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was elected to the}} Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died just months into his term. While some admire Johnson's strict constitutionalism, his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African Americans is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.|$|E
500|$|According to the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Gautama curses Indra {{to bear a}} {{thousand}} vulvae, which will turn to <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> worships the sun-god Surya. Ahalya, though innocent, is turned to stone for sixty thousand years and destined to be redeemed only by Rama's touch. Ahalya accepts the verdict without debate. In another version in the same Purana, Gautama catches Indra fleeing as a cat and curses him with castration. Ahalya's plea of innocence is acknowledged by Gautama, who declares that her mind is pure and she has kept the [...] "vow of chastity and fidelity", but another man's seed has defiled her body. Gautama orders {{her to go to}} the forest and become a stone until rescued by the touch of Rama's feet. In Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka's Telugu rendition, when Indra reluctantly leaves, Gautama arrives and curses Ahalya to become a stone, to be later purified by Rama's feet. After she is freed from the curse, Gautama and Ahalya are reconciled and they spend their days in bed, exploring sexual techniques.|$|E
500|$|The {{track is}} {{followed}} by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, [...] "Mind the gap...". [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> told me the truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E

500|$|Richard was nicknamed [...] "the Comet" [...] {{early in}} his career. When {{teammate}} Ray Getliffe remarked that Richard [...] "went in like a rocket" [...] {{as he approached the}} opposition goal, Richard was dubbed [...] "The Rocket" [...] by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the Montreal Star and Dink Carroll of the Montreal Gazette have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because [...] "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender Jacques Plante declared {{it one of the most}} appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to [...] "the rocket's red glare" [...] referenced in [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Glenn Hall agreed: [...] "What I remember most about Rocket was his <b>eyes.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> came flying toward you with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying." ...|$|E

Since Billy, Storm Shadow, and the Baroness were left {{under the influence}} of Cobra's Brain Wave Scanner {{at the end of the}} original series, Snake Eyes is on this mission to save Storm Shadow. At the end of this story, Storm Shadow returns to his ways as a ninja, and says he will deal with Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is ready. Snake Eyes and Scarlett move back to his home in the High Sierras, where Timber has died but sired a litter of pups before passing, and Snake Eyes adopts one. After the G.I. Joe Team disbanded, Snake Eyes and Scarlett leave the military and become engaged, but for unknown reasons on the day of the wedding, Snake Eyes disappears and retreats again to his cabin in the High Sierras.|$|E

2500|$|A power {{struggle}} between Hariri and the Military Committee occurred between 23 June and 8 July 1963. The Military Committee viewed Hariri's independent power base with unease. Bitar supported Hariri in his conflict against the Military Committee; presumably believing that Hariri {{worked as a}} check on the Military Committee's growing power. On 23 June, when Hariri was on a diplomatic visit to Algiers, the Military Committee transferred his supporters from sensitive military posts and demoted Hariri to become Syria's military attaché in Washington. On the same day, a new Agrarian Reform Lawwhich abolished the 1962 Agrarian Reform Law and amending the 1958 onewas published. Bitar had promised to introduce a new agrarian law for some time; according to Rabinovich its publication was [...] "probably fixed so as to serve the Ba'ath in its struggle against Hariri". Hariri resisted the Committee's move and promptly returned to Damascus to marshal his supporters. Neither Hariri nor the Committee sought a violent confrontation, and {{when it became clear that}} the Committee had a larger following in the officer corps, Hariri admitted defeat and left the country. He left for Paris on 8 July and was accompanied to the airport by Haddad and Bitar. Bitar reportedly had tears in his <b>eyes</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> said goodbye because he believed that without Hariri, the Committee would have full control over the military, leaving the civilian leadership considerably weaker in its competition for control of the Ba'ath Party.|$|E
