5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, in order to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> space and time on the ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he {{proved to be an}} effective assist-provider.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Levesque's {{role as an}} Executive Senior Advisor {{was officially}} formalized as he was given an office at WWE {{headquarters}} in Stamford, Connecticut. Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011. In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's role within {{the company has been}} under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers view {{it as a way to}} keep him on top on-screen and to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> television time. Levesque has spoken against this criticism and has denied all of it. Additionally, Levesque has been credited for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{set himself}} to {{finishing}} Ulysses in Paris, delighted {{to find that}} he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from Miss Shaw Weaver meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> and more problems and he often wore an eyepatch. He was treated by Dr Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929. Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from schizophrenia. Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung at the time, who after reading Ulysses {{is said to have}} concluded that her father had schizophrenia. Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.|$|E

But golf was not the most important reason.|$|E
25|$|Whitehead {{began work}} in his father's {{business}} when he was sixteen. He earned 2s.6d. a week, never progressed beyond being an ordinary workman of the lowest grade, and according to an obituary in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), enjoyed what he did. A similar tribute in The Manchester Guardian noted otherwise, {{saying that he was}} not particularly enamoured with his work. Both agree that he met with medical students in Manchester while attending chemistry lectures intended to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> knowledge of the workings of the family business; later, he also met with them while attending the market in Manchester on behalf of the business.|$|E
25|$|Foch {{had earlier}} refused to send 4 French {{divisions}} to Flanders but now redeployed Maistre’s Tenth French Army to the Somme sector, freeing up British forces. Foch {{was given the}} title of Generalissimo (he would have preferred “Commander-in-Chief”) (14 April) to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> clout over Petain, who was still reluctant to release French reserves. Eventually, later in the year, Petain would simply be placed under Foch’s command, although Haig and Pershing retained their right of appeal to their own governments. During a renewed attack (17 April) Foch {{drew attention to the}} valour of the British at First Ypres and refused to send further French reinforcements so as to keep a strategic reserve.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1931, rumours {{spread that}} Kreuger & Toll and other {{companies}} in Kreuger's empire were financially unstable. In February 1932, Kreuger turned to Sveriges Riksbank {{for the second time}} in his life to support him in raising a large increase in his loans. At this time his total loans from Swedish banks were estimated at about half of the Swedish reserve currency, which had started to have negative effects on the value of the Swedish currency in the international financial market. In order to grant him more loans, the government required that a complete statement of accounts of Kreuger's entire company group be presented, as the bank's (Sveriges Riksbank) own calculations showed that Kreuger & Toll finances were far too weak to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> loans.|$|E
25|$|Many boxing {{analysts and}} experts said that Darren Barker has {{the skills and}} ring generalship to one day become a champion, but that his skills were not perfected enough to do {{anything}} against Martínez. The first few rounds showed that Barker was actually able to make Martínez uncomfortable in the ring and <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> trouble than expected. Throughout the fight, Barker consistently gave Martínez problems, while never hurting him or really ever winning any of the rounds, he gave Martínez a challenge by coming in but not giving much offence to let Martínez counter or land anything clean. He also managed to get Martínez's nose to bleed early in the rounds by an upper-cut. Martínez, however, fought through the difficulty and eventually found openings {{which led to a}} knock-out of Barker, in the 11th with a right hook.|$|E
500|$|The Yankees {{promoted}} Jeter to the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> at-bats. He batted [...]247 in {{his first}} 11 games with Greensboro, and struggled defensively, making nine errors in 48 chances. Weighing , Jeter had a scrawny appearance that did not match his reputation as the Yankees' future leader. Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte, who played for the Hornets that season, at first questioned the hype surrounding Jeter, but recognized his talent and poise.|$|E

500|$|D3 {{provided}} the development team with more focus groups, {{and as a}} result, the game slowly incorporated more combat and less platforming and puzzles. Fred's combat capabilities were revamped to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> attacks, counterattacks and combinations. [...] D3 also gave Vicious Cycle more time to develop the game, {{with the hope of}} receiving better reviews and potentially turning Dead Head Fred into a franchise. [...] The delay pushed back the game's release from January to August 2007. D3Publisher bought Vicious Cycle two months before the game's release, but the company's headquarters remained in North Carolina and the staff was retained.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> of a sense of what's going on. I had wanted to strip away the gift {{for a long time and}} see if the show really played without it. But we got back into that".|$|E
500|$|On August 4, 2017, Owumi {{signed with}} the Surrey Scorchers, moving to his third BBL team in his career. After making the decision, he said, [...] "Since being in the league, Surrey has had a great fan base and can't wait to win some {{silverware}} for the organization." [...] Owumi also revealed that he prefers playing in smaller cities like Guildford, Surrey, in contrast to London, where he had played previously. He was strongly encouraged to join because Scorchers' head coach Creon Raftopoulos would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> freedom to bring in players he knew to the team. Owumi made his first appearance for Surrey on September 24 at the British Basketball All-Stars Championships, which features 12-minute games and several special rules. Although his team lost both games at the event, Owumi made two three-pointers in their opener against the Leicester Riders.|$|E

500|$|Though he is {{not opposed}} to doing work on TV or film scores, Schyman {{currently}} prefers to compose music for video games as he feels video game soundtracks <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> freedom and a greater technical challenge. He {{has said that the}} video games industry is filled with [...] "nice people whose egos were in check", which was not always his experience in the film and television industries. However, he feels that his television and film career has been [...] "a great experience" [...] and he [...] "still love scoring film and TV". He names his favorite composer [...] "at the moment" [...] as Gustav Mahler, and some of his favorite music as that from artists such as Prokofiev and Bartók. He enjoys music from the early to mid-20th century, and finds that it influences many of his scores, such as the ones to BioShock and Dante's Inferno.|$|E
500|$|Also that November, Schindler was {{introduced}} to Itzhak Stern, an accountant for Schindler's fellow Abwehr agent Josef [...] "Sepp" [...] Aue, who had taken over Stern's formerly Jewish-owned place of employment as a Treuhander (trustee). Property belonging to Polish Jews, including their possessions, places of business, and homes were seized by the Germans beginning immediately after the invasion, and Jewish citizens were stripped of their civil rights. Schindler showed Stern the balance sheet of a company {{he was thinking of}} acquiring, an enamelware factory called Rekord Ltd owned by a consortium of Jewish businessmen that had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year. Stern advised him that rather than running the company as a trusteeship {{under the auspices of the}} Haupttreuhandstelle Ost (Main Trustee Office for the East), he should buy or lease the business, as that would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> freedom from the dictates of the Nazis, including the freedom to hire more Jews.|$|E
500|$|Lark {{works on}} Lazarus ten {{or more hours}} per day. He uses photo {{references}} and digital tools {{in the early stages}} of his art, but the layouts and drawing are done with traditional tools. He is more involved with the coloring on Lazarus than any other comic he has illustrated. The logo design was finalized by Trautmann and Lark. Lark initially did all of the lettering and inking for Lazarus, but doing so made it impossible to release new issues on a regular schedule. To <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> time to focus on drawing, some of the smaller tasks like logo and type design were given to other people. Brian Level assisted with inking on issues three through ten, when he was replaced by Tyler Boss. Beginning with issue ten, Jodi Wynne took over the lettering duties and Owen Freeman started creating the cover art. Fake advertisements found on the back covers and many of the computer screens and holographic images in the artwork are created by Trautman. Lark and Rucka often discuss whether to use sound effects in scenes or limit their use. Lark does not want to rely on them to convey information because they may become a [...] "crutch" [...] in place of including important details in the art.|$|E

500|$|Suspicious of the {{identity}} of the unknown woman based on the carpoolers' general description, Walter Jones called Sharon Kinne and asked if she had seen or spoken to his wife. Kinne allowed that she had, indeed, seen Patricia that day; she had met her to tell her about Walter's affair. According to Kinne, she last saw Patricia where she dropped her off near the Jones house, speaking to an unknown man in a green 1957 Ford. [...] Based on Kinne's admission over the phone, Walter Jones met with her late Friday evening and insisted she <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> details about where his wife was; he later admitted to {{going so far as to}} hold a key to her throat threateningly. Kinne's response was, after leaving Jones, to call John Boldizs and ask him to help her search for Patricia Jones. Shortly before midnight, and within hours of Kinne's conversation with Walter Jones, she and Boldizs had found the body of a woman in a secluded area approximately one mile outside of Independence. According to Boldizs, he had been the one to suggest searching the area in which they encountered the body; it was a spot to which they had often gone on dates before.|$|E
500|$|Cousy {{was one of}} six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders' varsity {{basketball}} team in 1946–47. From {{the start of the}} season, coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two-team system, so that each player would get some time on the court. As members of the [...] "second team", they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game, where they would relieve the [...] "first team" [...] starters. They would sometimes get to play as much as a third or even half of the game, but even at that Cousy was so disappointed with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> of a chance to show off his talents on the court. Early in the season, however, he got into trouble with Julian, who accused him of being a showboater. Even as late as that 1946–47 season basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots. Far different was Cousy's up-tempo, streetball-like game, marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind-the-back dribbling and no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passing. Even so, he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season, finishing with the third-highest total on the team. Led by stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney, the Crusaders finished the 1946–47 basketball season 24–3.|$|E
500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>more</b> bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E
