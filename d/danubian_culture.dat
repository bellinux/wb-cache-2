5|$|Originating {{from central}} European lowlands, the Funnelbeaker people {{were able to}} utilize large expanses of less fertile soils, {{obtained}} by extensive reduction of forested areas, with the increased role of livestock. They moved south into the regions previously developed by the <b>Danubian</b> <b>cultures,</b> {{all the way to}} Bohemia and Moravia. Being more numerous, better fit for the environment, organized and economically more productive, the Funnelbeaker culture people replaced the <b>Danubian</b> <b>cultures</b> in their late phase.|$|R
5|$|The native Mesolithic {{populations were}} slow in {{gradually}} assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning {{with just the}} use of ceramics. It took a thousand years into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became especially important to them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late <b>Danubian</b> <b>cultures,</b> they became the threat that compelled the Danubian farmers to fortify their settlements. The native post-Mesolithic groups expanded beyond the traditional Danubian areas of agricultural development, moving also into ecologically less favorable environments, which included utilization of sandy soils.|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent aDNA {{studies are}} {{progressively}} focusing on various Neolithic and Hunter-Gatherer (HG) populations, providing arguments {{in favor of}} major migrations accompanying European Neolithisation. The major focus was so far on the Linear Pottery Culture (LBK), which introduced the Neolithic way of life in Central Europe {{in the second half of}} 6 th millennium BC. It is widely agreed that people of this culture were genetically different from local HGs and no genetic exchange is seen between the two groups. From the other hand some degree of resurgence of HGs genetic component is seen in late Neolithic groups belonging to the complex of the Funnel Beaker Cultures (TRB). Less attention is brought to various middle Neolithic cultures belonging to Late Danubian sequence which chronologically fall in between those two abovementioned groups. We suspected that genetic influx from HG to farming communities might have happened in Late <b>Danubian</b> <b>cultures</b> since archaeologists see extensive contacts between those two communities. Results: Here we address this issue by presenting 5 complete mitochondrial genomes of various late Danubian individuals from modern-day Poland and combining it with available published data. Our data show that Late <b>Danubian</b> <b>cultures</b> are maternally closely related to Funnel Beaker groups instead of culturally similar LBK. Conclusions: We assume that it is an effect of the presence of individuals belonging to U 5 haplogroup both in Late Danubians and the TRB. The U 5 haplogroup is thought to be a typical for HGs of Europe and therefore we argue that it is an additional evidence of genetic exchange between farming and HG groups taking place at least as far back as in middle Neolithic, in the Late Danubian communities...|$|R

5000|$|The term <b>Danubian</b> <b>culture</b> {{was coined}} by the Australian {{archaeologist}} Vere Gordon Childe {{to describe the}} first agrarian society {{in central and eastern}} Europe. It covers the Linear Pottery culture (Linearbandkeramik, LBK), stroked pottery and Rössen cultures.|$|E

50|$|The Danube basin was {{the site}} of some of the {{earliest}} human <b>cultures.</b> The <b>Danubian</b> Neolithic <b>cultures</b> include the Linear Pottery cultures of the mid-Danube basin. Many sites of the sixth-to-third millennium BC Vinča culture, (Vinča, Serbia) are sited along the Danube. The third millennium BC Vučedol culture (from the Vučedol site near Vukovar, Croatia) is famous for its ceramics.|$|R
50|$|Whatever happened, {{the fact}} is that c. 2400 BC this people of the Corded Ware replace their {{predecessors}} and expand to Danubian and Nordic areas of western Germany. One related branch invades Denmark and southern Sweden (Scandinavian culture of Individual Sepultures), while the mid-Danubian basin, though showing more continuity, shows also clear traits of new Indo-European elites (Vučedol culture). Simultaneously, in the west, the Artenac peoples reach Belgium. With the partial exception of Vučedol, the <b>Danubian</b> <b>cultures,</b> so buoyant just a few centuries ago, are wiped off the map of Europe. The rest of the period {{is the story of a}} mysterious phenomenon: the Beaker people. This group seems to be of mercantile character and to like being buried according to a very specific, almost invariable, ritual. Nevertheless, out of their original area of western Central Europe, they appear only inside local cultures, so they never invaded and assimilated but rather went to live among those peoples, keeping their way of life. This is why they are believed to be merchants.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the <b>Danubian</b> Lengyel <b>culture</b> absorbs its {{northern}} neighbours of the Czech Republic and Poland for some centuries, only to recede {{in the second}} half of the period. In Bulgaria and Wallachia (Southern Romania), the culture of Boian-Marica evolves into a monarchy with a clearly royal cemetery near the coast of the Black Sea. This model seems to have been copied later in the Tiszan region with the culture of Bodrogkeresztur. Labour specialization, economic stratification and possibly the risk of invasion may have been the reasons behind this development. The influx of early Troy (Troy I) is clear in both the expansion of metallurgy and social organization.|$|R

50|$|This phase, {{starting}} 7000 {{years ago}} is marked by the consolidation of the Neolithic expansion towards western and northern Europe, {{but also by the}} (eruption)irruption of a new culture that, probably through violence, occupies most of the Balkans, substituting or rather subjugating the first Neolithic settlers. This is the culture of Dimini (Thessalia) and the related ones of Vinca-Turdas (Serbia and Romania) and Karanovo III-Veselinovo (Bulgaria and nearby areas), this last one more hybrid than the other two. Meanwhile, the tiny proto-Linear Pottery culture has given birth to two very dynamic branches: the Western and Eastern Linear Pottery Cultures. The latter is basically an extension of the Balkan Neolithic, but the more original western branch expands quickly, assimilating what today is Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland and even large parts of western Ukraine, historical Moldavia, the lowlands of Romania, and regions of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. This was all achieved in less than one thousand years. With expansion comes diversification and a number of local <b>Danubian</b> <b>cultures</b> start forming {{at the end of the}} 5th millennium. In the Mediterranean, the Cardium Pottery fishermen show no less dynamism and colonize/assimilate all of Italy and the Mediterranean regions of France and Spain. Even in the Atlantic, some groups among the native hunter-gatherers start slowly incorporating the new technologies. Among those, the most noticeable regions seem to be the southwest of Iberia, influenced by the Mediterranean but specially by the Andalusian Neolithic, which soon develops the first Megalithic burials (dolmens) and the area around Denmark (culture of Ertebölle), influenced by the Danubian complex.|$|R

40|$|MA thesis Danube: Journey, Memory, City and Death is, to {{a certain}} extent, a {{personal}} search for today's meaning of the river Danube in literature and culture. Practically, it contains texts from the antiquity until today, not chronologically, but in motivic spirals of journey, memory, city and death. It is geographically linked especially to German-Austrian, Slovak and Hungarian space. The chapters are buoy-like, because together they form the characteristics of <b>Danubian</b> <b>culture,</b> which are border, appropriation, palimpsest quality, and pleasure seeking. The chapter about journey deals predominantly with searching for Danube's identity and the character of traveler. The chapter about memory analyses chosen places of memory and certain historical figures. The third chapter, dedicated to Danubian metropoli (Vienna, Bratislava and Budapest), searches for common traits of their soul, which are realized through the concepts of border, pleasure and bridge. The last chapter about death in Danube deals with both images of death and river beings - fairies and nymphs. The whole text represents certain literary-cultural anthropology of Danube...|$|E
50|$|With {{the early}} 18th century {{emergence}} of Phanariote rule over the <b>Danubian</b> Principalities, Greek <b>culture</b> became a norm. On one hand, this meant a noted neglect for the institutions inside the countries; on the other, the channeling of Princes' energies into emancipation from Ottoman rule, through projects that aimed for the erasing of inner {{borders of the}} Empire, moving toward {{the creation of an}} all-Balkan, neo-Byzantine state (seen as the extended identity of Greekdom). To these was added the omnipresence and omnipotence of Greek ethnic clerics {{at all levels of the}} religious hierarchy, with many monasteries becoming directly submitted to similar institutions in Greece, after being gradually granted by successive Princes.|$|R
50|$|From c. 3500 to 3000 BC, copper started {{being used}} in the Balkans, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe. However, perhaps more {{influential}} on the period than copper itself was the domestication of horses and the resulting increased mobility of cultures. From c. 3500 onwards, Eastern Europe was apparently infiltrated by people originating from beyond the Volga (Yamna culture), creating a plural complex known as Sredny Stog culture, which substituted the previous Dnieper-Donets culture, pushing the natives to migrate in a NW direction to the Baltic and Denmark, where they mixed with natives (TRBK A and C). This may be correlated with the linguistic fact of the spread of Indo-European languages; see Kurgan hypothesis. Near the end of the period, another branch would leave many traces in the lower Danube area (culture of Cernavodă culture I), in what seems to be another invasion.Meanwhile, the <b>Danubian</b> Lengyel <b>culture</b> absorbed its northern neighbours of the Czech Republic and Poland over a number of centuries, only to recede {{in the second half of}} the period.

50|$|Apparently {{related with}} the Anatolian culture of Hacilar, the Greek region of Thessalia {{is the first}} place in Europe known to have {{acquired}} agriculture, cattle-herding and pottery. These early stages are known as pre-Sesklo culture. The Thessalian Neolithic culture soon evolves in the more coherent culture of Sesklo (c. 8000 BP), which is {{the origin of the}} main branches of Neolithic expansion in Europe. Practically all the Balkan Peninsula is colonized in the 6th millennium from there. That expansion, reaching the easternmost Tardenoisian outposts of the upper Tisza gives birth to the proto-Linear Pottery culture, a significant modification of the Balkan Neolithic that will be in the origin {{of one of the most}} important branches of European Neolithic: the <b>Danubian</b> group of <b>cultures.</b> In parallel, the coasts of the Adriatic and southern Italy witness the expansion of another Neolithic current of less clear origins. Settling initially in Dalmatia, the bearers of the Cardium Pottery culture may have come from Thessalia (some of the pre-Sesklo settlements show related traits) or even from Lebanon (Byblos). They are sailors, fishermen and sheep and goat herders, and the archaeological findings show that they mixed with natives in most places. Other early Neolithic cultures can be found in Ukraine and Southern Russia, where the epi-Gravettian locals assimilated cultural influxes from beyond the Caucasus (culture of Dniepr-Don and related) and in Andalusia (Spain), where the rare Neolithic of La Almagra Pottery appears without known origins very early (c. 7800 BP).|$|R
