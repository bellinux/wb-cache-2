5|$|After {{qualifying}} {{fifth in}} Bahrain, Webber {{had been as}} high as third place in the race but he ultimately finished sixth, taking his points tally to 7 for the season. He followed this up by qualifying fourth and finishing a disappointing 10th after twice running wide off the track in the , although his position was revised to 7th after the disqualification of the BAR team and a resulting penalty to Ralf Schumacher. The race was a poor one for Williams (Heidfeld was 9th before the reclassification), but Webber <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> at the , qualifying 2nd and finishing 6th– his fourth points scoring finish {{in the first five}} races.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton set {{the pace}} in Q2, seven-tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg. Kimi Räikkönen {{was in danger of}} being {{eliminated}} {{for the majority of the}} session, as he spun while preparing for his first timed lap and then ran wide over the track limits on his second attempt, but managed to proceed into Q3 with his third fast lap. He initially demoted Fernando Alonso outside the top ten with his time, but the McLaren driver <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> with a time sufficient to move on. This left Magnussen, Daniil Kvyat, Gutiérrez, Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa, and Sergio Pérez on the sidelines for Q3.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> in {{the second}} session on Friday night, with Nico Rosberg leading his {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton by about {{a tenth of a}} second. The Ferraris were about half a second behind, with Räikkönen again the faster of the two. It was another dismal session for Jenson Button who had to park his car halfway through the session, though he was able to come back for a couple of laps {{towards the end of the}} session. A late red flag came out when Vettel, braking slowly into turn one, was clipped by the Force India of Sergio Pérez, taking off part of his front wing endplate.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff {{suffered}} an early setback when their captain, Paul Tito, was injured after nine minutes {{and had to}} be replaced. Ben Blair gave Cardiff the lead with a penalty kick before the 15-minute mark, but Leicester were then awarded three penalties in quick succession due to infringements by Cardiff. For each, Julien Dupuy elected to attempt a kick at goal, but was unsuccessful with all three attempts. Leicester's first score {{came in the form of}} a try from Scott Hamilton after 21 minutes, following a line break by Toby Flood, who then drew two defenders towards him before passing the ball to Hamilton. The try was converted by Dupuy, and a successful Dupuy penalty kick on 24 minutes made the score 10–3 to Leicester. Cardiff <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> with three successful penalty kicks of their own, one from Blair and two from Leigh Halfpenny, before Dupuy successfully kicked another penalty just before half-time to give Leicester a 13–12 lead at the break.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 {{season was}} a more {{successful}} season, with the Crusaders making a Grand Final appearance. The Crusaders made the playoffs {{with a record of}} 11 wins and 5 losses. For the second time the Crusaders won the New Zealand Conference, as a result, they earned a first round bye. The Crusaders then defeated the Sharks 38-6 in the semi-final. In the Grand Final against the Waratahs played in Sydney, the Crusaders fell short by 32-33. The Waratahs started strong with a 14-0 early lead before the Crusaders <b>hit</b> <b>back,</b> entering halftime down 13-20. In the 76th minute Colin Slade got his sixth penalty to put the Crusaders up 32-30, looking to steal the game at the end. However, Craig Joubert awarded a controversial penalty in the 78th minute to the Waratahs. Bernard Foley calmly made the championship winning kick, ensuring a 33-32 Waratahs victory. The following day Joubert contacted both Crusaders Coach Todd Blackadder and Crusaders Captain Richie McCaw to apologise, announcing to both that he got the final call wrong.|$|E

25|$|Vari-Target: These targets reward a {{different}} {{number of points}} depending on how hard the target was hit. It is a metal arm that pivots under the playfield.

A large sum of points is usually rewarded when the target is <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> all the way with one strike of the ball.|$|E
25|$|Next {{came the}} first home game, a Premier League game against Chelsea. Liverpool took a lead through Fernando Torres's first {{goal for the}} club, but Chelsea <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> with a disputed penalty, ending the game 1–1. Referee Rob Styles {{appeared}} to book Michael Essien twice without sending him off, similar to Graham Poll at the 2006 World Cup. Styles later admitted to have made an incorrect decision to award the penalty and, unusually, apologised to Liverpool for his mistake; he was subsequently dropped for the next gameweek.|$|E

25|$|At the tribunal, Caspar's {{case was}} heard first. Caspar was {{suspended}} for four weeks. Coleman's defence was simple: he had simply retaliated to two unprovoked punches from Caspar (for which Caspar had been suspended). The VFL at that time made no allowance for provocation, the Players' Advocate Dan Minogue was thought {{to have made a}} good case for Coleman by arguing that any man, if he were a man at all, would <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> after being hit. Both the boundary umpire, Herb Kent, and goal umpire Allen gave evidence that Coleman had retaliated only after he had been punched twice by Caspar.|$|E
25|$|James Beresford {{drove in}} the go-ahead {{run in the}} top of the ninth inning in the form of Paul Weichard after he and Andrew Russell <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> to back infield singles. Hayden Beard was brought in by South Australia to try to stop the flow of runs, but gave up a two run-double to Matthew Lawman to take Victoria to a 7–4 lead. Russell Spear entered the game for Victoria as closer for the second night in a row, and despite giving up two hits was able to keep South Australia {{scoreless}} to earn a second save.|$|E
25|$|Boston got to Darling early, {{recording}} three {{second inning}} runs. Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> to back home runs {{to lead the}} inning off and with two out, Wade Boggs drove in Dave Henderson with a single for a 3–0 Red Sox lead. Darling did not pitch {{as well as he}} had earlier in the series and was pulled in the fourth inning with two outs and a runner in scoring position. Sid Fernandez came in and after walking Boggs, he was able to retire Marty Barrett on a fly ball to right field. Fernandez then retired the side in order in the fifth and sixth.|$|E

25|$|The Wanderers began Season 2017/18 {{with the}} FFA Cup. They started by {{defeating}} Wellington Phoenix 1-0 with new marquee signing Oriol Riera scoring in the 120th {{minute of the}} game. A routine 4-0 defeat of Bentleigh Greens followed in the Round of 16. The quarter final match against Blacktown City FC was an epic encounter. The Wanderers went out to an early 1-0 lead through a Oriol Riera penalty kick. Blacktown <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> {{in the second half}} and took the game to extra time, where substitute James Andrew scored to put Blacktown ahead. Riera popped up again in the 111th minute to equalise, and the Wanderers held their nerve in the shootout to win it 4-2.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the war was}} not over. Hygelac, the {{new king}} of the Geats, {{attacked}} the Swedes. The Geatish warriors Eofor and Wulf fought together against the hoary king Ongenþeow. Wulf hit Ongentheow's head with his sword so that the old king bled over his hair, but the king <b>hit</b> <b>back</b> and wounded Wulf. Then, Eofor retaliated by cutting through the Swedish king's shield and through his helmet, giving Ongentheow a death-blow. Eofor took the Swedish king's helmet, sword and breastplate and carried them to Hygelac. When they came home, Eofor and Wulf were richly awarded, and Eofor was given Hygelac's daughter. Because of this battle, Hygelac {{is referred to as}} Ongentheow's slayer.|$|E
25|$|With {{a target}} to chase, Australia started their final innings aggressively, taking 13 {{off the first}} two overs. England <b>hit</b> <b>back,</b> as Justin Langer {{was caught in the}} gully off Matthew Hoggard in the third over. Matthew Hayden was caught by Paul Collingwood after top-edging Andrew Flintoff. Michael Hussey was {{promoted}} up the batting order to join Ricky Ponting, putting Australia's two in-form batsmen at the crease. The pair steadied the innings whilst continuing to score runs above the required rate. Again, progress stuttered in the 22nd and 23rd overs, as Ponting was caught off Ashley Giles at short extra cover for 49, and Damien Martyn was caught off Andrew Flintoff at point for five. However, Hussey and Michael Clarke were able to continue Australia's progress.|$|E
