25|$|The main storyline in {{the early}} seasons is the {{relationship}} between two half-brothers, Lucas and Nathan Scott, who start out as enemies but bond as the show progresses.

500|$|In its {{portrayal}} of the possible murder of Thomas Doohen, [...] "Ghost of a Chance" [...] is the first Homicide episode to demonstrate a murder in a wealthy rural setting, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location; the episode was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. This is particularly illustrated by Munch's comment to Bolander, [...] "Ah, green lawns, fresh air, nice houses, {{this is the place}} for a murder." [...] The episode also maintains a common Homicide trait of combining tragedy, like the devastated response by Adena Watson's family to her murder, with scenes of dark comedy, like Jessie Doohen's claim that she endured a miserable 60-year marriage because, [...] "We made a promise we wouldn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>divorce</b> until all the children were dead." ...|$|E
