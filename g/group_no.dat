5|$|For {{transporting}} paratroops, {{to avoid}} relying solely on American aircraft and pilots, No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force was expanded, becoming No. 38 Group with its Halifax squadrons, now supported by four squadrons of Albemarles and four squadrons of Stirlings. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery guns by air, {{the air force}} started experiments on parachuting them into combat, carrying the jeeps and guns in the aircraft's large bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport <b>group,</b> <b>No.</b> 46 Group, was formed, and was equipped solely with Dakotas, instead {{of the mixture of}} aircraft in No. 38 Group.

5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted recommendations in the aftermath of Operation Ladbroke. Aircrew were to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders were to be landed before the main force, to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified with complete brigades landing on a drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used on Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following a friendly fire incident over an Allied convoy, more training was given to ship's crews in aircraft recognition; Allied aircraft were also painted with three large white stripes. Training for pilots of the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery by air, the Royal Air Force started experimenting with how to use parachutes to drop them into combat, the jeeps and guns being carried in aircraft's bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport <b>group,</b> <b>No.</b> 46, was formed and equipped solely with Douglas Dakotas, instead of the mixture of aircraft in No. 38 Group. Together, the Royal Air Force groups were capable of supplying eighty-eight Albermarles, eighty-eight Stirlings, thirty-six Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas, a total of 362 planes which did not include aircraft held as reserves.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 2003, Benfica {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Brazilian midfielder Geovanni, on a loan deal from Barcelona {{until the end of}} the season. On 11 January, the team played Vitória Guimarães away. The 1–1 draw after 90 minutes was a consequence of the constant interruptions for a large number of fouls signalled by the referee. In the stands, the problematic behaviour of the Benfica supporters <b>group</b> <b>No</b> Name Boys caused the governing body of the Portuguese league to punish both clubs by closing their stadiums for one game each. On the following Sunday, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros for a game against Marítimo, which Benfica won 2–1 after an individual effort from Nuno Gomes in the 74th minute. It was the first win there since 1994–95. After selecting the Estádio Municipal Dr. Alves Vieira in Torres Novas to replace Estádio da Luz, Benfica hosted Beira-Mar on 26 January, winning 1–0 with a goal from Geovanni. Three days later, the team played the second friendly of the month after a 1–1 draw against Ajax a week before. During the game, intended to bring people to Da Luz, Benfica lost 0–1 to Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme <b>group</b> <b>no</b> longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E

25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white <b>group</b> <b>no.</b> 1 Petra Kvitová and red <b>group</b> <b>no.</b> 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a break point to go up 7–5, 2–0. Just like she did before, though, Kvitová came alive when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the biggest difference came in creating break point opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).|$|E

In July the squadron moved to Middleburg and attacked Japanese positions alongside the Beaufort-equipped No. 15 Squadron. Three No. 120 (NEI) Squadron fighters were shot down during an attack on 30 July, and a further two aircraft were lost in early August.

25|$|Bodies {{requiring}} higher firing temperatures, such as stoneware {{were introduced}} in the late 1950s {{even though it had}} existed elsewhere for centuries. These wares are considered to be much finer than what can be achieved at lower temperatures. A pioneer in the making of stoneware in Mexico is Jorge Wilmot, who began with Ken Edwards in the 1950s and 1960s. Later, a group in Mexico City began to experiment with stoneware, calling themselves Cono 10. While the <b>group</b> <b>no</b> longer exists, their work, both as a group and later as individuals has had a significant effect in the development of stoneware in Mexico. Ceramics fired at higher temperatures came to the interest of the government, especially FONART, in the 1970s. This agency installed suitable facilities {{in various parts of the}} country and trained potters in the techniques. Many of these later started their own workshops. Stoneware is still relatively rare and unlike other forms of pottery, it is usually made by professionals with education rather than people in rural areas. Some of the best known stoneware workshops include those of Hugo Velazquez in Cuernavaca, Taller Tecpatl in Guanajuato, Alberto Diaz de Cossio, Graziella Diaz de Leon and Francisco Javier Servin M., all of Mexico City.|$|E
