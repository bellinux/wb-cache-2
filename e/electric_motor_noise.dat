40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} encountered in the fault diagnosis in damped rotor-bearing systems used in centrifugal milk separators. It is shown that direct bearing vibration measurements are more reliable than indirect (through rotor housing) vibration measurements. However, in most cases {{it is not possible}} to measure bearing vibrations directly. The factors causing large diagnostic measurement errors, such as the influence of the vibration damping system, step-up gear and <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> <b>noise</b> are discussed in the paper. It is established that vibration measurements of the damping system are noninformative and cannot be used to diagnose faults in bearings.

40|$|Variable Speed Drive (VSD) motors allow {{building}} {{exhaust systems}} to operate more efficiently. It also, in principle, {{should lead to}} less noise due to a general reduction in fan speeds. Therefore, the National Research Council replaced old rooftop fans at one of its facilities, with fans selected for low-noise characteristics and equipped with VSD <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b> <b>Noise</b> measurements were made {{on the roof of}} the building, at a distance of 5 m, with all three fans operating simultaneously and under identical controller conditions. The fitting of the acoustic absorptive lining was early in the investigation and not well documented. Anecdotal evidence comparing noise from the fans with lined enclosures to those with unlined enclosures, suggests that the differences were small and insignificant. A characteristic of this type of VSD controller is that noise is generated when high frequency components in the electrical power to the motor cause electromagnetic resonances in the stator of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{emitted by}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} suction unit {{consists}} of airborne and structure-borne noise.

Among geometrical parameters, the statorof the blower and the <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> or metal shield if any, have the greatest effect on the structure-borne noise. Therefore, {{in this part of}} the paper, the effects of vibrations of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> structure on the noise characteristics have been measured and analysed at the design and off-design operation.

40|$|Nowadays {{the work}} is in {{progress}} to develop wheeled and caterpillar tractors with electromechanical transmission. Range of changes in transmission gear ratio while using propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> depends on mechanical characteristics of a tractor propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> which is equipped with electromechanical transmission. In case when the range is rather high then {{it is possible to}} minimize number of gearings in the tractor gearing box or exclude its usage at all. Type of the applied propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and regulation method specify type of mechanical characteristics (characteristics family) of the propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The paper considers a propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with frequency control. While using frequency control it is possible to regulate <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> revolutions by mutual changes in voltage and voltage frequency. There are various laws of mutual changes in voltage and frequency (regulation laws). Selection of a regulation law influences on type of mechanical characteristics of a propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> Application of any law can be admissible only for some specific range of voltage frequency otherwise it is possible to exceed some parameters (for example, admissible voltage in the winding of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> stator). It is necessary to ensure the required moment within wide range for a tractor propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> In this case losses in the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> must be minimal. Losses in the rotor of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> are directly proportional to its sliding and its best propulsion and mechanical properties of a mobile machine will be ensured in the case when sliding is preserved at a constant value. According to these reasons selection of regulation laws has been carried out for operation of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with nominal sliding and mechanical characteristics at nominal sliding is conventionally called a nominal characteristics. The paper analyzes the possible laws of mutual application of voltage and voltage frequency and their application boundaries. A combination of laws for regulation of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> has been selected in the paper. The combination ensures the widest operational range of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with high moment value at nominal sliding and due account of limitations on application of every used regulation law. The following mechanical characteristics family has been constructed for the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> regulated in accordance with the proposed law: at nominal sliding, at critical sliding, at changeable sliding and without changes in voltage and frequency. </p...|$|R
