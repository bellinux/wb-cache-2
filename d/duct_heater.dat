40|$|The University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC), in {{partnership}} with United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) under a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) contract, has designed, constructed, and operated a 3. 0 -million Btu/hr (3. 2 x 10 {sup 6 } kJ/hr) slagging furnace system (SFS). Successful operation has demonstrated that the SFS meets design objectives and is well suited for testing very high-temperature heat exchanger concepts. Test results have shown that a high-temperature radiant air heater (RAH) panel designed and constructed by UTRC and used in the SFS can produce a 2000 F (1094 C) process air stream. To support the pilot-scale work, the EERC has also constructed laboratory- and bench-scale equipment which {{was used to determine}} the corrosion resistance of refractory and structural materials and develop methods to improve corrosion resistance. DOE projects that from 1995 to 2015, worldwide use of electricity will double to approach 20 trillion kilowatt hours. This growth comes during a time of concern over global warming, thought by many policy makers to be caused primarily by increases from coal-fired boilers in carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) emissions through the use of fossil fuels. Assuming limits on CO{sub 2 } emissions from coal-fired boilers are imposed in the future, the most economical CO{sub 2 } mitigation option may be efficiency improvements. Unless efficiency improvements are made in coal-fired power plants, utilities may be forced to turn to more expensive fuels or buy CO{sub 2 } credits. One way to improve the efficiency of a coal-fired power plant is to use a combined cycle involving a typical steam cycle along with an indirectly fired turbine cycle using very high-temperature but low-pressure air as the working fluid. At the heart of an indirectly fired turbine combined-cycle power system are very high-temperature heat exchangers that can produce clean air at up to 2600 F (1427 C) and 250 psi (17 bar) to turn an aeroderivative turbine. The overall system design can be very similar to that of a typical pulverized coal-fired boiler system, except that ceramics and alloys are used to carry the very high-temperature air rather than steam. This design makes the combined-cycle system especially suitable as a boiler-repowering technology. With the use of a gas-fired <b>duct</b> <b>heater,</b> efficiencies of 55 % can be achieved, leading to reductions in CO{sub 2 } emissions of 40 % as compared to today's coal-fired systems. On the basis of work completed to date, the high-temperature advanced furnace (HITAF) concept appears to offer a higher-efficiency technology option for coal-fired power generation systems than conventional pulverized coal firing. Concept analyses have demonstrated the ability to achieve program objectives for emissions (10 % of New Source Performance Standards, i. e., 0. 003 lb/MMBtu of particulate), efficiency (47 %- 55 %), and cost of electricity (10 %- 25 % below today's cost). Higher-efficiency technology options for new plants as well as repowering are important to the power generation industry in order to conserve valuable fossil fuel resources, reduce the quantity of pollutants (air and water) and solid wastes generated per MW, and reduce the cost of power production in a deregulated industry. Possibly more important than their potential application in a new high-temperature power system, the RAH panel and convective air heater tube bank are potential retrofit technology options for existing coal-fired boilers to improve plant efficiencies. Therefore, further development of these process air-based high-temperature heat exchangers and their potential for commercial application is directly applicable to the development of enabling technologies in support of the Vision 21 program objectives. The objective of the work documented in this report was to improve the performance of the UTRC high-temperature heat exchanger, demonstrate the fuel flexibility of the slagging combustor, and test methods for reducing corrosion of brick and castable refractory in such combustion environments. Specific technical issues of interest included measuring the effects of coatings on heat transfer in the RAH, determining the general impact of firing a lower-iron bituminous coal on the operation of the RAH panel and SFS, and the development of ways to treat slag and refractories to decrease corrosion rates...|$|E

However, it was effectively the beginning of a phase-out in favour of the newer Astra, Vauxhall's version of the front wheel drive Kadett D, which was launched in January 1980; although it was not produced in Britain until November 1981. The phasing-out of the Chevette continued in April 1983, when the hatchback model was discontinued due to the launch of the Spanish built Nova.|$|R

The roughness provided {{is in the form of}} protrusions which are arranged in an arc pattern. This paper presents an investigation to study the effect of protruded geometry on heat transfer coefficient and friction factor in an artificially roughened solar air <b>heater</b> <b>duct.</b> The pair of protrusion geometry arc angle (α) of 45 o is mounted on the test section of duct to create a longitudinal flow through test section. Measurements are carried out for rectangular duct which has aspect ratio (W/H) of 11, relative roughness pitch (P/e) in the range of 12 - 24, relative roughness height (e/D) of 0. 03, ratio of height of protrusion to print diameter (d) of 0. 3 ° and Reynolds number (Re) ranges from 3600 - 18100. The results obtained for various relative roughness pitch (P/e) has also been compared with smooth one.

The implementation of variable artificial roughness patterns on a surface {{is an effective}} technique to enhance {{the rate of heat}} transfer to fluid flow in the ducts of solar air heaters. Different geometries of roughness elements investigated have demonstrated the pivotal role that vortices and associated turbulence have on the heat transfer characteristics of solar air <b>heater</b> <b>ducts</b> by increasing the convective heat transfer coefficient. In this paper we investigate the two-dimensional, turbulent, unsteady flow around rectangular ribs of variable aspect ratios by directly solving the transient Navier-Stokes and continuity equations using the finite elements method. Flow characteristics and several aspects of turbulent flow are presented and discussed including velocity components and statistics of turbulence. The results reveal the impact that different rib lengths have on the computedmean quantities and turbulence statistics of the flow. The computed turbulence parameters showa clear tendency to diminish downstreamwith increasing rib length. Furthermore, the applied numerical method is capable of capturing small-scale flow structures resulting from the direct solution of Navier-Stokes and continuity equations. 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to study the heat transfer coefficient and friction factor by using artificial roughness in the form of specially prepared inverted U-shaped turbulators on the absorber surface of an air <b>heater</b> <b>duct.</b> The roughened wall is uniformly heated while the remaining three walls are insulated. These boundary conditions correspond closely to those found in solar air heaters. The experiments encompassed the Reynolds number range from 3800 to 18000; ratio of turbulator height to duct hydraulic mean diameter is varied from, e/D(h) = 0. 0186 to 0. 03986 (D(h) = 37. 63 mm, and e = 0. 7 to 1. 5 mm) and turbulator pitch to height ratio is varied from, p/e = 6. 67 to 57. 14 (p = 10 to 40 mm). The angle of attack of flow on turbulators, alpha = 90 degrees kept constant during the whole experimentation. The heat transfer and friction factor data obtained is compared with the data obtained from smooth duct under similar geometrical and flow conditions. As compared to the smooth duct, the turbulator roughened duct enhances the heat transfer and friction factor by 2. 82 and 3. 72 times, respectively. The correlations have been developed for area averaged Nusselt number and friction factor for turbulator roughened duct. (c) 200...|$|R
40|$|In double pass solar {{air heater}} thermal {{performance}} {{can be obtained}} by augment the rate of heat transfer and minimizes the top losses and bottom losses. Efficiency of solar air heater is low because of low value of heat transfer coefficient between absorber plate and flowing air. This is due to the presence of laminar sub layer that need to be broken to increase heat transfer. Therefore for enhancement of heat transfer turbulence is created by providing inclined continuous ribs on absorber plate. This paper presents an experimental investigation carried out to study the effect Inclined continues rib roughness on heat transfer coefficient and friction factor in an artificially roughened solar air <b>heater</b> <b>duct.</b> The experiment encompassed Reynolds number (Re) from 3000 to 15, 000. Relative roughness height (e/D) values 0. 027, relative roughness pitch (P/e) range of 6 – 12, angle of attack (α) - 600. Extensive experimentation has been conducted to collect data on heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics of a rectangular duct roughened with continues inclined-ribs. Using these experimental data, correlations for Nusselt number and friction factor in terms of roughness geometry and flow parameters have been developed. The roughened wall has roughness with pitch (P), ranging from 9 - 18 mm, height of the rib of 1. 5 mm and duct aspect ratio of 6. 67. The air flow rate corresponds to Reynolds number between 3000 – 15000. The heat transfer results have been compared with those for smooth duct...|$|R
