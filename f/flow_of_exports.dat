40|$|I {{presented}} {{the paper on}} May 21, 2009 to a keen audience in the session on Economic Policy and Governance in Africa. The presentation was well received and, as one participant noted, the topic was very relevant to the current economic debate in Uganda – i. e., whether a fixed or flexible exchange rate will serve that country better. Perhaps the comment that mattered most in terms of future work was that I {{did not address the}} issue of non-normality in the regression residuals. It is claimed that failure to address the may lead to overstatement of the negative effect of exchange rate volatility on trade flows. I am currently developing this presentation into a paper for publication in an academic journal and I am paying special attention to the above comment. In particular, in order to circumvent the problem of non-normality, I have explored several other estimation techniques besides the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) technique. This article examines the relationship between exchange rate volatility and the flow of international trade in Sub-Saharan African countries. Using the gravity model and annual data for the period 1998 - 2007, we find that exchange rate volatility has adverse effect on the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> and imports. However, the estimated results indicate a very low level of responsiveness of international trade to volatility in exchange rate. Thus, eliminating the volatility in the exchange rates will result in only very small increases in the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> or imports. This shows that exchange rate stability is not a sufficient condition for promoting international trade in Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the hypothesis that}} the increase in the intermediate consumption caused by the growth of material costs due to innovation and modernization temporarily reduces the level of economic efficiency. This leads to further multiple increases of final product volume, which, in turn, increases the region’s economic potential and competitiveness, provides its enhanced participation in inter-regional and international exchange processes. The authors consider the main factors and conditions that determine the variation of these parameters in the market economy and discuss the intermediate and final product, export, import and others. The results of the analysis, calculations and statistics reveal and confirm the possibility of their measurement with the use of interindustry balances. The study aims at assessing the quantitative interdependence of intermediate and final products growth based on the analysis of interregional and international exchange in the system coordination to macroeconomic indicators of the socio-economic development of the region during the periods of planned and market economy. Another purpose is to determine the directions of the region’s participation in the division of labour and implementation of innovations in order to increase of gross domestic product. On the example of the development of Bashkortostan economy, the authors have revealed that a greater involvement of the region in the foreign economic processes led to the increase in the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> and imports and the simultaneous reduction of production export to other regions of the Russian Federation and import from them. At the same time, the region has focused mainly on the export of fuel and energy products. The proportions of intermediate and final products in the period under review have changed by increasing the final products. That confirms the improvement of conditions for the growth of the region’s competitiveness. On the example of oil-extracting and oil processing industries, the authors have proved that the modernization and introduction of innovative approaches to the organization of production are an effective tool for multiple increases of the final product volume, despite the increase in intermediate products...|$|E
40|$|A paper {{presented}} to the 40 th Congress of ANZAAS, Christchurch, 1968. Before devaluation in November 1967, New Zealand faced the most marked deflationary pressure on the economy since the 1930 ’s. Since 1964, economic policies had emphasised the need for growth, based on an expanding <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> to finance essential imports. During 1966 and 1967, export prices steadied and then declined sharply, {{especially in the case}} of wool. The deficit in the balance of payments widened sharply, and stern deflationary measures were initiated from January 1967. The agricultural industry, which provides 82 per cent of overseas receipts, was caught in the middle of the new investment programme initiated in 1964. Retrenchment was quickly forced on to the agricultural expansionists. Official policy remained expansionist, however, although there were many pessimists on the manufacturing side who believed N. Z. was not diversifying fast enough. No doubt, everyone hoped that the terms of trade would improve as rapidly as they had declined. But the situation worsened, if anything, in the course of 1967, and a permanent readjustment in our overseas trading position was acknowledged on November 20 th when the $N. Z. was devalued by 19. 45 per cent. For many years, the expansion of agricultural output depended on the self interest of the farming community. Semi popular folk lore on output behaviour was based on the depression expression experience when farmers responded to low prices with a marked expansion of production. Policy itself has been contradictory. On the one hand, internal revenue depreciation allowances and the like have favoured farming and particularly new forms of mechanisation, agricultural research is encouraged and so on; while on the other, national policy toward full employment and stability has effectively drained the countryside of its labour force and has been very wary of measures that would result in larger incomes for farmers. Advanced technology has been forced on agriculture by the social conditions prevailing rather than through direct cost savings. In general, a steady expansion of output had always been forthcoming, and this in turn provided the exports to finance the import demands of the rapidly urbanised society which resulted. Some details of these agricultural changes now follow...|$|E

Thus the results {{support the view that}} corruption adversely affects international trade. Our estimates suggest that if a country with Africa's average corruption perception index of 2. 8 were to improve its corruption level to Botswana's 5. 9, its exports would improve by about 15 per cent and imports by about 27 per cent.

40|$|M. B. A. According to du Plessis et al., (1994 : 67), {{the history}} of {{protectionism}} in trade goes almost {{as far back as}} that of trade itself. There are various arguments for the numerous benefits, which can be gained from free trade such as, efficiency and welfare gains. But, despite these benefits, governments have had counter arguments as to why protectionism is justified. Examples of these traditional arguments for protection are, the infant industry argument, the terms of trade argument, protection to increase employment in an industry, a tariff to offset foreign dumping and a tariff to improve the balance of payments. All of these arguments have important gains for the protected economy but could be considered beggar-thyneighbour policies since they are {{at the expense of the}} unprotected economy. Various trade instruments are used by governments to intervene in its countries trading activities. These trade instruments are categorised into, tariff, non-tariff barriers and export taxes and subsidies. Both tariff and non-tariff barriers are used to interfere on the import side of trade, whereas export subsidies and taxes are used to interfere with the free <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports.</b> Tariff barriers include specific tariffs, ad valorem tariffs, import subsidies, preferential duties, most-favoured nation treatment and offshore assembly provisions. Nontariff barriers include import quotas, "voluntary" export restraints, government procurement provisions, local content provisions, administrative classification and restriction on service trade (du Plessis et al., 1994 : 67 - 70). An example of a protected industry in South Africa is the motor industry. The initial protectionist programmes used by the motor industry were characterised by local content policies. These programmes resulted in a heavily protected motor and component industry. In recent years, policymakers have attempted to reduce the level of protection in the industry through the Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP), in line with the General Trade and Tariff Agreement (GATT). This programme is not only attempting to reduce the use of trade instruments but, also to become globally competitive. This dissertation attempts to evaluate the effects that protectionism, in the form of the Motor Industry Development Programme, has had on the Motor Industry's component suppliers...|$|E
