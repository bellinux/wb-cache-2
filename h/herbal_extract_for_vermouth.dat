However, the issues associated with use of HARRT such as the high cost, severe side-effects, and drug resistance have called for development of alternative anti-HIV therapeutic strategies. In this study, we screened several traditional Chinese medicinal <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> <b>for</b> their anti-HIV activities and determined their anti-HIV mechanisms. Methods: Nine traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) herbal plants and their respective parts derived from Hainan Island, China were extracted using a series of organic solvents, vacuum dried, and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Initial anti-HIV activity and cytotoxicity of these extracts were evaluated in HIV-infected human CD 4 + T lymphocytes Jurkat. Extracts of higher anti-HIV activities and lower cytotoxicity were selected from the initial screening, and further examined for their effects on HIV- 1 entry, post-entry, reverse transcriptase, gene transcription and expression using combined virology, cell biology and biochemistry techniques. Results: Four extracts derived from two different herbal plants completely blocked HIV- 1 replication and showed little cytotoxicity at a concentration of 10 g/ml. None of these four extracts had any inhibitory effects on HIV- 1 long terminal repeat promoter. Two of them exhibited direct inhibitory activity against HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT). All four extracts showed significant blocking of HIV- 1 entry into target cells.

40|$|Impaired and {{aberrant}} {{wound healing}} imposes a huge financial burden {{in the developed}} world and is an insurmountable problem in the undeveloped one. Many new approaches, such as gene therapy and tissue engineered skin have met with limited success. The application of plant-based medicines provides, in principle, a cost effective therapy; a major criticism of herbal medicines, however, is that they are not subjected to the rigours of their pharmaceutical counterparts. This work scientifically investigates the effects of four African herbal medicines used generally in the treatment of wounds; the behaviour of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) is known to be crucial to the onset of wound healing disorders and culture of this cell type was the means by which effects were gauged. The herbs are Cissus rotundifolia leaf extract (C. rotundifolia(L)), Cassia abbreviate bark extract (C. abbreviata(B)) Zanthoxylum chalybeum bark extract (z chalybeum(B)) and Zanthoxylem chalybeum leaf extract (Z chalybeumQS)). Aqueous extractions of herbal medicines were used in all experiments. Single and paired combinations of the herbal medicines were assessed. The effects of combinations were compared to a theoretical additive (obtained by the summation of individual <b>herbal</b> <b>extract</b> effects); thus, combination behaviour was defined in terms of being additive, greater than additive or less than additive The effects of single and combined <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> on cultured NHDF were assessed with respect to the following wound healing parameters: 1. Growth of NHDF in basal media (to unequivocally establish the extent of effects) and basal media / 2 %FBS (to simulate impaired healing). 2. Growth of NHDF in basal media / 10 % FBS + 70 μg / ml of insulin-like growth factor (to simulate fíbrotic healing) 3. NHDF exposed to H 2 O 21 FeSOa oxidant environment (to simulate impaired healing). NHDF were either pre-incubated with <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> <b>for</b> 12 һ (to assess protective effects) or exposed to oxidants and extracts simultaneously (to assess the ability of extracts to neutralise oxidants) 4. NHDF production of pro-collagen type I carboxypeptide (PICP) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) For growth related effects {{and the extent to which}} NHDF were damaged by exposure to oxidants, the MTS assay was used as an indirect determination of viable cell number. The production of biomolecules (PICP and KGF), was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). С. rotmdifolia(L) and c. abbreviate(B) enhanced the growth of NHDF in basal media and basal media / 2 % FBS. Combinations of these <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts,</b> when applied in basal media, produced less than additive effects when the c. rotundifolia(L) proportion exceeded 1 : 1 but greater than additive effects at с rotundifolia(L) proportions of 1 : 1 or less. In the case of c. rotundifolia(L) I c. abbreviata(B) combinations applied in basalmedia / 2 % FBS, the effects were greater than additive at all proportions. Ζ chalybeum(B) had antiproliferative effects on the NHDF fibrotic model. When combined with Z chalybeum{B) in proportions greater than 1 : 1, с rotundifoliaQS) reduced the extent to which z chalybeum(B) was able to inhibit growth; when present in proportions of 1 : 1 or less, c. rotundifolia(L) was not able to influence the effects of Z chalybeum(s). Neither single nor combined <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> had any effect on the production of biomolecules such as PICP and KGF. The apparent changes corresponding to the application of с rotundifoliaÇL), с. abbreviata(B) and z chalybeum(B) were due entirely to their growth-related effects. In terms of antioxidant effects, none of the <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> (single or combined), when incubated with NHDF prior to oxidant addition, were able to protect cells from damage. C. rotundifoliai(L), z. chalybeum(L) and z chalybeum(B), in descending order of potency, demonstrated an ability to neutralise the effects of oxidants when oxidant and <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> were added simultaneously. Combinations of c. rotundifolia(L) and z chalybeum(L) produced effects which were additive at all proportions. Combinations of c. rotundifolia(L) and z chalybeum(L) produced effects which were additive at z chalybeum(L) proportions greater than 1 : 1 but super-additive at X. chalybeum(L) proportions of 1 : 1 or less. Combinations of z chalybeum(B) and z chalybeum(L) were less than additive at all proportions. The work has provided an appropriate platform for the broader study of the four herbal medicines and it is reasonable to conclude that there is a scientific basis for the application of these <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> to the treatment of wounds and wound healing disorders. All of the <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> have influenced at least one of the selected wound healing aspects, whether singly or in combination; in particular, c. rotundifolia(L) and Z chalybeum(L) have demonstrated growth related and antioxidant properties. The further investigation of effective herbs, in terms of other skin cell types (keratinocytes or endothelial cells) or more involved study (organ culture, human trials) would be of merit.

40|$|Abstract Background Peanut allergy is {{characterized}} by increased levels of peanut-specific IgE in the serum of most patients. Thus, the most logical therapy would be to inhibit the IgE production by committed B-cells. This study aims to investigate the unreported anti-IgE effects of Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> of Rubia cordifolia (Qiancao) and Dianthus superbus (Qumai). Methods Seventy <b>herbal</b> <b>extracts</b> were tested <b>for</b> their ability to reduce IgE secretion by a human B-cell line. Those with the lowest inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50) values were tested in a mouse model of peanut-anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic scores, body temperature, plasma histamine and peanut-specific-immunoglobulins were determined. Results Rubia cordifolia and Dianthus superbus inhibited the in vitro IgE production by a human B-cell line in a dose-dependent manner and the in vivo IgE production in a murine model of peanut allergy without affecting peanut-specific-IgG 1 levels. After challenge, all mice in the sham groups developed anaphylactic reactions and increased plasma histamine levels. The extract-treated mice demonstrated significantly reduced peanut-triggered anaphylactic reactions and plasma histamine levels. Conclusion The extracts of Rubia cordifolia and Dianthus superbus inhibited the IgE production in vivo and in vitro as well as reduced anaphylactic reactions in peanut-allergic mice, suggesting potentials for allergy treatments. </p...|$|R
