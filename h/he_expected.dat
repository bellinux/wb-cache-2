5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus. The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him {{what it was like}} to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E
5|$|With the Dodgers crowded outfield situation, Kemp was {{the subject}} of much trade {{speculation}} after the season. His agent, Dave Stewart, publicly stated that <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> Kemp to be traded during the off-season. However, Stewart later remarked that the team had assured him {{that it would not be}} making such a trade.|$|E
5|$|After {{being cut}} {{for the second time}} by the Blue Bombers, Alford moved back to the United States and worked in a glove factory in Memphis. <b>He</b> <b>expected</b> that his {{professional}} football career was over, but he was signed by the Montreal Alouettes in 1999. During training camp, he competed against 11 other receivers for a place on the active roster, with head coach Charlie Taaffe expecting to cut at least five receivers. Alford failed to make the active roster and was released {{before the start of the}} regular season.|$|E

5|$|After {{getting his}} degree, O'Donnell moved to Chicago, where <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> {{that he would}} teach at the American Conservatory of Music. The job fell through, and instead {{he worked as a}} grip in the film and {{television}} business. O'Donnell began his musical career in the field after one of his colleagues who knew of his music background approached him to write for his film. O'Donnell talked to his friend Michael Salvatori, who had his own recording studio, and offered to split the profits from the job with him; the two became constant partners.|$|E
5|$|As spring {{training}} 2015 began, Hollands {{noted that he}} was not taking a spot in the bullpen for granted, and that <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> to compete with several other lefties. During {{spring training}}, he strained the common flexor tendon in his throwing arm. He underwent Tommy John surgery in April, and missed the 2015 season. After completing a rehabilitation assignment, the Phillies optioned Hollands to Lehigh Valley on June 2, 2016. He was released on May 20, 2017.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano {{completed}} his first {{studies at the}} San Carlos school, where he learned Latin, philosophy, logic, physics, metaphysics, and literature; he graduated in 1786. Domingo had sufficient success as merchant to send his two sons Francisco and Manuel to study in Europe. <b>He</b> <b>expected</b> them to study commerce, but Manuel decided to study law. Belgrano was so successful and attained such prestige that Pope Pius VI allowed him to study forbidden literature, even books deemed as heretical, excepting only the astrological and obscene books. In this way he {{came into contact with}} authors like Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Filangieri, who were forbidden in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did {{not plan}} to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> anybody to pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E
5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E

5|$|Groves retired {{at the end}} of February 1948, and Nichols was {{designated}} as his successor with the rank of major general. At the same time, Forrestal, now the Secretary of Defense, reorganized the Military Liaison Committee. A civilian, Donald F. Carpenter, replaced Brereton as chairman, and there were now two members from each of the three services. On 11 March, Truman summoned Lilienthal, Nichols and Secretary of the Army Kenneth C. Royall to his office, and told them that <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> the AFSWP and the AEC to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 {{the family}} moved to Mount Vernon, New York, a popular Jewish area of Westchester County. Nevelson was upset with the move, which removed her from city life and her artistic environment. During the winter of 1932–1933 she {{separated}} from Charles, unwilling to becoming the socialite wife <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> her to be. She never sought financial support from Charles, and in 1941 the couple divorced.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress {{that he wore}} in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. Sarria continued to own a smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; he had said that <b>he</b> <b>expected</b> to eventually donate those materials to the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E
