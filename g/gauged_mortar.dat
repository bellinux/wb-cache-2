The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint. A new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak [...] long by [...] diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with <b>gauged</b> <b>mortar.</b>|$|E

The tests results were used for design of optimised calcining temperature of kaolin, proportion of gauging between lime and metakaolin, and evaluation of influence of addition of Portland cement. Discussion of the results includes suitability of metakaolin <b>gauged</b> lime <b>mortars</b> for repair of historic monuments...|$|R

Arheološkim istraživanjem obuhvaćena je površina sjeverozapadnog dijela lokaliteta, izvan gabarita arhitektonskog sklopa, kako bi se definirao spoj temeljnih stopa sjevernoga i zapadnog zida burga. Pronađeni su ostaci drvene konstrukcije. Radi li se o ostacima skele koja je služila zidarima iz 13. stoljeća pri gradnji romaničkoga burga, razjasnit će tek nastavak arheoloških istraživanja. Nastavljeni su i zaštitni konzervatorski i konsolidacijski radovi na istraženoj arhitekturi. In 2006, the {{systematic}} archaeological conservation {{research of the}} castle of Vrbovec was continued. The archaeological research encompassed {{the area of the}} northwestern part of the site, beyond the measures of the architectural frame, in order to define the connection between the foundation footings of the north and west walls of the castle. Remains of a wooden construction were discovered. Whether we are dealing with the remains of a scaffolding used by the 13 th century masons for the construction of the Romanic castle, shall only be clarified by the sequel of the archaeological research. In the upper layers, numerous discarded fragments of ceramic pottery, mostly kitchen pots, were found. On the other hand, the dates of some single finds of table pottery point to a wider time span, in which life or a form of life existed in the town, i. e. until {{the very end of the}} 15 th and even the beginning of the 16 th century. This is not in accordance with the historical sources, in which the castle of Vrbovec is mentioned as deserted already in 1463 and subsequently in 1497. The rescue conservation and consolidation works were also continued on the investigated architecture. Before the works were started, the walls were cleansed and rinsed with Miniwash. In the course of the works, the plaster was tended by pouring water over it. The binding − <b>gauged</b> lime <b>mortar</b> − consisted of aggregate (< 4 mm) from the nearby local quarry, lime and cement in the ratio of (1 : 3 : 6 - cement:lime:aggregate). Stones from the very locality have been used. The finish coat was made out of the hydraulic lime Calx Romano in the ratio of 1 : 2 (Calx Romano:aggregate). The faces of the walls, i. e. their original medieval parts, were coated by a mixture firmer than Calx Romano (1 : 1), a process necessary because of their bad preservation...|$|R
