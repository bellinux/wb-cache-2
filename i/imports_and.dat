5|$|After pacifying central Vietnam, Duyệt was reappointed {{to be the}} viceroy of {{southern}} Vietnam and Cambodia in 1820 by Emperor Minh Mạng, Gia Long's successor. The emperor further enhanced Duyệt's powers by allowing him the power to oversee all foreign trade coming into his area, and collect taxes in Cambodia and on <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> exports at his discretion. This gave Duyệt control over the vast economic resources in the fertile agricultural and lumber-rich region and most importantly, land development. The southern area had only been populated by ethnic Vietnamese in recent centuries and immigration, clearing and development of land was rapid.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{efficiency}} {{is the measure}} of the ability of a cow to become pregnant and produce viable offsprings. The comparative reproductive efficiency of 50 each <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born Friesian cows at Bhunikey (Pattoki), Harichand (Charsada) and Quetta (Baluchistan) was studied. It was concluded that age at first calving differed significantly at different locations (P< 0. 05) for <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows. The services per conception at Bhunikey and Quetta did not differ significantly for <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born but these differed significantly from <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born of Harichand. The service period of <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows at Bhunikey was significantly longer (P< 0. 05) than cows at Harichand and Quetta did not vary significantly in <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born except Harichand. There {{was no significant difference in}} milk yield of <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows at Quetta. However, at Bhunikey <b>and</b> Harichand, <b>imported</b> cows produced significantly (P< 0. 05) more milk than their progeny and all these classes produced significantly more milk than <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born at Quetta. Calving interval of <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows at Bhunikey was significantly longer (P< 0. 05) than the Harichand and Quetta but did not differ significantly for <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born cows. Mean dry period for <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born at Bhunikey is significantly (P< 0. 05) longer than that of Harichand and Quetta, but there was no significant difference between the <b>imported</b> <b>and</b> local born at different locations...|$|R

5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> exports, but the handling charges and dues {{charged by the}} Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E
5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner became {{president}} in May 2003. In the mid-2000s, export of unprocessed soybeans and of soybean oil and meal generated more than 20% of Argentina's export revenue, triple the joint {{share of the}} traditional exports, beef and wheat. Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds of which came from soy exports. Taxes on <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation over 20%.|$|E

5|$|By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian {{trade with}} Byblos yielded a {{critical}} source of quality timber {{not found in}} Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with Punt provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons. Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli, {{which had to be}} imported from far-away Afghanistan. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of olive oil. In exchange for its luxury <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.|$|E

40|$|Protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> export {{into and}} out of the cell nucleus {{requires}} a signal in the protein to be transported. Furthermore, several factors are involved in recognition of the signal, delivery of the protein to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and its subsequent translocation across the NPC. We have biochemically analyzed the mechanism of nuclear protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> export using all recombinant factors from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using solution binding assays, GTP hydrolysis and exchange assays, as well as surface plasmon resonance we have identified various interactions between different components of the transport machinery. We propose a model for the mechanism for nuclear protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> export. Both nuclear protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> export share certain features, i. e. docking of the transport cargo at the NPC via a karyopherin, release of the cargol karyopherin complex, and subsequent recycling of the transport factors for another round of function. However, although the proteins of the general transport machinery involved are the same for nuclear protein <b>import</b> <b>and</b> export, some transport factors play different roles in <b>import</b> <b>and</b> in export...|$|R

5|$|By {{this time}} Port Darlington had become {{overwhelmed}} by the volume of <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> exports and work started in 1839 on Middlesbrough Dock, which had been laid out by William Cubitt, capable of holding 150 ships, and built by resident civil engineer George Turnbull. The suspension bridge across the Tees {{was replaced by a}} cast iron bridge on masonry piers in 1841. After three years and an expenditure of £122,000 (equivalent to £9.65m at 2011 prices), the formal opening of the new dock took place on 12 May 1842. The S provided most of the finance, and the dock was absorbed by the company in 1849.|$|E

5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> exports across Europe and worldwide.

A stone inscription in Anuradhapura {{implies that the}} market or bazaar was an important functionality in the city. Trade was limited in villages since they were mostly self-sufficient, but essential commodities such as salt and metal had to be obtained from outside.
