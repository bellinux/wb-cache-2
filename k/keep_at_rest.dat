It seems quite hardy, but obviously thrives best in fairly soft and slightly alkaline water at not too high a temperature—conditions that can often be met with treated tap water.

In a small tank, a group of six individuals—half males, half females—will do well and exhibit natural behavior.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to show that motor simulation participates in the conceptual representation of manipulable objects in long-term memory. In two experiments, lists of manipulable and nonmanipulable objects were presented. Participants were instructed to memorize the items while adopting different postures. In the control condition, they had to <b>keep</b> their hands <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> in front of them. In the interference condition, participants had to keep their hands crossed behind their back to make their hands less free for action. After each list, participants had to perform first a distractive task, and then an oral free recall. The results showed that the interfering posture produced a specific decrease in the recall of manipulable objects, but not of nonmanipulable ones. This decrease was similar when the items were presented as pictures (Experiment 1) or as words (Experiment 2), thus excluding a purely visual effect. These results provide strong evidence that the motor simulation plays a role in the memory trace of the object...|$|R

If this were wholly separated from all our outward sensations, and inward thoughts, we should have no reason to prefer one thought or action to another; negligence to attention, or motion to rest. And so we should neither stir our bodies, nor employ our minds, but let our thoughts (if I may so call it) run adrift, without any direction or design, and suffer the ideas of our minds, like unregarded shadows, to make their appearances there, as it happened, without attending to them. In which state man, however furnished with the faculties of understanding and will, would be a very idle, inactive creature, and pass his time only in a lazy, lethargic dream.

40|$|New {{versions}} of Windows come equipped with mechanisms, such as EFS and BitLocker, which {{are capable of}} encrypting data to an industrial standard on a Personal Computer. This creates problems if the computer in question contains electronic evidence. BitLocker, for instance, provides a secure way for an individual to hide the contents of their entire disk, but as with most technologies, there {{are bound to be}} weaknesses and threats to the security of the encrypted data. It is conceivable that this technology, while appearing robust and secure, may contain flaws, which would jeopardize the integrity of the whole system. As more people encrypt their hard drives, it will become harder and harder for forensic investigators to recover data from Personal Computers. By analyzing Windows encryption, the author intends to produce automated tools to aid investigators in gaining access to this data, as well as contribute to the progression of Windows encryption standards. Over the course of this document, the author outlines both encryption systems and points out potential vulnerabilities in them. While presenting his findings, the author also provides tips and suggestions on how to use EFS and BitLocker in order to optimize their efficiency and make the best use of their strengths. This project also delivers software solutions designed to help compromise the integrity of these systems. The ultimate finding of this project is that in order to <b>keep</b> data <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> optimally secure, both EFS and BitLocker should be used in tandem, or they should be used in conjunction with other encryption solutions. Neither of these solutions is completely impenetrable on it's own, but when combined with other forms of encryption, they provide a layer of defense that's sufficiently hard to crack...|$|R

60|$|What {{sort of a}} man was Wakefield? We {{are free}} to shape out our own idea and call it by his name.

He was intellectual, but not actively so; his mind occupied itself in long and lazy musings that tended to no purpose or had not vigor to attain it; his thoughts were seldom so energetic as to seize hold of words. Imagination, in the proper meaning of the term, made no part of Wakefield's gifts. With a cold but not depraved nor wandering heart, and a mind never feverish with riotous thoughts nor perplexed with originality, who could have anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to a foremost place among the doers of eccentric deeds? Had his acquaintances been asked who was the man in London the surest to perform nothing to-day which should be remembered on the morrow, they would have thought of Wakefield. Only the wife of his bosom might have hesitated. She, without having analyzed his character, was partly aware of a quiet selfishness that had rusted into his inactive mind; of a peculiar sort of vanity, the most uneasy attribute about him; of a disposition to craft which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping of petty secrets hardly worth revealing; and, lastly, of what she called a little strangeness sometimes in the good man.

The second research question is whether subjective outcome (VAS/WOMAC) after hip (THA) or knee arthroplasty (TKA) differs in patients with or without nocturnal pain and pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> preoperatively compared to those who do not. METHODS: A consecutive group of 189 TKAs and 189 THAs was evaluated. The influence of pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and nocturnal pain preoperatively on the outcome was evaluated by means of a one-way ANOVA. Outcome measurements used were WOMAC, VAS pain and VAS Satisfaction. RESULTS: The results show that satisfaction at follow up was not influenced by the presence of nocturnal pain or pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> preoperatively. The presence of nocturnal pain and pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> preoperatively did result in a poorer WOMAC pain score WOMAC physical impairment score and a higher VAS pain <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and activity after surgery for both THA and TKA.

30|$|Given that PTB {{is part of}} the {{regulatory}} loop to induce neuronal differentiation, such loop could be, at least in theory, induced by modulating any component in the loop, e.g., inactivating REST or overexpressing miR- 124, to achieve the same end purpose. As a matter of fact, inactivating REST or its key component SCP 1 has been shown to induce neuronal-specific gene expression program (Yeo et al. 2005). However, genetic ablation of REST has demonstrated that the complete loss of REST causes the depletion of neuronal progenitors and impairs viability of differentiated neurons (Gao et al. 2011). Therefore, REST has to be maintained at an adequate lower level in differentiated neurons. As a result, the efficiency of siRNA against REST has to be titrated in trans-differentiation, as too low would be insufficient to achieve neuronal conversation, whereas too high would be detrimental to the viability of converted neurons. It is currently unclear how to experimentally reduce REST to an optimal level to induce neurogenesis. Thus, the strategy to down-regulate REST yet <b>keep</b> down-regulated <b>REST</b> <b>at</b> the required low level is best achieved through the activation of the internal regulatory mechanism to maintain its hemostatic expression in differentiated neurons, such as the strategy of PTB knockdown.|$|R
