Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser {{releasing}} his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I'm thinking.|$|E
6000|$|Five {{more days}} passed, all too quickly, {{and once more}} Monday came round. It was the 22nd of October, and the Michaelmas Sittings began on the 24th. On the morrow, Tuesday, Geoffrey was to return to London, there to meet Lady Honoria {{and get to work}} at Chambers.

He's the blackest sheep of the lot--and the head of them! He's a thoroughbred Tory, and as fit to be a judge as I am to be a general. That queer little fellow, with the long chin, he's Burton--he's a hundred if he's a day--he was fifty when he was called, seventy when they benched him, and I'm sure he's a judge thirty years! But he's the sharpest chap of the whole twelve, and no end of a boy afther the girls. If you only saw him walking in his robes--I'm sure he's not three feet high! That next, with the skinny neck, he's Crampton--he's one of Father Mathews lads, an out and out teetotaller, and he looks it; he's a desperate cross fellow, sometimes! The other one, you can't see, he's Perrin. There, he's leaning over--you can just catch the side of his face--he's Perrin. It's he'll acquit the traversers av' anything does--he's a fair fellow, is Perrin, and not a red-hot thorough-going Tory like the rest of 'em." ...|$|E
