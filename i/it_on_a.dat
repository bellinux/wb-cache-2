5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved from the war, its walls and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present gates to the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates displayed the College's arms and crest.|$|E
5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting {{to prevent it from}} getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second pass. The result did not add to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in full flight {{at the time of its}} destruction.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> par with Arkham City.|$|E

5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did not want it to get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time came for the film's climax, where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt, and neither wanted to damage the mask by putting <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, Bath's abbey {{church was}} {{dilapidated}} and Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to rebuild <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> smaller scale in 1500. The new church was completed {{just a few}} years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city's parish church in the Elizabethan era, when the city experienced a revival as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status.|$|E

5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E

5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E

5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route through the town of Cairo. It comes close to the hamlet of Cairo, but {{bypasses}} <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> four-lane divided highway that takes it around the northern fringe of the community. As it runs around Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Kennel Club {{recognised}} the Dandie Dinmont Terrier {{as one of}} {{the rarest}} dog breeds native to the British Isles, putting <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. The breeds chosen for this list were those who originated in the UK and Ireland, but had less than 300 puppy registrations per year. One particularly low period was between July and September 2003, when only 21 puppies were registered, of which 18 were male. Overall that year, only 90 puppies were registered in the UK, compared to 9,823 for the West Highland White Terrier. Additionally numbers had dropped to low levels in America as well, with the AKC registering only 75 puppies in the same time period. Following work since 2006, the Dandie Dinmont registration numbers have improved slightly, with 151 puppies registered with the Kennel Club in 2010, the highest number for any year in the last ten years. Of other breeds of native terrier, only the Skye, Sealyham, Manchester and Glen of Imaal Terriers have lower registration figures.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1980s, Nickelodeon was {{approached}} by production and consulting groups {{with the idea of}} doing a game show for children, a first for the network.

Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse Trap. The pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby. Double Dare was green-lighted and announced in June 1986.|$|E
