5|$|In 1938, Waldmann {{applied for}} a career as {{an officer in the}} Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed {{suitable}} but at the age of 16 was too young to volunteer for military service. After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his <b>fellow</b> <b>students</b> were forced into compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute. Since Waldmann had intended to study aircraft construction after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology at the Braunschweig-Waggum airfield under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.|$|E

5|$|The Naval Academy's {{first ever}} {{football}} team was fielded in 1879. The squad was entirely student-operated, receiving no official support from Naval Academy officials. The team was entirely funded by {{its members and}} their <b>fellow</b> <b>students.</b> This would continue until 1892, when that season's team was led by coach Ben Crosby. The 1879 team participated in just one game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, at most likely an unused drill field on the Naval Academy campus. Navy would not field a football team in 1880 or 1881, likely {{due to the lack of}} support.|$|E

He worked as a preschool teacher {{for two years before}} the success of The Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, The Wiggles {{became one of the most}} successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs.

5|$|He {{attended}} Columbia University, {{where he}} received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was {{due in part to}} conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his <b>fellow</b> <b>students</b> there were extreme leftists and {{that he was one of}} only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.|$|E
5|$|In October 1776, {{at the age}} of 17, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge. The {{deaths of}} his {{grandfather}} and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study. Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found the excesses of some of his <b>fellow</b> <b>students</b> distasteful. Witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, Wilberforce was a popular figure. He made many friends including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt. Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788.|$|E
