50|$|Analog {{television}} channels, whether terrestrial, {{cable or}} satellite, are transmitted {{as a single}} program service uncompressed at the same <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> which fills the entire bandwidth available. Digital television channels can be interleved and are in a highly compressed format, so that the bandwidth they require varies due to the bitrate provided to each channel; it is more cost efficient to transmit several channels together so that they share the same bandwidth, each channel have carefully constrained bitrates allocated, so that {{the sum of all}} channels fill the <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidth</b> provided. A group of program services transmitted within a particular bandwidth allocation is erroneously known as a multiplex; or the channels may be called subchannels. Sometimes, when analog transmissions are replaced by digital, the <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of one analog broadcast is allocated to the program services; the bandwidth of one analog broadcast is sufficient for several compressed channels.|$|E

We develop a theory that focuses on uniformity in bandwidth. We establish a n-asymptotic representation of our estimator as a process depending on the bandwidth within a wide range including <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidths</b> and that applies to misspecified models. We also study an efficient version of our estimator. We develop inference procedures based on a distance metric statistic for testing restrictions on parameters and we pro-pose a new bootstrap technique.

Hence, the theoretical considerations developed before do not solve the practical problem. Several directions have been proposed to overcome this problem. One of the most famous ones consists in using leave-one-out or other cross-validation methods [30, 38]: among a finite family of <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidths,</b> such methods choose the best one in an asymptotic setting. However, to our knowledge, nothing can be said when the family of <b>bandwidths</b> is not <b>fixed</b> and some <b>bandwidths</b> tend to 0 with n.

50|$|Given a <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidth</b> {{and high}} refresh rate, {{interlaced}} video {{can also provide}} a higher spatial resolution than progressive scan. For instance, 1920×1080 pixel resolution interlaced HDTV with a 60 Hz field rate (known as 1080i60 or 1080i/30) has a similar bandwidth to 1280×720 pixel progressive scan HDTV with a 60 Hz frame rate (720p60 or 720p/60), but achieves approximately twice the spatial resolution for low-motion scenes.|$|E
50|$|Variable bitrate (VBR) is a {{strategy}} to maximize the visual video quality and minimize the bitrate. On fast-motion scenes, a variable bitrate uses more bits than it does on slow-motion scenes of similar duration, yet achieves a consistent visual quality.

The latter setting is general enough to entertain as a particular case a unknown symmetry point, which we duely estimate by the sample median. The conditions we derive ensure that the resulting estimation error is asymptotically negligible. Simulations show that the asymptotic tests perform well even in very small samples, entailing better size and power properties than some of the existing symmetry tests...|$|R

However, no individual DHT can satisfy an application {{that requires a}} “best of all worlds ” performance, viz., adaptive behavior at run-time. We propose the MultiRouter, a light-weight solution that provides adaptivity to the application using a DHT-independent approach. By merely making run-time choices to select from among multiple DHT protocols using simple cost functions, we show the MultiRouter is able to provide a best-of-all-DHTs run-time performance with respect to object access times and churnresistance. In addition, the MultiRouter {{is not limited to}} any particular set of DHT implementations since the interaction occurs in a black box manner, i. e., through well-defined interfaces.

Frame Relay networks can dynamically allocate bandwidth at both the physical and logical channel level.|$|E
50|$|Conventional IP {{networks}} allow bandwidth reuse, but do {{not allow}} key services to exclusively use <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> IP hard pipe strictly isolates soft and hard pipes by reserving hardware so that soft and hard pipes do not affect each other.

5000|$|The {{first product}} {{released}} by the new subsidiary was MG1212, a 12 channel, 12 track recorder in 1984. This innovative device used a special VHS-like cartridge (a MK-20), and was good for 10 minutes of continuous 12 track recording (19 cm per second) or 20 minutes at half speed (9.5 cm per second). One track (14) was permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another one for synchronization such as SMPTE or MTC. Each channel strip included dbx type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidths).</b> The unit also had innovations like an electronic 2 bus system, a 12 stereo channel patch bay and auto punch in and out, among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality rivaling that of more expensive 16 track machines using 1" [...] tape. The MG-1212 was later replaced by the MG-1214, which improved the transport mechanism and overall performance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Multi-rate {{teletraffic}} models {{aim at the}} call-level QoS {{assessment of}} modern telecom networks. This assessment {{is important for the}} bandwidth allocation among serviceclasses, the avoidance of too costly over-dimensioning of the network and the prevention, through traffic engineering mechanisms, of excessive throughput degradation. Despite of its importance, the call-level QoS evaluation remains an open issue, due to the presence of elastic traffic in modern telecom networks. In this paper we consider elastic traffic in connectionoriented networks at call level, i. e. a) calls which have contingency alternative bandwidth requirements at the call setup phase and b) the ability of in-service calls to reduce their bandwidth (elastic bandwidth), while increasing simultaneously their service time. According to the call arrival process, the bandwidth requirements of calls and their behavior during their lifetime, we distinguish the study of multi-service loss models into four categories: A: Random arriving calls with either <b>fixed</b> or elastic <b>bandwidth</b> requirements, and constant use of their assigned bandwidth (constant-bit-rate) during their lifetime.

5000|$|In {{digital audio}} and video broadcasting, for example, a {{statistical}} multiplexer is a content aggregating device that allows broadcasters to provide {{the greatest number of}} audio or video services for a given bandwidth by sharing a pool of <b>fixed</b> <b>bandwidth</b> among multiple services or streams of varying bitrates. The multiplexer allocates to each service the bandwidth required for its real-time needs so that services with complex scenes receive more bandwidth than services with less complex ones.

As the modulation rate increases, the spectral efficiency improves, but at the cost of the SNR requirement.
