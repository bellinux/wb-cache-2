40|$|Are <b>deep</b> <b>recessions</b> {{typically}} {{followed by}} strong recoveries? This paper investigates this question. There {{is not a}} single standard definition for a <b>deep</b> <b>recession</b> or a strong recovery. Therefore, our first step is to define what constitutes a <b>deep</b> <b>recession</b> and a strong recovery. Next we examine whether there is any causal relationship between <b>deep</b> <b>recessions</b> and strong recoveries. Our analysis shows there is no relationship between the depth of a recession and the subsequent pace of economic recovery when we use Gross Domestic Product, Gross Domestic Income, and employment as measures of recession and recovery. A modestly significant relationship does exist, however, between the magnitude of increases in the unemployment rate during a recession and decreases in the unemployment rate during the ensuing recovery. ...|$|R

40|$|Why did Finland {{experience}} in 1991 - 93 the <b>deepest</b> <b>recession</b> observed in an industrialized country since the 1930 s? Using a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} with labor frictions, we argue that {{the collapse of the}} Soviet-Finnish trade was a major contributor to the contraction. Finland’s experience mirrors that of the transition economies of Eastern Europe, which suffered similar <b>deep</b> <b>recessions</b> coupled with institutional changes. By focusing on the Finnish case we isolate the effects of the Finnish-Soviet trade collapse and shed new light on the sources of recessions in transition economies...|$|R

40|$|Many {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} for root coverage. However, none of them presents predictable results in <b>deep</b> and wide <b>recessions.</b> Objective: The aim of this case series report is to describe an alternative technique for root coverage at sites showing <b>deep</b> <b>recessions</b> and attachment loss > 4 mm at buccal sites. Material and Methods: Four patients presenting <b>deep</b> <b>recession</b> defects at buccal sites (>= 4 mm) were treated by the newly forming bone graft technique, which consists {{in the creation of}} an alveolar socket at edentulous ridge and transferring of granulation tissue present in this socket to the recession defect after 21 days. Clinical periodontal parameters, including recession depth (RD), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), plaque index (PI) and keratinized gingiva width (KGW) were evaluated by a single examiner immediately before surgery and at 1, 3, 6 and 9 months postoperatively. Results: All cases showed reduction in RD and PD, along with CAL gain, although no increase in KGW could be observed. These findings suggest that the technique could favor periodontal regeneration along with root coverage, especially in areas showing <b>deep</b> <b>recessions</b> and attachment loss...|$|R

40|$|The {{recovery}} from the financial crisis of 2007 ‐ 2008 has now been proceeding for 16 quarters. The recent recovery is slower than every preceding recession with a financial crisis in U. S. history. Many {{have argued that the}} reason this recovery has been so sluggish is that it reflects the severity of the financial crisis (eg Reinhart and Rogoff 2009). Yet this goes against the record of U. S. business cycles in the past century and a half. According to Milton Friedman (1969) “A large contraction tends to be followed by a large business expansion. ” Friedman explained this tendency for a rapid bounce back from a <b>deep</b> <b>recession</b> by his plucking model. He imagined the U. S. economy as a string attached to an upward sloping board, with the board representing the underlying growth rate. A recession was a downward pluck on the string; a recovery was when the string bounced back. The greater the pluck, the faster the bounce back to trend. Bordo and Haubrich (2012) revisited the issue whether business cycles with financial crises are different from the general pattern. Our analysis of 27 U. S. business cycles from 1880 to the present not only confirms Friedman’s plucking model but also shows that <b>deep</b> <b>recessions</b> associated with financial crises recover at a faster pace than <b>deep</b> <b>recessions</b> without them. We find that the recent recession is different from the historical average seen in a shallow recovery after a <b>deep</b> <b>recession...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using Swedish economy-wide data {{spanning}} {{across two}} <b>deep</b> <b>recessions,</b> {{we examine the}} relationship between labor market conditions and the role of social contacts in matching labor market entrants to employing firms. We use class-plant fixed-effects models to isolate the role of social contacts from paid work during high-school. One third of post-graduation matches are formed at establishments where youths worked during their studies. Furthermore, graduates {{are much more likely to}} match with sites to which adult coworkers from these jobs have relocated. These patterns are strikingly counter-cyclical. Contacts are much more important for job matching in <b>deep</b> <b>recessions</b> than in good times, suggesting that informal contacts and social networks are crucial determinants of matching patterns in bad times...|$|R
