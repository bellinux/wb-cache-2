40|$|This paper conducts an econometric {{examination}} {{on changes}} in foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>policies</b> of China and Asia before and after China's policy changes in July 2005. Foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>policies</b> in China and Asia are {{an important component of}} global issues connected with international finance. Before July 2005, policies in China and some other Asian countries were based on de facto, fixed exchange rates systems against the U. S. dollar (dollar-peg). A rise in the current-account surplus and massive currency intervention in China triggered pressure from other countries and international organizations on China to change its foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>policies.</b> In July 2005, China responded by allowing the yuan to appreciate against the dollar. At the time of the policy changes, the official statement mentioned discarding the dollar-peg and adopting reference to a basket value. Several patterns exist in the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>policies</b> of emerging Asian countries other than China. Dollar-peg systems were also adopted by Hong Kong (before the Asian Currency Crisis) and Malaysia (from September 1998). Singapore adopted a basket system (the weighted average value of the currencies of its main trading partners) even before the Asian Currency Crisis. After the Asian crisis, several countries including Thailand and Korea adopted flexible exchange rate regimes. Interventions, though differing in scale, were also carried out in an effort to stabilize values against the dollar. This report rigorously estimates the weight of basket currencies and examines how the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>policies</b> of countries other than China were altered before and after China's policy changes. The results show that the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>policies</b> adopted by China after the July 2005 reform are in no way a basket system; they are instead a crawling peg —gradual appreciation— against the dollar. The degree of appreciation and volatility of most other currencies of emerging Asian economies after the reform has been larger than that of the yuan. ...|$|R

40|$|Initiation of a fixed <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> {{is often}} {{made as a}} part of a policy package {{involving}} among other things restrictive demand man-agement policies. Likewise the breakdown of fixed <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policies</b> is often attributed to the failure of bringing demand management poli-cies on a path consistent with the exchange rate peg. The present paper shows that the incentives underlying <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> are dependent on demand management policy and that a restrictive demand manage-ment policy may be a way of sustaining a fixed <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy.</b> Hence, fiscal policy can be interpreted as a commitment mechanism in the sense that a fiscal policy that reduces the gain from an exchange rate change makes the fixed <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> time-consistent and therefore credible. ...|$|R

According to the Basic Constitutional Act of the Central Bank of Chile (Law 18,840), its main objectives are to safeguard “the {{stability of the}} currency and the normal functioning of internal and external payments". To meet these objectives, the CBoC is enabled to use monetary and foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>policy</b> instruments, along with some discretion on financial regulation. In practice, the CBoC monetary policy is guided by an inflation targeting regime, while the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>policy</b> is led by a floating exchange rate and, although unusual, the bank reserves the right {{to intervene in the}} foreign exchange markets.|$|E
40|$|Even though {{globalization}} benefits {{less developed}} countries (LDCs), it also makes them more vulnerable to the exogenous shocks to the economies. Many LDCs rely on imported technologies and intermediate inputs {{to compete in the}} international export markets with better quality and cost efficient products. In this regard, <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policies</b> in respective countries have a direct bearing on the cost of production. This paper examines alternative exchange rate regimes to suggest an appropriate <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> in the context of developing countries. The paper utilizes a small open economy model involving direct supply-side effects of exchange rate and expectations of key economic variables and considers four possible <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policies,</b> e. g., fixed exchange rate, perfectly flexible exchange rate, leaning against the wind, and leaning with the wind. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the paper finds that {{in the event of a}} shock, leaning against the wind is likely to be the most appropriate <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy.</b> Moreover, in the event of rigid wages, a fixed <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> is advisable. globalization, exchange rate regimes, <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper reviews Japan's <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> {{from the}} end of the Bretton Woods era to the present. The Japanese {{authorities}} used various tools to manage the yen–dollar exchange rate over much of this period. The most dominant was official foreign exchange intervention, which in most instances took the form of "leaning against the wind". Capital controls were also used but, with full capital account convertibility, ceased to exist as an instrument of <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> by the mid- 1980 s. Following the post-Plaza appreciation of the yen, the authorities eased monetary policy to arrest the appreciating pressure. The possible role of <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> in the great asset inflation that followed, however, remains unanswered. More recently, <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy</b> during the period of prolonged stagnation and fragile recovery was made subordinate to the overall stance of macroeconomic policy. In this regard, particularly striking in terms of scale and frequency was the "great intervention" of 2003 – 2004. Equally striking has been the total absence of official intervention since. It would require a renewed substantial volatility of the yen to know whether this indeed marks a permanent shift in Japan's <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy.</b> Japanese <b>exchange</b> rate <b>policy,</b> <b>exchange</b> rate management, Japanese economic policy...|$|R
