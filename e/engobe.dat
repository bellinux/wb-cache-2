This waste product is interesting for recycling process. The main mineralogical phase of dust is hematite alpha-Fe 2 O 3. Both synthetic and natural iron oxides are commonly used as pigments in ceramic industry. In this experiment the metallurgy dusts were used as a pigment for preparation of glazes and <b>engobes.</b> Agglomerating dusts were used both precalcined thermally at 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C and in an original state. The prepared glazes were composed of a transparent glaze base with 10 wt% agglomerating dusts as pigment. The glazes calcined at 1060 degrees C were finally yellow colored and glazes calcined at 900 degrees C were brown colored. <b>Engobes</b> contained a ceramic clay base with 1, 5, 10 and 50 wt% of dust as pigment. <b>Engobes</b> calcined at 900 degrees C were red and grey colored. The pigments were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical (XRFS) analysis, granulometry (PSD), thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal (DTA) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and CIELab values.

The analysed samples were mainly produced for burial in tombs and were not intended for everyday use. They belong to the period between the end of themid- 7 th century andthe first half of the 4 th century BC, and were excavated from the Toppicelli archaeological district near the suburbs of Canosa (Puglia, Italy). Forty-eight pottery fragments were available for this study. No handling of the samples was required for the Raman study, and it was possible to excise the pigmented layer {{in such a way that}} the lacunae were not distinguishable to the naked eye due to the micrometric size of the laser spot as far as LA-ICP-MS is concerned. Their combination turned out to be quite useful for the investigation of these archaeological materials: the chemical nature of the white, red, brown and black pigments employed in the pottery manufacture was investigated. Iron and manganese compounds were identified as the red and brown/black main colouring substances, respectively; on the other hand, whites and <b>engobes</b> (whitish slips) were based on kaolinite. This set of colouring substances is of importance, as it enabled the artisan to obtain in one oxidising firing cycle brown, black and red paints.

30|$|Water is an {{important}} raw material in the ceramic-tile industries (Enrique et al. 2000; Gabaldón-Estevan et al. 2014). Water consumption varies in different parts and processes of manufacturing tiles (Huang et al. 2013). Generally, the consumed water per square meter of manufactured tile is about 20  L; 85 percent of this amount is consumed in the slurry process and the remaining 15 percent {{is used in the}} glazing section (Enrique et al. 2000). The wastewater of the ceramic-tile industries is produced through the following processes: slurring, spray drying, preparing glaze, coloring, <b>engobing,</b> as well as polishing and washing the floors of the production halls (Gabaldón-Estevan et al. 2014; Shu et al. 2010). The major part of the produced wastewater in these sectors is attributed to washing (Moliner-Salvador et al. 2012). Wastewaters of such industries contain clays, insoluble ferrites and silicates, electrolytes, anions such as sulfate (100 – 500  mg/L) and chloride (100 – 700  mg/L), as well as heavy metals such as lead, zinc, chemical oxygen demand (COD) (150 – 1000  mg/L), and BOD 5 (50 – 400  mg/L). Organic materials in wastewater are mainly produced from the additives used in decorating tiles (Al-Asheh and Aidan 2017; Moliner-Salvador et al. 2012). In the ceramic-tile industries, a considerable amount of suspended solids and wastewater turbidity can be removed using a simple sedimentation process (Chong et al. 2009). The produced wastewater after this stage is only applicable in the slurry sector. This recycled water does not have the necessary quality to be used in other sectors, especially in glaze preparation or other coating processes. Therefore, it requires a more comprehensive treatment process (Chong et al. 2009; Martínez-García et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Water is, of course, a {{universal}} substance, and indeed, {{has been the}} subject of artistic depiction from time immemorial. Thus, it has been typically depicted two dimensionally in an impressionistic format, as for example waves shown in either geometric or organic design. E. g., certain of the prehistoric painted vases from Susa employed the geometric chevron wave pattern; organic wave patterns appeared in Hokusai's famous wood-block print, "Mt. Fuji Seen Below a Wave at Kanagawa". My work attempts to challenge the two dimensional limitation and bring water to a three dimensional perspective, but again employing the wave configuration. The vitality of waves and the variety of imaginable momentary forms provide an opportunity to capture the movement or flow of nature. Thus, these works have been, to some extent, influenced by the classic Japanese garden with its violent and subdued extremes. In executing my works, I have attempted to manipulate the properties of clay. In its plastic stage, clay is capable of being shaped into smooth, subtle lines and graceful curves for subdued expression. When less moist, it may result in harsh and violent configurations and rough textures. By employing the variety of forms made possible by the properties of clay, the ceramic medium is able to depict the full scope of wave forms present in nature, ranging from rolling to choppy to rough and every conceivable quality between. Waves in nature also appear in a wide range of color and tone, from blue to green to white, red, black and grey, and from dull and dim to shiny and glistening bright. In various firings, such as sagger, and from cone 3 to cone 12, and by using <b>engobes</b> and high fire glazes, I attempted to produce the wide variety of colors and tones for waves that appear in nature. First in concept, and then confirmed in the development of these works, the motion of water has offered me an intriguing and challenging artistic subject. The limitlessness of form, texture, color and tone permitted an energy for creation that I found to be inspiring. In particular, in the context of the variety and range of mood made available by the subject, I sought to capture an expression of some of the natural balance between the chaos and serenity existing in the universe...|$|R

The plastic potential contained in the ceramic materials regarding to exploring visual and tactile qualities have created an attraction in some plastic artists, throughout the history. What did attract them? An idea inspired by the pictorial materials of ceramic that generates the impulse to create? An idea that is subsequently created by means of these materials? Which creative processes do inspire and are inspired by these materials? These are issues in need of an answer. The aim of this work is to analyze the implications in the pictorial process of ceramic painting and to understand its identity.

Materials like clays, <b>engobes,</b> pigments and glazes are characterized. A reference to the media and means of ceramic painting is also included in this first part. To complete this introduction we point out some contexts of ceramic painting such as the chromatic component, the light reflection, the action of textures, and the influence of surfaces. In a second moment the ceramic paintings of the portuguese ceramist Cecilia de Sousa between 1980 and 1990 is analyzed. Cecilia de Sousa uses the ceramic materials on a painting that, in our point of view, strengthens the ceramic materials.

In this thesis a commercial roof tile, which was taken from a company, was used. For good fitting between the <b>engobe</b> and the roof tile their coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) should be almost the same. One way of adjusting the CTE values, the chemical analysis of the roof tile was analyzed and based on these different <b>engobe</b> recipes with high purity raw materials and frit that was made in the laboratory with high purity raw material were prepared. The roof tiles were rich in SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, (Na+K) 2 O. Therefore, by changing the percentage of these oxides new <b>engobe</b> recipes were prepared to find the most suitable composition for roof tiles. After application on surfaces of roof tiles, the samples were fired at 1000 oC for 75 min. 70 % SiO 2, 20 % Al 2 O 3, 10 % (Na+K) 2 O with 10 % laboratory frit and 70 % SiO 2, 20 % Al 2 O 3, 10 % (Na+K) 2 O with 30 % laboratory frit were found to be two of the most proper <b>engobe</b> compositions for the roof tile. Later these <b>engobe</b> recipes were prepared with lower purity industrial grade raw materials and industrial frit because the cost of producing frit is high for a roof tile manufacturer. The low purity engobes were applied successfully on the surface. However, lower purity raw materials containing little Fe and Ti led to a slightly darker color compared to higher purity engobes. The life cycle of the products were tested with different kinds of acids and temperature tests. And the results showed that the <b>engobe</b> samples were durable against the environmental effects.

40|$|Abstract Ceramic <b>engobe</b> is an {{intermediate}} layer between the substrate and the glaze of a ceramic tile. It is basically composed by plastic material, clays, and non-plastic material, feldspar and frit. Light-colored clays with good plasticity and low-fire temperature {{are used in}} ceramic <b>engobe</b> formulations, typically ball clays. However, these clays contain different accessory minerals, which can adversely affect the opacity and the whiteness. The use of washed kaolin, with a lower content of accessory minerals, tends to lead to higher opacity and whiteness. In addition, its mechanical activation can increase the plasticity, allowing its use {{as a replacement for}} ball clay. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the use of mechanically-activated kaolin to replace ball clay in an <b>engobe</b> employed in the production of ceramic tiles. Samples of kaolin were activated by high energy mill (1 and 4 h, at 500 rpm) and characterized by surface area and particle size measurements, crystallography, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Cylindrical specimens of four ceramic <b>engobe</b> formulations were submitted to splitting tensile strength and bulk density tests. The specimens were fired in a laboratory kiln and characterized through the determination of water absorption, bulk density, relative density and by reflectance spectrophotometry. Crystallographic analysis with Rietveld refinement and microstructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy were also carried out. After the high energy milling, the kaolin had less crystallinity and the specific surface area increased from 4. 6 to 46. 1 m 2 /g.
