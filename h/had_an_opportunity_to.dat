5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, {{which had to be}} thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E

After a three-and-out on their opening drive, Alabama scored their first touchdown of the evening on a six-yard AJ McCarron touchdown pass to Brad Smelley to complete a ten-play, 77-yard drive. On the following drive Vanderbilt <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> cut into the lead, but Carey Spear missed a 47-yard field goal to keep the Alabama lead at 7–0. Spear missed a second field goal later {{in the second quarter}} from 38-yards, and the Crimson Tide responded with their second touchdown drive of the game.

5|$|McCabe ran for an {{administrative}} position with his local club Mosman after his retirement, but was defeated, so he never <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> serve with the NSWCA. After {{the end of}} his first-class career, McCabe became a keen recreational golfer, but stopped playing in the mid-1950s due to his foot problems and other health issues. In 195657, McCabe and O'Reilly were given a testimonial match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI and acted as a trial for the non-Test tour of New Zealand. The match raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O'Reilly, and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.|$|E
5|$|Nagumo {{was now in}} a quandary. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (Hiryū and Sōryū), {{recommended}} that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on Sōryū and Hiryū, and half the ready cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or {{it would have to}} ditch into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> position ("spot") their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch.|$|E

5|$|Roma had {{a chance}} to equalise in the 27th minute, but Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar saved Conti's low shot. Neal was shown a yellow card in the 32nd minute for {{bringing}} down Conti, and a few minutes later Liverpool <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> extend their lead. Liverpool striker Rush charged down Dario Bonetti's clearance and ran onto the ball, but his shot was saved by Tancredi. With minutes remaining until half-time, Roma equalised. Sebastiano Nela passed to Conti, who ran down the left-hand side of the pitch. His first attempt at crossing the ball into the penalty area was blocked by a combination of Neal and Mark Lawrenson, but his cross rebounded back to him. His second attempt found Roberto Pruzzo in the penalty area, whose glancing header went into the Liverpool goal to level the scores at 1–1.|$|E
5|$|The 1957 Yankees {{reached that}} year's World Series, but lost in seven games to the Milwaukee Braves. Following the Series, the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California, leaving the Yankees as New York's only MLB team.

In the 1958 World Series, the Yankees <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> avenge their defeat to the Braves. The Yankees fell behind by losing three of the first four games, but won the final three games of the Series to claim another championship.

5|$|After {{six games}} without a goal and some {{criticism}} from supporters, manager Pulis revealed that Jones has had personal problems which have affected his performances. He ended this {{run with a}} goal against Everton on New Year's Day. However, he again went on a goal drought this time for three months before scoring against Tottenham Hotspur in April. He then went on a similar scoring run he had {{at the start of}} the season scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers and then <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> become the first Stoke player to score in four consecutive Premier League matches against Blackpool but he missed an open goal. He made amends the following match scoring against Arsenal in a 3–1 win. Jones played in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Stoke lost 1–0 to Manchester City, he had Stoke's best chance in the match going through one on one with Joe Hart who saved Jones' effort. Jones ended the 2010–11 as joint top goalscorer with Jonathan Walters, both scored 12 goals. Jones said that he had a 'topsy-turvy' first season at Stoke.|$|E
5|$|DiMaggio {{played his}} final MLB season in 1951, while highly touted outfielder Mickey Mantle made his debut for New York. Pitcher Allie Reynolds threw two no-hitters during 1951, as the Yankees claimed the AL pennant {{for the third}} {{straight}} year. They then won the 1951 World Series against the Giants, four games to two. When their 1952 team took the AL pennant, the Yankees <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> match the four straight World Series championships won by the team from 1936 to 1939. In another Yankees–Dodgers matchup, New York fell behind three games to two, but victories in games six and seven gave the Yankees the title. New York and Brooklyn were matched again in the 1953 World Series, and a Billy Martin base hit that decided the sixth and final game of the Series gave the Yankees another four games to two victory and a fifth title in a row. As of 2016, the 1949–1953 Yankees are the only MLB teams to win five straight World Series; no team since has won more than three in a row.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> {{drive the}} Austrians {{from the west}} bank of the Rhine in {{conjunction}} with the Army of the Center. Instead he pursued a pet project of his, the invasion of the Dutch Republic. He hoped to go to war with the Dutch while keeping the Kingdom of Great Britain neutral. But the French government forced his hand, declaring war on Great Britain on 1 February 1793 and ordering him to overrun the Dutch Republic. Dumouriez undertook the invasion with 15,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, soon reinforced. Leaving Miranda to besiege Maastricht, covered by Valence's army and Harville's corps, Dumouriez pushed north. At this time the Army of the North counted 18,322 men, the Army of Belgium numbered 30,197, the Army of the Ardennes consisted of 23,479 soldiers, Harville's corps was 12,051 strong, the Army of Holland had 23,244 troops and there were 15,000 men in Belgian garrisons. All told, the strength of the French army in the Low Countries was 122,293 men. The French army became overconfident, believing itself invincible. Meanwhile, the National Convention was riven by bitter political struggles between the moderate Girondists and the extreme Jacobins. During this period the army supply system fell apart through neglect.|$|E
