25|$|Distressed {{vessels that}} request {{the service of}} towing vessels have means to make towing as safe as possible. Oil tankers have <b>emergency</b> <b>towing</b> {{equipment}} fixed at the forward and aft part of the vessel that will allow to connect the towing line. The connection of these apparatuses to the vessel's hull is reinforced according with class requirements. Bulk carriers and general cargo vessels {{are not required to}} have a specialized <b>emergency</b> <b>towing</b> arrangement. Depending on the vessel's type and keel laid date, in accordance with the MSC256(84) standard they must have on board an <b>emergency</b> <b>towing</b> procedure manual. This ship-specific manual describes procedures that will allow the vessel to be towed using its own equipment. The procedure should make use of the standard mooring equipment like mooring ropes, bits, rollers and Panama chock.|$|E

25|$|The German {{concept of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>towing</b> prescribes a maximum {{response}} time of two hours for any incident in German coastal waters. This requires three ETVs in the North Sea and {{five in the}} Baltic Sea despite a considerably smaller area to cover there. Equipment and performance of the vessels have been adapted {{to the size of}} the vessels in the respective areas of operation and include the ability to operate in shallow waters. Moreover, it is mandatory to have one vessel with 200 t of bollard pull and 100 t each in the North Sea and Baltic respectively. Both ship types are also required to be able to operate under hazardous conditions such as explosive areas and gas leaks.|$|E
25|$|An {{emergency}} tow vessel, {{also called}} <b>emergency</b> <b>towing</b> vessel, (ETV) is a multi purpose boat used by state authorities to tow disabled vessels on high seas {{in order to}} prevent dangers to man and environment. The disabled vessel is either towed to a safe haven or kept in place against wind and current until commercial assistance by tug boats has arrived on site or until it has been repaired to the extent of being able to manoeuvre on its own. The need for ETVs as a preventive measure has arisen since the number of available commercial salvage tugs was reduced while potential dangers from individual vessels have increased. E.g. Spain has fourteen, Turkey has eleven, Germany operates eight, Norway has seven, France has five, Sweden three and the Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Iceland and Finland each have one official emergency tug boat. Australia also operates emergency response vessels. The United Kingdom's four strong ETV fleet was to be disbanded in September 2011 due to budget cuts but the two vessels operating in Scottish waters received an extension of contract until the end of 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the new multipurpose vessel began on 25 May 2003 when the Ministry of Transport and Communications appointed a work group to investigate the technical requirements and economic aspects of building a new multipurpose icebreaker capable of combating oil and chemical spills around the year. The amount of oil transported in the Gulf of Finland had increased from a mere 15 million tons {{per year in the}} early 1990s to 69 million tons in 2003 and was expected to reach 130 million tons by 2010 after the new Russian oil terminals became operational, increasing the risk of a large spill in the vulnerable sea area considerably. While Finland already had a fleet of vessels with oil recovery equipment, none of them were capable of collecting spilled oil efficiently in heavy seas or in ice. The new multipurpose icebreaker would be designed to be capable of recovering spilled oil and chemicals in both open water and ice conditions, extinguishing shipboard fires and <b>emergency</b> <b>towing</b> of the largest merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Finland. The new vessel would also have sufficient icebreaking capability to assist oil tankers to the Kilpilahti oil refinery in Porvoo during winter. However, in the interim report, published on 30 September 2003, the work group noted that unless other work outside the winter months could be arranged and the new multipurpose icebreaker would have {{to spend the rest of}} the year in pollution control readiness, the operating expenses would be very high.|$|E
2500|$|The Ministry of the Environment {{operates}} the Louhi. The ship {{is listed as}} a [...] multi-purpose oil recovery vessel {{and can be used}} for <b>emergency</b> <b>towing,</b> fire-fighting, icebreaking, mine-laying, to combat oil/chemical spills, as well as other rescue operations. The vessel has a bollard pull of 60 t. YAG Louhi is based at the Port of Upinniemi approximately 40km west of Helsinki in the Archipelago Sea.|$|E

50|$|The Abeille Bourbon is a {{high seas}} <b>emergency</b> <b>tow</b> vessel (salvage tug), 80 metres long with a {{tractive}} power of 200 t-f MN, a crew of 12, designed by Norwegian naval architect Sigmund Borgundvåg. She was christened by Bernadette Chirac on 13 April 2005 {{in the presence of}} sponsor Jacques de Chateauvieux. She is based in Brest, France.|$|R
25|$|The {{construction}} and commissioning of the Nordic were {{a consequence of}} the Pallas accident off Amrum island in 1998 when a cargo vessel ran aground and lost a substantial amount of oil. Especially the Schutzgemeinschaft Deutsche Nordsee association and many other non-governmental organisations {{for the protection of the}} environment had worked towards the commissioning of a new <b>emergency</b> <b>tow</b> vessel on the German North Sea coast.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2013, the Finnish Transport Agency {{awarded the}} design {{contract}} for the new icebreaker to the Finnish engineering companies Aker Arctic and ILS. On 22 January 2014, {{the construction of the}} 125 million euro vessel was awarded to Arctech Helsinki Shipyard. The new state-owned icebreaker will be able to move continuously in level ice with a thickness of [...] and reach an average speed of [...] during escort operations in the Baltic Sea. The vessel will be powered by environmentally friendly dual fuel engines capable of using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel. In addition to icebreaker duties, the new vessel will be fitted for <b>emergency</b> <b>towing</b> and oil spill response.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{icebreaker}} {{will have}} a crew of 38 and additional accommodation for 90 special personnel. In addition to normal icebreaking and escorting tasks, Viktor Chernomyrdin will be equipped for <b>emergency</b> <b>towing</b> and rescue operations in open water, oil spill response, offshore and underwater construction projects, and fire fighting. To support technical work, the ship can be fitted with a 150-ton deck crane. The large superstructure will contain over [...] of scientific laboratory space and a modular [...] "diving complex" [...] consisting of a diving chamber and other support systems built in standard-sized containers can be carried on the deck. An outboard lift will allow persons with limited physical abilities as well as compact equipment to be lowered directly to the sea ice. The icebreaker {{will have a}} small helipad in the bow for Kamov Ka-32 and Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma, and a larger helicopter deck and hangar capable of accommodating two heavier Mil Mi-8 and AgustaWestland AW101 in the aft.|$|E

2500|$|The {{facility}} became operational on 1 January 2007, and {{was officially}} opened on 23 January. Initially the VTS was given {{jurisdiction over the}} ocean south to Rørvik. The center received two employees. From 1 July a traffic separation scheme (TTS) was introduced along the coast from Vardø to Røst, with NOR VTS set to monitor the traffic. Approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the TTS forced tankers exceeding 5,000 gross tonnes to follow a stipulated, separated route typically [...] from the shore. NOR VTS was also given {{the responsibility for the}} State <b>Emergency</b> <b>Tow</b> Response Service, a joint effort between the Coastal Administration and the Coast Guard.|$|R

2500|$|On 22 October 2010, the Ministry of Defence {{confirmed}} that Astute had [...] "run into difficulties" [...] off the Isle of Skye while on trials, after eyewitnesses reported the submarine had run aground {{a few miles}} from the Skye Bridge. There were no reports of injuries. The captain of the vessel elected to wait for tug assistance, rather than use the submarine's own power to clear the stern from the obstruction, to minimise the damage to the hull's anechoic tiles. A Royal Navy spokesperson said the vessel had been grounded on silt, and was re-floated at high tide. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency-chartered <b>emergency</b> <b>tow</b> vessel Anglian Prince was dispatched to the scene from Stornoway.|$|R
