However, his {{citizenship}} papers were not processed in time to compete in the Olympic trials, and so he did not compete in Barcelona. Peters won his first Olympic medal when he rode with the US dressage team to a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, together with Robert Dover, Michelle Gibson and Guenter Seidel. Peters, riding Floriano, was an alternate for the US team at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and did not compete. In 2006, with an aging Floriano, Peters and the US team won bronze at the 2006 World Equestrian Games. Soon after, he began riding TC Ravel, who would become his most successful horse. Despite being gelded while in quarantine after his shipment from the Netherlands and suffering an injury in 2007 that prevented training, Ravel carried Peters to a qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In individual dressage competition at the Games, Peters placed fourth, riding Ravel. The US team finished fourth at the 2008 Games, but was disqualified after team member Courtney King's horse tested positive for <b>felbinac,</b> a banned substance. In 2009, Peters and Ravel had the highest scores in all three portions of the prestigious German Aachen World Equestrian Festival Grand Prix competition, leading them to be the first American pair to be named the Aachen Grand Prix Champions.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{protocol}} using gluten as {{a carrier}} material {{was developed to}} administer chemicals to adult zebrafish, per os (p. o.). To evaluate the capacity of gluten to retain chemicals, we prepared gluten granules containing eight types of chemicals with different Log P(ow) values and immersed them in water. Less than 5 % of chemicals were eluted from gluten granules within 5 min, a standard feeding time for zebrafish. Although retention capability was dependent on the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the chemicals, the gluten granules retained 62 %- 99 % of {{the total amount of}} chemical, even after immersion in water for 60 min. Vital staining dyes, such as 4 -Di- 2 -Asp and Nile red, administered p. o., were delivered into the gastrointestinal tract where they were digested and secreted. Subsequently, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study of oral administration of <b>felbinac</b> and confirmed that it was successfully delivered into the blood of zebrafish. This indicates that chemicals administered using gluten granules are satisfactorily absorbed from the digestive tract and delivered into the metabolic system. The absorption, distribution, and pharmacokinetics of chemicals given by oral administration were also compared with those of chemicals given by alternative administration routes such as intraperitoneal injection and exposure to chemical solution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background External {{medication}} that is absorbed percutaneously {{may be used}} to reduce inflammation and relieve pain from acute injuries such as ankle sprains and bruises. The plaster method of percutaneous absorption for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was established in Japan in 1988. However, due to the possibility of a placebo effect, the efficacy of this method remains unclear. This experimental study was conducted to control for the placebo effect and to study the efficacy of the plaster method in relieving pain by using a rat model of inflammation. Methods Male Wistar-Imamichi rats were used. A yeast suspension was injected into the right hind paw to induce inflammation. A sheet (2. 0 × 1. 75 cm) containing the drug was adhered to the inflamed paw. Five treatment groups were used, and each sheet contained a single drug: loxoprofen sodium (loxoprofen-Na) (2. 5 mg); <b>felbinac</b> (1. 75 mg); indomethacin (1. 75 mg); ketoprofen (0. 75 mg); or base only (control, 0 mg). Mechanical pain threshold, expression of c-Fos in the dorsal horn, and amount of prostaglandin (PG) E 2 in the inflamed paw were evaluated. Results Pain threshold increased after treatment, and was significantly increased in the loxoprofen-Na group compared with the control group (p 2 were significantly decreased in the loxoprofen-Na and indomethacin groups compared with the control group (p p Conclusion Percutaneously absorbed NSAIDs have an analgesic effect, inhibit expression of c-Fos in the dorsal horn, and reduce PGE 2 in inflamed tissue, indicating the efficacy of this method of administration for acute inflammation and localized pain. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in acute and chronic pain conditions. DESIGN: Quantitative systematic review of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: 86 trials involving 10, 160 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures of treatment success approximating at least 50 % reduction in pain, local and systemic adverse effects. Analysis at 1 week for acute and 2 weeks for chronic conditions with relative benefit and number needed to treat. RESULTS: In acute pain conditions (soft tissue trauma, strains, and sprains) placebo controlled trials had a relative benefit of 1. 7 (1. 5 to 1. 9), the number needed to treat was 3. 9 (3. 4 to 4. 4). With analysis by drug (at least three trials), ketoprofen (number needed to treat 2. 6), <b>felbinac</b> (3. 0), ibuprofen (3. 5), and piroxicam (4. 2) had significant efficacy. Benzydamine and indomethacin were no different from placebo. In chronic pain conditions (osteoarthritis, tendinitis) placebo controlled trials had a relative benefit of 2. 0 (1. 5 to 2. 7); the number needed to treat was 3. 1 (2. 7 to 3. 8). Small trials (< 40 treated patients) exaggerated effectiveness of topical non-steroidals by 33 % in acute conditions but not in chronic conditions. There was no relation between trial quality and treatment effect. In both acute and chronic pain local and systemic adverse events and withdrawal from the study related to the drug had a low incidence and were no different from placebo. CONCLUSION: Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in relieving pain in acute and chronic conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the correlation between}} an in vivo isobologram based on the concentrations of new quinolones (NQs) in brain tissue and the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the occurrence of convulsions in mice and an in vitro isobologram based on the concentrations of both drugs {{for changes in the}} γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -induced current response in Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA from mouse brains in the presence of NQs and/or NSAIDs. After the administration of enoxacin (ENX) in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>felbinac</b> (FLB), ketoprofen (KTP), or flurbiprofen (FRP), a synergistic effect was observed in the isobologram based on the threshold concentration in brain tissue between mice with convulsions and those without convulsions. The three NSAIDs did not affect the pharmacokinetic behavior of ENX in the brain. However, the ENX-induced inhibition of the GABA response in the GABAA receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes was enhanced in the presence of the three NSAIDs. The inhibition ratio profiles of the GABA responses for both drugs were analyzed with a newly developed toxicodynamic model. The inhibitory profiles for ENX in the presence of NSAIDs followed the order KTP (1. 2 μM) > FRP (0. 3 μM) > FLB (0. 2 μM). These were 50 - to 280 -fold smaller than those observed in the absence of NSAIDs. The inhibition ratio (0. 01 to 0. 02) of the GABAA receptor in the presence of both drugs was well-fitted to the isobologram based on threshold concentrations of both drugs in brain tissue between mice with convulsions and those without convulsions, despite the presence of NSAIDs. In mice with convulsions, the inhibitory profiles of the threshold concentrations of both drugs in brain tissue of mice with convulsions and those without convulsions can be predicted quantitatively by using in vitro GABA response data and toxicodynamic model...|$|E
