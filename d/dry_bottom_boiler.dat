50|$|A Wet-bottom furnace or wet-bottom boiler is boiler that {{contains}} a wet bottom furnace. It {{is a kind of}} boiler used for pulverised fuel firing.In wet bottom boiler the bottom ash is kept in a molten state and tapped off as a liquid. Wet bottom boiler slag is the molten condition ash as it is drawn {{from the bottom of the}} slag-tap or cyclone furnaces.An advantage is the fact that the end product in this process has a higher value compared to that of a <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>boiler.</b> Wet bottom boilers are preferred for low volatile coals that produce a lot of ash. But it has higher investment costs and higher maintenance costs, so it is built less often.|$|E

Fly ashes for chemical analysis, phase analysis and colour measurements were sampled from the four sections of electrostatic fly ash precipitator. Colour parameters indicate relationships with concentrations of elements which are preferentially bound in silicate matrix.

40|$|Coal is {{a crucial}} {{feedstock}} for South Africa’s unique synfuels and petrochemicals industry and it is used by Sasol as a feedstock to produce synthesis gas (CO and H 2) via the Sasol-Lurgi fixed bed <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> gasification process. A detailed knowledge of coal characteristics is essential to predict gasification behavior when a specific coal source is to be gasified. The principle aim {{of this paper is}} to highlight and discuss those specific coal characteristics, which affect gasification behavior and stability. In order to determine the suitability of a coal source for gasification purposes, the coal is characterized and the results compared with historical data. Benchmark data, obtained when the gasifiers are operating without problems and with relatively high stability, is used as a reference. Coal from sources with extreme properties (e. g. ash content < 10 % to as high as 35 % or “brown coal ” with moisture content of approximately 30 %) can be gasified in a Sasol-Lurgi fixed bed <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> gasifier provided that certain operational changes are implemented. Other properties, like high caking propensity for example, require blending to acceptable levels and /or mechanical modifications. The coal characteristics discussed in this paper are not the only properties affecting gasifier stability, but are those properties which are easily measurable on laboratory scale and can be related to gasifier performance. Interpretation of coal characterization data gives an indication of expected gasifier performance, and the suitability of a specific coal source for Sasol/Lurgi Fixed Bed Gasification. Data on a number of coal sources will be discussed. Keywords: Sasol-Lurgi fixed bed <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> gasification, coal characteristics, South African coal sources, other feedstocks. 1...|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS) {{and magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) are used to measure water uptake in nylon 6 films. Based on the EIS data the uptake process is split into three stages. At first, during the first 3 h, the spectrum is mainly capacitive due to the <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> part of the film. The existence of a <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> part is confirmed by the MRI measurements. In the second stage EIS shows that small traces of water reach the substrate, whereas MRI still not detects water at the nylon/substrate interface. This demonstrates the sensitivity of EIS as water at the substrate is detected by EIS before MRI {{is able to do}} so. The last stage starts as the waterfront reaches the substrate and the amount of water in the nylon at the substrate increases. MRI shows that the bulk of the water ingresses into the nylon film as a sharp front. A simple capacitance model is able to link this ingressing front to the impedance as measured with EIS at high frequency. The detection of water breakthrough and interface processes by EIS illustrates the complementarity of the techniques. EIS is able to detect small traces of moisture reaching the substrate before the bulk amount of water does. MRI gives a better view on the overall water distribution during uptake. [...] -...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} mineral {{sequestration}} {{of carbon dioxide}} in circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) <b>boiler</b> <b>bottom</b> ash. CFBC bottom ash, which originated from two sources, was prepared along with pulverized coal-fired (PC) <b>boiler</b> <b>bottom</b> ash as a control. These ashes were exposed to accelerated carbonation conditions at a relative humidity of 40 % and 100 %, in order to investigate the effects of humidity on the carbonation kinetics of the bottom ash. The obtained results showed that not only lime but other calcium-bearing phases (gehlenite, wollastonite, and brownmillerite) in CFBC bottom ash participated in the mineral carbonation reaction. In particular, these phases underwent hydration in a wet carbonation environment, whereby the carbon dioxide uptake and capacity of CFBC bottom ash are significantly enhanced. This study may have important implications, demonstrating the feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration and recycling of CFBC <b>boiler</b> <b>bottom</b> ash...|$|R

Coal particle size distribution and coal composition are considered as hard-to-control variables during normal operation. The paper discusses the application of statistical robustness studies as a method for determining the optimal settings of process variables that might be hard to control during normal operation. Several dual response surface strategies are evaluated for determining the optimal process variable conditions. It is shown that a narrower particle size distribution is optimal for maximizing gasification performance which is robust against the variability in coal composition.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{cost-effective}} method {{was applied for}} the synthesis of zeolite composites utilising wet <b>bottom</b> <b>boiler</b> slag from the Bulgarian coal-fired thermal power plant “Sviloza”, {{near the town of}} Svishtov. The method consisted of a prolonged alkali treatment at room temperature of this waste. Experimental techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction analyses, are employed to characterize the initial slag and the final products with respect to their morphology, and elemental and mineral compositions. The composites synthesized in this way contained two Na-type zeolite phases: zeolite X (type FAU) and zeolite Linde F (type EDI). The zeolited products and the starting slag were tested as adsorbents for a textile dye (Malachite Green) from aqueous solutions. In comparison with the initial slag, the zeolite composite possessed substantially better adsorption properties: it almost completely adsorbs the dye in much shorter times. The results of this investigations revealed a new, easy and low cost route for recycling boiler slag into a material with good adsorption characteristics, which could find different applications, e. g., for purifying polluted waters, including those from the textile industry...|$|R

40|$|The Sasol-Lurgi {{fixed bed}} <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> {{gasification}} technology has the biggest {{market share in}} the world with 101 gasifiers in operation. To be able to further improve the technology and also to optimise the operating plants, {{it is important that the}} fundamentals of the process are understood. The main objective of this study was to determine the reaction zones occurring in the Sasol-Lurgi fixed bed <b>dry</b> <b>bottom</b> (S-L FBDB) gasifier operating on North Dakota lignite. A Turn-Out sampling method and subsequent chemical analyses of the gasifier fuel bed samples was used to determine the reaction zones occurring in the commercial MK IV, S-L FBDB gasifier operating on North Dakota lignite. The reaction zones were further compared with the same reactor operating on bituminous coal. Based on the results obtained from this study it was found that about two thirds of the gasifier volume was used for drying and de-volatilising the lignite thus leaving only about a third of the reactor volume for gasification and combustion. Nonetheless, due to the high reactivity of the lignite, the char was consumed within a third of the remaining gasifier volume. Clear overlaps between the reaction zones were observed in the gasifiers thus confirming the gradual transition from one reaction zone to another as reported in literature. Due to the high moisture content in the lignite, the pyrolysis zone in the gasifiers operating on North Dakota lignite occurred lower/deeper in the gasifier fuel bed as compared to the same gasifier operating on South African bituminous coal from the Highveld coalfield. All the other reaction zones in the gasifier operating on bituminous coal were also higher in the bed compared to the lignite operation. This can therefore explain the higher gas outlet temperatures for the S-L FBDB gasifiers operating on higher rank coals when compared to the gasifiers operating on lignite. The fact that the entire reactor volume was utilized for drying, de-volatilisation, gasification and combustion with carbon conversion of > 98 % makes the S-L FBDB gasifier very suitable for lignite gasification.
