40|$|For a {{video-on-demand}} {{computer system}} we propose a scheme which balances the {{load on the}} disks, thereby helping to solve a performance problem crucial to achieving maximal video throughput.

50|$|OS/360, officially {{known as}} IBM System/360 Operating System, is a {{discontinued}} batch processing operating system developed by IBM for their then-new System/360 mainframe computer, announced in 1964; it was {{heavily influenced by}} the earlier IBSYS/IBJOB and Input/Output Control System (IOCS) packages.

50|$|A {{record is}} a series of related data fields, such as the name, address, {{identification}} number and salary of a single employee, in which each field is encoded and mapped to a contiguous string of bytes. Early computers had limited input and output capabilities, typically in the form of stacks of 80 column punched cards or in the form of paper or magnetic tapes. Application records, such as employee data records, were sequentially read or written a record at a time and processed in batches. When <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> became available, programming languages added ways for programs to randomly access records one at a time, such as access by the values of key fields or by the position of a record in a file. All of the records in a file can be of the same format (as in a payroll file) or of varying formats (as in an event log). Some files are read-only in that their records, once written to the file, can only be read, while other files allow their records to be updated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-A throughput-driven {{approach}} to the performance analysis of <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> (DASD's), i. e., disks, is presented for {{a model of a}} block-multiplexor channel system with multiple transfer paths. The approach relies on a step-wise analysis of shared components within the data transfer path: head of string, control unit, channel, referred to as blocking points. In order to derive the service time of an I/O request, each blocking point is analyzed separately, using essentially a classical loss-system model. The advantages of the method are its relative simplicity and applicability to a large number of configurations. Transient and boundary effects, including the miss probability on second and subsequent reconnection attempts, and the device reconnection window (lead time), are also discussed. The inclusion of the approach in a larger system model, as well as its relationship with previous work on DASD analysis is considered. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the method.

5000|$|IBM's 1964 System/360 {{introduced}} {{their new}} self-formatting variable-length record format for their S/360 mainframes wherein each record had an optional variable length key field and a variable length data field. IBM mainframe disk, drum and mass <b>storage</b> <b>devices,</b> called <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> (DASD) are addressed using a six byte seek address for seek commands and a five byte CCHHR for search count commands. OS/360 and other S/360 operating systems used an 8-byte address structured as MBBCCHHR (Extent (M)-Bin (BB)-Cylinder (CC)-Head (HH)-Record (R), which {{was capable of}} storing records of varying size, up to 255 such records per track, with the zeroth record (R0) being reserved for certain error correction information, such as [...] "skip defects"). In addition to data, records could also contain a key. The length of the key, like {{the length of the}} data, was specified by the application writing the record. In addition to addressing records by number, it was possible to search disks by key, using the underlying count key data (CKD) structure. The term [...] "fixed-block architecture" [...] was created by IBM in 1979 to distinguish this format from its variable-length record format. Fixed-block architecture was adopted for a few mainframe HDDs produced by IBM beginning in the 1970s, and contemporary DASD systems continue to support 3310 and 3370 compatibility. MVS continues to require CKD DASD, although by the 1990s all new IBM HDDs used fixed sectors internally. IBM's various FBA disks had block sizes of 100 or 200 characters, and 270,366, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096 bytes.|$|R

IBM's System 360 operating system addressed the 2321 as a direct access storage devices, i.e., a disk drive, with a 6-byte seek address of the form ØBBSCH (hexadecimal) where the first byte is zero and the remaining bytes address the Bin (i.e., cell), Bin (i.e., sub-cell), Strip, Cylinder and Head.|$|E
40|$|System {{software}} overheads in the I/O path, including VFS {{and file}} system code, become more pronounced with emerging low-latency <b>storage</b> <b>devices.</b> Currently, these overheads constitute the main bottleneck in the I/O path and they limit efficiency of modern storage systems. In this paper {{we present a}} taxonomy of the current state-of-the-art systems on accelerating <b>accesses</b> to fast <b>storage</b> <b>devices.</b> Furthermore, we present Iris, a new I/O path for applications, that minimizes overheads from system software in the common I/O path. The main idea is {{the separation of the}} control and data planes. The control plane consists of an unmodified Linux kernel and is responsible for handling data plane initialization and the normal processing path through the kernel for non-file related operations. The data plane is a lightweight mechanism to provide <b>direct</b> <b>access</b> to <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> with minimum overheads and without sacrificing strong protection semantics. Iris requires neither hardware support from the <b>storage</b> <b>devices</b> nor changes in user applications. We evaluate our early prototype and we find that it achieves on a single core up to 1 : 7 and 2 : 2 better read and write random IOPS, respectively, compared to the XFS and EXT 4 file systems. It also scales with the number of cores; using 4 cores Iris achieves 1 : 84 and 1 : 96 better read and write random IOPS, respectively. In sequential reads we provide similar performance and in sequential writes we are about 20 % better compared to other file systems...|$|R
