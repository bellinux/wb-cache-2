5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|TK is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} {{who wears a}} large bandanna over his eyes and tends to break out in dance every so often. No one knows his real name or past. <b>He</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> semi-nonsensical English phrases depending on the situation, mainly quoted from pop culture, but apparently does not know English fluently. He saves the team many times and does know some Japanese but rarely speaks it. He carries Browning Hi-Power and LAR Grizzly handguns or a PP-19 Bizon submachine gun during missions.|$|E
25|$|Cruyff {{suffered}} a heart attack (like his father who {{died of a heart attack}} when he was 12) in his early forties. He used to smoke 20 cigarettes a day prior to undergoing double heart bypass surgery in 1991 while he was the coach of Barcelona. Cruyff was forced to immediately give up smoking, and he made an anti-smoking advertisement for the Catalan Department of Health. In the TV spot, Cruyff is dressed like a manager in a long trench coat combined with collared shirt and tie. He juggled a cigarette pack 16 times – using feet, thighs, chest, shoulder, and head like holding up a ball – before volleying it away. Throughout the commercial <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> Catalan about the dangers of smoking.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} and specific source for his romances are uncertain. <b>He</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> the vaguest {{way of the}} materials he used, and though Celtic influence is detectable in the stories, {{there is no direct}} evidence that he had Celtic written sources. Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned Erec, Lancelot, Gornemant and many others who {{play an important role in}} Chrétien's narratives. One is left to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore that goes back to a Celtic source in the case of Béroul, an Anglo-Norman who wrote around 1150. However, Chrétien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his own day. And Chrétien's five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French chivalry. Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chrétien was influenced by the changing face of secular and canonical law in the 12th century. This is particularly relevant for his Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chrétien's day.|$|E
25|$|Tibullus's {{first book}} {{consists}} of poems written {{at various times}} between 30 and 26. His first love, the subject of book i., is called Delia in the poems, but Apuleius (Apol. 10) reveals that her real name was Plania. As regards her station, it should be noticed {{that she was not}} entitled to wear the stola, the dress of Roman matrons (i. 6, 68). Her husband is mentioned as absent (i. 2, 67 seq.). She eludes the custodes placed over her (i. 2, 15 and 6, 7). Tibullus's suit was favoured by Delia's mother, of whom <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> very affectionate terms (i. 6, 57 seq.). For Tibullus's illness at Corcyra, see i. 3, I seq., 55 seq. The fifth elegy was written during estrangement (discidium), and the sixth after the return of the husband and during Delia's double infidelity. It is impossible to give an exact account of the intimacy. The poems which refer to her are arranged in no chronological order. Sometimes she appears as single, sometimes as married; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband's death. Yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in Cilicia which gave Tibullus the opportunity to see her, and he continued to do so when the husband returned. Delia was clever in deception—too clever, as Tibullus saw when he found that he was not the only lover. His entreaties and appeals were of no avail; and after the first book no more is heard of Delia. In addition, several elegies in Book I concern themselves with Tibullus's love for a boy, who is named Marathus.|$|E

500|$|When Zhou is vocalized in [...] "Yangzhou storytelling", <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Square mouth public talk", {{which is}} a manner of {{speaking}} reserved for martial heroes, highly respected characters, or, sometimes, lesser characters that pretend to be an important hero. Square mouth public talk is actually a mixture of two forms of dialogue: Fangkou and Guanbai. Fangkou (square mouth) is a manner of steady, yet forceful over pronunciation of dialogue that was possibly influenced by Northern Chinese opera. Guanbai (public talk) is monologue and dialogue that is sometimes used for [...] "imposing heroes". This mixture of styles means Zhou Tong is treated as a highly regarded hero.|$|E
500|$|The American {{journalist}} George Thayer, who {{met with}} Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being [...] "blonde and balding", with [...] "cold, evasive eyes". Thayer stated that Tyndall [...] "had not the slightest spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous, and excitable, and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court." [...] In {{his study of the}} National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off [...] "an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control". Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as [...] "a rather small man with a hard, unlined face and pale blue eyes. His movements are abrupt and energetic, and <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> a loud voice with a clipped inflection." [...] Walker described him as having a [...] "keen political mind", with a [...] "concern for organisation [...] meticulous planning".|$|E
500|$|Approximately thirty parables form {{about one}} third of Jesus' {{recorded}} teachings. The parables appear within longer sermons and at {{other places in the}} narrative. They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the spiritual. Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression. Some of his parables, such as the Prodigal Son (...) , are relatively simple, while others, such as the Growing Seed (...) , are sophisticated, profound and abstruse. When asked by his disciples about why <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> parables to the people, Jesus replies that the chosen disciples have been given to [...] "know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven", unlike the rest of their people, [...] "For the one who has will be given more and he will have in abundance. But the one who does not have will be deprived even more.", going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown [...] "dull hearts" [...] and thus are unable to understand (...)

Parthiban, was ranked at number 8 in the magazine's {{list of the}} 13 Cheesiest, Chalkiest Lines in Indian Cinema. In April 2012, Rediff.com included the film in its list The A to Z of Tamil Cinema. In a January 2015 interview with The Times of India, playwright Y. G. Mahendra said, [...] "most character artists today lack variety [...] Show me one actor in India currently who can do a Kattabomman, a VOC, a Vietnam Veedu, a Galatta Kalyanam and a Thiruvilayadal." [...] Actor Rana Daggubati, {{in an interview with}} Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu, said that Ganesan's performances as Kattabomman and Karna (in the 1964 film Karnan) served as inspirations for his role in [...] (2015). The scene between Ganesan and Parthiban was later featured in the 2016 film Jackson Durai, which was titled after Parthiban's character. M. Sasikumar's Balle Vellaiyathevaa, released in the same year, was named after a dialogue uttered by Ganesan's character.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the book when Cal discusses his family's history and actions prior to his birth, <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> an androgynous voice, with limited omniscience; he acknowledges that he is fabricating some of the details. John Mullan, University College London's professor of English and a contributor to The Guardian, wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters' thoughts, Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction. In the novel's closing pages, Cal provides minute details about his father's dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother. Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male, his identity is not confined by his own body. According to Mullan, this [...] "mobility of identification becomes a narrative principle" [...] and is thoroughly exploited in Middlesex. The novel follows the principle that people are molded by events prior to their birth, and Eugenides explores a character's prenatal life in terms of his or her genes; the narrator is, however, subject to the principle that whatever he does not know is of his imagination. As such, contradictory statements highlight the unreliable nature of Cal's narration. While narrating the story that pre-dates his birth, he remarks, [...] "Of course, a narrator in my position (prefetal at the time) can't be entirely sure about any of this." [...] However, he later says, [...] "I alone, from the private box of my primordial egg, saw what was going on." [...] Cal's dubious omniscience, doubtful narration, and parodies combine to show that his unreliability is an act of mischief.|$|E

2500|$|Plato never {{presents}} {{himself as}} a participant {{in any of the}} dialogues, and {{with the exception of the}} Apology, there is no suggestion that he heard any of the dialogues firsthand.

2500|$|Many of Zinzendorf's {{beliefs and}} acts were based upon his father's words: “I live no more; {{he lives in}} me. I speak no more; <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>in</b> me.

An engraving complete with his portrait states that one can see the departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words Gebrochne Augen(broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.|$|E
