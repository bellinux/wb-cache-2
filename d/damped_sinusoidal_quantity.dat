The most of them are damped and oscillated. The impedance is a popular feature in power system, and it has been widely used in relay protection and fault location. So the impedance calculation based on the <b>damped</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> signal have been the important way to diagnosis the fault, locate the fault and so on. But the methods used now are based on the fundamental impedance calculation theory, lacking theoretical basis. In fact, the traditional methods for fundamental signal calculation are not appropriate for the quantitative analysis of <b>damped</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> signal. The paper analyzed the impedance calculation based on <b>damped</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> signal, combined the features of <b>damped</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> signals and the traditional impedance calculation method. The two typical signal analysis methods for <b>damped</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> signal extraction are used to calculate the accurate impedance based on the different extraction results.

The Laplace wavelet correlation filtering is introduced to decompose piezoelectrical signals into impulse responses of single mode subsystems [2], followed by a Least Square Estimator to fit PA signal and estimate parameters of the exponentially <b>damped</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> model [3]. Good agreement between the fitting model and the PA signal is obtained.
