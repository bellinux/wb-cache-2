25|$|On 5 September 2006, Huntley {{was found}} {{unconscious}} in his prison cell and {{thought to have}} taken an overdose. He had previously taken an overdose of antidepressants in prison in June 2003 while awaiting his trial. He was under police guard in hospital for two days, before being returned to Wakefield prison, prompting much reaction from many present at the scene, as well as making {{the front pages of}} many of the UK newspapers the next morning. Following this attempted suicide, his cell was cleared and a tape was found which was marked with Queen on one side and Meat Loaf on the other. This tape is thought to contain confessions from Huntley on what he did and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> It is believed that Huntley made the tape in return for antidepressants from a fellow prisoner, who hoped to obtain and later sell the confession to the media after his release. On 28 March 2007, The Sun began publishing transcripts of Huntley's taped confession.|$|E

"'Imagine {{that you}} are on a street with houses marked 1 through [...] There is a house in between (...) such that {{the sum of the}} house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right. If [...] is between 50 and 500, what are [...] and ?' This is a bivariate problem with {{multiple}} solutions. Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a continued fraction. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems. [...] Mahalanobis was astounded and asked <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> 'It is simple. The minute I heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Drake stated that his debut album will be [...] "a solid hip hop album" [...] and musically distinct from his So Far Gone mixtape, which received negative comparisons to Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak (2008). He {{expressed a desire to}} work with André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Sade for the album. In {{an interview}} for MTV, Drake cited Nas and André 3000 as influences for parts of Thank Me Later, stating [...] "Nas was somebody that I used to listen to his raps and never understood <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> I always wanted to understand how he painted those pictures and his bar structure. I went back and really studied Nas and André 3000 and then came back with this album". In comparing the album to his previous work, he stated [...] "It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna sound happier. More victorious, 'cause that's where I'm at in my life". He told Entertainment Weekly that, [...] "I didn't make this album for commercial purposes. A lot of the verses are extremely long. I just made it to share with people. I hope they can enjoy".|$|E

500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} enthusiastic. The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Taylor found the protagonist [...] "a little too credulous." [...] She also found McEwan's [...] "wilful {{narrative}} sadism" [...] sadly {{missing from the}} work. The review in The Economist was even more scathing: referring to Sweet Tooth as [...] "not Mr McEwan's finest book", the reviewer concluded that by the end, [...] "it is hard to feel much of anything for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth." [...] James Lasdun of The Guardian {{found that there were}} [...] "momentous political questions" [...] raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, [...] "to what end?" [...] Particularly the ending of the book was polarising. Kellaway saw it as [...] "a good excuse {{to go back to the}} beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending [...] "might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it...</b> it made me want to throw the book out the window." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1906, Hirst {{completed}} an unprecedented double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. Cricket writer A. A. Thomson noted that both milestones were unusual individually, {{and that such}} all-round achievements had only been matched in scope by those of W. G. Grace in the 1870s. No other cricketer has come close to matching this particular double. Hirst reached the 1,000 run–100 wicket double {{by the end of}} June, two weeks faster {{than anyone else in the}} history of first-class cricket. In total he scored 2,385 first-class runs at an average of 45.86 and took 208 wickets at 16.50. Hirst's contributions were particularly important in a close race for the County Championship. Kent were eventual champions after Yorkshire lost a close game to Gloucestershire, but Hirst performed well in the two matches against Kent. He scored a century and took 11 wickets as Yorkshire won the first, and took eight wickets and scored a match-saving 93 in the drawn second encounter. Against the other title contenders, Lancashire and Surrey, he was likewise successful with both bat and ball, earning praise from The Times and Wisden for his batting under difficult circumstances in these matches. His captain, Lord Hawke, said [...] "It was not only what Georgie Hirst did but <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> coming off [...] when an effort seemed most necessary and playing his best against the more formidable sides." [...] He scored six centuries, two of which came in a record-equalling performance against Somerset. He scored 111 and 117 not out when batting and took six for 70 and five for 45 with the ball. He became only the second man after Bernard Bosanquet to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in the same first-class match; as of 2015, only one other man, Franklyn Stephenson in 1988, has achieved the feat. Battling a knee injury and exhaustion towards the end of the season, it became increasingly difficult for Hirst to perform. Hirst took his 200th wicket at the end of August and commented that, were his feat to be duplicated in future, [...] "whoever does will be very tired". He also commented that his injuries only troubled him once the season was over and it [...] "was a triumph of spirit over matter".|$|E
2500|$|Brian Bishop, a British POW {{interviewed by}} Walters, {{while he did}} not claim to know Avey, stated [...] "I can’t {{understand}} <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> To {{do something like that}} you need to have several people helping on both sides — our side and the Jewish side." [...] Similar doubt about the feat was expressed by Ron Jones, another British POW, who also found {{it hard to believe that}} Avey, a tall, fit, strong Englishman, could have passed himself off alongside [...] "starving six-stone Jews." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 4, 2009, Ackerman criticized SEC Officials {{over the}} {{handling}} of tips given {{to them about the}} Bernie Madoff scandal. Ackerman believed that he was reflecting the public's opinion, saying: [...] "How are they supposed to have confidence that if somebody goes to you with a complaint—gives it to you on a silver platter with all the investigations, with all the numbers, with all of the data, telling you exactly what he did, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and why he did it and how he knows that—and after a period after half a dozen or eight years, you don't know anything?" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} his {{shortened}} playing career, Bossy had impressive numbers. He scored 573 {{goals and}} 553 assists in only 752 games. In 129 playoff games, he had eighty-five goals and seventy-five assists. When he retired, he held the record for most goals per season average with 57.3. While he wanted to be considered a great overall player, he was basically known for his impressive scoring output. Even he did not completely understand <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> As he was quoted as saying by Stan Fischler in The All-New Hockey's 100, [...] "About 90 percent of the time I don't aim: I just try to get my shot away as quick as possible as a surprise element. I just try to get the puck on net." ...|$|E

When it is repeated a second time, Brookfield tells him that he cannot tell what cards he has if Ellinger doesn't look at them.

Brainiac manages to free himself from Luthor's control, forcing him on board the ship, and the two make their escape. The two are later shown to have entered into an alliance, with Brainiac promising Luthor the Earth when he is done with it. While reading newspapers {{to catch up on}} what happened during his imprisonment, Luthor learns of the resurrection of Superboy. Lex quickly returns to Smallville, where it is revealed that his physically and mentally handicapped sister Lena Luthor is still alive, and living with her daughter Lori. In an effort to mockingly prove his abilities to Superboy, Lex agrees to cure his sister's illness. With Superboy's aid, Luthor manages to cure Lena, allowing her to walk and think logically again for a brief moment, before he then quickly reverses the process, leaving Lena completely catatonic, and informs Superboy that so long as Superman is alive, he will never reveal <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> Luthor escapes with Brainiac, leaving Superboy, Lori, and Krypto horrified at his cruelty. Because Luthor now sees Superboy as a failed experiment of using the [...] "wrong alien DNA", he and Brainiac create another binary clone with their own genetics for another plan against the entire House of El.|$|E
