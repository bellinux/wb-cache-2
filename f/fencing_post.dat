25|$|Midway {{through the}} 1975 F1 season, Penske {{abandoned}} the troublesome PC1 and started using the March 751. Donohue recently {{had arrived in}} Austria for the Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring race track following the successful closed-course speed record attempt at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama {{just a few days}} earlier. During a practice session for the race, Donohue lost control of his March after a tire failed, sending him careening into the catch fencing at the fastest corner on the track, Vöest Hügel Kurve. A track marshal was killed by debris from the accident, but Donohue {{did not appear to be}} injured significantly. It is said that Donohue's head struck either a catch <b>fencing</b> <b>post</b> or the bottom of the wood frame for an advertising billboard located alongside of the racetrack. A headache resulted, however, and worsened. After going to the hospital of Graz the next day, Donohue lapsed into a coma from a cerebral hemorrhage and died. He was survived by his wife and two sons from his first marriage. Donohue is buried at St. Teresa Cemetery in Summit, New Jersey.|$|E

40|$|Rice husks fibre {{reinforced}} polypropylene composite (rhfrpc) {{is a natural}} plant fibre reinforced polymer composite having advantages of high strength, light weight and affordability. They are commonly used for light load structural and non structural applications. They are mainly used as particle boards, for <b>fencing</b> <b>post,</b> roofing tiles, for interiors of car and aircrafts among other usages. This material once cracked by impact forces cannot be repaired using traditional repair methods for engineering materials such as metals or other composites that can be repaired by welding or by patch repair methods respectively, thus a method of repair of rice husks fibre {{reinforced polypropylene}} composites by refilling the damaged volume by injection of various healing agents has been investigated. The composite coupons were produced by injection moulding, cooled sufficiently and prepared for charpy impact tests. Test results for pristine coupons were a maximum of 48 J/mm 2. The destroyed coupons were then subjected to healing in a fabricated healing fixture. Healing agents such as epoxy resin, ethyl cyanoacrylate, and tannin gum have been investigated for their use as possible healing agents to fill the damaged volume and perform healing action at the fractured surfaces. The impact test results were recorded and {{compared with those of}} unhealed pristine coupons. The recovered strengths were a maximum of 60 J/mm 2 translating into a 125 % impact strength recovery, and this is good enough for the healed composites to be recommended for reuse in their second lives of their respective original functions...|$|E

40|$|Historic {{concrete}} <b>fence</b> <b>posts</b> {{were created}} {{in the early twentieth}} century. This study examined how they were constructed and who constructed them.

Literature sources indicate that farmers were encouraged to construct concrete posts on their own. The survey also points to the idea that historic concrete <b>fence</b> <b>posts</b> were created by the farmers who used them. While commercially manufactured posts exist in Randolph county, they are from a later date, and thus not the focus of this study. Interviews with members off the farming community also indicate that most farmers built their own concrete <b>fence</b> <b>posts,</b> from molds they also made. While many businesses and colleges promoted the use and construction of concrete <b>fence</b> <b>posts,</b> they were individually made to serve farmers' immediate and long term fencing needs.

50|$|The device {{works by}} using infra-red {{light-emitting}} diode (LED) lamps on a <b>fence</b> <b>post</b> to create a field of light. This field of light reflects from retroreflective material on another <b>fence</b> <b>post,</b> much like that used on roads and highway signs, and bounces back to its source. This field of light is monitored by charge-coupled devices (CCDs) {{similar to the ones}} used in consumer digital cameras. These cameras are situated on both <b>fence</b> <b>posts</b> and detect shadows in the light between the posts. Once an insect is detected, a non-lethal laser is fired at it. This non-lethal laser is used to determine the size of the insect, and the frequency at which its wings are beating.|$|R
