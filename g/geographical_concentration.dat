60|$|There is an {{attitude}} for which {{my friends and}} I were {{for a long period}} rebuked and even reviled; and of which at the present period we are less likely than ever to repent. It was always called Anti-Semitism; but it was always much more true to call it Zionism. At any rate it was much nearer {{to the nature of the}} thing to call it Zionism, whether or no it can find its <b>geographical</b> <b>concentration</b> in Zion. The substance of this heresy was exceedingly simple. It consisted entirely in saying that Jews are Jews; and as a logical consequence that they are not Russians or Roumanians or Italians or Frenchmen or Englishmen. During the war the newspapers commonly referred to them as Russians; but the ritual wore so singularly thin that I remember one newspaper paragraph saying that the Russians in the East End complained of the food regulations, because their religion forbade them to eat pork. My own brief contact with the Greek priests of the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem did not permit me to discover any trace of this detail of their discipline; and even the Russian pilgrims were said to be equally negligent in the matter. The point for the moment, however, is that if I was violently opposed to anything, it was not to Jews, but to that sort of remark about Jews; or rather to the silly and craven fear of making it a remark about Jews. But my friends and I had in some general sense a policy in the matter; and it was in substance the desire to give Jews the dignity and status of a separate nation. We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} test a large set of {{childhood}} leukaemia and lymphoma registrations {{for the presence of}} short radius spacial clusters. DESIGN [...] The study was a geographical cluster analysis. SETTING [...] England, Wales and Scotland. PATIENTS [...] All registrations for leukaemia and lymphoma between 1966 and 1983 in children aged 0 to 14 years were examined. The records included date and age of registration, sex, diagnosis, and the map reference of the postcode of residence. Of the 9411 registrations, 8888 were suitable for inclusion. MAIN RESULTS [...] There was a significant excess of case pair addresses separated by < 0. 5 km. There was also a significant excess of pairs sharing the same postcode. Both findings were based upon comparison with random pairs of postcodes drawn from the Central Postcode Directory. Examination for clustering at this very short range was based upon a clear prior hypothesis derived from the results of a study of space-time interaction, reported in a companion paper. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is postulated that the space-time interaction and the <b>geographical</b> <b>concentrations</b> shown here result from a common epidemic process. The epidemiology of this disease is characterised by short range <b>geographical</b> <b>concentrations,</b> with temporal non-homogeneity superimposed. The findings exclude certain artefacts which remained unresolved in the space-time interaction study. The distributions almost certainly reflect biological processes, and the most probable explanation is in terms of an infective process...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{conclusions}} on {{the limits}} of the Leucobryaceae and on the function of the Leucobryaceous leaf are used as basis for further observations on evolution of the group. Eight genera are recognized in the family; 1. Leucobryum, 2. Steyermarkiella, 3. Ochrobryum, 4. Arthrocormus, 5. Schistomitrium, 6. Holomitriopsis, 7. Cladopodanthus, and 8. Octoblepharum. The leaf form, capsule shape, and peristome substructure of Leucobryum seems to derive from a Campylopus-type member of the Dicranaceae. Four basic stages are noted in the functional evolution of the family. 1. The stratification of the leaf into leucocysts and chlorocyst layers with leucocysts holding water and internally generated gas; 2. The shift from soil substrates seen mostly in Temperate Zone Leucobryum to rotten wood substrates or epiphytism; 3. Increasing reliance on vegetative reproduction with reduction of reliance on sporophytes; 4. Morphogenetic increase of the number of chlorocysts in the leaf. <b>Geographical</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the genera are noted, and distributions between hemispheres are apparently mostly by way of the South Atlantic.

50|$|The initial {{research}} {{focus of}} URENIO concerned the technological development {{of cities and}} regions {{and their ability to}} create environments supporting R&D, human skills, and innovation. Interest in the contribution of technological innovation to urban and regional development peaked after 1980 by economic geography research on industrial districts of central Italy, new industrial spaces in the west coast of the USA, and the planning of large technopoles in Japan. These new forms of agglomeration brought on the surface a series of phenomena with major impact on urban and regional development, such as the <b>geographical</b> <b>concentration</b> of innovation, the role of R&D and innovation in regional competitiveness and growth, the drivers of innovative agglomerations, the new divides and gaps in terms of knowledge and innovation.

As we resolve the paradox of geographical location in a global economy, we may discover how businesses create their competitive advantage.

40|$|Clusters of <b>geographical</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{of related}} {{business}} firms {{are assumed to}} confer competitive advantages to their members and their regions via knowledge management and knowledge spillovers of tacit knowledge. Despite mixed empirical evidence to support these claims, business clusters remain {{at the forefront of}} regional development policies. Past research indicates that cluster success factors may be distinct {{in different parts of the}} world, in different economies and in different stages of their development. Yet most studies focus on the success of a cluster as a whole and do not assess the impact of cluster membership on a single firm due to the absence of commonly agreed metrics. To address this problem, this article shifts the focus from mere spatial proximity to the flow of information in business networks and to the production, dissemination and absorption of knowledge. In this context, information flow in business clusters is aided and abetted by spatial proximity but the flow itself is the important success factor.
