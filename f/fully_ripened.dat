25|$|Some wine journalists {{contend that}} chaptalization allows wine makers to {{sacrifice}} quality {{in favor of}} quantity by letting vines overproduce high yields of grapes that have not <b>fully</b> <b>ripened.</b> Also, winemakers have been using technological advances, such as reverse osmosis to remove water from the unfermented grape juice, thereby increasing its sugar concentration, but decreasing the volume of wine produced.|$|E

2500|$|The {{peculiar}} {{characteristics of}} its fruit {{have made the}} tree well known. [...] This fruit is a globular berry, with variation {{in the number of}} seeds, sometimes with eight and sometimes without any. [...] It bears at its apex the remnants of the styles and sits in the enlarged and persistent calyx. [...] It ripens in late autumn, is pale orange with a red cheek, often covered with a slight glaucous bloom. [...] One joke among Southerners is to induce strangers to taste unripe persimmon fruit, as its very astringent bitterness is shocking to those unfamiliar with it. [...] Folklore states that frost is required to make it edible, but <b>fully</b> <b>ripened</b> fruit lightly shaken from the tree or found on the ground below the tree is sweet, juicy and delicious. [...] The peculiar astringency of the fruit is due to the presence of a tannin similar to that of Cinchona. [...] The seeds were used as buttons during the American Civil War.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the primary}} factors {{influencing}} the ripening process of grapevine is the climate and weather. Sunlight and temperature warmth are vital to the physiological functions of the grapevine (such as photosynthesis). An absence of either, such as long periods of extensive cloud cover, will cause many functions of the vine to slow or even completely halt as the vine enters a type of [...] "survival mode". As the grapevine funnels more resources to preserve its own survival, less resources are directed towards the ripening {{and development of the}} grape clusters. Excessive heat can also cause a grapevine to react adversely. The occurrence of heat waves during the growing season, particularly as it nears harvest, can cause the sugars in grapes to jump as acids fall dramatically. Some winemakers may decide to harvest early in order to maintain acid levels even though other components (such as tannins and phenolic compounds) may not be at optimal ripening. For the winemakers that decide to [...] "wait it out", a lack of acid can be partially rectify during the winemaking process with the addition of acids such as tartaric acid. It is much more difficult to remedy the effects of extensive rains during the ripening period. Steady rains before the harvest can cause the berries to swell with water which dilutes the flavors as well as causing cracking in the skin that creates openings for spoilage causing microorganism to propagate. Because of these risks, the threat of prolong rainfall during a vintage may cause an early harvest before the grapes have <b>fully</b> <b>ripened.</b> The most favorable vintages allow a slow, steady ripening without drastic jumps in heats or the threat of excessive rain fall.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Grapes {{that develop}} {{millerandage}} {{will not have}} seeds, making them smaller and with potentially a higher juice to skin ratio which may be desirable in winemaking. However, these smaller berries may not <b>fully</b> <b>ripen</b> and could potentially add high acid and [...] "green" [...] flavors to the wine.|$|R
25|$|In Argentina, varietal {{examples}} of Douce noir/Bonarda are similarly {{characterized by a}} deep purple color with notes of cassis, fennel, cherry, and dried fig. Wine expert Oz Clarke notes that the grape needs a long growing season and time to <b>fully</b> <b>ripen</b> or the wines will have green, vegetal flavors.|$|R
5000|$|In Summer 2010, {{a limited}} edition version was made, {{combining}} both apple and pear flavours in one and named 'Summer Blend'.

60|$|The {{earliest}} {{attempt in}} {{the execution of}} this design was to set up for Minister a person, in rank indeed respectable, and very ample in fortune; but who, to the moment of this vast and sudden elevation, was little known or considered in the kingdom. To him the whole nation was to yield an immediate and implicit submission. But whether it was from want of firmness to bear up against the first opposition, or that things were not yet <b>fully</b> <b>ripened,</b> or that this method was not found the most eligible, that idea was soon abandoned. The instrumental {{part of the project}} was a little altered, to accommodate it to the time, and to bring things more gradually and more surely to the one great end proposed.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time, if I am able, and if I shall be permitted, I will lend an humble helping hand {{to any other}} good work which is going on. I have not, Sir, the frantic {{presumption}} to suppose that this plan contains in it the whole of what {{the public has a}} right to expect in the great work of reformation they call for. Indeed, it falls infinitely short of it. It falls short even of my own ideas. I have some thoughts, not yet <b>fully</b> <b>ripened,</b> relative to a reform in the customs and excise, as well as in some other branches of financial administration. There are other things, too, which form essential parts in a great plan for the purpose of restoring the independence of Parliament. The contractors' bill of last year it is fit to revive; and I rejoice that it is in better hands than mine. The bill for suspending the votes of custom-house officers, brought into Parliament several years ago by one of our worthiest and wisest members,[45]--would to God we could along with the plan revive the person who designed it! but a man of very real integrity, honor, and ability will be found to take his place, and to carry his idea into full execution. You all see how necessary it is to review our military expenses for some years past, and, if possible, to bind up and close that bleeding artery of profusion; but that business also, I have reason to hope, will be undertaken by abilities that are fully adequate to it. Something must be devised (if possible) to check the ruinous expense of elections.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have seen}} that {{according}} to Labat the vine and wheat require acclimatisation in order {{to succeed in the}} West Indies. Similar facts have been observed at Madras: [...] "two parcels of mignonette-seed, one direct from Europe, the other saved at Bangalore (of which the mean temperature is much below that of Madras), were sown at the same time: they both vegetated equally favourably, but the former all died off a few days after they appeared above ground; the latter still survive, and are vigorous, healthy plants." [...] "So again, turnip and carrot seed saved at Hyderabad are found to answer better at Madras than seed from Europe or from the Cape of Good Hope." [...] (24/77. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1841 page 439.) Mr. J. Scott of the Calcutta Botanic Gardens, informs me that seeds of the sweet-pea (Lathyrus odoratus) imported from England produce plants, with thick, rigid stems and small leaves, which rarely blossom and never yield seed; plants raised from French seed blossom sparingly, but all the flowers are sterile; on the other hand, plants raised from sweet-peas grown near Darjeeling in Upper India, but originally derived from England, can be successfully cultivated on the plains of India; for they flower and seed profusely, and their stems are lax and scandent. In some of the foregoing cases, as Dr. Hooker has remarked to me, the greater success may perhaps be attributed to the seeds having been more <b>fully</b> <b>ripened</b> under a more favourable climate; but this view can hardly be extended to so many cases, including plants, which, from being cultivated under a climate hotter than their native one, become fitted for a still hotter climate. We may therefore safely conclude that plants can to a certain extent become accustomed to a climate either hotter or colder than their own; although the latter cases have been more frequently observed.] ...|$|E

50|$|Cantaloupes {{are often}} picked, and shipped, before <b>fully</b> <b>ripening.</b> One post-harvest {{practice}} is treatment with a sodium hypochlorite or bleach wash to prevent mold and Salmonella growth.

60|$|These {{were the}} public reasons {{which made the}} {{invasion}} of Britain and Germany an undertaking, at that particular time, not unworthy a wise and able general. But these enterprises, though reasonable in themselves, were only subservient to purposes of more importance, and which he had more at heart. Whatever measures he thought proper to pursue {{on the side of}} Germany, or on that of Britain, it was towards Rome that he always looked, and to the furtherance of his interest there that all his motions were really directed. That republic had receded from many of those maxims by which her freedom had been hitherto preserved under the weight of so vast an empire. Rome now contained many citizens of immense wealth, eloquence, and ability. Particular men were more considered than the republic; and the fortune and genius of the Roman people, which formerly had been thought equal to everything, came now to be less relied upon than the abilities of a few popular men. The war with the Gauls, as the old and most dangerous enemy of Rome, was of the last importance; and Cæsar had the address to obtain the conduct of it for a term of years, contrary {{to one of the most}} established principles of their government. But this war was finished before that term was expired, and before the designs which he entertained against the liberty of his country were <b>fully</b> <b>ripened.</b> It was therefore necessary to find some pretext for keeping his army on foot; it was necessary to employ them in some enterprise that might at once raise his character, keep his interest alive at Rome, endear him to his troops, and by that means weaken the ties which held them to their country.|$|E
6000|$|The second {{element in}} the modern {{transition}} is only the intellectual side of the first. It is the substitution of interest in things for interest in words, of positive knowledge for verbal disputation. Few now dispute the services of the schoolmen to the intellectual development of Europe. But conditions had <b>fully</b> <b>ripened,</b> {{and it was time}} to complete the movement of Bacon and Descartes by finally placing verbal analysis, verbal definition, verbal inferences, in their right position. Form was no longer to take precedence of matter. The Encyclopædists are never weary of contrasting their own age of practical rationalism with [...] "the pusillanimous ages of taste." [...] A great collection of books is described in one article (Bibliomanie) as a collection of material for the history of the blindness and infatuation of mankind. The gatherer of books is compared to one who should place five or six gems under a pile of common pebbles. If a man of sense buys a work in a dozen volumes, and finds that only half a dozen pages are worth reading, he does well to cut out the half dozen pages and fling the rest into the fire. Finally, it would be no unbecoming device for every great library to have inscribed over its portal, The Bedlam of the Human Mind. At this point one might perhaps suggest to D'Alembert that study of the pathology of the mind is no bad means of surprising the secrets of humanity and life. For his hour, however, the need was not knowledge of the thoughts, dreams, and mental methods of the past, but better mastery of the aids and instruments of active life. In any case Diderot was right when he expressed his preference for the essay over the treatise: [...] "an essay where the writer throws me one or two ideas of genius, almost isolated, rather than a treatise where the precious gems are stifled beneath a mass of iteration.... A man had only one idea; the idea demanded no more than a phrase; this phrase, full of marrow and meaning, would have been seized with relish; washed out in a deluge of words, it wearies and disgusts."[169] Rousseau himself does not surpass Diderot or D'Alembert in contempt for mere bookishness. We wholly misjudge the Encyclopædia, if we treat it either as literature or philosophy.|$|E

50|$|Edamame is {{typically}} harvested by hand to avoid damaging the crop's stems and leaves. Green soybean pods are picked before they <b>fully</b> <b>ripen,</b> typically 35 to 40 {{days after the}} crop first flowers. Soybeans harvested at this stage are sweeter because they contain more sucrose than soybeans picked later in the growing season. Other factors contributing to edamame's flavor include free amino acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and alanine.
