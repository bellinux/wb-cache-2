5|$|In October 2005, the WA Planning Commission {{presented}} Metropolitan Region Scheme Amendment 1089/33 to the Western Australian parliament, {{which was}} approved and took effect from 2 April 2006. The amendment rezoned an {{area known as}} East Landsdale Precinct 64, west of Alexander Drive, <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> to urban. In August 2006, Wanneroo City Council, the local government area responsible for Landsdale, submitted corresponding changes to the District Plan for approval. It is unknown at this time whether PITC will eventually have to relocate as a medium-to-long-term result of the rezoning.|$|E

They had licensed the directory of 11 other local directories, with Rural being the only hold-out in the region. Despite Rural's denial of a license to Feist, Feist copied some 4000 entries <b>from</b> <b>Rural's</b> directory. Because Rural had placed {{a small number of}} phony entries to detect copying, Feist was caught.|$|R
50|$|Burton Latimer {{became a}} {{separate}} urban district in 1923. In 1935 it was expanded greatly under the County Review Order, taking {{in part of}} Oxendon Rural District, the parishes of Gretton and Rockingham <b>from</b> Gretton <b>Rural</b> District, and the parish of Mawsley <b>from</b> Brixworth <b>Rural</b> District.|$|R
5|$|In a short distance, MD355 heads <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas into a {{commercial}} district {{on the outskirts}} of Frederick. The road widens to four lanes as it passes by the Francis Scott Key Mall and several other businesses. It intersects MD 85 (Buckeystown Pike), which provides access to and from I-70 and US 40. MD355 passes over I-70/US 40 and ends just north of the overpass, with the road continuing north into Frederick as locally maintained Market Street.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} 19th {{century that}} Leeds began to grow into one of Britain's largest cities. This led to {{widespread}} building across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted {{in the building of}} many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which migrated to the city <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds has perhaps the most surviving examples of back-to-back terrace housing in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills.|$|E

5|$|Key figures {{mentioned}} in inscriptions <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas were the Gavundas (officials) or Goudas. The Gavundas belonged to {{two levels of}} economic strata, the Praja Gavunda (people's Gavunda) and the Prabhu Gavunda (lord of Gavundas). They served the dual purpose of representing the people before the rulers as well as functioning as state appointees for tax collection and the raising of militias. They are {{mentioned in}} inscriptions related to land transactions, irrigation maintenance, village tax collection and village council duties.|$|E
5|$|Skopje is an {{ethnically diverse}} city, and its urban {{sociology}} primarily depends on {{ethnic and religious}} belonging. Macedonians form 66% of the city population, while Albanians and Roma account respectively for 20% and 6%. Each ethnic group generally restrict itself to {{certain areas of the}} city. Macedonians live south of the Vardar, in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, and Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are considered more traditional, whereas the south side evokes to Macedonians modernity and rupture <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> life.|$|E
5|$|The {{abortive}} {{attack on}} Montreal {{led to the}} full mobilization of local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 men, but they soon began to drift away. Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the battalion's personnel arrived on 27 and 28 July. Coming from across the state of New South Wales, the men were drawn from places such as Tamworth, Newcastle, Wagga, Goulburn, and Liverpool, with roughly 60 percent coming <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> backgrounds. With an authorised strength of around 900 men, the battalion was organised around a battalion headquarters, with a regimental aid post, four rifle companies and a headquarters company consisting of various support platoons and sections including signals, mortars, transport (later carriers), pioneers, anti-aircraft and administration.|$|E
5|$|There was {{an exodus}} <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas {{in most of}} the country. Today the urban {{population}} represents slightly {{more than half of the}} population, according to the latest census. In many cases, people went into cities outside the traditional area of their ethnic group. There are now important Ovimbundu communities in Luanda, Malanje, and Lubango. There has been a degree of return, but at a slow pace, while many younger people are reluctant to go to a rural life that they never knew.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Malaysian art {{was mainly}} centred on {{the areas of}} carving, weaving, and silversmithing. Traditional art ranges from handwoven baskets <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts. Common artworks {{included}} ornamental kris, beetle nut sets, and woven batik and songket fabrics. Indigenous East Malaysians {{are known for their}} wooden masks. Each ethnic group have distinct performing arts, with little overlap between them. However, Malay art does show some North Indian influence due to the historical influence of India.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne container service from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon has taken over the Melbourne - Horsham container service.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{development}} {{and the rise of}} manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.|$|E
5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected as the chairman and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The most important question was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E

However, political scientists {{mentioned that}} PR would {{have a tough time}} getting support <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas, referring to the DAP's dismal performance in rural polling centres. Nevertheless, encouraged by the strong support from the urban Chinese community in the Sibu by-election, DAP is now aiming to win the four other Chinese-majority parliamentary seats (namely the Sarikei, Miri, Stampin and Lanang seats) and seven other State constituencies held by SUPP in Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, Control Data and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts with cultural {{institutions such as the}} Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, and the Walker Art Center.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia had no {{diplomatic}} powers, but largely oversaw its own {{contributions of}} manpower and materiel {{to the war}} effort, being responsible for its own defence. Rhodesian officers and soldiers were distributed in small groups throughout the British and South African forces {{in an attempt to}} prevent high losses. Most of the colony's men served in Britain, East Africa and the Mediterranean, particularly at first; a more broad dispersal occurred from late 1942. Rhodesian servicemen in operational areas were mostly from the country's white minority, with the Rhodesian African Rifles—made up of black troops and white officers—providing the main exception in Burma from late 1944. Other non-white soldiers and white servicewomen served in East Africa and on the home front within Southern Rhodesia. Tens of thousands of black men were conscripted <b>from</b> <b>rural</b> communities for work, first on the aerodromes and later on white-owned farms.|$|E
