Hugo, who {{is hiding}} at Martha's farm, overhears him and {{recognises}} him as the cop that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> paid off when he was involved in the people smuggling racket. Martha makes this aware to Angelo who agrees to go to Martha's farm with Eaves. On the way, Eaves threatens Angelo to go along with his plans. Eaves shoots Hugo and then flees the scene. Hugo is rushed indoors and Martha phones local doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews). Eaves is caught by Angelo, Tony and Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson). Angelo then arrests both Hugo and Martha. As Angelo is driving them to the police station, he suddenly stops and lets them out. He tells Hugo to punch him {{to make it look like}} he and Martha had overpowered him and escaped. Martha thanks Angelo for letting them leave together. Hugo and Martha use Angelo's police car to escape and they flee the Bay, leaving behind their family and friends.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{reputation}} at {{this time}} was as a master of orchestration, based on Sadko and Antar. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with whom <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as Professor of Music Theory at the Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.|$|E

25|$|The wicket {{began to}} take ever {{increasing}} turn and wickets fell regularly to the England off-spinners Fred Titmus (4/40) and Dave Allen (4/47). Titmus took his 100th Test wicket and as he had passed 1,000 Test runs in the England innings completed the double of 1,000 Test runs and 100 Test wickets. Jim Parks failed to dismiss any batsmen, but the expert close fielders Mike Smith and Colin Cowdrey took five catches between them. Doug Walters top scored with 35 not out and David Sincock hit 5 fours in his 27 as Australia fell to 174 all out and an innings defeat on the fourth day. Smith tried to give Dave Allen the honour of leading the England team off the field, but <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> insisted that their captain should enter the pavilion first. They were greeted by the Australian captain Brian Booth, who shook hands with all the England players with his typical good sportsmanship.|$|E

After becoming a l'Cie and finding Serah in crystal stasis, he despairs and is forced to tame his Eidolon, the Shiva Sisters. After meeting up with Cid Raines and Oerba Yun Fang, Snow pairs up with Hope while oblivious to the boy's grudge against him. Once Hope gets Snow alone, he unsuccessfully tries to murder him for his part in his mother's death and reconciles with him soon after.

500|$|The {{following}} day, {{the group}} {{returns to the}} school to investigate further. The Doctor confronts Mr. Finch, who confirms that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are Krillitanes— a composite species that takes desirable attributes of the species they conquer. He attempts to subvert the Doctor, without success. Meanwhile, Sarah Jane and Rose, now getting on better than at their first meeting, try to unlock the programming on the school's computers; Mickey and K9 remain in Sarah Jane's car for surveillance. With the Doctor's help, they discover that the computers— bolstered by the students' enhanced intelligence— {{are part of a}} Krillitane effort to solve the [...] "Skasis Paradigm", a theory of everything. As the paradigm is nearly solved, which would allow the Krillitanes full control over time and space, they seal the school. Mr. Finch propositions the Doctor a second time, tempting him with the ability to save the Time Lords and override human mortality. With Sarah Jane's counseling, the Doctor refuses, and they run from Mr. Finch. After Kenny (a student who had not eaten the chips) alerts Mickey to the students' plight, Mickey crashes Sarah Jane's car through the school's doors and unplugs the computers, allowing the children to flee. The Doctor leads the Krillitanes to the kitchen. [...] Upon their arrival, K9 detonates the chip oil container, saturating the Krillitanes. [...] The Krillitanes suddenly explode, destroying the school and K9.|$|E
500|$|In Part II, Itachi uses one of Sasori's {{informants}} as a clone {{of himself}} {{to hold off}} Naruto {{and the rest of}} his team while <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> seal away Shukaku the One Tail. Itachi remains on the sidelines until learning that Sasuke has finally severed his ties to Orochimaru, having absorbed him and now being strong enough to settle matters. Prior to his fight with Sasuke, Itachi meets with Naruto and, after questioning his intentions to save Sasuke, ensures the youth's safety with a crow with Shisui's Sharingan as a countermeasure against Sasuke if he gains his Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and attempts to attack Konoha. Sasuke ultimately tracks him down and they engage in their final battle, during the course of which he uses his Mangekyo Sharingan to push Sasuke to his limits. In doing so, Orochimaru is drawn out from Sasuke's body, and Itachi seals him away with his Totsuka blade before finally succumbing to his [...] mysterious illness. As his final act, Itachi implants his Amaterasu technique within Sasuke, meant as a protective measure that will kill Tobi in case he ever tries to approach Sasuke and reveal the truth of their clan's slaughter. Unfortunately, having knew where Itachi's loyalties truly lie, Tobi survived and reveals the truth of Itachi's actions to Sasuke. This gives Sasuke a resolve to destroy the village, eventually having his brother's Mangekyo Sharingan implanted on him.|$|E

500|$|The trial {{took place}} in Kapenguria, a remote area that the {{authorities}} hoped would not attract crowds or attention. Together, Kenyatta, Bildad Kaggia, Fred Kubai, Paul Ngei, Achieng Oneko and Kung'u Karumba—the [...] "Kapenguria Six"—were put on trial. They assembled an international team of defence lawyers, including Chaman Lall, H. O. Davies, and Dudley Thompson, while they were led by British lawyer and Member of Parliament Denis Nowell Pritt. Pritt's involvement brought much media attention, and during the trial he faced government harassment and received various death threats. The judge in the case, Ransley Thacker, had recently retired from the Supreme Court of Kenya. The trial lasted five months: Rawson Macharia, the main prosecution witness, {{turned out to have}} perjured himself; the judge had only recently been awarded an unusually large pension and maintained secret contact with the then colonial Governor Evelyn Baring. The prosecution failed to produce any strong evidence that Kenyatta or the other accused had any involvement in managing the Mau Mau. Nevertheless, in April 1953, the judge found the defendants guilty. They were sentenced to seven years' hard labour, which was to be followed by indefinite restriction preventing him from leaving a given area without permission. Kenyatta then addressed the court, stating that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> did not recognise the judge's findings and that they had been scapegoated by the government. The government followed the verdict with a wider crackdown, banning KAU in June 1953, and closing down most of the independent schools in the country, including Kenyatta's.|$|E
500|$|An Honorary Life Member of the MCC, Gilligan {{served as}} MCC {{president}} from 1967 to 1968. During his tenure, the MCC {{was involved in}} controversy over the non-selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira in the England team {{on the grounds of}} his colour. Gilligan, in his capacity as MCC president, was aware of this having seen a private letter which communicated the explicit threat from the South African prime minister B. J. Vorster that the forthcoming tour would be cancelled if D'Oliveira were selected. However, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> who saw the letter, G. O. B. Allen and Billy Griffith, respectively the MCC treasurer and secretary, kept this information to themselves. When the English selectors met to choose the team, Gilligan, Allen and Griffith were present to represent the MCC. A BBC programme in 2004 claimed that Gilligan pressured the selectors to leave out D'Oliveira, but D'Oliveira's biographer Peter Oborne suggests that Allen carried far more influence at the meeting. He writes of Gilligan's part in the affair: [...] "It would be wrong to make too much of Gilligan's embarrassing past. Given that presidents are appointed for only a year, it was a very strong president indeed who could impose his personality on the permanent MCC secretariat of Griffith and Allen, and Gilligan was not a strong president." [...] Initially D'Oliveira was left out of the team, but when a player withdrew with an injury, the selectors added him as a replacement; the South African government barred D'Oliveira from taking part and the MCC cancelled the tour.|$|E

[...] Richard Walsh, Sheriff of Worcester, arrived with a vigilante force of about 200men early on 8 November. [...] Thomas {{was the first to}} be hit, in the shoulder, while crossing the courtyard. [...] The Wright brothers were next, followed by Rookwood, still injured from the explosion the night before. [...] Catesby and Percy were dropped by a single lucky shot. [...] The sheriff's men then proceeded to strip the defenders of their valuables, but Thomas was saved by the sheriff's assistant. [...] His fine sword, ordered and paid for four months previously, apparently proved too great a temptation for the Sheriff's men, as it was never seen again. [...] <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. [...] Despite a proclamation of 18 November naming them as wanted men, Robert Wintour and Stephen Litteton managed to evade capture until 9 January 1606. [...] They spent about two months hiding out in barns and houses; at one point they were forced to restrain a drunken poacher who happened upon their hiding place.

500|$|In season three, Tom supervises an {{operation}} on Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), {{the leader of}} the Others, which Jack is performing, and is coerced into letting Kate and Sawyer escape. He loses trust in Juliet, believing her to be plotting against Ben, and expresses his views to the Others' sheriff, before returning to the Island. Shown in a flashback during season four, Tom leaves the Island and tracks down Michael in Manhattan, where Michael is trying to kill himself. He tells Michael that the Island will not let him die and gives him the address of his hotel penthouse. There, Tom convinces Michael to work for Ben, and instructs him to get a job as a janitor on board a freighter that is about to set sail from Fiji. When Michael arrives at the port Tom tells him to wait a day or two before activating an explosive device, to kill all the freighter crew, preventing them from reaching the Island. He returns to the barracks and is seen playing football with Jack. Shortly after this, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Others</b> abandon the barracks, making camp in the jungle en route to the temple. Tom is shocked when Ben agrees to take one of the survivors, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), to see Jacob, Ben's superior. His faith in Ben's leadership is shaken, and ignores Ben's calls to intervene when Locke begins to beat another Other, Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff). When Ben returns from Jacob, he orders a raid on the survivors' beach camp that night; Tom is part of the party sent. In [...] "Through the Looking Glass", the season three finale, Jin, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) are captured by the party, and Ben radios Tom to shoot them. This prearranged code is the signal for Tom to shoot three bullets into the ground, only pretending to kill the hostages, to mislead the rest of the survivors, who have been met by Ben. Afterwards Tom expresses regret at not finishing the hostages, as they killed seven of the Others. The arrival of Hurley in a van, along with Sawyer and Juliet, sees the rest of the attack party killed. Tom admits defeat and surrenders, but Sawyer shoots him in his heart, claiming his life as payment for taking Walt off the raft. Juliet later buries Tom near the jungle along with his team of deceased Others.|$|E
