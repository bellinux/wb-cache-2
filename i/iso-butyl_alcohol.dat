30|$|Well-known {{techniques}} for 4 -TBC synthesis {{were based on}} the alkylation of catechol by isobutylene or iso-butanol in the presence of inorganic acids, mainly sulphuric acid [3, 4]. The industrial production process was conducted in two stages: first, by the alkaline melting of o-chlorophenol or o-phenylsulphonic acid, they obtain the starting catechol, which, in its turn, was alkylated over KU- 2 cationite with <b>iso-butyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The drawbacks of the process were the following: the formation of di- and tri- alkyl catechol derivatives, the undesired waste effluent formation, and the complex production technology.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Solid-state {{fermented}} Thai rice wines (Ou) were analysed {{to determine}} their chemical components. Determined parameters were pH (4. 5 – 5. 5), protein (0. 45 – 0. 99 g/ 100 g), ash (0. 10 – 0. 30 g/ 100 g), total solid (1. 72 – 14. 34 g/ 100 g), glucose (4. 07 – 7. 91 mg/ml) contents and volatile compounds. The ethanol concentration was {{in the range of}} 12. 15 to 104. 60 mg/ml. Profiles of volatile compounds were analysed by dynamic headspace coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry and gas chromatography olfactometry. The potent odours were alcoholic and solvent-like, sweet, fruity, buttery, and pungent aromas. The concentration in Ou of n-propanol, <b>iso-butyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> iso-amyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol, benzene ethanol, acetol, 2, 3 -butanediol, glycerol, ethyl lactate, acetoin, furfural, 5 -methyl furfural, 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -furfural, and acetic acid were also determined by a direct injection technique. From principal component analysis, Ou samples coul...|$|E
40|$|Some {{processes}} to recover zinc from aqueous and solid metallurgical wastes by hydrometallurgical methods are reported. In {{the case of}} waste liquid effluents, two different ways to recover zinc from the waste electrolyte of a zinc electrowinning plant are considered: in a first way sulfuric acid was extracted by <b>iso-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (IBA) before extracting zinc by di- 2 -ethil-hexyl phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA); in the second way zinc was directly extracted by tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP). In the case of solid industrial wastes the zinc recovery from both electric arc furnace (EAF) dusts as collected, and fumes coming from pyrometallurgical treatment of EAF dusts was investigated by means of aqueous sulfuric acid leaching, purification of leach liquor both by iron precipitation or solvent extraction. In all the studied cases the zinc purified solutions are suitable for zinc electrowinning: high current efficiency and low specific energy consumption are obtained with a high quality zinc deposits...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol based {{solutions}} {{are among the}} most convenient and wide spread aid in the prevention of nosocomial infections. The current study followed the efficacy of several types and isomers of alcohols on different bacterial species. Seven alcohols (ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, <b>iso-butyl,</b> tert-butyl <b>alcohol,</b> and ethylene glycol) were used to evaluate their minimal inhibitory and bactericidal effects by microdilution method on bacteria that express many phenotypical characteristics: different cell-wall structure (Gram positive/negative bacteria), capsule production (Klebsiella pneumoniae), antibiotic resistance (MRSA vs MSSA) or high environmental adaptability (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Results: The best inhibitory effect was noticed for n-propyl, followed by iso-propyl, n-butyl, and <b>iso-butyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> with equal values. Ethylene glycol was the most inefficient alcohol on all bacteria. In K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, the bactericidal concentrations were higher than the inhibitory one, and to a level similar to that encountered for most of the Gram-positive bacteria. Among Gram-positive cocci, E. faecalis presented the lowest susceptibility to alcohols. Conclusions: All alcohols presented good effect on bacteria, even in low concentrations. Compared to ethanol as standard, there are better alternatives that can be used as antimicrobials, namely longer-chain alcohols such as propyl or butyric alcohols and their iso- isomers. Ethylene glycol should be avoided, due to its toxicity hazard and low antimicrobial efficacy. Bacterial phenotype (highly adaptable bacteria, biofilm formation) and structure (cell wall structure, presence of capsule) may drastically affect the responsiveness to the antimicrobial activity of alcohols, leading to higher bactericidal than inhibitory concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Perfluorobutanesulfonic {{acid and}} other fluorine-free Bronsted acids (phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluensulfonic acid) are {{compared}} with regard their catalytic performance in alkylation reactions involving oxygen-containing alkylating agents (alcohols, ethers, esters, ketones). Reactions {{were carried out}} using benzene or toluene as an aromatic substrate; in any case experimental data emphasized the very high catalyzing ability of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid {{in comparison with the}} other experimented acids. In particular, in the alkylation of benzene iso-butyl ether, <b>iso-butyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> n-butyl alcohol and tert-butyl alcohol were used as alkylating agents; tert-butylbenzene was always the main reaction product. Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid only, compared with phosphoric acid and methanesulfonic acid, gives complete conversion of the alkylating agent and shows the highest reaction rate. In the alkylation of toluene di-iso-butyl and methyl-tert-butyl ether, iso-propyl alcohol, ethyl acetate and acetone were used as alkylating agents. Either reactivity or yield were always higher with perfluorobutanesulfonic acid in comparison with the other used acids. Acetone experimented as an alkylating agent led to a surprising result because of the formation of unexpected p-tert-butyltoluene as a sole reaction product. Experimental results are described...|$|E
40|$|In field {{trapping}} tests {{conducted in}} Hungary {{large numbers of}} Pyralis costalis F. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), a secondary pest, were attracted to traps baited with iso-amyl alcohol (3 -methyl- 1 -butanol) and acetic acid. The same bait attracted lower numbers of P. farinalis L., a well-known stored product pest. In both spp. the capture of the two-component blend {{was significantly higher than}} the catch in traps with the single com­po­nents. In tests conducted in a country mill, the blend of the above two com­pounds proved to be attractive towards Anagasta kuehniella Zell. and Plodia interpunctella Hbn. (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae), both important pests of stored products worldwide. The majority of captured insects were females. The optimal ratio for attracting A. kuehniella was 1 : 1 to 1 : 10 iso-amyl alcohol:acetic acid. The related iso-amyl acetate was inactive. The addition of <b>iso-butyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (2 -methyl- 1 -propanol) did not influence acti­vity of the iso-amyl alcohol / acetic acid blend. Polyethylene dispensers with 0. 2 ml of the blend started to loose activity only after 3 weeks of field exposure. Application possibilities of the newly discovered attractant are discussed...|$|E
