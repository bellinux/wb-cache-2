25|$|It was as hard-hitting a {{memorandum}} as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> Butler {{accused me of}} overstating the lack of resolve in both Washington and London. But my argument over {{the need to get}} a concealment-based inspection on track did resonate with him. He authorized me to put together an updated inspection plan to take place following his August visit to Baghdad.|$|E
500|$|In August 1905, Norman Warne died, and {{his brother}} Harold became Potter's editor. She wrote to him {{indicating}} Norman had approved the frog project: [...] "We had thought of doing... "Mr. Jeremy Fisher" [...] {{to carry on the}} series of little [...] I know some people don't like frogs! but I think I had convinced Norman that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a really pretty book with a good many flowers & water plants for backgrounds". Warne decided to put Jeremy Fisher into print.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Bakshi was {{promoted}} to director. His first assignment was the series Sad Cat. Bakshi {{and his wife had}} separated by then, giving him the time to animate each short alone. Bakshi was dissatisfied with the traditional role of a Terrytoons director: [...] "We didn't really 'direct' like you'd think. We were 'animation directors,' because the story department controlled the storyboards. We couldn't affect anything, but I still tried. I'd re-time, mix up soundtracks—I'd fuck with it so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> my own." ...|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr. Wopsle's eye, {{and he seemed}} to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out. <b>I</b> sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch-case, and still <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out. <b>I</b> was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him waiting for me near the door.|$|R
500|$|... "Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics in their reviews for The Element of Freedom. Allison Stewart of The Washington Post {{noted that the}} track, which is a pop ballad, had replaced [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] sports team references and ruminations with [...] "even milder and less controversial string of generalities", highlighting Keys' version's lyrics [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> here/I could make it anywhere". The track was not as commercially successful as [...] "Empire State of Mind", peaking at number four in the United Kingdom, number forty on the Canadian Hot 100, and number sixty-nine in Sweden. It also debuted on the Billboard R charts at number seventy-seven and peaked at number fifty-five on the Billboard Hot 100 without an official release.|$|E
500|$|Weir {{wanted the}} film to be funnier, feeling that Niccol's script was too dark, and declaring [...] "where he [...] had it depressing, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> light. It could {{convince}} audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7." [...] Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star, but because of commitments with The Cable Guy and Liar Liar, {{he would not be}} ready to start filming for at least another year. Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role. Niccol rewrote the script twelve times, while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.|$|E
2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. I saw all the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> as a doctor.|$|E

2500|$|The dispute {{ended in}} 2010, when the pair reunited {{for a full}} tour. Paul Wall stated [...] "It {{took a long time}} and us growing. You know, we started off as a group {{and a lot of times}} when you go your {{separates}} ways, a lot of people say, [...] "Oh you can't do it without him" [...] and so you wanna prove them wrong. I know for me, I wanted to prove everyone wrong and prove that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> on my own." [...] Chamillionaire replied; [...] "We had been bumping into each other a lot. It's kinda been died down for a little bit now but we just kinda needed that stamp of approval. I think the tour kinda just solidifies it for other people. It's not like today we just stopped beefing, we stop beefing along time ago, but nobody believed us." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was sitting}} at my desk {{examining}} the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Richard James, a naval {{mechanical}} engineer {{stationed at the}} William Cramp and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas. James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, {{and watched as the}} spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs to a stack of books, to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. James's wife Betty later recalled, [...] "He came home and said, 'I think if I got the right property of steel and the right tension; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> walk.'" [...] James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk. [...] Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it. She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning [...] "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary, and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.|$|E

5000|$|I await your {{reaction}} on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion {{than we have}} had or have less customers with what we've got to sell.

5000|$|So, really, {{the book}} is three strands woven together. There's the {{material}} from the Conan Doyle stories, there's the real history of the 19th century, and if those two failed to provide something then I {{was in a position}} where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> simply <b>make</b> <b>it</b> up.

6000|$|... "I didn't mean it that way," [...] {{said the}} other, with some confusion. [...] "I felt I {{had to say}} {{something}} cheerful to rouse you up, and that was the best <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> of <b>it.</b> Anyway, we'll both feel better after supper, and I'm hoping we'll yet see the man who turned you out in a tight place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A regular Paradise!" [...] he said. [...] "When {{this war}} is over, how I {{would like to come}} up here and knock around for a few weeks. I reckon <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> well worth while." ...|$|E
60|$|His wife. Oh, {{the grim}} {{grotesque}} agony of it all. My strength {{would never be}} sufficient to carry me through all this. My heart was faint, and my speech was low; yet it was as cold and resolute as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The hog!" [...] {{said the}} Asika, or rather she hissed it, [...] "the hog, {{who dared to}} touch me and to strike at you. Well, his time is short--would that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> shorter! Did you hear what he sought of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess you're right," [...] was Phil's reply. [...] "I overheard Lowell {{speaking}} about {{something of the}} kind, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not quite <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out." ...|$|R

60|$|There {{is little}} logic to be {{expected}} on this earth, {{not only in the}} matter of thought, but also of sentiment.

60|$|Possibly. But {{altogether}} <b>I</b> fancy we <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> uncommonly nasty {{for you if}} {{you made}} a fuss. If dirty linen is going to be washed in public--there's generally a good deal to be done on both sides.|$|R
