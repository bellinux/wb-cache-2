5|$|For December 7, Colonel John Laurens {{stated that}} “the loss of Morgan's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded”, while John Donaldson, an American cavalryman wrote that “Morgan had 44 killed & wounded & {{among them was}} Major Morris a brave & gallant officer” This {{reference}} was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment, so Donaldson's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan's command, while Laurens' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only. Benson Lossing confirms that “twenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan's Corps”, while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost “16 or 17” wounded. For December 8, David Martin says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 15 prisoners. From these sources, the aggregate American loss from December 5–8 would {{appear to have been}} 16 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 24 captured on the 5th; 70 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 15 captured on the 6th; 44 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded on the 7th and 20 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 15 captured on the 8th. This gives 150 <b>killed</b> <b>or</b> wounded and 54 captured, for a total loss of 204 men.|$|E
