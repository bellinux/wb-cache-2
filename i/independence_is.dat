One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of <b>Independence,</b> <b>is</b> also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
