500|$|She visited troops, hospitals, factories, {{and parts}} of Britain that were {{targeted}} by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End, near London's docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered, in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent [...] "the rainbow of hope". When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits {{during the height of}} the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, [...] "I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me feel <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> the East End in the face." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Do Somethin'" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} usage of {{electric}} guitars and a [...] "bump beat", {{as described by}} Spence D. of IGN. He also noted the song is [...] "filled with faux string bursts and mock-'70s synth gurgle (think Zapp/Gap Band era) and plenty of treated guitar and bass". According to the sheetmusic published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, it is set at a moderately fast tempo with 130 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of E minor, and Spears' vocal range spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of C6. Lyrically, [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] refers to having fun while being watched by other people, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "Somebody pass my guitar/So <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> like a star." [...] Tim Lee of musicOMH compared the song's style to Gwen Stefani's [...] "What You Waiting For?" [...] (2004).|$|E
500|$|During World WarII, {{the palace}} was bombed nine times, {{the most serious}} and publicised of which {{resulted}} in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King GeorgeVI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed. War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: [...] "I'm glad we have been bombed. Now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> the East End in the face". The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as The Sunday Graphic reported: ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} match, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Boycott was to face what was later {{said to be}} Holding's {{greatest}} over. Boycott was hit on the gloves by the first delivery, played-and-missed the second outside off stump, was hit on the thigh by the third, fended the next two deliveries away with his bat, and was then bowled by the final delivery. Though in 1987 Boycott would claim a 1966 delivery by Gary Sobers {{to be the best}} he ever faced in cricket, he noted of Holding's over that [...] "for {{the first time in my}} life <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> at a scoreboard with a duck against my name and not feel a profound sense of failure." [...] Boycott led an England fight back in the fourth Test. Having watched Holding's over several times on video, and worked in the nets on his game, Boycott came out and made 38 in the first innings and then hit his twentieth Test century. His career run total was now 7,410, gaining on Gary Sobers' record of 8,032.|$|E
500|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that by the end}} of the war, 80tons of bombs had fallen on the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green alone, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable. In Bethnal Green, 555 people were killed, and 400 were seriously injured. For the whole of Tower Hamlets, a total of 2,221 civilians were killed, and 7,472 were injured, with 46,482 houses destroyed and 47,574 damaged. [...] So badly battered was the East End that when Buckingham Palace was hit during the height of the bombing, Queen Elizabeth observed that [...] "It makes me feel <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> the East End in the face." [...] By the end of the war, the East End was a scene of devastation, with large areas derelict and depopulated. War production was changed quickly to making prefabricated houses, and many were installed in the bombed areas and remained common into the 1970s. Today, 1950s and 1960s architecture dominates the housing estates of the area such as the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, much of which was built as a show-piece of the 1951 Festival of Britain.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, Binchy told The Irish Times: [...] "I don't {{have any regrets}} about any roads I didn't take. Everything went well, and I think that's been a help because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> back, and I do get great {{pleasure}} out of looking back... I've been very lucky and I have a happy old age with good family and friends still around." [...] Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival. She once said {{she would like to}} die [...] "...on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and myself into the side of a mountain".|$|E
2500|$|Hudson {{has stated}} that her {{biological}} father [...] "doesn't know me from {{a hole in the}} wall", and that she considers Russell her father. Her biological father indicated that though he had made several efforts to connect with Kate and Oliver, neither of them reciprocated. Hudson has described her mother as [...] "the woman that I've learned the most from, and who I look up to, who has conducted her life in a way that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> up to". She has four half-siblings: Emily and Zachary Hudson, from her biological father's later marriage to actress Cindy Williams; Lalania Hudson, from his relationship with another woman; and Wyatt Russell, from her mother's relationship with Kurt Russell.|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{elevation}} to {{the status}} of a beloved classic came decades after its initial release, when it became a television staple during Christmas season in the late 1970s. This came as a welcome surprise to Frank Capra and others involved with its production. [...] "It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen," [...] Capra told The Wall Street Journal in 1984. [...] "The film has {{a life of its own}} now, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> at it like I had nothing to do with it. I'm like a parent whose kid grows up to be president. I'm proud... but it's the kid who did the work. I didn't even think of it as a Christmas story when I first ran across it. I just liked the idea." [...] In a 1946 interview, Capra described the film's theme as [...] "the individual's belief in himself" [...] and that he made it [...] "to combat a modern trend toward atheism".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Richard, {{it is not}} that," [...] she faltered. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>look</b> {{into your}} face again. If you have any {{compassion}} for me you will leave me now." ...|$|R

2500|$|Australian ugg {{boots are}} not {{considered}} fashionable in their countries of origin and are worn for warmth and comfort. Ugg boots in Australia are worn predominantly as slippers and associated with [...] "daggy fashion sense, bogan behaviour" [...] and the [...] "outer suburbs" [...] when worn in public. According to Australian fashion stylist Justin Craig: [...] "The only people who get away with wearing them are models, who give out the message: 'I'm so beautiful, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> good in any crap." [...] The Deckers UGG brand emerged as a fashion trend in the US through Deckers' actions to promote it as a high fashion brand. Deckers solicited endorsements from celebrities such as Kate Hudson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lopez, and product placements in television series such as Sex and the City, and films such as Raising Helen. This marketing campaign [...] "led to an exponential growth in the brand's popularity and recognizability." [...] The company reported US$689 million in UGG sales in 2008, almost a 50-fold increase from 1995.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} the album's first single [...] "This Is Music" [...] in May, and it reached No.35, their first single {{to reach the}} Top 40. It was followed by [...] "On Your Own" [...] in June which performed even better, reaching No.28. This single was particularly new for the Verve {{as it was a}} soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single [...] "History", which reached No.24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: [...] "I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because {{it could have been the}} greatest time of our lives, with [...] "History" [...] doing well, but I still think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away." ...|$|E
