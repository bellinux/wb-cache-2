50|$|Muscles {{undergoing}} heavy {{eccentric loading}} suffer greater damage when overloaded (such as during muscle building or strength training exercise) {{as compared to}} concentric loading. When eccentric contractions are used in weight training, they are normally called negatives. During a concentric contraction, muscle fibers slide across each other, pulling the Z-lines together. During an eccentric contraction, the filaments slide past each other the opposite way, though the actual movement of the myosin heads during an eccentric contraction is not known. Exercise featuring a heavy <b>eccentric</b> <b>load</b> can actually support a greater weight (muscles are approximately 40% stronger during eccentric contractions than during concentric contractions) and also results in greater muscular damage and delayed onset muscle soreness one to two days after training. Exercise that incorporates both eccentric and concentric muscular contractions (i.e., involving a strong contraction and a controlled lowering of the weight) can produce greater gains in strength than concentric contractions alone. While unaccustomed heavy eccentric contractions can easily lead to overtraining, moderate training may confer protection against injury.|$|E

50|$|The kiln {{is usually}} turned {{by means of}} a single Girth Gear {{surrounding}} a cooler part of the kiln tube, but sometimes it is turned by driven rollers. The gear is connected through a gear train to a variable-speed electric motor. This must have high starting torque in order to start the kiln with a large <b>eccentric</b> <b>load.</b> A 6 x 60 m kiln requires around 800 kW to turn at 3 rpm. The speed of material flow through the kiln is proportional to rotation speed, and so a variable speed drive is needed in order to control this. When driving through rollers, hydraulic drives may be used. These have the advantage of developing extremely high torque. In many processes, it is dangerous to allow a hot kiln to stand still if the drive power fails. Temperature differences between {{the top and bottom of}} the kiln may cause the kiln to warp, and refractory is damaged. It is therefore normal to provide an auxiliary drive for use during power cuts. This may be a small electric motor with an independent power supply, or a diesel engine. This turns the kiln very slowly, but enough to prevent damage.|$|E

For the other three GFRP tube reinforced concrete columns, one column was subjected to concentric loading, while the other two columns were subjected to <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading</b> with eccentricities of 25 mm and 50 mm. It has been shown that GFRP tube reinforced concrete column obtained higher load carrying capacity than steel reinforced concrete column under concentric <b>loading.</b> <b>Eccentric</b> loadings dramatically reduced the load carrying capacity of GFRP tube reinforced concrete columns...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{the load}} {{carrying}} capacity of masonry under combined axial load and flexure is a key priority {{for the assessment of}} masonry arches, pillars, vaults and walls. Despite the wealth of experimental data on the behaviour of masonry structures under <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading</b> and the attempts to relate the eccentric capacity of masonry specimens to the concentric value, there are still uncertainties regarding the prediction of the capacity of masonry under <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading</b> and its dependency on the properties of the constituent materials. This study provides a critical review on the behaviour of masonry under <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading.</b> Current state of the knowledge is presented and the different models that have been proposed in the past for prediction of the capacity of unreinforced masonry specimens under combined axial and flexural loading are evaluated and compared against each other and against available experimental data. The model best matching the experimental data is identified and coupled with upper and lower limits which enclose the majority of the data. Finally, the need...|$|R
