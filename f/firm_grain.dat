40|$|AnSTRAC'r: Bahaman grapestone is {{produced}} by cementation of recrystallized ooids in the marine environment. Initial binding of grains is accomplished by growth of algae and encrusting forams in the substrate. Later cementation and infilling of the composite may be &re to continued growth of these organisms {{in the interior of}} the aggregate and to chemical or biochemical precipitation of cement. Data indicate the recrystallized ooids making up grapestone were formed at an earlier stage in sedimentation as the sea transgressed onto the Bahaman Platform {{at the end of the}} last glacial lowstand.

40|$|Source {{verification}} (lot identity) is {{the ability}} to trace products from their initial components through a production and distribution system to an end user. Source verification is a documentation process that may also require product testing, special logistics, or other actions. Formal certification and audit is generally required. Grain markets have traditionally handled interchangeable average quality commodities. Biotechnology, safety/security concerns, and new consumer perceptions are converging to create a grain market need for source verification and the associated quality management certification systems. Iowa State has assisted a large <b>grain</b> <b>firm</b> with the application of quality management systems, product tracing, and implementation of related statistical process controls. The <b>grain</b> <b>firm</b> has already achieved certification by an industry quality system and is moving to ISO 9000 (2000). A major goal {{is the ability}} to track product completely for individual production unit to user—a challenge for the <b>grain</b> <b>firm</b> handling bulk commodities. However, the act of creating the quality management system generated significant operating cost efficiencies applicable to its general commodity business. This presentation uses the case study of the grain elevator to illustrate the needs, actions, and challenges of introducing source verification and certification to the grain market. Data from other elevator studies is used to illustrate program costs. Source verification and certification will change the mindset of agricultural businesses. In addition to providing security for very specialized products with restricted markets, this effort will reduce operating costs because a rigorous study of work processes is required for implementation. The conversion of commodity markets to product markets will improve profitability and efficiency of market participants. The tolerance for purity in both specialty and commodity markets will determine the actual costs associated with the programs...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} on the buildup of rocks from small dust grains has reaffirmed that grain growth in protoplanetary disks should occur quickly. Calculation of growth rates have been made {{for a variety of}} growth processes and generally predict high probabilities of sticking in low-velocity collisions that may be brought about {{in a number of ways}} in protoplanetary disks. Laboratory experiments have measured sticking coefficients for some materials largely confirming the calculations. Although the detailed velocity fields of disks are not well understood, many of the important processes leading to particle collisions and grain growth have been studied theoretically and demonstrate likely paths by which dust is assembled into planets. Calculations of the radiative properties of particles with various size distributions show that large particles should produce observable changes in the spectral energy distributions of disks. Changes of the sort predicted are, in fact, observed, but their interpretation is ambiguous; there are other ways to produce the observed changes that do not require grain growth, so the evidence is currently inconclusive. The major uncertainties can be overcome with the next generation of millimeter-wave interferometers, and it seems likely that a <b>firm</b> case for <b>grain</b> growth could be established within a decade.

30|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is {{an annual}} crop {{cultivated}} for grains as {{a rich source}} of carbohydrates minerals and vitamins. Based on developmental pattern, rice plant growth is divided into vegetative (germination to panicle initiation), reproductive (panicle initiation to heading), grain filling or ripening and maturity phases. At seedling stage the plant has clearly defined shoot and root parts. Further tillers are formed on main shoot, a gradual increase in plant height and leaf emergence at regular intervals takes place during vegetative development. In reproductive stage plant undergo culm elongation, a decline in tiller number, booting, emergence of the flag leaf, heading or panicle protrude out from sheath and flowering. Grain filling and ripening or maturation stage is characterized by grain growth (Yoshida and Nagota 2011). The developmental phases have direct and indirect influences on the yield and quality characteristics of rice grains. The reproductive growth stage is most sensitive to biotic and abiotic stresses (Fageria 2007). As the plant undergo different developmental phases, simultaneous level of endogenous hormones, primary and secondary metabolites including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are altered. Photosynthates produced in leaves are transported primarily in the form of sucrose to meristem and developing organs such as flowers. During this phase of development, maximum amino acids and proteins are synthesized in plants and transported to developing organs where they are utilized for flower and embryo development. At grain filling or ripening, grain size and weight increases since starch and sugars are translocated from the culms and leaf sheaths to developing grains. The carbohydrate is stored in the form of starch in grain endosperm. Initially when florets on the main stem show milky accumulation, starch is white and milky in consistency. It loses moisture and changes into bread dough or <b>firmer</b> during dough <b>grain</b> stages. At maturity physiological process of grain filling cease. And when the moisture content of the grain on the main stem is 25 to 30  % the plant reaches to physiological maturity (Paul and Foyer 2001).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} u. s. and Canadian grain-marketing systems, {{emphasizing}} wheat. The historical evolution of each system is first presented; then each system's performance is evaluated using such criteria as producer prices and export market shares. The particular marketing system by itselfis {{not the only}} determinant of performance differences of the two systems; government policies also playa role. Furthermore, the two marketing systems do not operate independently of each other. Often the Canadian Wheat Board uses the private system in the United States {{to carry out the}} delivery of grain once sales have been made; also, at times, the Board has made direct sales to U.

Public debate regarding the character of a country's grain-marketing system and the ap-propriate role of government in it has esca-lated in recent years in both Canada and the United States. In the United States the debate has focused most recently on two issues: (a) honesty in grading and (b) whether, in a world of state traders, U. S. reliance on a few, large, multinational grain-export firms {{is in the best interest}} of U. S. farmers, consumers, and tax-payers. Discussions of both issues have led to proposals for increased (or, in the case of grading, actual) government involvement in the grain-marketing system. In Canada a pub-lic debate is also occurring in a somewhat op-posite direction-namely, should there be greater involvement of the private sector in a marketing system which, since the 1930 s, has been dominated by a public monopoly, the Canadian Wheat Board? In the current debates the following issues arise: (a) the level and stability of producers' prices and returns; (b) marketing efficiency, marketing margins, and returns to market in-termediaries and middlemen; (c) physical capacity of the system, grain marketing in-Alex F.

The collection largely focuses on Renate Herzfeld Modern's direct forebears: Rabbi Levi Herzfeld, Felix Herzfeld, and Adolf Herzfeld. Material on their wives {{and other family members}} is also included, in addition to some documentation of the Wolfes family, especially her grandfather, Hermann Wolfes. The collection includes correspondence; poetry and manuscript drafts; official, educational and military documents; sermons; newspaper clippings; family trees; notes; and a few photographs. Additional items pertaining to this collection have been donated to Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum in Braunschweig, Germany. Levi Herzfeld was born on December 27, 1810 in Ellrich, Thuringia, Germany, the son of Ruben and Frederike (née Levi) Herzfeld. He studied theology and the Talmud under Rabbi Samuel Egers in Braunschweig, where he also attended the Gymnasium. Afterwards he attended universities in Würzburg and Berlin, studying philosophy, Oriental languages, geography, archaeology, and history in addition to attending Berlin lectures on the Talmud under scholars such as Leopold Zunz and others. In 1836 he received his doctorate in philosophyand then returned to Braunschweig to continue his rabbinical studies. In 1842 Levi Herzfeld was named Braunschweig's regional Rabbi (Landesrabbiner). A prolific writer, he achieved renown as a scholar of history and economics, and was called the first Jewish economic historian. In 1879 the Duke (Herzog) of Braunschweig awarded Levi Herzfeld the title of professor in recognition of his scholarly work. - Levi Herzfeld married Georgine Salomon. They had eight children: Anna, Felix, Elsbeth, Robert, Clara (Claire, Klara), Lea, Gottfried, and Marta. Levi Herzfeld died in 1884. Felix Herzfeld was the eldest son of Levi Herzfeld, and was born September 3, 1849 in Braunschweig. He became a banker, but also had an interest in writing poetry and in Italian literature. He married Anna Bremer of Gandersheim, Germany; together they had three children: Adolf, Ernst, and Ludwig. Felix Herzfeld died in 1910, Anna Herzfeld committed suicide in 1943 on the eve of deportation to Theresienstadt. Adolf Herzfeld was born in 1883 in Hannover. He completed his Gymnasium studies in 1901 and then studied law and political science in Freiburg, Berlin, and Heidelberg. In 1906 he received his Doctor of Philosophy from the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University of Berlin. In 1906 and 1907 he lived in France and England, where he learned wholesale trade and banking. At the end of 1907 he joined the Braunschweiger Privatbank A. G. and in 1911 the Dresdner Bank in Berlin, where he worked as secretary of the bank's branches. In 1914 he became director of the Dresdner Bank in Kassel. Later that year he volunteered for World War I when he received the Iron Cross First and Second Class. - In August 1919 Adolf Herzfeld married Lisbeth (Luise) Wolfes, the daughter of Hermann and Rosa (née Nordheimer) Wolfes. He rejoined the Dresdner Bank in Berlin in March 1920 and in April became a general partner in the firm founded by his father-in-law, Gebrüder Wolfes Bank und Getreide, Hannover. Gebrüder Wolfes was headed by Hermann Wolfes until his death in 1924, when Adolf Herzfeld was elected chair of the North German Portland Cement Factory in Misburg, a position he held until 1933 when he had to resign. He was also on the Board of Directors for several other cement factories and was chair of the interest group for these factories. Hermann Philip Wolfes had founded the firm Gebrüder Wolfes in 1850 in Elze, near Hannover, and in 1891 it was established in Hannover. It was one of the leading <b>firms</b> in <b>grain</b> wholesaling in northern Germany and belonged to one of the prominent private banking firms of Hannover. The firm was a leader {{in the development of the}} cement industry in the Hannover region. In 1898 the firm helped found the Norddeutsche Portland-Cement-Fabrik (North German Portland Cement Factory) in Misburg, near Hannover. In addition Hermann Wolfes was prominent in the commercial sphere of Hannover. From 1912 - 1915 he was a Minister of Trade for the city. He also headed the Getreidebörse (grain exchange) of the city for decades and was a member of the city's Chamber of Commerce. He and his wife had one daughter, Lisbeth (also called Luise). She was musically inclined and studied piano under Heinrich Lutter, a former student of Franz Liszt and Hans von Bülow. As a young woman she participated in musical performances. Lisbeth and Adolf Herzfeld had two daughters, Edith and Renate. Adolf and Lisbeth Herzfeld left Germany in 1937; they first stayed in Amsterdam before leaving for Brazil and settling in São Paulo. There Adolf Herzfeld began a printing business. After completing school, Renate Herzfeld spent one year studying art but then assisted her family in their business.
