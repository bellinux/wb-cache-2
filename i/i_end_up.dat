Unlike many other celebrities, Mukerji limits her {{interactions with the}} media and is sometimes labelled a recluse; {{she said in a}} 2011 interview, [...] "Today actors have become more open with the media. But this has posed a problem for actors like me because if I don't do that, then <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being called reclusive. So now I have changed myself and am easily approachable." [...] Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and filmmaker Karan Johar. The nature of Mukerji's relationship with filmmaker Aditya Chopra was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India, though she refused to publicly talk about it. On 21 April 2014, she married Chopra at a private ceremony in Italy. On 9 December 2015, she gave birth to their daughter, named Adira.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, One by One was {{considered}} the band's heaviest album, as Grohl described the sound as a darker and more aggressive approach {{as opposed to the}} band's usual work. Grohl said that the album mainly focused on the energy of live performances, which he attributed to both the extensive touring preceding the compositions, and the short period during which the re-recordings were done. The frontman added that although the previous albums had songs which were never played live, the track listing on One by One was compared to a set list where he would play all songs every night. As the results of the early recording sessions had manager John Silva complimenting the songs that did not sound like the band's previous work, and suggesting Grohl to [...] "stop trying to write hit singles and go back to being weird", the band decided to be more experimental in addition to writing music meant to be played in full arenas. The variety included moody songs such as [...] "Have It All" [...] and [...] "Tired of You", the seven-minute [...] "epic opus" [...] album closer [...] "Come Back", and the alternating dynamics of [...] "Halo", which drew inspiration from Tom Petty, Cheap Trick and Guided by Voices. Grohl added that the sonority tried to blend dissonance and melody: [...] "We figured we're gonna get mean, we're gonna get ugly. And then <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> putting this four-part harmony on it, and all of sudden it's beautiful. Like 'wait a second, {{it was supposed to be}} gross, and now it's gorgeous'." ...|$|E
