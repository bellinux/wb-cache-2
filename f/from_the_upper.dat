5|$|A limited fauna {{is known}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> {{section of the}} Oldman Formation, and Corythosaurus casuarius as well as C. intermedius are among the taxa. Also from {{the section of the}} {{formation}} are the theropods Daspletosaurus, and Saurornitholestes, the hadrosaurids Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, and the ankylosaurid Scolosaurus, and the ceratopsians Coronosaurus and Chasmosaurus. Other genera are known, but do not persist <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> section of the formation, and therefore are not contemporaries of Corythosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} between 1953 and 1955 by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield from the Ministry of Works {{found evidence of}} extensive human occupation of the area. Consecutive habitation, spanning thousands of years <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods (Old, Middle, and New Stone Age), to the Bronze and Iron Ages had left numerous artefacts behind. Discoveries have included stone knives, flint blades, {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves.|$|E
5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and animals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E

5|$|By 1528, Spanish {{colonial power}} had been {{established}} in the Chiapas Highlands, and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores. Spanish dominion extended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> drainage of the Grijalva, across Comitán and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley. This area was incorporated into the Villa de San Cristóbal district, also including Chamula, Chiapan, and Zinacantán.

5|$|England's bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling at speeds of around 150km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised the tactics {{in an attempt}} to curb Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman, whose average hovered around 100, around twice that of all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.|$|E
5|$|Holocene {{lava flows}} are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava flows and {{comprise}} several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths {{do not exist}} in the older lava flows. However, chemical evidence indicates that every lava flow was produced in a similar way by low degrees of piecemeal melting. The melts originally came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Jack Horner {{and colleagues}} {{published}} an extremely preliminary {{report of a}} tyrannosaurid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> parts of the Campanian Two Medicine Formation in Montana, which was interpreted as a transitional species between Daspletosaurus and the later Tyrannosaurus. Currie (2003) stated that the tyrannosaurid from the Two Medicine Formation mentioned by Horner et al. (1992) may be an unnamed third species of Daspletosaurus. Another partial skeleton was reported <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> Two Medicine in 2001, preserving {{the remains of a}} juvenile hadrosaur in its abdominal cavity. This specimen was assigned to Daspletosaurus but not to any particular species. The remains of at least three more Daspletosaurus have also been described in a Two Medicine bonebed by Currie et al. (2005); the authors stated that this fossil material likely represents then-unnamed species mentioned by Horner et al. (1992), but cautioned that further study and description of Daspletosaurus would be necessary before the species can be determined with certainty. In 2017, the Two Medicine Formation taxon was named as the new species D. horneri.|$|E
5|$|Like other bird-hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gryposaurus {{appears to}} have only existed {{for part of the}} {{duration}} of time that the rocks were being formed. As the formation was being laid down, it recorded a change to more marine-influenced conditions. Gryposaurus is absent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> part of the formation, with Prosaurolophus present instead. Other dinosaurs known from only {{the lower part of the}} formation include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow-crested duckbill Corythosaurus. Gryposaurus may have preferred river-related settings.|$|E
