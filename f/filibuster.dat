5|$|In March 2013, Paul, with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, {{threatened}} another <b>filibuster,</b> {{this one}} opposing any legislative proposals to expand federal gun control measures. The <b>filibuster</b> was attempted on April 11, 2013, but was dismissed by cloture, in a 68–31 vote. Also in March 2013, Paul endorsed fellow Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell's 2014 re-election campaign. McConnell had previously hired Paul's 2010 campaign manager, Jesse Benton, {{as his own}} campaign manager. Paul's endorsement {{was seen as a}} major win for McConnell in avoiding a challenge in the Republican primary.|$|E
5|$|Amid a push by Senate Democrats in July 2013 to {{eliminate}} the <b>filibuster</b> for all executive-branch nominees, senators struck a deal {{to pave the way}} for a final, up-or-down vote on Cordray's nomination. With that senators voted 71–29 on July 16, 2013 to invoke cloture on Cordray's nomination. The U.S. Senate confirmed Cordray in a 66–34 vote on July 16, 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Gillibrand {{proposed}} {{legislation that would}} remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command; the bill was cosponsored by Republican senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Gillibrand's bill failed to gain enough votes to break a <b>filibuster</b> in March 2014; however, her efforts likely improved her standing as a lawmaker in the Senate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Filibusters</b> are {{irregular}} {{soldiers who}} (normally) act without official authority {{from their own}} government, and are generally motivated by financial gain, political ideology, or the thrill of adventure. The freewheeling actions of the <b>filibusters</b> of the 1850s led to the name being applied figuratively to the political act of <b>filibustering</b> in the United States Congress.|$|R
50|$|In 1896 the Straightouts {{offered to}} {{nominate}} Broward for sheriff, {{but he was}} busy with his <b>filibustering</b> operation and declined. In 1900, the war over and his <b>filibustering</b> days were ended.|$|R

5|$|Mathias {{remained}} {{active in}} his final days in the Senate, playing {{an important role in}} removing a death penalty provision in a 1986 Senate drug bill after threatening <b>filibuster,</b> and in preparing impeachment proceedings against federal judge Harry E. Claiborne. Mathias' last day in the Senate was January 3, 1987, at which point he was succeeded by Mikulski.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, the Senate voted 60–39 to end {{debate on}} the bill: a cloture vote to end the <b>filibuster.</b> The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote). The bill was {{endorsed}} by the AMA and AARP.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, the Senate {{voted for}} cloture by a 70-30 vote, thus {{overcoming}} {{the threat of}} <b>filibuster</b> and limiting further debate on the bill. On May 26, the Senate passed the bill by a 77-19 vote (Democrats 47-16, Republicans 30-2); only Senators representing Southern states voted against it.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there has}} been a long history of Supreme Court nominees being rejected, only one Supreme Court nominee has ever been <b>filibustered.</b> In 1968, Chief Justice nominee Abe Fortas was <b>filibustered</b> and withdrew after a short period.|$|R
50|$|Three of the <b>filibustered</b> nominees (Estrada, Pickering, and Kuhl) had withdrawn. In the 109th Congress, {{five of the}} {{remaining}} seven <b>filibustered</b> nominees (Owen, McKeague, Griffin, Pryor, and Brown) were confirmed {{as a result of}} the deal brokered by the Gang.|$|R

5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a <b>filibuster.</b>|$|E
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican <b>filibuster,</b> most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{meetings}} had to end by nightfall, {{a senator}} could talk {{a proposal to}} death (a <b>filibuster)</b> if he could keep the debate going until nightfall. Any proposed motion could be vetoed by a tribune, {{and if it was}} not vetoed, it was then turned into a final senatus consultum. Each senatus consultum was transcribed into a document by the presiding magistrate, and then deposited into the aerarium.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of these ten <b>filibusters,</b> Senate Republicans began to {{threaten}} to change the existing Senate rules by using what Senator Trent Lott termed the [...] "nuclear option" [...] and which Republicans tended to call the [...] "constitutional option". This change in rules would eliminate <b>filibusters</b> of judicial confirmation votes.|$|R

5|$|A {{group of}} Cuban revolutionaries led by Venezuelan adventurer Narciso López {{intended}} to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule by the sword. Searching {{for a military}} leader for a <b>filibuster</b> expedition, they first offered command of the Cuban forces to General William J. Worth, but he died before making his decision. In the summer of 1849, López visited Davis {{and asked him to}} lead the expedition. He offered an immediate payment of $100,000 (worth more than $2,000,000 in 2013), plus the same amount when Cuba was liberated. Davis turned down the offer, stating that it was inconsistent with his duty as a senator. When asked to recommend someone else, Davis suggested Robert E. Lee, then an army major in Baltimore; López approached Lee, who also declined on the grounds of his duty.|$|E
5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a <b>filibuster</b> or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Home Squadron as flagship, Roanoke transported the American <b>filibuster</b> {{and former}} President of Nicaragua, William Walker, {{and his men}} back to the United States from Aspinwall, Colombia, (now called Colón, Panamá). Roanoke arrived on 4 August and the ship was {{decommissioned}} at the Boston Navy Yard on 24 September 1857. Recommissioned on almost a year later on 18 August 1858, Roanoke resumed her duties as flagship of the Home Squadron. For over a year, she was stationed at Aspinwall awaiting {{the arrival of the}} first Japanese embassy to the United States to ratify the 1858 Treaty of Amity and Commerce. They reached Aspinwall on 25 April 1860 and Roanoke reached Hampton Roads on 12 May 1860 with the delegation and was again decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|During {{his service}} in New Orleans, Beauregard became {{dissatisfied}} as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 {{that he was}} going to join the <b>filibuster</b> with William Walker, who had seized control of Nicaragua; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard to stay in the United States. He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011-2015 term, the State Senate {{was made}} up of 35 Democrats and 12 Republicans. Republicans gained two seats (District 6 in Baltimore County and District 29 in Calvert and St. Mary's counties) in the {{elections}} held on November 4, 2014. Democrats maintain a super-majority in the chamber despite these changes. Article II, Section 17(a) of the Maryland Constitution specifies it takes a three-fifths vote of both chambers to override a veto, which is 29 votes in the State Senate. The rules of the Senate also permit members to limit debate by a three-fifths majority vote, meaning Republicans would need to gain five additional seats, for a total of 19, in order to sustain a veto or <b>filibuster</b> legislation.|$|E
5|$|Following the NDH's establishment, Đujić {{narrowly}} escaped capture by the Ustaše. As {{early as}} April, Đujić's Chetnik's began killing and mutilating Croats {{in retaliation for}} the wave of Ustaše atrocities against Serb communities across the NDH around the same time. According to Italian reports, Đujić had around 300 Chetniks under his command that month, centered mainly around Knin. By mid-month, his Chetniks were launching raids against communist-held villages between Bosansko Grahovo and Drvar in conjunction with the Italians, who considered him a <b>filibuster.</b> His Chetniks successfully kept the Ustaše out of Knin and its surroundings, sparing the local Serb population from further massacres.|$|E

5|$|Jackson's successor, President Martin Van Buren, viewed Texas {{annexation}} as {{an immense}} political liability that would empower the anti-slavery northern Whig opposition – especially if annexation provoked {{a war with}} Mexico. Presented with a formal annexation proposal from Texas minister Memucan Hunt, Jr. in August 1837, Van Buren summarily rejected it. Annexation resolutions presented separately in each house of Congress were either soundly defeated or tabled through <b>filibuster.</b> After the election of 1838, new Texas president Mirabeau B. Lamar withdrew his republic's offer of annexation due to these failures. Texans were at an annexation impasse when John Tyler entered the White House in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Keyes first {{stated that}} he was {{considering}} leaving the Republican Party during a January 2008 appearance on The Weekly <b>Filibuster</b> radio show. He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1,191 delegates to the Republican National Convention, {{even though he was}} no longer campaigning for the Republican nomination. On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo {{in the form of a}} dead elephant. This appeared to be an indication of Keyes's intentions to quit the Republican party and to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party's presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|McClellan {{resigned}} {{his commission}} January 16, 1857, and, capitalizing on {{his experience with}} railroad assessment, became chief engineer {{and vice president of}} the Illinois Central Railroad, and then president of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad in 1860. He performed well in both jobs, expanding the Illinois Central toward New Orleans and helping the Ohio and Mississippi recover from the Panic of 1857. Despite his successes and lucrative salary ($10,000 per year), he was frustrated with civilian employment and continued to study classical military strategy assiduously. During the Utah War against the Mormons, he considered rejoining the Army. He also considered service as a <b>filibuster</b> in support of Benito Juárez in Mexico.|$|E
