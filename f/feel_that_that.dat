6000|$|... "Yes, I understand," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley. [...] "What a pity she couldn't {{be made to}} <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> didn't {{deepen the}} {{obligation}} at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How sweet you are!' she cried. 'I {{feel that}} {{what you say is}} true. I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is what a wife should be to her husband. Please God, I will be so to Frank!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> why I'd {{like to take}} it up. It's the only thing out here <b>that</b> {{interests}} me--and I've got to do something. I can't loaf." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2012 Prendergast {{announced}} his retirement from inter-county hurling saying [...] "I just feel I have enough done at this stage, I'm involved for 12 years and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> probably enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I always <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> my {{only way}} of showing anything. It's absurd, if you like," [...] Mrs. Blessingbourne pursued, [...] "but I never know, in such intense discussions, what strange {{impression}} I may give." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't any {{old family}} feeling about Follingsbee," [...] said John. [...] "But I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> man {{deserves to be}} in State's prison much more than many a poor dog that is there now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} would be very much use if I did," [...] she said. [...] "One can't go sailing always--and if you <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is a pity, you can think of the rain and the wind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mrs Poynsett {{must always}} <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> wretched {{marriage}} broke her son's heart, and murdered him!--murdered him!" [...] said Rosamond to herself, clenching that soft fist of hers. [...] "It {{ought not to}} be broached to her!" ...|$|E
5000|$|No Free Lunch {{does not}} blame drug {{companies}} {{for trying to}} market their products; the group <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is the companies' job. [...] Rather, it believes <b>that</b> physicians are allowing themselves to be courted and swayed by advertisers.|$|R
500|$|We used to {{get more}} {{negative}} reactions when [...] didn't have as loud of stuff. [...] It's just, be super loud and you're all set. [...] (laughs) The rock and roll has been revealed. [...] I do <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> the message - if there's any message, <b>that's</b> what it is. [...] This is kinda what we do to keep ourselves excited these days. [...] In these days - everyone knows what I'm talking about. (laughs) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunt," [...] {{she said}} with a little tremor in her voice, [...] "it is almost bewildering. Still one seemed to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> what <b>that</b> man has done could never have been the work of Lance Courthorne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How massive!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "What splendid limbs! And {{look at that}} immense head! I know I {{shall never}} be afraid now. I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is a dog I can rely upon. Make him stand up, please, so I can see how tall he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then see to it, Jan, as speedily as you can. I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{man down}} below is our evil genius. While he lives Chance will be against us, of that I am as {{convinced}} as I am {{of the justice}} of our cause. If that man lives, Jan, the Stadtholder will escape us; I feel it in my bones: something must have told me this in the night--it is a premonition that comes from above." ...|$|E
60|$|George Bertram, {{as we have}} seen, {{returned}} to town after his interview with Miss Waddington without seeing his father. Neither to his mind nor to hers was any comfort brought by that grammatical rule in which Miss Baker had found so much consolation. For both of them the separation was now a thing completed. Each knew enough of the other to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> other's pride was too high to admit {{of his or her}} making any first fresh advancement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, she doesn't contradict. But she-- There is {{something}} about her-- One <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> things <b>that</b> are most important and vital are nothing to her. Don't you feel it? She comes from another world to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Scarcely. Sometimes he was {{on leave}} in my holidays, and you know {{we were at the}} depot afterwards, but I shall always <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> all <b>that</b> I {{have been able to do}} since has been owing to him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As the Voices {{have told}} you {{you are going to}} Paradise, you <b>feel</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>that</b> will happen and <b>that</b> you will not be damned in hell. Is <b>that</b> so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Muriel's talents," [...] said Corky, with {{a little}} cough [...] "lie more in the {{direction}} of the drama, Bertie. I didn't mention it before, but one of our reasons for being a trifle nervous as to how Uncle Alexander will receive the news is that Muriel is in the chorus of that show Choose your Exit at the Manhattan. It's absurdly unreasonable, but we both <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> fact might increase Uncle Alexander's natural tendency to kick like a steer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you what there is about her which is so fetching," [...] Drummond, who was {{lounging}} by, declared. [...] "She contrives somehow to strike the personal note in an amazing manner. You are wedged in amongst a crowd, perhaps in the promenade, you lean over the back, you are almost out of sight. Yet you catch her eye--you can't seem to escape from it. You <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> smile is for you, the words are for you, the whole song is for you. Naturally you shout yourself hoarse when she has finished, and feel jolly pleased with yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't; I {{think she}} is dreadfully common," [...] said Mrs. Follingsbee: [...] "she {{is one of those}} women who can't talk any thing but baby, and bores Charlie half to death. But then, you know, when there is a liaison like mine with Charlie, one can't be too careful to {{cultivate}} the wives. Les convenances, you know, are the all-important things. I send her presents constantly, and send my carriage around to take her to church or opera, or any thing that is going on, and have her children at my fancy parties: yet, for all that, the creature has not a particle of gratitude; those narrow-minded women never have. You know I am very susceptible to people's atmospheres; and I always <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> creature is just as full of spite and jealousy as she can stick in her skin." ...|$|E
50|$|Compassion {{consists}} of three major requirements: People must <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> troubles <b>that</b> evoke their feelings are serious, the understanding <b>that</b> sufferers' troubles are not self-inflicted, and ability to picture oneself with the same problems in a non-blaming and non-shaming manner.|$|R
50|$|The five play {{without realizing}} the social {{differences}} <b>that</b> separate them and <b>feel</b> confident <b>that</b> <b>that</b> friendship will last forever. But the holidays end and, {{with the exception}} of Lancelotti and Mary, they never meet.|$|R
5000|$|Like many noise rock bands, Lightning Bolt mostly plays {{extremely}} loud, aggressive music. In {{the film}} The Power of Salad, Gibson attributes {{much of their}} success to volume:We used to get more negative reactions when we didn't have as loud of stuff. It's just, be super loud and you're all set. (laughs) The rock and roll has been revealed. I do <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> the message - if there's any message, <b>that's</b> what it is.

60|$|Of Mr Samuel Rubb, junior, we {{must say}} a few words. His first {{acquaintance}} with our heroine was not made under circumstances favourable to him. In that matter of the loan, he departed very widely from the precept which teaches us that honesty is the best policy. And when I feel that our Margaret was at one time really {{in danger of becoming}} Mrs Rubb,--that in her ignorance of the world, in the dark gropings of her social philosophy, amidst the difficulties of her solitude, she had not known whether she could do better with herself and her future years, than give herself, and them, and her money to Mr Samuel Rubb, I tremble as I look back upon her danger. It has been said of women that they have an insane desire for matrimony. I believe that the desire, even if it be as general as is here described, is no insanity. But when I see such a woman as Margaret Mackenzie in danger from such a man as Samuel Rubb, junior, I am driven to fear that there may sometimes be a maniacal tendency. But Samuel Rubb was by no means a bad man. He first hankered after the woman's money, but afterwards he had loved the woman; and my female reader, if she agrees with me, will <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> virtue covers a multitude of sins.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{argument}} {{would not}} have any influence with you personally, but, taking your position with regard to Mademoiselle de Pointdexter, it should have great weight. You can judge, from {{what you would have}} felt yourself, had you been aware of her disappearance, what she would feel, did she hear of your death in this quarrel. Were you her brother, I should say that you would be right--nay, that it would be your duty to endeavour to punish the outrage against the honour of your family. Were you openly betrothed to her, you would again have the right to punish her abductor; but, not being either her brother or her betrothed, neither reason nor public opinion would justify your doing so. Moreover, did you fight with him and kill him, you would incur the gravest resentment of the king; for, in fact, you would be impugning his justice, which has considered banishment from court to be a sufficient punishment for his offence. Not only was he a favourite of the king's, but he belongs, I understand, to a powerful family; who would, you may be sure, use their influence with the king to bring about your punishment, for the breach of the decree against duelling, and you would be fortunate if you escaped a long imprisonment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay!" [...] {{he said in}} a {{tone that}} was almost insolent in its proud defiance, [...] "there is but little that a man cannot do an he sets his mind to it. For the rest, 'tis in God's hands!" [...] he added more gently. [...] "Dear heart! you swore that you would be brave. The Dauphin is still in France, and until he is out of it he will not really be safe; his friends wanted to keep him inside the country. God only knows what they still hope; had I been free I should not have allowed him to remain so long; now those good people at Mantes will yield to my letter and to Ffoulkes' earnest appeal--they will allow one of our League to convey the child safely out of France, and I'll wait here until I know that he is safe. If I tried to get away now, and succeeded--why, Heaven help us! the hue and cry might turn against the child, and he might be {{captured}} before I could get to him. Dear heart! dear, dear heart! try to understand. The safety of that child is bound with mine honour, but I swear to you, my sweet love, that the day on which I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> safety is assured I will save mine own skin--what there is left of it--if I can!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am greatly {{obliged to}} you, General," [...] he said; [...] "but I do {{not at all}} <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the {{services}} <b>that</b> I have tried to perform----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven forbid I {{should do}} {{anything}} of the kind! I know moreover <b>that</b> his mother doesn't want him to marry young. She holds it the worst of mistakes, she <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> at <b>that</b> age a man never really chooses. He doesn't choose till he has lived a while, till he has looked about and compared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{much more}} than <b>that.</b> She seems to be failing every way. The doctor has told her she ought {{to get away from}} Florence." [...] Colville could not speak; Imogene went on. [...] "She's always delicate, you know. And I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> all <b>that's</b> keeping her here now is the news from home <b>that</b> I--we're waiting for." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were six}} of us went into this new banishment. My brother Henry had left Cambridge and was ill. My younger sister was ill. And though as yet we hardly told each other that it was so, we began to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> desolating fiend, consumption, was among us. My father was broken-hearted as well as ill, but {{whenever}} he could sit at his table he still worked at his ecclesiastical records. My elder sister and I were in good health, but I was an idle, desolate hanger-on, that most hopeless of human beings, a hobbledehoy of nineteen, without any idea of a career, or a profession, or a trade. As well as I can remember I was fairly happy, for there were pretty girls at Bruges with whom I could fancy that I was in love; and I {{had been removed from}} the real misery of school. But as to my future life I had not even an aspiration. Now and again there would arise a feeling that it was hard upon my mother that she should have to do so much for us, that we should be idle while she was forced to work so constantly; but we should probably have thought more of that had she not taken to work as though it were the recognised condition of life for an old lady of fifty-five.|$|E
6000|$|As he sat by {{her bedside}} sleepless and agonized, {{night and day}} for five days together, one prayer only rose to his lips time after time: [...] "Heaven grant she may die!" [...] He had depth enough in the civilized side of his soul to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> {{was the only way}} to save her from a lifelong shame. [...] "If she gets well," [...] he said to himself, trembling, [...] "I will leave this accursed Africa at once. I will work my way back to England as a common sailor, and send her home by the mail with my {{remaining}} money. I will never inflict my presence upon her again, for she cannot be persuaded, if once she recovers, that she did not see me, as she did see me, a bare-limbed heathen Fantee brandishing a devilish tom-tom. But I shall get work in England--not a parson's; that I can never be again--but clerk's work, labourer's work, navvy's work, anything! Look at my arms: I rowed five in the Magdalen eight: I could hold a spade as well as any man. I will toil, and slave, and save, and keep her still like a lady, if I starve for it myself, but she shall never see my face again, if once she recovers. Even then it will be a living death for her, poor angel! There is only one hope--Heaven grant she may die!" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, first, a son must be of {{the same}} nature as his father,--that is certain. Each kind of animal brings forth after its kind: the lion begets lions, the sheep, sheep; {{the son of a}} man must be a man, of one {{substance}} with his earthly father; and by the same law, the Son of God must be God. Take away that notion: say that the only- begotten Son of God is not very God of very God, of one substance with His Father, and the word son means nothing. If a son be not of the same substance as his father, he is not a son at all. And more, a perfect son must be as great and as good as his father, exactly like his father in everything. That is the very meaning of father and son; that like should beget like. Among fallen and imperfect men, some sons are worse and weaker than their fathers: but we all <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is an evil, a thing to be sorry for, a sad consequence of our fallen state. Our reasons and hearts tell us that a son ought to be equal to his father, and that it is in some way an affliction, almost a shame, to a father, if his children are weaker or worse than he is. But we cannot fancy such a thing in God; the only-begotten perfect Son of the Almighty and perfect Father must be at least equal to His Father, as great as His Father, as good as His Father; the brightness of His Father's glory, and the express image of His Father's person.|$|E

5000|$|He was {{remembered the}} {{occasion}} when El Monstruo asked the Gaviota de Plata (Silver Seagull) award for José Luis Rodríguez in 1988; {{the refusal of}} the mayor of Viña del Mar, Eugenia Garrido, who in the 1980s was who corroborated the awards, the singer said [...] "Sometimes the people's voice must be heard", a phrase which some had a political background {{in relation to the}} military regime then ruling the country; the artist has said his sentence was not thought out or had a direct political intention. Rodriguez has indicated <b>that</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> in <b>that</b> case it was a [...] "tool for greater spiritual ideal." ...|$|R
