40|$|A {{physiological}} flow {{model is}} presented to account for plasma level double peaks based on cyclical <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> and intestinal motility in the fasted state. Central to the model {{is the assumption that}} <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> and intestinal transit rates will vary directly with the strength of the contractile activity characteristic of the fasted state motility cycle. Simulated curves clearly indicate that variable <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> can result in variable absorption rates from the gastrointestinal tract and double peaks in the plasma level curves of cimetidine. Vital to the occurrence of double peaks are (i) dosing time relative to phasic activity, (ii) variability in flow out of the stomach, and (iii) a small <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> constant Q s /V s, {{for a period of time}} within the first hour after administration. Variability in intestinal flow rates alone does not cause a double peak in the plasma level curve. Results of the simulations, as well as experimental results, can be categorized according to the shapes of the plasma level curves into four types: type A, C pmax (1) C pmax (2); type D, C pmax (1) =C pmax (2). Assuming that the experimental results were obtained from fasted subjects, with the time of dose administration being a random variable, the frequency of the experimental curves having shape A, B, C, or D correlates extremely well with theoretical predictions. It is concluded that variable <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> due to the motility cycle can account for plasma level double peaks. Furthermore, variable <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> combined with the short plasma elimination half-life and poor gastric absorption of cimetidine can be the cause of the frequently observed plasma level double peaks...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We have {{recently}} described a reservoir for rectal replacement after total mesorectal excision for rectal carcinoma. The ileocecal segment with its intact extrinsic nerve and blood supply is placed between the ascending colon and the anal canal. This reconstruction {{has been shown}} to provide good defecation quality and anorectal function. Whether <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> and small as well as large bowel transit are affected by this transposition remains unclear. Our aim was to quantify whole gut transit in such patients and compare it with that of a matched group of controls. METHODS: <b>Gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> and small intestinal and colonic transit times were assessed scintigraphically in 12 patients aged 46 to 87 years with ileocecal reservoir reconstruction after total mesorectal excision and compared to a sex-matched group of asymptomatic healthy volunteers of similar age. <b>Gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> and small intestinal and colonic transit times were calculated as described previously. Data were compared using Wilcoxon's signed rank test for <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> and small bowel transit or by analysis of variance for colonic transit; p < 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Gastric time for half of the meal (T 50) was 161 +/- 16 minutes for patients and 201 +/- 22 for the controls. Small bowel transit time was 150 +/- 15 minutes for patients and 177 +/- 22 for the controls. Geometric center at 6 hours was 1. 53 +/- 0. 13 for patients and 1. 27 +/- 0. 16 for the controls.

Summary: <b>Gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> and small bowel transit and colonic transit times (expressed as geometric center at 6 and 24 hours) were similar in patients with ileocecal reservoir reconstruction and in a sex- and age-matched group of healthy controls.

40|$|The {{variable}} <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> of a {{test meal}} {{is one of the}} major problems in evaluating accurately gastrointestinal physiological functions beyond the stomach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> on the rate of intraluminal lipolysis. Thirty four subjects without pancreatic disease (21 with a normal gastric emptying and 13 with a known slow gastric emptying) and 14 subjects with pancreatic disease (four without and 10 with pancreatic insufficiency) were studied using a dual labelled breath test. The test meal consisted of one egg, 60 grams of white bread, 10 grams of margarine, and 150 ml of water (350 kcal). The egg yolk was labelled with 91 mg of 13 C-octanoic acid, the margarine was labelled with 296 kBq of distearyl- 2 - 14 C-octanoyl-glycerol. Breath samples were taken every 15 minutes during six hours and analysed for 13 CO 2 and 14 CO 2 content. The <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> of the meal was evaluated by the gastric emptying coefficient, the half emptying time, and the lag phase; the rate of intraluminal lipolysis was evaluated by the six hours cumulative 14 CO 2 excretion. Despite a clear distinction in the rate of intraluminal lipolysis, no difference could be detected in <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> of the test meal between subjects without and with pancreatic disease. In subjects with pancreatic insufficiency, intraluminal hydrolysis was the rate limiting process in fat assimilation; in patients without pancreatic insufficiency, however, gastric emptying could be rate limiting. Therefore, patients with known slow gastric emptying, displayed a significantly decreased rate of intraluminal lipolysis compared with normal controls. This decrease could be corrected for accurately using a correction factor based on the gastric emptying coefficient. In conclusion, the combined 13 C-octanoic acid and 14 C-mixed triglyceride breath test permits the measurement of <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> and intraluminal lipolysis simultaneously in a minimally invasive way. Correction of intraluminal lipolysis rate for <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> of the given test meal permits evaluation of fat assimilation rates in a physiological way regardless of gastric emptying disorders...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{order to}} know the role of gastric {{emptying}} in the mechanism of weight loss and early satiety after a restrictive surgical procedure for treatment of morbid obesity, a consecutive series of patients were scintigraphically investigated before and after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. METHODS: Sixteen patients undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding underwent preoperatively, and at 6 months postoperatively, a gastric emptying study (solid meal and single isotope). Esophageal retention time, lag phase, peak activity time, <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate,</b> fundus emptying rate, and weight loss were recorded. Upper GI symptom assessment {{was carried out by}} using a standardized questionnaire. Gastric emptying parameters were correlated with the upper GI symptoms. RESULTS: Gastric band placement showed no significant influence on postoperative <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> [median % (interquartile range) : 42 (23. 3 - 59) preoperatively vs 38 (31 - 71) postoperatively and fundus emptying rate: 59 (37 - 91) preoperatively vs 70 (53 - 89) postoperatively]; however, an increase in early satiety was found. Neither <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> nor fundus emptying rate showed a relation with early satiety or weight loss.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that duodenal acidification strongly inhibits gastric acid secretion, <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> and gastrin release.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pattern of}} {{progression}} {{of a meal}} from the stomach to the caecum in diabetes mellitus is controversial and the differential roles of transit through the jejunum and the ileum have not been investigated in diabetes. AIMS: To determine <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> and transit <b>rates</b> through proximal and distal regions of the small bowel in type I diabetic patients. SUBJECTS: The study included six diabetic patients with evidence of autonomic neuropathy (DM-AN group), 11 diabetics without autonomic dysfunction (DM group), and 15 control volunteers. METHODS: <b>Gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> and small bowel transit of a liquid meal were evaluated scintigraphically in these subjects. Transit through regions of interest corresponding to the proximal and distal small intestine up to the caecum was determined and correlated with <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates,</b> cardiovascular measurements of autonomic function, and the occurrence of diarrhoea. RESULTS: <b>Gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> and transit through the proximal small bowel were similar in the three groups. The meal arrived to the caecum significantly earlier in DM-AN patients (median; range: 55 min; 22 [...] > 180 min) than in the DM group (100 min; 44 [...] > 180 min, p 180 min, p < 0. 02). Accumulation of chyme in the distal small bowel was decreased in DM-AN patients, who showed values for peak activity (30 %; 10 - 55 %) significantly lower than in the DM group (49 %; 25 - 77 %, p = 0. 02) and controls (50 %; 30 - 81 %, p = 0. 02).

In a double-blind, four-period crossover study eight subjects received single doses of 0. 5, 2, or 10 mg MK- 329, or placebo, followed by an intravenous infusion of CCK- 8 (30 pmol/kg. h). In placebo-treated subjects gallblad-der volumes decreased on average to 43 % of initial volumes after 2 h of CCK infusion. MK- 329 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of CCK-stimulated gallbladder contraction with 10 mg producing complete blockade (P < 0. 01, cf. placebo). Gallbladder contraction and <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> after a mixed meal were then measured in a two-period crossover study. Subjects received placebo or 10 mg of MK- 329 2 h before eating. <b>Gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> of both solids and liquids was measured simultaneously by gamma scintigraphy. In placebo-treated subjects plasma CCK levels increased postprandially to 2. 3 pM, gallbladder volumes decreased 68. 4 ± 3. 8 % (SE), and the times for 50 % emptying of liquids and solids from the stomach were 58 ± 10 and 128 ± 8 min, respectively. In MK- 329 -treated subjects there was a marked elevation in peak CCK levels to 13. 8 pM (P < 0. 01, cf. placebo), and gallbladder contraction was completely inhibited. Solid and liquid empty-ing rates were unaffected. These findings demonstrate that (a) MK- 329 is a potent, orally active antagonist ofCCK in humans, and (b) CCK is the major regulator of postprandial gallbladder contraction. These data also support the concept of negative feedback regulation of CCK secretion and suggest that mechanisms other than CCK play a dominant role in the regulation of postprandial <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

Propantheline significantly reduced the <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate,</b> with a decreased gastric emptying coefficient (p = 0. 0007) and an increased gastric half emptying time (p = 0. 0168) in all subjects, but {{no change in the}} lag phase (p = 0. 1214). Further mathematical analysis showed that breath sampling at 15 minutes intervals over a four hour period is recommended to guarantee accuracy and the discriminative value of the breath test in various gastric emptying patterns. In conclusion the *C labelled octanoic acid breath test is sufficiently sensitive to show pharmacologically induced changes of gastric emptying rates of solids...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of two techniques to measure the <b>rate</b> of <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying.</b> A noninvasive scintigraphic technique using a gammacamera and an invasive aspiration technique based on dye dilution were performed simultaneously. Seven healthy male volunteers each consumed two different liquid meals on two separate occasions. Scintigraphic measurements were performed continuously with aspiration every 10 minutes {{for a total of}} one hour. <b>Gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> were expressed as slope values after semilog linearisation of the emptying curves. Agreement between the two methods was assessed from the individual differences and mean of the two techniques, {{as well as from the}} geometric mean, including 95 % limits of agreement. The scintigraphic technique gave a 70 % slower <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> than the dye dilution technique. However, the 95 % limits of agreement are large (1. 56 to 0. 30), reflecting the small sample size and the large coefficient of variation in the techniques used...|$|R
40|$|After a meal, the {{proximal}} stomach relaxes probably through the activation of nitrergic neurons in the gastric wall. Nitric oxide-induced smooth muscle relaxation involves activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, with cGMP production, {{which is then}} degradated by phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE- 5). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of sildenafil, a selective PDE- 5 inhibitor, on fasting and postprandial proximal gastric volume and on <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> in humans. A gastric barostat was used to study gastric compliance and perception to isobaric distension in healthy subjects before and after placebo (n = 13) or sildenafil, 50 mg (n = 15). In 10 healthy subjects, two gastric barostat studies were performed in randomized order to study the effect of placebo or sildenafil on postprandial gastric relaxation. Similarly, solid and liquid <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> were studied in 12 healthy subjects. Sildenafil significantly increased fasting intragastric volume (141 +/- 15 vs. 163 +/- 15 ml, P < 0. 05) and volumes of first perception. Sildenafil induced a higher and prolonged gastric relaxation either at 30 min (357 +/- 38 vs. 253 +/- 42 ml, P < 0. 05) or 60 min (348 +/- 49 vs. 247 +/- 38 ml, P < 0. 05) after the meal. Sildenafil did not alter solid half-emptying time but significantly delayed liquid emptying (43 +/- 4 vs. 56 +/- 4 min, P < 0. 01). In conclusion, sildenafil significantly increases postprandial gastric volume and slows liquid <b>emptying</b> <b>rate,</b> confirming that meal-induced accommodation in humans involves the activation of a nitrergic pathway. The effect of sildenafil on gastric fundus suggests a therapeutic potential for phosphodiesterase inhibitors in patients with impaired gastric accommodation. status: publishe...|$|R

Introduction: Delayed <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> (DGE) often occurs in patients with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) due to neurological impairment (NI). 13 C has been used as an alternative tool for measuring the <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} predict <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> in children with GER using 13 C-acetate breath test (ABT) by 24 -hour pH monitoring.

40|$|Tacrolimus is {{characterized}} by a highly variable oral bioavailability and narrow therapeutic window. Tacrolimus absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is to a large extent determined by the genotypic, phenotypic, and functional expression of P-glycoprotein and CYP 3 A in the gut wall and liver. It is disputed whether the <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> per se is important for determining oral bioavailability of tacrolimus and whether delayed gastric emptying is clinically relevant for therapeutic drug dosing. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study in 50 renal recipients, measuring simultaneously the rate of gastric emptying using a carbon- 14 -octanoic acid breath test and quantifying drug exposure by area under the concentration-time curve sampling. Gastric half emptying time (t 1 / 2) significantly correlated with time to reach maximum blood tacrolimus (tmax) concentration (r 2 = 0. 30; p < 0. 0001), whereas the gastric emptying coefficient, reflecting the overall <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate,</b> showed a weak inverse correlation with tmax (r 2 = 0. 14; p = 0. 007). The time-dependent rate of gastric emptying strongly correlated with the simultaneously measured blood tacrolimus concentration over the first 4 h after oral drug administration (r 2 = 0. 96; p < 0. 0001). Comparison between patients with and without delayed gastric emptying confirmed that maximum blood tacrolimus concentration was reached significantly more slowly in the former group (tmax, 2 +/- 1 h versus 1. 48 +/- 0. 68 h; p = 0. 04), whereas the extent of tacrolimus absorption was not different. Despite a strong association between <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> and the timing of tacrolimus absorption from the gut in stable recipients, <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> does not affect the total extent of drug absorption and is not responsible for significant alterations in drug exposure, even in situations of delayed gastric emptying. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Delayed <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> as a {{potential}} mechanism for lowered glycemia after eating sourdough bread: studies in humans and rats using test products with added organic acids or an organic salt 13 Helena GM Liljeberg and Inger ME Bj#{ 246 }rck ABSTRACT The possible effects of organic acids or an or-ganic salt on the rate of gastric emptying was studied to identify the cause for reduced postmeal responses of blood glucose and insulin to foods containing such components, eg, sourdough bread. Paracetamol was included in bread products with added lactic acid or sodium propionate and used as a marker for the rate of gastric emptying in healthy subjects. In parallel, postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, and satiety were evaluated. The influence of lactic acid, propionic acid, and sodium propionate was also studied in rats after they were tube-fed with glucose solutions. The bread products with lactic acid or sodium propionate both lowered blood glucose and insulin responses. The bread with sodium propionate also prolonged satiety. The reason for the lowered metabolic responses with sodium propionate was probably a lowered <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate,</b> as judged from reduced blood paracetamol concen-trations; {{there was no such}} effect observed with bread with added lactic acid. A similar amount of lactic acid in solution tube-fed to rats did not affect the disappearence of glucose from the stomach. In contrast with the finding in humans, sodium propionate had no effect on the rate of gastric emptying in rats whereas an equimolar solution of propionic acid reduced <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> in rats. Possibly, less of this acid was produced in the gastric contents after a bolus load of a sodium propionate solution (in rats) than in an eating situation. Also, the pH and/or the osmolarity may be im-portant, and when provided in excessive amounts, lactic acid reduced the <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rate</b> in rats. A hydrochloric acid solution of similar pH was much less effective in this respect...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the extent to which oat particle size in a porridge could alter glucose absorption, <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying,</b> gastrointestinal hormone response, and subjective feelings of appetite and satiety. Porridge was prepared from either oat flakes or oat flour with the same protein, fat, carbohydrate, and mass. These were fed to eight volunteers on separate days in a crossover study, and subjective appetite ratings, gastric contents, and plasma glucose, insulin, and gastrointestinal hormones were determined over a period of 3 h. The flake porridge gave a lower glucose response than the flour porridge, and there were apparent differences in <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> in both the early and late postprandial phases. The appetite ratings showed similar differences between early- and late-phase behavior. The structure of the oat flakes remained sufficiently intact to delay their <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying,</b> leading to a lower glycemic response, even though initial <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> were similar for the flake and flour porridge. This highlights the need to take food structure into account when considering relatively simple physiological measures and offering nutritional guidance...|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} species {{is based on}} which will give the best {{correlation}} to human trials. Differences in the gut, enzyme activity, circulatory system, or other considerations make certain models more appropriate based on the dosage form, site of activity, or noxious metabolites. For example, canines may not be good models for solid oral dosage forms because the characteristic carnivore intestine is underdeveloped compared to the omnivore's, and <b>gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>rates</b> are increased. Also, rodents can not act as models for antibiotic drugs because the resulting alteration to their intestinal flora causes significant adverse effects. Depending on a drug's functional groups, it may be metabolized in similar or different ways between species, which will affect both efficacy and toxicology.|$|R

METHODS [...] <b>Gastric</b> <b>emptying</b> of a 5 % glucose solution and an iso-osmotic maltodextrin solution was measured using 3 MBq of 99 mtechnetium labelled diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) and continuous gamma camera imaging in five male subjects. The subjects performed four 1 h trials at 70 % VO 2 peak on a cycle ergometer. After 15 min, 200 ml of a radiolabelled solution of glucose or maltodextrin were ingested in a blind crossover protocol. The two solutions were each ingested on separate occasions (trial 1 and trial 2) to establish repeatability.
