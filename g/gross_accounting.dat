40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} various zero emissions scenarios under A 1 T of IPCC-SRES (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – Special Report of Emissions Scenarios) that allowed {{economic growth in}} particularly technological progress. We used our global modeling including a simplified climate model, whose supply costs of sectors in energies, materials, biomass and foods were minimized by linear programming from 2010 to 2150 in order to draw various zero emissions scenarios. In this study, we focused on various scenarios of CO 2 zero emissions from the sectors and their climate change mitigations and their costs. Inclusion of Non CO 2 greenhouse gases (NCGHG) can be chosen. We set following four scenarios. First one is Business As Usual (BAU) without any climate policy intervention. Second one is denoted as “ 350 ppm zero”, whose emissions trajectories are zero {{in the latter half}} of this century, which can be achieved by giving cumulative emissions of WRE 350 (Wigley Richels Edmonds) from 2010 to 2150 as emissions constraint. Caveating that this scenario add on the allowed WRE 350 emissions after 2010. Third one is denoted as “net zero”, whose cumulative emissions from 2010 to 2150 is zero. This does not mean keep the emissions level zero in the time horizon; allowing positive emissions in several decades while negative emissions achieved by large deployment of BECCS (biomass energy carbon capture and storage). Fourth one is keeping the emissions level after 2100 is zero emissions, which is denoted as “ 2100 zero”. We considered several patterns of carbon accounting for BECCS, such as carbon neutral, <b>gross</b> <b>accounting,</b> and net accounting. We also considered that two patterns of storage options for BECCS, one is only forest sink, the other one is allowing the captured CO 2 into both the forest sink and geological storage. Following results when adding NCGHG emissions are obtained. Global mean temperature rise up to 2150 below 2 degree Celsius (DC) can be achieved in the “net zero” scenario, while “ 350 ppm zero” scenario leached 2. 3 DC. The “ 2010 zero” scenario leached 4 DC while BAU about 5 DC...|$|E

5000|$|The {{inspiration}} for Pasikowski {{to write and}} direct the film, which was originally titled Kaddish (the Jewish prayer read by those in mourning), was the controversy in Poland surrounding the 2000 publication of Neighbors by Polish-American historian Jan T. Gross. According to Gross's historical research into the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, Polish gentiles had murdered the hundreds of Jewish residents of Jedwabne, contrary to the official history which held the Nazi occupying force accountable. <b>Gross's</b> <b>account</b> of the Jedwabne massacre was a jarring development for Poles, [...] "accustomed to seeing themselves as victims during World War II", rather than the victimizers.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes a film may do {{reasonably}} {{well at the}} box office, but still be considered a bomb due to a large budget. For example, 2005's Sahara cost over $241 million to make (including marketing and distribution), {{due in part to}} exorbitant production costs. It took in $122 million, usually enough to be successful. However, in this case, this accounted for barely over half of its expenses. In 2012, Disney reported losses of $200 million on John Carter; at that time the film had made a considerable $234 million worldwide, but this was far short of its $250 million budget plus worldwide advertising. 47 Ronin, which was released in 2013, made over $151 million at the box office. However, the film cost a total of $225 million to make due to its exorbitant production costs, and its box office <b>gross</b> <b>accounted</b> for barely over 2/3 of its expenses.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} U. S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ {{integration}} initiative (Yuskavage, 2000; Moyer et al., 2004 a, 2004 b; Lawson et al., 2006), the Industry Accounts Directorate {{is drawing}} upon the Stone method (Stone et al., 1942) and Chen (2006) to reconcile the gross operating surplus component of value-added from the 2002 expenditure-based benchmark input-output accounts and the 2002 income-based <b>gross</b> domestic product-by-industry <b>accounts.</b> The objective of the reconciliation is to use information regarding the relative reliabilities of underlying data in both the benchmark input-output use table and the <b>gross</b> domestic product-by-industry <b>accounts</b> in a balanced input-output framework {{in order to improve}} intermediate input estimates and gross operating surplus estimates in both accounts. Given a balanced input-output framework, the Stone method also provides a tool for balancing the benchmark use table. This paper presents work by the Industry Accounts Directorate to develop and implement the reconciliation and balancing model. The paper provides overviews of the benchmark use table and <b>gross</b> domestic product-by-industry <b>accounts,</b> including features of external source data and adjustment methodologies that are relevant for the reconciliation. In addition, the paper presents the empirical model that the Industry Accounts Directorate is building and briefly describes the technology used to solve the model. Preliminary work during development of the model shows that reconciling and balancing a large system with disaggregated data is computationally feasible and efficient in pursuit of an economically accurate and reliable benchmark use table and <b>gross</b> domestic product-by-industry <b>accounts.</b> ...|$|R
