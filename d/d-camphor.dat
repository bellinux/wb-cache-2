We cloned from a Hindlll DNA library of PpGl a 2. 9 kbp CAM segment which carries the major part of camA gene encoding NADH-putidaredoxin reductase and the entire camB gene encoding putidaredoxin. The 2. 9 kbp CAM segment was adjacent to the 4. 27 kbp Hindlll CAM segment which has been previous-ly cloned (Koga et al. (1986) J. BacterioL 166, 1089 - 1095).

Presl, which were found to possess strong fumigant toxicity against Tribolium castaneum and Lasioderma serricorne adults. The essential oils of the plants were extracted by the method of steam distillation using a Clavenger apparatus.

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 cin catalyzes the monooxygenation of 1, 8 -cineole, {{which is}} {{structurally}} {{very similar to}} <b>D-camphor,</b> the substrate for the most thoroughly investigated cytochrome P 450, cytochrome P 450 cam. Both 1, 8 -cineole and <b>D-camphor</b> are C- 10 monoterpenes containing a single oxygen atom with very similar molecular volumes. The cytochrome P 450 cin-substrate complex crystal structure has been solved to 1. 7 Angstrom resolution and {{compared with that of}} cytochrome P 450 cam. Despite the similarity in substrates, the active site of cytochrome P 450 cin is substantially different from that of cytochrome P 450 cam in that the B 2 ̆ 7 helix, essential for substrate binding in many cytochrome P 450 s including cytochrome P 450 cam, is replaced by an ordered loop that results in substantial changes in active site topography. In addition, cytochrome P 450 cin does not have the conserved threonine, Thr 252 in cytochrome P 450 cam, which is generally considered {{as an integral part of}} the proton shuttle machinery required for oxygen activation. Instead, the analogous residue in cytochrome P 450 cin is Asn 242, which provides the only direct protein H-bonding interaction with the substrate. Cytochrome P 450 cin uses a flavodoxin-like redox partner to reduce the heme iron rather than the more traditional ferredoxin-like Fe 2 S 2 redox partner used by cytochrome P 450 cam and many other bacterial P 450 s. It thus might be expected that the redox partner docking site of cytochrome P 450 cin would resemble that of cytochrome P 450 BM 3, which also uses a flavodoxin-like redox partner. Nevertheless, the putative docking site topography more closely resembles cytochrome P 450 cam than cytochrome P 450 BM 3...|$|E
40|$|Site-directed mutants of {{cytochrome}} P- 450 cam (the cytochrome P- 450 {{that acts}} as the terminal monooxygenase in the <b>d-camphor</b> monooxygenase system), in which threonine- 252 had been changed to alanine, valine, or serine, were employed to study {{the role of the}} hydroxy amino acid in the monooxygenase reaction. The mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified by a conventional method. All the mutant enzymes in the presence of <b>d-camphor</b> exhibited optical absorption spectra almost indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme in their ferric, ferrous, oxygenated, and carbon monoxide ferrous forms. In a reconstituted system with putidaredoxin and its reductase, the alanine enzyme consumed O 2 at a rate (1100 per min per heme) comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme (1330 per min per heme), whereas the amount of exo- 5 -hydroxycamphor formed was less than 10 % of that formed by the wild-type enzyme. About 85 % of the O 2 consumed was recovered as H 2 O 2. The valine enzyme also exhibited an oxidase activity to yield H 2 O 2 accompanied by a relative decrease in the monooxygenase activity. On the other hand, the serine enzyme exhibited essentially the same monooxygenase activity as that of the wild-type enzyme. Thus, uncoupling of O 2 consumption from the monooxygenase function was produced by the substitution of an amino acid without a hydroxyl group. When binding of O 2 to the ferrous forms was examined, the alanine and valine enzymes formed instantaneously an oxygenated form, which slowly decomposed to the ferric form with rates of 5. 5 and 3. 2 x 10 (- 3) sec- 1 for the former and latter enzymes, respectively. Since these rates were too slow to account for the overall rates of O 2 consumption, the formation of H 2 O 2 was considered to proceed not by way of this route but through the decomposition of a peroxide complex formed by reduction of the oxygenated form by reduced putidaredoxin. Based on these findings, a possible mechanism for oxygen activation in this monooxygenase reaction has been discussed...|$|E

The study consists of two parts, a topological approach, which uses data obtained from routine measurements (differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction), and the experimental determination of phase transitions as a function of pressure and temperature. This has resulted in two topological pressure-temperature phase diagrams of the pure enantiomer <b>d-camphor</b> and of the racemic mixture dl-camphor; both have been verified by the experiments as a function of pressure.

40|$|In Pseudomonas putida {{carrying}} the CAM plasmid, the operon (camDCAB) encoding enzymes {{involved in the}} degradation pathway of <b>D-camphor</b> is negatively regulated by the CamR protein, and camR is autorepressed. S 1 nuclease mapping revealed that camDCAB and camR were divergently transcribed from overlapping promoters, the transcription start sites were separated by 11 bp, and transcriptions of the cam operon (camDCAB) and camR increased about 10 - and 4 -fold, respectively, immediately after addition of camphor.

The camR promoter was initiated by P. putida RNA polymerase containing sigma 70, but transcription from the camDCAB promoter by sigma 70 holoenzyme was not observed. The purified CamR protein repressed in vitro transcription from the camR promoter. This repression was suppressed by camphor.

Two of the isolates, which showed the highest growth during screening as demonstrated {{by an increase in}} their optical densities at 600 nm and named as NITWDBT 1 and NITWDBT 3. In isolate NITWDBT 1, the lowest optimum growth of 0. 189 at 600 nm was observed when the level of anthracene was lowest (50 ppm); while the highest optimum growth of 0. 578 was recorded when the level of anthracene was highest (300 ppm). Similarly, the lowest optimum growth in isolate NITWDBT 3 was 0. 173 at anthracene level of 50 ppm, while the highest was 0. 380 when the level of anthracene was 250 ppm (OD 600).

To conceive the sensor arrays single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) networks were aligned to bridge a 3 f Ým gap between a pair of prefabricated microelectrodes followed by coating with polypyrrole (PPY) with different dopants by electrochemical polymerization. Initially, the sensor¡¦s synthesis conditions in terms of PPY thickness on SWNTs networks by varying the electropolymerization charge of the monomer pyrrole in presence of LiClO 4 dopant for the sensing of NH 3 was optimized.

Coriandrum sativum L. is a major aromatic crop in Ukraine. The plants of Coriandrum sativum contain the essential oils and other compounds in the seeds and leaves and {{have an important role}} as flavorings. The main objective was to investigate possibility effective utilization of coriander essential oil in national economy of Ukraine. It was necessary to study the chemical compounds of coriander fruits by instrumental analysis and odor by sensory analysis with following creating new aroma compositions. Search had been carried out throughout 2009 - 2014 years. The aerial parts of aromatic plants were harvested at the plots of National Botanical Garden of National Academy of the Sciences of Ukraine. Essential oil was obtained by hydro distillation procedure in National University of food technology. Main and specific components of essential oils from seeds coriander were characterized. Qualitative structure of essential oils was determined by the gas-liquid chromatography method on the chromatograph Agilent Technologies 6890 with mass-spectrometric detector 5973. The run of components was done using Device of Fractional Distillation. Linalool, limonene, geranyl acetate, <b>d-camphor,</b> myrcene and geraniol were found as the major components. In the composition of essential oils each component has its own flavor, the combination of which determines the flavor of the oil. We investigated the possibility of target separation of essential oils of coriander fruits into fractions of different flavor.

Principles and laws of the vacuum distillation were used for directional control of the process distillation of complex mixtures of hydrocarbons on the distillation column. Mode of selection process the fractionation of essential oils allowed changing the component composition of the fractions and to provide more variety of flavors. Monitoring of the fractioning process allows concentrating the key aromatic components and receiving highly concentrated flavors of original pure notes.
