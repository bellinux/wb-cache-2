40|$|Coal ash, and {{particularly}} fine fly ash, remain {{one of the}} principal practical and environmental problems in coal-based power generation. In particular, submicron aerosols are identified with direct inhalation risk. Submicron ash is thought to arise from mineral vaporization during char combustion, followed by nucleation, condensation and coagulation to yield an aerosol. While aerosols are predominantly made out of volatile alkali minerals, they also can include refractory oxides that are chemically reduced to more volatile forms within the char particle and vaporized. Most of the ash of size greater than 1 {mu}m is generated by agglomeration of mineral as the char particle bums out. These two principal mechanisms are thought to account for most of the ash generated in coal combustion. Previous research has shown that various forms of coal treatment can influence the yields of fine ash from combustion. The research reported here investigates various forms of treatment, including physical coal cleaning, aerodynamic sizing, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>grinding,</b> and combinations of these on both aerosol yields and on yields of fine residual ash (1 - 4 {mu}m). The work also includes results from the combustion of artificial chars that include individual mineral elements. This research shows that these various forms of coal treatment can significantly change ash characteristics.

40|$|The most {{important}} {{task in the}} development of the diet of farm animals feeding is a selection of the most balanced in its composition and most nutritious feeds, which are safe and meet all the necessary requirements at the same time. To evaluate the productive value of feeds and their effectiveness the rate of food productive action η was proposed. This ratio reflects the productive part of the total value of the exchange energy of the daily feed ration and is an essential criterion of the feed quality indicators. In the feed rations of animals the most expensive, but energy-rich feed is a mixed fodder, a mixture of grinded seeds of agricultural crops and protein, mineral and vitamin additives. In the diet for its nutritional value, this feed product is for cattle – 50, pigs – 60 … 100 and birds – 100 %. The basic operation in the production of mixed fodder is seeds grinding, i. e. their destruction under the influence of external forces, exceeding the forces of molecular adhesion of the grains particles. To grind the grain different ways are used: chopping, grinding, impact «in flight», crushing, etc. In the production of mixed fodder on the existing production equipment, there is the problem of getting the grain mixed fodder the necessary <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> and uniform in its particle size distribution at the same time. When receiving too coarse grinding there is a problem of difficult digestibility of mixed fodder by farm animals.  Moreover grinding process is accompanied by a high energy consumption.

The proposed constructive solutions allow to obtain a high-performance technical means for crushing seeds of crops, as well as reduce energy costs that arise during the course of the process of obtaining of mixed fodder.  The methodology justification of degree of grain grinding by the steps of the proposed grinder is shown in the article. </p...|$|E

Each experimental period included 10 days for diet adaptation, four days for feces collection and one day for digesta collection. The kinetics of the particulate and solute phases of digesta were evaluated based on the mean retention time (MRT), passage rate (k) and transit time (TT) using two external markers: Cr-NDF and Co-EDTA.

From 30 to 51 days of age (phase I), there was a control diet based on regular soya bean meal (R-SBM; 44 % CP) of Argentina (ARG) origin and five extra diets in which a high-protein soya bean meal (HP-SBM; 49 % CP) of the USA or ARG origin, either ground (990 μm) or micronized (60 μm), or a soya protein concentrate (SPC; 65 % CP) substituted the R-SBM. From 51 to 61 days of age (phase II), all pigs were fed a common commercial diet in mash form. The following pre-planned orthogonal contrasts were conducted: (1) R-SBM v. all the other diets, (2) SPC v. all the HP-SBM diets, (3) micronized HP-SBM v. ground HP-SBM, (4) HP-SBM of ARG origin v. HP-SBM of US origin and (5) interaction between source and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> of the HP-SBM. Dietary treatment did not affect growth performance of the pigs at any age but from 30 to 51 days of age, post weaning diarrhoea (PWD) was higher (P< 0. 001) and the TTAD and AID of all nutrients were lower for pigs fed the R-SBM diet than for pigs fed the HP-SBM or the SPC diets. However, no differences between the HP-SBM and the SPC containing diets were detected for any trait. The TTAD of organic matter (P= 0. 07) and gross energy (GE) (P= 0. 05) tended to be higher for the micronized HP-SBM than for the ground HP-SBM and that of GE was higher (P< 0. 05) for US meal than for the ARG meal. Pigs fed R-SBM had lower villus height (P< 0. 01) than pigs fed HP-SBM or SPC but no differences in ileal mucosal morphology were detected between SPC and HP-SBM containing diets.

In surface grinding machines is shown characteristic <b>of</b> surface <b>grinding,</b> the partition <b>of</b> the surface <b>grinding</b> machines, ways <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> and description each way, producers <b>of</b> these <b>grinding</b> machines and tips of separate machine with its preferences and engineering characteristic. The last type <b>of</b> the outside <b>grinding</b> machines are centreless grinding machines. There is shown characteristic <b>of</b> centreless <b>grinding,</b> ways <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> and the description each of the way, producers <b>of</b> centreless <b>grinding</b> machines and tips of these machines with its description and engineering characteristic. By the centreless grinding are shown even the ways <b>of</b> double disk <b>grinding</b> with the examples <b>of</b> utilization this <b>grinding.</b> The work is ended by finish, where is shown overall assessment in the way <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> machines development, resources and innovations, which the producers using to increasing precision of the machines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} improved grinding roughness model established for cylindrical plunge grinding though analysing the existing roughness models. The proposed roughness model {{is to consider}} the uncertain effects <b>of</b> <b>grinding,</b> such as changes <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> conditions and circumstance, as grinding procedure is progressed. In order to consider the uncertain effect <b>of</b> <b>grinding,</b> the time delay between programmed and actual infeed rate <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> table is selected as weighting factor of the proposed roughness model. The developed roughness model is also used for the optimization algorithm <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> procedure. Optimization algorithm {{in this study is}} constructed to minimize the grinding cost and to obtain the optimized dressing and grinding conditions under grinding constraints such as no-burn condition, limitation of roughness <b>of</b> workpiece, <b>grinding</b> power, etc. The optimized results also give an optimized dressing interval in batch production. The used optimization algorithm is an Evolutionary Strategy algorithm, and performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated with experiments...|$|R
40|$|A new {{theoretical}} method {{which is}} used to define conditions of reducing the machinery cost price has been proposed. This method is based on functional interconnection between the major heads of expenditure. It has been analytically proved that the machining cost price, depending on production efficiency has its extremum (minimum) specified by the cutting tool wear rate. This fact made it possible to determine the optimal conditions of machining according to the criterion of the least cost price. By means <b>of</b> diamond <b>grinding</b> new conditions necessary for machining cost price reducing have been determined. They are maintenance of the optimal cutting relief <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel working face, that ensures its fast cutting capability and increase in product efficiency. The influence of dimensionless coefficient that determines the dulling <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> a single-point diamond on machining cost price has been demonstrated. Knowing this coefficient, it is possible to compare different variants <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> in a scientifically grounded way and choose the best one according to the criterion of the least machining cost price...|$|R
