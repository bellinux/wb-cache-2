5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E

25|$|Insect {{morphology}} is {{the study}} and description of the physical form of insects. The terminology used to describe insects {{is similar to that}} used for other arthropods due to their shared evolutionary history. Three physical features separate insects from other arthropods: they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> divided into three regions (head, thorax, and abdomen), have three pairs of legs, and mouthparts located outside of the head capsule. It is this position of the mouthparts which divides them from their closest relatives, the non-insect hexapods, which includes Protura, Diplura, and Collembola.|$|E
25|$|Using {{body fat}} {{percentages}} (BF%), however, BF-defined obesity {{was found in}} 50% of men and 62% of women. While BMI-defined obesity showed high specificity (95% for men and 99% for women), BMI showed poor sensitivity (36% for men and 49% for women). Despite this undercounting of obesity by BMI, BMI values in the intermediate BMI range of 20–30 {{were found to be}} associated {{with a wide range of}} body fat percentages.

25|$|The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, {{named after}} the common trait of growth by {{moulting}} or ecdysis. The largest animal phylum belongs here, the Arthropoda, including insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All these organisms <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water. A number are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Egyptians, {{like many}} cultures, {{believed}} in an afterlife {{and much of}} what remains of their civilization reflects this because only the temples, tombs and other religious structures survive well. One belief {{that was at the}} center of Egyptian beliefs about life after death was the belief in the ka. The ka was believed by the Egyptians to be ones' life source, essence, and soul. Egyptians believed that after they died, their ka would continue to live as they had lived on earth in the afterlife. It would enjoy the same activities the individual had enjoyed on earth. Egyptians also believed that the ka had to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> to return to, and because of this belief they would mummify their dead. Egyptians also took precautionary measures, in case their body did not survive, by commissioning ka statues; statues of the deceased that were buried in the tomb, along with the body, and would serve as a replacement if the body decayed beyond recognition. It was especially important to ensure the comfort of the king's ka in the afterlife, due to his prominent position both in politics, and religion.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 80s, several {{researchers}} advocated {{a completely new}} approach to artificial intelligence, based on robotics.

500|$|When the {{offspring}} are born, they are hairless and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>body</b> mass of approximately [...] Incisors and claws are already formed, but the digits, eyes, and pinnae are closed and cannot be used. The {{rate at which}} the young develop differs depending on the distribution range. However, the differences are usually no longer than a day. In Tuva, the pinnae open {{on the first day of}} birth and are completely open after three days of development. However, in Mongolia, the same process occurs between two and four days of development. Fur first grows on the crown, back, and abdomen. The young are usually have a full coat of fur after seven days of development. Offspring born in captivity have a shorter development time than those born in the wild. Specifically, the growth and development of the head and body, tail, hind feet, and pinnae can be up to a day sooner than those found in the wild. After 28 days of development in captivity, the young are already around half the mass of their parents.|$|E
