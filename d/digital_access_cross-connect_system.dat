This digital communications switching system is deployed at the mission control centers of Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB, and China Lake Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC). Each system provides the test ranges with mission-critical voice communications and Time Space Position Information (TSPI) switching. Through user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), the switch provides exceptional resource management of radios, telephones, user positions, secure communications, radars, trackers, 4 -wire Ear & Mouth (E&M) devices, subscriber services, and other equipment. Developed using commercial equipment, such as the Lucent Technologies <b>Digital</b> <b>Access</b> and <b>Cross-Connect</b> <b>System</b> (DACS) II, the digital switch can integrate and interface with the technologies of other test ranges and customers. The DSSP sustaining engineering contract, a 10 M contract awarded in 1997, is a multi-service effort in supporting cost effective maintenance and enhancement for the systems’ software and hardware. Eglin and China Lake have agreed to participate in a Digital Switch Working Group (DSWG) to ensure that this configuration management is in place and that all players follow the same system migration path. These ranges and other interested ranges that agree to purchase systems off the contract and participate in the working group will continue to derive benefits by reducing overhead and eliminating the duplication of effort involved in separate endeavors...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{architecture}} and system perspective of optical <b>cross-connect</b> <b>systems</b> using semiconductor optical amplifiers. The work includes architecture study, system performance analysis, simulation, and experimental investigations. Optical cross-connects are promising for future large capacity switching <b>systems</b> and <b>cross-connect</b> <b>systems</b> in high-speed transport networks. To construct large capacity <b>cross-connect</b> <b>systems</b> using presently available technologies, multi-dimensional optical cross-connects are explored. A novel architecture using wavelength-division and space-division multiplexing techniques is proposed, where the wavelengths of WDM are effectively reused {{and the size of}} space switches is dramatically reduced. Conceptual designs are presented to show the feasibility of its implementation. As for the system performance, homo-wavelength crosstalk from space switches is identified as a main degradation factor. The performance is further investigated with Gaussian approximation of signal-crosstalk beat noise for a reasonably large size (64 x 64) cross-connect as a high-speed switching core. It is shown that a 64 x 64 cross-connect can be constructed with 4 -wavelengths WDM and 16 x 16 space switches using presently available technology. Also, a 4 x 4 optical cross-connect based on the proposed architecture was experimentally demonstrated. Performance degradation due to homo-wavelength crosstalk in multi-wavelength optical networks using dynamic wavelength routing is addressed. Enhanced crosstalk degradation due to ASE noise of optical amplifiers is identified for the first time. Mechanisms and classification of homo-wavelength crosstalk are further investigated comprehensively. To analyze homo-wavelength crosstalk implications on system performance, a theoretical model based on moment generating functions (MGF) is presented. Further, the saddlepoint approximation is employed to evaluate the power penalty with the MGF of the received signal. The evaluation results justify the estimation of the required crosstalk ratio calculated with the Gaussian approximation for a large number of crosstalk channels $(N> 4). $ Several experiments were carried out in order to verify the theoretical analysis and study the effect of wavelength alignment between the signal and the crosstalk. A good agreement is achieved between the analysis and experiments. The wavelength range for generating homo-wavelength beat noise is found around 0. 05 nm for a 1 Gb/s directly-modulated signal. As primary optical switching components in the proposed <b>cross-connect</b> <b>system,</b> semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are investigated in various aspects. The available SOAs are tested and characterized for switching application. They perform very well in terms of polarization insensitivity and contrast ratio. As for system applications of SOAs, an input dynamic range of SOAs is studied experimentally and further simulated numerically. An input dynamic range can be over 20 dB for a single-stage SOA system and over 10 dB for a three-stage SOA system at 1 Gb/s. The simulation shows a signal bit rate can be up to 20 Gb/s with a reasonable input dynamic range. By using a wide optical bandwidth of SOAs, we propose to construct bi-directional cross-connects using semiconductor optical amplifiers. The feasibility of bi-directional cross-connection using SOAs is confirmed experimentally at a bit rate of 1 Gb/s. The maximum input power, however, is limited due to the cross-gain modulation, particularly for multi-stage SOA systems...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> to rare book {{collections}} and rare book librarian’s new profile. Internet search engines were used in collecting data from institutions and librarians from Brazil and around the world. People responsible for rare book collections that were listened on libraries sites and members of the electronic discussion lists related to rare books were contacted. A questionnaire was sent by e-mail and the results categorized into three classes: issues about the <b>digital</b> <b>access,</b> issues about the digital library’s characteristics and, about the rare book librarian’s profile. The valorization process of the rare book collections with the implementation of <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> is outlined in this study. The results shows that there is an increase in the number of local users and the emergence of new types of users as a consequence of the <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> to the most valuable rare material from the libraries. To provide <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> to the rare material is a strategic decision taken by the libraries management teams. These teams are still in the process of evaluating their holdings and the opportunities created by the new access. Our study identified some digitalization collective initiatives of rare material from libraries as a solution to the concern of the standardization of the practices related to the electronic documents. The major initiatives observed came from the university libraries that were preoccupied with the integration of rare book collections with the other institution’s research material. An evaluation of the rare book librarian’s profile was made focusing the experience and training adaptability to activities related to the <b>digital</b> <b>access.</b> Some of their special skills have became compatible to the new technology started from a personal interest in the technological developments of the Internet. As a general introduction to the rare books collections at the Internet, this study is best seen as a tentative interpretation of the new possibilities that the <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> may contribute to the libraries and to its most valuables holdings...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{technologies}} have penetrated so many facets of people‘s lives {{that access to}} technology has become a dimension of social inclusion. It is widely assumed that <b>access</b> to <b>digital</b> technologies would result in higher standards of living and improved social welfare through interaction, commerce and learning in a global community and individuals without <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> will be excluded from this community. In order to leverage all the benefits and opportunities that the digital revolution promises, {{it is essential to}} include more citizens to the digital society. The Digital Inclusion Index is proposed as a tool to measure and examine the digital divide in South Africa. Current digital divide measurements are limited and narrow in focus. The Digital Inclusion Index proposed in this study is based on <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> levels of individuals to various digital technologies. The bi-annual AMPS survey results, containing data of more than 20 000 personal interviews, was used as secondary data. Factor analysis was used to assign a scale to each respondent‘s level of <b>digital</b> <b>access.</b> Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square cross tabulations were used to profile the different levels of <b>digital</b> <b>access.</b> The study aimed to understand the digital environment of South Africa by creating the Digital Inclusion Index which measures the digital divide. The index was then applied to profile various levels of <b>digital</b> <b>access</b> in term of individual attributes and geographical regions.
