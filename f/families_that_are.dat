25|$|There are {{hundreds}} {{of different types of}} fibulae. They are usually divided into <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> based upon historical periods, geography, and/or cultures. Fibulae are also divided into classes that are based upon their general forms.|$|E

25|$|The {{area was}} slowly rebuilt after the disaster. The {{government}} initially proposed {{the creation of}} a two-kilometer buffer zone along low-lying coastal areas within which permanent construction was not permitted. This proposal was unpopular among some local inhabitants and proved impractical in most situations, especially fishing <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> dependent on living near to the sea.|$|E
25|$|They {{are found}} in {{freshwater}} environments, though most inhabit shallow, running water. Representatives of at least eight families are hypogean (live underground) with three <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> also troglobitic (inhabiting caves). One such species is Phreatobius cisternarum, known to live underground in phreatic habitats. Numerous species from the families Ariidae and Plotosidae, and a few species from among the Aspredinidae and Bagridae, {{are found in}} salt water.|$|E
25|$|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? smashes these {{conventions}} and shows realistic <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{far from perfect}} and possibly ruined. The families of Honey and Martha were dominated by their fathers, there being {{no sign of a}} mother-figure in their lives. George and Martha's chance at a perfect family was ruined by infertility and George's failure at becoming a prominent figure at the university. Being just a few of many, these examples directly challenge social expectations both within and outside of a family setting.|$|E

25|$|This {{shift to}} S-Corporations means that income {{previously}} not included on {{personal income tax}} returns appeared there during this change, as S-Corporation investors directly pay taxes on corporate profit {{regardless of whether it}} is distributed or not. Furthermore, Reynolds points out in the same literature that tax-deferred savings accounts grew substantially from the 1980s onward, so that investment income to these accounts was not included as personal income in the years which it accrued. The CBO noted {{that at the end of}} 2002, $10.1 trillion was in tax-deferred retirement plans, and that $9 trillion of that was taxable upon withdrawal. These numbers amount to potentially large amounts of investment income to middle-class <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> no longer reported on tax returns each year, but were reported prior to the widespread growth of tax-deferred retirement plans.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} step of duplex {{sequencing}} library preparation, Illumina sequencing adapters {{are added to the}} tagged double stranded libraries by PCR amplification using primers containing sequencing adapters. During PCR amplification both complementary strands of DNA are amplified and generate two types of PCR products. Product 1 derive from strand 1 which have a unique tag sequence (called α in the figure 2) next to the Illumina adapter 1 and product 2 that have a unique tag (called β in the figure 2) next to illumina adapter 1. (Please note that in each strand, tag a is the retrograde, complementary version of tag b and vice versa). The libraries containing duplex tags and Illumina adapters are sequenced using Illumina TruSeq system. Reads that are originating from each single strand of DNA form a group of reads (tag <b>families)</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> sharing the same tag. The detected families of reads will be used in next step for analyzing sequencing data.|$|E
25|$|Political prisoners: Political {{prisons are}} the harshest {{long-term}} punishment {{that can be}} inflicted to an individual in the DPRK, and are used as the means to remove from society those individuals and <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> seen as an irredeemable threat to the regime. As such, these inmates cease to be considered citizens with any rights. Persons accused of major political crimes become victims of enforced disappearance; they are detained and, if not executed immediately, brought without trial to political prison camps (kwanliso) and held incommunicado. Their families are never informed of their fate. The State uses this system to instill fear in the population. The inmate population has been gradually eliminated through deliberate starvation, forced labor, executions, torture, rape and the denial of reproductive rights. The Commission estimates that {{hundreds of thousands of}} political prisoners have perished in these camps over the past five decades, with atrocities that resemble the horrors of camps that totalitarian states established during the twentieth century. Between 80,000 and 120,000 people are believed to remain incarcerated. The DPRK has always denied the existence of this prison network.|$|E

500|$|The {{specific}} name pseudoplatanus {{refers to the}} superficial similarity of the leaves and bark of the sycamore to those of plane trees in the genus Platanus, the prefix pseudo- (from Ancient Greek) meaning [...] "false". [...] However, the two genera are in different <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> only distantly related. Acer and Platanus differ in the position in which leaves {{are attached to the}} stem (alternate in Platanus, paired or opposite in Acer) and in their fruit, which are spherical clusters in Platanus and paired samaras (winged fruit) in Acer.|$|E
500|$|From 2001 to 2007, the Nauru {{detention}} centre provided a {{significant source of}} income for the country. The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia. In February 2008, the Foreign Affairs minister, Dr Kieren Keke, stated that the closure would result in 100Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10percent of the island's population directly or indirectly: [...] "We have got a huge number of <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> suddenly going to be without any income. We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited. Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us." [...] The {{detention centre}} was re-opened in August 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{figures in}} the lunettes appear to be families, but in every case they are <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> divided. The {{figures in the}}m are {{physically}} divided by the name tablet {{but they are also}} divided by a range of human emotions that turn them outward or in on themselves and sometimes towards their partner with jealousy, suspicion, rage or simply boredom. In them Michelangelo has portrayed the anger and unhappiness of the human condition, painting [...] "the daily round of merely domestic life {{as if it were a}} curse". In their constraining niches, the ancestors [...] "sit, squat and wait". Of the fourteen lunettes, the two that were probably painted first, the families of Eleazar and Mathan and of Jacob and Joseph are the most detailed. They become progressively broader towards the altar end, one of the last being painted in only two days.|$|E

500|$|Barbauld also {{collaborated with}} her brother John Aikin on the six-volume series Evenings at Home (1793). It is a {{miscellany}} of stories, fables, dramas, poems, and dialogues. In many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an Enlightenment education: [...] "curiosity, observation, and reasoning." [...] For example, the stories encourage learning science through hands-on activities; in [...] "A Tea Lecture" [...] the child learns that tea-making is [...] "properly an operation of chemistry" [...] and lessons on evaporation, and condensation follow. The text also emphasises rationality; in [...] "Things by Their Right Names," [...] a child demands that his father tell him a story about [...] "a bloody murder." [...] The father does so, {{using some of the}} fictional tropes of fairy tales such as [...] "once upon a time", but confounding his son with details, such as the murderers all [...] "had steel caps on." [...] In the end the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle, and his father comments [...] "I do not know of any murders half so bloody." [...] Both the tactic of defamiliarising the world to force the reader to think about it rationally and the anti-war message of this tale are prevalent throughout Evenings at Home. In fact, Michelle Levy, a scholar of the period, has argued that the series encouraged readers to [...] "become critical observers of and, where necessary, vocal resisters to authority." [...] This resistance is learned and practised in the home; according to Levy, [...] "Evenings at Home ... makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family." [...] It is <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> responsible for the nation's progress or regress.|$|E

2500|$|The primase used by archaea and eukaryotes, in contrast, {{contains}} a highly derived {{version of the}} RNA recognition motif (RRM). This primase is structurally similar to many viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, cyclic nucleotide generating cyclases and DNA polymerases of the A/B/Y <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> involved in DNA replication and repair. [...] In eukaryotic replication, the primase forms a complex with Pol α.|$|E
2500|$|Genetic testing {{provides}} the ultimate diagnosis in 95% of cases; genetic counseling is usually needed in families where FAP has been diagnosed. Testing may also {{aid in the}} diagnosis of borderline cases in <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> otherwise known to [...] p34.3 and p32.1 (1p34.3–p32.1). Testing can only show if an individual is susceptible to FAP or rule it out (i.e., {{whether or not they}} inherited the defective APC gene). [...] It cannot determine the actual condition of a patient; this can only be found by direct physical examination.|$|E
2500|$|The 46 {{questions}} in the lineamenta covered {{many of the same}} topics as the questionnaire sent out in advance of the 2014 Synod. [...] They asked about [...] "all aspects of the promotion of authentic family values, the training of clergy in family ministry, the way the Church can be more present among those living far away from the Christian faith, and the care of <b>families</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> wounded and fragile." [...] "How would it have been possible to talk about the family without engaging families, listening to their joys and hopes, their pain and anxieties?” Pope Francis asked.|$|E
