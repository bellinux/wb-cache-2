500|$|Released in October , the PSP Go is {{the biggest}} {{redesign}} of the PlayStation Portable to date. Unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go does not feature a UMD drive but instead has 16GB of internal flash memory to store games, videos and other media. This can be extended by up to 32GB {{with the use of}} a Memory Stick Micro (M2) <b>flash</b> <b>card.</b> Also unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go's rechargeable battery is not removable or replaceable by the user. The unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. It has a 3.8" [...] 480×272 LCD (compared to the larger 4.3" [...] 480×272 pixel LCD on previous PSP models). The screen slides up to reveal the main controls.

The PSP Go is being produced and sold concurrently with its predecessor the PSP-3000 although it will not replace it. All games on the PSP Go must be purchased and downloaded from the PlayStation Store as the handheld is not compatible with the original PSP's physical media, the Universal Media Disc. The handheld also features connectivity with the PlayStation 3's controllers the Sixaxis and DualShock 3 via Bluetooth connection.|$|E
