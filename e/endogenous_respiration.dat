Bacteria rapidly consume organic matter and convert it into carbon dioxide, water and a range of lower molecular weight organic compounds.

50|$|Aerobic {{digestion}} is {{a bacterial}} process {{occurring in the}} presence of oxygen resembling a continuation of the activated sludge process. Under aerobic conditions, bacteria rapidly consume organic matter and convert it into carbon dioxide. Once {{there is a lack of}} organic matter, bacteria die and are used as food by other bacteria. This stage of the process is known as <b>endogenous</b> <b>respiration.</b> Solids reduction occurs in this phase. Because the aerobic digestion occurs much faster than anaerobic digestion, the capital costs of aerobic digestion are lower. However, the operating costs are characteristically much greater for aerobic digestion because of energy used by the blowers, pumps and motors needed to add oxygen to the process. However, recent technological advances include non-electric aerated filter systems that use natural air currents for the aeration instead of electrically operated machinery.|$|E

We compared several biochemical parameters, including <b>endogenous</b> cellular <b>respiration,</b> adenosine and guanosine triphosphate levels, and 14 C-amino acid incorporation, of rat hearts treated with doxorubicin and some of its derivatives, recent products of pharmacological research aimed at selecting less toxic antiblastic agents.

Our data indicate that mitochondria are the target of the anthracycline effects and that oxygen uptake and nucleotide levels may be regarded as markers of the toxicity when evaluating new drugs before their clinical use. The lack of cytoplasmatic or endoplasmatic reticulum alterations may account for the failure of anthracyclines to affect amino acid incorporation. In any event, the rate of protein synthesis cannot serve as a marker of cardiac toxicity.

Two factors are important in the initial increase—the early developmental stage of the cells and the influence of light. In autotrophically developing algae the parts played by developmental processes and by light have not been separated. Direct activation of respiratory enzymes by light, in addition to the level of respiratory substrate, cannot be excluded. The decline of respiration rate over most of the cell history seems to have no connection with light and is probably bound to the developmental processes per se.

Bacteriol. 86 : 58 – 66. 1963. —The {{nature of}} the nitrogenous reserves of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that are oxidized during <b>endogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> was studied by following {{the changes in the}} chemical constituents and in the distribution of radioactivity of starving cells that had been grown on C 14 -labeled substrates. The total protein and nucleic acid of Warburg vessel contents decreased during starvation. Deoxyribonucleic acid increased slightly, whereas ribonucleic acid (RNA) decreased. C 14 O 2 was evolved from endogenously respiring cells specifically labeled in the nucleic acid fraction and from cells specifically labeled in the protein fraction. Chemical fractionation of C 14 -labeled cells showed a decrease in hot trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -insoluble compounds, indicating that the C 14 O 2 arose from the degradation of RNA and protein and not free pool compounds. A decrease in ribosomal RNA and protein was evident from physical fractionations of starved, labeled cells. An enzyme responsible for the initiation of ribosomal degradation was found {{to be associated with the}} ribosome fraction. It was concluded that oxidation of the ribonucleo-protein during <b>endogenous</b> <b>respiration</b> may be a general phenomenon in microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Epididymal sperm flushed {{from the}} caudae of mature rabbits with Tris-saline buffer {{containing}} EDTA are motile. The <b>endogenous</b> rate of <b>respiration</b> is stimulated by glucose or pyruvate. There is no further {{stimulation of the}} respiration rate by added Ca+ 2, and this rate is sensitive to inhibition by oligomycin which inhibits mitochondrial ATP synthesis and slows respiration, but which does not inhibit mitochondrial Ca+ 2 uptake with attendant increase in respiration rate. The sperm cell membrane is not permeable to Ca 2, {{as shown by the}} observation that addition of the ionophore A 23187, which makes cell membranes selectively permeable to Ca+ 2, results in a marked stimulation of respiration by added Ca+ 2. The stimulated rate is insensitive to inhibition by oligomycin, showing that the Ca+ 2 has direct access to the mitochondria which take up this cation in an energy-linked reaction. The presence of 45 mM l- 1 C 03 in the medium stimulates the rate with pyruvate, but not with glucose, and does not affect the response to added Ca+ 2. Cyclic AMP and dibutyl cyclic AMP, with or without added Ca+ 2, also do not stimulate respiration with glucose or pyruvate as substrate. Mature rabbit sperm from the cauda epididymis are apparently intrinsically motile, needing only freedom from restraint and oxygen; a trigger in the form of Ca+ 2 is not needed...|$|R
40|$|Hexachlorophene (HCP) {{inhibits}} both <b>endogenous</b> and exogenous <b>respiration</b> (oxygen uptake) in Bacillus megaterium, without sparing by any {{of several}} substrates. The inhibition is maximal when the cells are treated with 8 μg of HCP per mg of cells (dry weight), which corresponds to the minimal lethal dose. Levels as low as 2 μg/mg are inhibitory but not lethal. HCP also inhibits the respiration of isolated B. megaterium membranes and can act on several components of the electron transport chain in the membranes and on soluble enzymes. Although both forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form dehydrogenase and malic dehydrogenase are inhibited by HCP, they are less susceptible than is oxygen uptake. The site of maximal sensitivity is nearer the terminal electron acceptor, but the exact location depends on the cytochrome composition of the membranes. If cytochromes b 1, a, and a 3 are present, but not o, HCP inhibits electron transport on the substrate side of cytochrome b 1; if cytochromes b 1, a 3, and o are present, but not a, the inhibition occurs on the oxygen side of cytochrome b 1. Exogenous menadione, an analogue of menaquinone, reverses the inhibition in both circumstances. The primary lethal action of HCP thus appears to be respiratory inhibition at a site within the membrane-bound part of the electron transport chain...|$|R
40|$|Ketoconazole, an {{antifungal}} drug, completely inhibited {{the growth}} of Candida albicans 7 N at concentrations of {{greater than or equal}} to 50 microgram/ml (94 microM). However, ketoconazole incompletely inhibited {{the growth of}} this opportunistic yeast at concentrations of 25 to 0. 2 microgram/ml (47 to 0. 4 microM). At these lower concentrations, 2, 3, 5 -triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, an electron acceptor, was reduced by several strains of C. albicans. This effect resulted in red coloration of colonies. Concomitantly, this phenomenon was not antagonized in the presence of ergosterol. Furthermore, neither ketoconazole nor antimycin A inhibited the growth of C. albicans under anaerobic conditions, as revealed by a paper disk method. Ketoconazole at the concentrations stated above inhibited <b>endogenous</b> and exogenous <b>respiration</b> immediately after it was added to a system containing log phase C. albicans cells, as determined polarographically. At the same time, ketoconazole inhibited the activity of NADH oxidase at the mitochondrial level. In contrast, higher concentrations of ketoconazole (greater than 100 microM) were required to inhibit the activity of succinate oxidase from rat liver mitochondria. In addition, concentrations of ketoconazole greater than 100 microM were required to impair the uptake of labeled leucine and adenine and, subsequently, the incorporation of the former into protein and the latter into DNA and RNA in intact cells. On the other hand, ketoconazole at concentrations of 10, 1. 0, and 0. 4 microM had no effect on either membrane permeability or macromolecular synthesis...|$|R
