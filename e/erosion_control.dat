5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and <b>erosion</b> <b>control.</b> Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|To the south, the White Salmon River has {{its source}} {{on the lower}} flanks of {{the west side of}} Adams and gains {{additional}} flows from streams along the southwest side of the mountain. Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, {{at some point in their}} courses, provide essential irrigation water for farming and ranching. The Klickitat and White Salmon rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon) and <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> (Klickitat). The Cispus and Lewis rivers have been impounded with dams farther downstream for flood control and power generation purposes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Erosion</b> <b>controls</b> {{are used}} in natural areas, {{agricultural}} settings or urban environments. In urban areas <b>erosion</b> <b>controls</b> are often part of stormwater runoff management programs required by local governments. The controls often involve {{the creation of a}} physical barrier, such as vegetation or rock, to absorb some of the energy of the wind or water that is causing the erosion. They also involve building and maintaining storm drains. On construction sites they are often implemented in conjunction with sediment controls such as sediment basins and silt fences.|$|R
50|$|Sediment traps are {{installed}} before land disturbance (earth moving, grading) begins on a construction site. The traps {{are often used}} in conjunction with <b>erosion</b> <b>controls</b> and other sediment control practices.|$|R
25|$|The University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station conducts crop research, crop {{management}} and <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> experiments. The no-till method of farming in Tennessee originated at the Milan facility.|$|E
25|$|An {{agricultural}} {{drainage system}} is a system by which water is drained on or in the soil to enhance agricultural production of crops. It may involve any combination of stormwater control, <b>erosion</b> <b>control,</b> and watertable control.|$|E
25|$|Collier {{also set}} up the Indian Division of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC {{provided}} jobs to Native American men (of all ages) in soil <b>erosion</b> <b>control,</b> reforestation, range development, and other public works projects and built infrastructure such as roads and schools on reservations.|$|E
50|$|Sediment {{can also}} be {{discharged}} from multiple different sources. Sources include construction sites (although these are point sources, which can be managed with <b>erosion</b> <b>controls</b> and sediment controls), agricultural fields, stream banks, and highly disturbed areas.|$|R
50|$|Silt fences {{are often}} {{perimeter}} controls, typically used {{in combination with}} sediment basins and sediment traps, as well as <b>erosion</b> <b>controls,</b> which are designed to retain sediment in place where soil is being disturbed by construction processes (i.e., land grading and other earthworks).|$|R
25|$|Sediment (loose soil) washed off fields is {{the largest}} source of {{agricultural}} pollution in the United States. Farmers may utilize <b>erosion</b> <b>controls</b> to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include contour plowing, crop mulching, crop rotation, planting perennial crops and installing riparian buffers.|$|R
25|$|Grasses are {{the primary}} plant used in lawns, which {{themselves}} derive from grazed grasslands in Europe. They also provide an important means of <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> (e.g., along roadsides), especially on sloping land. Grass lawns are an important covering of playing surfaces in many sports, including football (soccer), American football, tennis, golf, cricket, softball and baseball.|$|E
25|$|Faced with {{decades of}} neglect and bad governance, {{the shift in}} human {{migration}} has posed problems to available infrastructural provision, environmental sanitation, <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> and other social services. As a result, major cities have become characterized by inadequate and deteriorated road networks, walkways, unregulated building patterns, sanitation, uncontrolled street trading, mountains of garbage, and chaotic transport systems, creating congestion, noise pollution and overcrowding.|$|E
25|$|In the {{riparian}} zone near rivers and streams, <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> measures {{can be taken}} to try to slow down or reverse the natural forces that cause many waterways to meander over long periods of time. Flood controls, such as dams, can be built and maintained over time to try to reduce the occurrence and severity of floods as well. In the United States, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains a network of such flood control dams.|$|E
50|$|Certified Professional in <b>Erosion</b> and Sediment <b>Control</b> (CPESC) is a {{qualification}} {{indicating the}} holder has educational training, expertise {{and experience in}} <b>controlling</b> <b>erosion</b> and sedimentation, and met certification standards.|$|R
40|$|Twenty states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands enacted <b>erosion</b> and {{sediment}} <b>control</b> legislation {{during the past}} decade to provide for the implementation or the strengthening of statewide <b>erosion</b> {{and sediment}} <b>control</b> plans for rural and/or urban lands. That legislation and the state programs developed to implement these laws are quoted and reviewed. The natural resource data requirements of each program are also extracted. The legislation includes amendments to conservation district laws, water quality laws, and <b>erosion</b> and sediment <b>control</b> laws. Laws which provides for legislative review of administrative regulations and LANDSAT applications and/or information systems that were involved in implementing or gathering data for a specific soil <b>erosion</b> and sediment <b>control</b> program are summarized as well as principal concerns affecting <b>erosion</b> and sediment <b>control</b> laws...|$|R
50|$|To control {{sediment}} and runoff, farmers may utilize <b>erosion</b> <b>controls</b> {{to reduce}} runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include contour plowing, crop mulching, crop rotation, planting perennial crops and installing riparian buffers. Conservation tillage {{is a concept}} used to reduce runoff while planting a new crop. The farmer leaves some crop reside from the previous planting in the ground to help prevent runoff during the planting process.|$|R
25|$|Invasive {{species can}} be transported {{intentionally}} or accidentally. Many invasive species originate in shipping areas {{from where they}} are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to <b>erosion</b> <b>control.</b> These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It {{is important to note}} that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive.|$|E
25|$|Buckwheat, a short-season crop, {{does well}} on low-fertility or acidic soils, but the soil must be well drained. Too much fertilizer, {{especially}} nitrogen, reduces yields. In hot climates {{it can be}} grown only by sowing late in the season, so that it blooms in cooler weather. The presence of pollinators greatly increases the yield. The nectar from buckwheat flower makes a dark-colored honey. It is sometimes used as a green manure, as a plant for <b>erosion</b> <b>control,</b> or as wildlife cover and feed.|$|E
25|$|The Preserve {{lies between}} Petaluma and Santa Rosa, California; access may be {{achieved}} from Petaluma Hill Road, and thence to Roberts Road and Lichau Road. On route along Roberts Road, one can obtain {{glimpses of the}} channel restoration work on lower Copeland Creek conducted during the late 1990s; this work featured <b>erosion</b> <b>control,</b> native riparian planting and eliminating access by cattle. The paved access route also features a stretch of gravity hill, an optical illusion which makes the motorist feel like a stretch of roadway appearing to be uphill, in fact, is a downhill extent.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example is}} the US Department of Agriculture’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The CRP was {{originally}} {{put in place to}} protect soil from erosion, but also has major implications for conservation of biodiversity. [...] In the program, landowners take their land out of agricultural production and plant trees, shrubs, and other permanent, <b>erosion</b> <b>controlling</b> vegetation. Unintended, but ecologically significant consequences of this were the reduction of runoff, improved water quality, creation of wildlife habitat, and possible carbon sequestration.|$|R
40|$|Public Law 92 - 500 - the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments - {{mandates}} {{the analysis}} of agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution controls. This report {{presents the results of}} a study of the economic impact of implementing potential agricultural NPS pollution controls in the watershed above Lavon Reservoir. The study focuses on: (a) effects of <b>erosion</b> <b>controls</b> on farm income, (b) off-side sediment damages in the watersheds; (c) costs of administering and enforcing alternative erosion-sedimentation controls, and (d) effects of adopting cotton pest management methods. <b>Erosion</b> <b>controls</b> considered include possible regulatory programs as well as voluntary programs combined with economic incentives. While the stimulus for this study was concern over pollution (an off-site problem) it can not, because of long-run farm income consequences, be separated from conservation problems (an on-farm problem). Thus, the study is as much an analysis of conservation economics as it is an analysis of environmental economics. Accordingly, the report contains substantial information on the short and long-run on-farm benefits and costs of various soil conservation practices for all soil mapping units in Lavon watershed The results are applicable to much of the Blackland Prairies Land Resource area...|$|R
50|$|A {{sediment}} {{control is}} a practice or device designed to keep eroded soil on a construction site, {{so that it does}} not wash off and cause water pollution to a nearby stream, river, lake, or sea. Sediment controls are usually employed together with <b>erosion</b> <b>controls,</b> which are designed to prevent or minimize erosion and thus reduce the need for sediment controls. Sediment controls are generally designed to be temporary measures, however, some can be used for storm water management purposes.|$|R
25|$|Kudzu {{has been}} used as a form of <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> as well as to enhance the soil. As a legume, it {{increases}} the nitrogen in the soil by a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its deep taproots also transfer valuable minerals from the subsoil to the topsoil, thereby improving the topsoil. In the deforested section of the central Amazon Basin in Brazil, it {{has been used}} for improving the soil pore-space in clay latosols, thus freeing even more water for plants than in the soil prior to deforestation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erosion</b> <b>control</b> {{efforts have}} always been of extreme importance. Underwater weirs {{redirect}} the most damaging currents, {{and the top of}} the falls has also been strengthened. In June 1969, the Niagara River was completely diverted away from the American Falls for several months through construction of a temporary rock and earth dam (clearly visible in the photo at right). During this time, two bodies were removed from under the falls, including {{a man who had been}} seen jumping over the falls, and the body of a woman, which was discovered once the falls dried.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{recognition}} of impacts of land development and land use practices, {{which began in the}} mid-19th century and have continued until 2006, certain actions are being considered by the Board of Supervisors of Sonoma County. Most notably a special parcel tax may be submitted to voters to assess landowners adjacent to Sonoma Creek. These funds could be used in flood control, hydrology modeling studies, stream conservation work, including <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> and wildlife conservation. Other current activities include considerable research in public and private sectors including work by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sonoma County and various private conservation groups.|$|E
5000|$|Assisted by 600 {{volunteers and}} 3,000 donors each year, the CTF {{maintains}} over 500 miles of trail. Each summer, its trail crews work for about 12 weeks and six weekends clearing trees, working on <b>erosion</b> <b>controls,</b> and maintaining signage along the trail. The trail crews work on major {{projects that are}} {{beyond the scope of}} its sister [...] "Adopt-A-Trail" [...] program. That program lets interested volunteers [...] "adopt" [...] one of 78 maintenance sections along the trail, each averaging about eight miles long.|$|R
50|$|Structures in Camp Thunder {{include the}} Howard Lodge Administration Building, Camp Thunder Trading Post, Mitchell Shooting Sports Complex, and 12 campsites. In 2010, new {{construction}} included {{the completion of}} a staff area shower and lounge and the Chandler Waterfront (creating the Boy Scouts of America's largest swimming dock, a beach, and athletic field). At this time there are no scheduled construction projects in Camp Thunder, although staff cabins, shooting sports safety fenching, dining hall renovations, and <b>erosion</b> <b>controls</b> are being proposed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Erosion</b> <b>controls</b> have {{appeared}} since medieval times when farmers realized {{the importance of}} contour farming to protect soil resources. Beginning in the 1950s these agricultural methods became increasingly more sophisticated. In the 1960s some {{state and local governments}} began to focus their efforts on mitigation of construction runoff by requiring builders to implement <b>erosion</b> and sediment <b>controls</b> (ESCs). This included such techniques as: use of straw bales and barriers to slow runoff on slopes, installation of silt fences, programming construction for months that have less rainfall and minimizing extent and duration of exposed graded areas. Montgomery County, Maryland implemented the first local government sediment control program in 1965, and this was followed by a statewide program in Maryland in 1970.|$|R
25|$|The Bay checkerspot went locally extinct {{during the}} early 2000s, last {{observed}} at Edgewood Park in 2002. This local extinction {{has been attributed to}} nitrogen deposition from cars traveling on adjacent Interstate 280, which fertilized invasive Italian ryegrass and choked out native plants required by the butterflies. However, the Italian ryegrass was intentionally planted as an <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> measure mandated by San Mateo County Planning Department after construction of PG high power lines that cross the park, and spread into the park from that location. Subsequently, attempts to restore the habitat by mowing at an appropriate time of year to reduce the Italian ryegrass and allow the native plants to regrow. In early 2007, 1000 Bay checkerspot larvae were reintroduced to the park.|$|E
25|$|Geo{{synthetic}}s are synthetic products used {{to stabilize}} terrain. They are generally polymeric products used to solve civil engineering problems. This includes eight main product categories: geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, geomembranes, geosynthetic clay liners, geofoam, geocells and geocomposites. The polymeric {{nature of the}} products makes them suitable for use in the ground where high levels of durability are required. They can also be used in exposed applications. Geosynthetics are available {{in a wide range of}} forms and materials. These products have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil, geotechnical, transportation, geoenvironmental, hydraulic, and private development applications including roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, <b>erosion</b> <b>control,</b> sediment control, landfill liners, landfill covers, mining, aquaculture and agriculture.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{the island}} {{became part of}} the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge after it was {{acquired}} from the U.S. Coast Guard. According to the Connecticut Audubon Society, [...] "it currently supports over 95% of the nesting Common Terns in Connecticut. It is the site of one of the ten largest Roseate Tern (~45 pairs) colonies in Northeastern North America, and is the only regular nesting location for this federally endangered species in the state." [...] Also living on the island is the American oystercatcher, with one to two breeding pairs noted each year. Although the <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> project was completed, Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy greatly reduced the breeding habitat of the terns to just [...] In spring 2014, the dock damaged by Hurricane Sandy was scheduled to be rebuilt.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFour {{criteria}} are generally used to prioritize agricultural lands for placing conservation buffers. The criteria include soil erodibility, hydrological sensitivity, wildlife habitat, and impervious surface rate that capture conservation buffers’ benefits in reducing soil <b>erosion,</b> <b>controlling</b> runoff generation, enhancing wildlife habitat, and mitigating stormwater impacts, respectively. This {{article describes the}} data used to derive the values of those attributes and a scheme to classify the values in multi-criteria analysis of conservation buffer placement in “Choosing between alternative placement strategies for conservation buffers using borda count” [1]...|$|R
