40|$|Bread’s {{texture and}} aroma are key factors {{influencing}} its acceptability by consumers. The {{main purpose of}} the present study was to characterize aroma compounds in three different French baguettes varying in their structural properties (density, hardness, size of alveoli and crumb’s heterogeneity). The volatile fraction of their crumb was isolated by Solvent Assisted Flavour Evaporation (SAFE) technique. Extracts were analysed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Aroma-active compounds were determined by GC-Olfactometry (GC-O) and results were processed with detection frequency method. A total of 81 compounds (pyrazines, lactones, furans, ketones, pyrroles, aldehydes, alcohols, acids) was identified and quantified by GC-MS. All the compounds were present in the three baguettes but their quantities varied between breads. Among the 40 most important odorant zones (detection frequency ≥ 40 %), the notes ‘burned’, ‘cocoa’, ‘bread’ and ‘dust’ were found in all the breads, whereas other zones (burned, butter, cereal, chemical, fruity, <b>green,</b> <b>honey,</b> moldy/mushroom, roasted, vegetable) were more specific to one products. Roasted notes were associated to pyrazines and vegetal/fruity notes were associated to aldehydes...|$|E

40|$|The {{first study}} on the high {{efficiency}} of nanometer-sized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4) coated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dithiooxamide as a new sorbent solid phase extraction has been reported. Modified magnetic nanicomposites was used to preconcentrate and separate Co (II) ions in food and environmental water samples. Magnetic nanoparticles were prepared by chemical precipitation of Fe (II) and Fe (III) salts from aqueous solution by ammonia solution. These magnetic nanoparticles and nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analysis CHNS. A micro sample introduction system was employed for the nebulization micro-volume of diluted solution into flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The extraction conditions were optimized by selecting the appropriate extraction parameters including the amount of nanosorbent, pH value, volume of dithiooxamide and condition of eluting solution. The detection limit of this method for Co (II) ions was 1. 21 ng ml- 1 and the R. S. D. was 0. 9 % (n= 6). The advantages of this new method include rapidity, easy preparation of nanosorbents and a high preconcentration factor. The proposed method {{has been applied to}} the determination of Co (II) ions at trace levels in real samples such as, kiwi, orange, cucumber, apple, <b>green</b> pepper, <b>honey,</b> potato, tap water, river water and sea water with satisfactory results...|$|R

40|$|Five food {{substances}} rich in chemopreventive {{agents were}} assessed for their potential {{to increase the}} activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes in the liver. The dietary supplements used were, onion, cabbage, <b>honey,</b> <b>green</b> tea and their combination. The effects of these supplements on the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD 2) were examined. The result showed {{that the combination of}} these products increased the antioxidant enzymes activities significantly (p< 0. 05) and more potently than individual food supplement compared which animals on normal diet. Supplementation with the individual diet supplement significantly increased the activities of all the enzymes (p< 0. 05) except SOD 1 and SOD 2. However, combination of the supplements significantly increased the activities of SOD 1 and SOD 2 (p< 0. 05) in addition to the activities of the enzymes increased by individual food supplement (p< 0. 05...|$|R
40|$|Nonalcoholic {{beverages}} {{are usually}} consumed accompanying alcoholic drinks, {{and their effects}} on alcohol metabolism are unclear in vivo. In this study, the effects of 20 nonalcoholic beverages on alcohol metabolism and liver injury caused by alcohol were evaluated in mice. Kunming mice were orally fed with alcohol (52 %, v/v) and beverages. The concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in blood {{as well as the}} activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in liver were assessed to indicate alcohol metabolism. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in serum as well as the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver were measured to reflect the alcohol-induced liver injury. The results showed that the treatment of soda water, <b>green</b> tea and <b>honey</b> chrysanthemum tea could accelerate ethanol metabolism and prevent liver injuries caused by alcohol when companied with excessive alcohol drinking. They might be potential dietary supplements for the alleviation of harmful effects from excessive alcohol consumption. On the contrary, some beverages such as fresh orange juice and red bull are not advised to drink when companied with alcohol consumption due to their adverse effects on ethanol induced liver injury...|$|R
40|$|Poster PresentationConference Theme: We are the FutureSession 22 : P 2 Objective: To {{report on}} the {{concentration}} of fluoride ions in the popular industrialized bottled waters and beverages in Hong Kong. Method: The most popular brands of bottled waters and beverages, i. e. the largest sales by volume, as reported by marketing researches conducted in Hong Kong were selected for investigation in this study. Two samples with different batch number of each selected drink were purchased from retail outlets. The concentration of fluoride ions in each sample drink was determined by using a fluoride ion selective following a standard protocol. The measurement was performed in a research laboratory of the University of Hong Kong by a trained investigator. Tap water (0. 5 ppm) and deionized water were used as the positive and the negative controls for the measurements. Results: Fluoride concentration of 13 brands of bottled waters and 11 brands of beverages were determined. All 5 distilled water and 3 mineralized water {{were found to have}} fluoride concentrations < 0. 1 ppm. A large variation was seen in natural mineral/spring water, ranging from < 0. 1 to 1. 31 ppm. Approximately 70 % of the selected bottled waters had a fluoride concentration < 0. 1 ppm. Tea beverages were found to have a relatively high fluoride concentration, ranging from 0. 69 to 2. 76 ppm. The highest one was lemon tea while the lowest one is <b>green</b> tea with <b>honey.</b> The fluoride concentration in the other studied non-tea beverages ranged from < 0. 1 to 0. 5 ppm, and most of them (75 %) contained < 0. 1 ppm fluoride. The differences in the measured fluoride concentration between the two samples of the same brand of drink was small, nearly all were < 0. 1 ppm. Conclusion: Concentration of fluoride in the popular bottled drinks in Hong Kong, except tea products, is generally low and variation between different batches is small...|$|R
