40|$|The {{state and}} {{citizenship}} in green political theory: a brief story The {{idea of an}} <b>environmental</b> <b>account</b> of citizenship emerged within the policy discourse before it entered the academic field of green political theory (Bell, 2005). In fact the term “environmental citizenship ” was first used in 1990 by a state body, Environment Canada (Szerszynski, 2006). The literature on ecological citizenship often presumes that states are, to a certain extent, responsible for creating the conditions and implementing the mechanisms for its practice (MacGregor and Pardoe, 2005; Dobson and Valencia Sáiz, 2005). Partly because most green theorists of citizenship live in liberal democratic states, partly because {{it is thought that}} any transformation of the political order shall emerge from existing institutions, {{attempts have been made to}} demonstrate that current neoliberal states can and should encourage more sustainable forms of citizenship (Bell, 2005; Hailwood, 2005; Valencia Sáiz, 2005; Dobson, 2003). There is a tendency to argue that states ’ resources and steering capacity can be used to promote green behaviors as a route to extend ecological citizenship, for instance, using tools like legal and monetary incentives (Connelly, 2006; Barry, 2006), substantive and procedural rights (Bell...|$|E

The three municipalities that we chose in the thesis were Huddinge, Burlöv and Sandviken. The municipalities were selected because they had the same sort of environmental reporting in the form of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounts</b> and that they all had carried out the <b>environmental</b> <b>accounts</b> in the four years 2006 - 2009. We used a qualitative approach in this paper, where we were able to examine more deeply the selected items. The investigation has been a case study of the municipalities and media press.

In the context of greatly expanding sub-national climate efforts, research on Carbon Footprint accounting at municipality level is timely and necessary to facilitate the establishment of local climate strategies. This study aims at exploring the methodologies for Carbon Footprint assessment at municipality level, based on the case study of Haninge municipality in Sweden. In the study, a Greenhouse Gas inventory of Haninge is developed and it is discussed how the municipality can reduce its Carbon Footprint. The Carbon Footprint of Haninge is estimated to be more than 338, 225 tonnesCO 2 eq, and 4. 5 tonnes CO 2 eq per capita. These numbers are twice as large as the production-based emissions, which are estimated to be 169, 024 tonnes CO 2 eq in total, and approximately 2. 3 tonnes CO 2 eq per capita. Among them the most important parts are emissions caused by energy use, and indirect emissions caused by local private consumption. It is worth noting that a large proportion of emissions occur outside Haninge as a result of local consumption. Intensive use of biomass for heat production and electricity from renewable sources and nuclear power have significantly reduced the climate impact of Haninge. The major barrier for Carbon Footprint accounting at municipality level is lack of local statistics. In the case of Sweden, several databases providing emission statistics are used in the research, including KRE, RUS, NIR and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Account.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The unique {{challenges}} of offshore drilling, unable {{to be overcome}} by conventional drilling approaches, have forced the industry to aggressively pursue alternative methods to the “pump and dump” top hole drilling, which simply spills the drilling fluid and cuttings onto the seabed. Drilling topholes using riser is banned on the Norwegian continental shelf due to the risky relation to shallow gas pockets. The most prevalent tophole drilling problem {{associated with the use}} of the “pump and dump” approach is the dispelling of drilling fluid and cuttings, which has obvious environmental implications. Heightened focus on the discharge to the marine environment has propelled the demand of a technology to mitigate the seabed disturbance, as authorities have begun to place restrictions on the amount of discharge emitted to sea. With new regulations, the demand for new technologies arises. The development of RMR was impelled by the vision of zero hazardous discharge, and offers environmental benefits by capturing drilling waste at wellhead and pumping it back to the rig for conditioning and reuse. By implementing RMR it is possible to bypass some destructive discharge, but new challenges related to the drilling process may arise. When drilling through potential hazardous zones, the mud cap on the SMO will be open to sea and allow for drilling fluid to breach out. The knowledge of the corals vulnerability of drilling fluid is insufficient. However, the corals in Norwegian waters are assumed to have some resistance to sedimentation due to high current intensity and high particle density in the water. Even though it assumed that the corals are able to re-colonize, inadequate documentation on coral settlement makes it important to limit destructive discharge. As mentioned, the Suction Module of the Riserless Mud Recovery System is open to sea and the different sub-activities of the drilling process will generate drilling fluid discharge. Pulling the drillstring out of the hole was deliberated to be the procedure causing the most mixing in the drilling fluid-sea water interphase and a model was developed for simulation purpose. Different rheology drilling fluids were mixed where the viscosity and density was altered in order to evolve rheology profiles. Baker Hughes provided drilling fluids commonly used during RMR projects. When experiments commenced it was evident that diffusion could be excluded as a mass transfer mechanism disturbing the interphase. Advection was superior and did cause, in some cases, complete contamination of the fluids. The acquired results indicate that density will have the least effect of impeding the advection. The only prerequisite was that there had to be a density difference between the two fluids. A density of 1, 1 kg/l turned out to be sufficient as opposed to the first drilling muds tested with densities in the 1, 02 kg/l- 1, 05 kg/l range. When the density requirement was fulfilled, viscosity was the property with most influence of the fluid contamination. The common denominator of the drilling fluid that managed to impede the advection and showed resistance towards mixing was a high plastic viscosity. If the drilling fluid in addition had a high yield point the mixing degree was lowered. The obtained results from the experiments indicate a marshalling sequence of: Plastic Viscosity Yield Point Density RMR is employed when drilling the top hole sections, hence a high yield point of the drilling fluid is not required to be able to lift the cuttings out of the annulus. However, when drilling in environmentally vulnerable areas the operator should consider raising the viscosity and yield point in order to strengthen the resistance towards mixing. The apparent results regarding duration of the tripping procedure, indicated that time have little effect on the fluid contamination. The mass transfer reached its peak and the mixing degree seemed to stay constant as time went on. The velocity of the tripping did have a greater influence on the mixing degree than duration. It was found that the high density mud with low viscosity and yield point, especially, will profit on the <b>environmental</b> <b>account</b> by slowing down the tripping velocity. However, reducing the speed increases the time consumption and increases the overall cost of the project. In most areas the drilling fluids will be allowed emitted to the sea, however RMR may be adapted in environmental vulnerable areas where the discharge regulations is more stringent. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent to which Portuguese local {{entities}} have implemented a set of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices, and to analyse some potential determining factors of their use. Design/methodology/approach – The data were collected by sending a postal questionnaire to a sample of medium-sized and large city councils and the municipal companies belonging to those municipalities. Three variables were considered as possible factors that drive the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices in the local public sector. Findings – The degree of development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices in Portuguese local entities is low. Organisational size and the degree of development of environmental management practices are positively and statistically related to the level of development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices. However, the findings suggest that the existence of compulsory <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> standards is not positively associated with the development of <b>environmental</b> <b>accounting</b> practices by Portuguese local entities. Research limitations/implications – The study limits itself to Portugal and, therefore, its results could not be applicable in other settings.
