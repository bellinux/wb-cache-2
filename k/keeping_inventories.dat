50|$|The third {{dimension}} is {{control over the}} value chain encompassing all functional groups (finance, supply/procurement, marketing, inventory, information technology etc..) to ensure low costs. For supply/procurement chain this could be achieved by bulk buying to enjoy quantity discounts, squeezing suppliers on price, instituting competitive bidding for contracts, working with vendors to keep inventories low using methods such as Just-in-Time purchasing or Vendor-Managed Inventory. Wal-Mart is famous for squeezing its suppliers to ensure low prices for its goods. Other procurement advantages could come from preferential access to raw materials, or backward integration. Keep in mind {{that if you are}} in control of all functional groups this is suitable for cost leadership; if you are only in control of one functional group this is differentiation.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common stated needs by small and medium {{enterprises}} (SMEs) is the limited space that often restricts the movement and use of right layout within their manufacturing premises. Often times, these SMEs start off as a “mom and pop ” operation within the confines of their family home. The typically layout is not designed for efficient flow of work and in most cases do not actually provide the right space for <b>keeping</b> <b>inventories.</b> These companies eventually outgrow their “facility ” due to the need to increase production output. For most SMEs that eventually generate enough demand that would require an increase in production output, space becomes the most valuable asset of the company. These spaces often are used to pile up accumulated work in process (products that have not been completed, but work have already been started) and finished goods. In the course of time, these SMEs, tend to accumulate excess raw materials and excess production, due to allowances and samples used during its production. These spaces seem to create the notion that keeping these excesses is permissible. SMEs rationalize that these excesses can still be used for future production. However, in interviews done with these companies, these excesses never disappear and in fact tend to grow in time...|$|E

Now we can say that, although mass customisation approach is not a panacea for every kind of firm, it is really proving to be an important component of competitive strategy for more and more firms. The hurdles in implementing mass customisation, a further evidence of its competitive potential due to low imitability, however, are not trivial, especially when coming to operations strategy issues. How firm can allow for greater responsiveness of their operations while offering customised products? How the product should be designed for fast customisation?

Managers are looking for answers to these questions as well as research is trying to formalise models that provide some insights in how operations strategies supporting mass customisation should be shaped.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} of top executives is to maintain proper inventory levels. Excessive inventories {{at the time of}} a drop in business activity are likely to-lead to severe losses [...] occasionally bankruptcy [...] when management has to liquidate them on a falling market. On the other hand, insufficient inventories after a recession and at the start of an upsurge in business usually lead to delays in fulfilling orders and to losses in sales. In addition, the management of inventories affects company efforts to maintain more stable production and steadier jobs for employees. Of course, these are all things which most executives know. <b>Keeping</b> <b>inventories</b> at optimum profitable levels is, however, a perplexing problem. The questions businessmen raise in connection with management and control of inventories are basically aimed at action, not at arriving at answers. However, action questions are not enough by themselves. In order to get at the answers to the questions as a basis for taking action, it is necessary to back off and ask some rather different kinds of questions: "Why do we have inventories?" "What affects the inventory balances we maintain?" From these questions, a picture of the inventory problem can be built up which shows the influence on inventories and costs of the various alternative decisions which the management may ultimately want to consider. This type of analytic or functional question has been answered intuitively with considerable success in the past. As business has grown and as business executives have become more and more specialized in their jobs or farther removed from direct operations, however, the task of achieving an ecomical balance intuitively has become increasingly difficult. One of the principal difficulties in the intuitive approach is that the types and definitions of cost which influence appropriate inventory policy are not those characteristically found on the books of a company. Many costs such as setup or purchasing costs are hidden in the accounting records. Others such as inventory capital costs may never appear at all. Each cost may be clear to the operating head primarily responsible for its control; since it is a "hidden" cost, however, its importance may not be clear to other operating executives concerned. The resulting confusion may make it difficult to arrive at anything like a consistent policy. This is the reason why we have to take an analytic approach. In this paper major attention will be devoted to the conceptual framework of the analytic approach, including the definition on inventory function and the measurement of operational costs...|$|E

This safety stock placement problem, for which some solution strategies were proposed in case of uncapacitated supply chains, becomes much more complicated when, in addition to the variability of the demand, capacity constraints also come into play. In this paper, we propose a model to locate safety stocks in a capacitated supply chain with the objective of maintaining the required service level. The underlying relationships linking excess capacity, demand variability, and service levels are analyzed to gain deeper understanding of the safety stock placement problem in capacitated supply chains.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the Inventory-Routing Problem where n geographically dispersed retailers must be supplied by a central facility.

In a fixed partition policy, the retailers are partitioned into disjoint and collectively exhaustive sets. Each set of retailers is served independently of the others and at its optimal replenishment rate. We derive a deterministic (O(n)) lower bound on the cost of the optimal fixed partition policy. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of this bound demonstrates that it is asymptotically 98. 5 %-effective. That is, as the number of retailers increases, the lower bound is very close to the cost of the optimal fixed partition policy...|$|R

40|$|Companies {{competing}} in today’s global economy are challenged by two critical yet conflicting {{issues related to}} their supply chains. On one hand, they are under ongoing pressure to reduce operational and inventory costs, which requires <b>keeping</b> <b>inventory</b> levels low.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we study}} the {{decision}} {{problem of a}} retailer, who wants to optimize the amount of shelf inventory of a particular product, given that the demand for the product is stochastic and replenishment lead times (from the stores stockroom to the shelf) are negligible. The shelf inventory is managed according to a (0,B) -inventory policy: when the shelf inventory is sold out, the retailer gets a fixed amount of B units from the central stockroom to replenish the shelf inventory. To adequately reflect the shopping behavior of retail customers, the demand process is modeled as a compound Poisson process, with Poisson distributed purchase quantities. When the purchase quantity of a cus- tomer exceeds the amount of shelf inventory still available, the unsatisfied demand {{is considered to be}} lost sales. As the demand process is stochastic, the runout time of the shelf in- ventory will be stochastic too. The costs per cycle related to <b>keeping</b> <b>inventory</b> on the shelf can be split up into three components: average holding costs (which {{may be related to the}} scarcity of shelf space), a fixed handling cost (per replenishment trip), and an average lost sales cost.

40|$|<b>Keeping</b> <b>inventory</b> {{record of}} packed grains in silos poses {{challenges}} since the bulk material’s different segments do not discharge uniformly, leading to formation of random {{peaks and valleys}} on the surface. To facilitate obtaining accurate volume measurement of the grains by taking into account this non-linear behavior on the surface, laser or plumb-bob level-sensing devices are employed at {{different part of the}} surface to probe the level of material under those regions. The main goals of this research is to study the behavior of granular material in silo while discharging downward and by doing so, differentiate certain flow patterns formed during this process which could be important in predicting granular materials’ behavior on the surface. In order to conduct this thesis study, three unique numerical discharge models were built with two types of granular material and assigned to these, were the material/mechanical properties of polyethylene plastic and corn kernels separately. Validation procedures were conducted (grain volume measurements) by setting up a physical silo in the lab and monitoring center and side discharge developments for real polyethylene and maize grains, sequentially. The differences in results of numerical and lab discharge were small and large, depending on the materials used, as well as the type of discharge process performed (center or side).

40|$|We {{consider}} a generalisation of the lot-sizing problem that includes an emission constraint. Besides the usual financial costs, there are emissions associated with production, <b>keeping</b> <b>inventory</b> {{and setting up}} the production process. Because the constraint on the emissions {{can be seen as}} a constraint on an alternative cost function, there is also a clear link with bi-objective optimisation. We show that lot-sizing with an emission constraint is NP-hard and propose several solution methods. First, we present a Lagrangian heuristic to provide a feasible solution and lower bound for the problem. For costs and emissions for which the zero inventory property is satisfied, we give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm, which can also be used to identify the complete Pareto frontier of the bi-objective lot-sizing problem. Furthermore, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for such costs and emissions and extend it to deal with general costs and emissions. Special attention is paid to an efficient implementation with an improved rounding technique to reduce the a posteriori gap, and a combination of the FPTASes and a heuristic lower bound. Extensive computational tests show that the Lagrangian heuristic gives solutions that are very close to the optimum. Moreover, the FPTASes have a much better performance in terms of their gap than the a priori imposed performance, and, especially if the heuristic’s lower bound is used, they are very fast...|$|R
