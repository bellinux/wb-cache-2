5|$|In July 2007, {{the museum}} pushed back the <b>expected</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> by 18 months, {{due in part}} to issues with the boiler restoration. By January 2009, with further {{problems}} encountered including misaligned frames and a cracked right hand cylinder, as well as due to rising metal prices, the museum launched the SOS (Save Our Scotsman) appeal, seeking to raise a further £250,000, hoping to complete the work by 2010. In May 2011, the locomotive was unveiled on the museum's turntable, finished in wartime black LNER livery; following final testing it was planned to finish it in LNER apple green and have it running excursions by the summer. In June 2011, cracks were discovered in the horn blocks, which led to further testing which discovered numerous latent cracks throughout the frame assembly, leading to the replacement of the main stretcher bar, horn ties and middle cylinder motion bracket, all of which were deemed beyond repair.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{investment}} {{was to create}} approximately 100,000 jobs. The stated reason for the decision is a $21.3 billion deficit in the 2010 provincial operating budget. Standard economic metrics, however, show that as stimulus, Transit City adds significantly to provincial tax revenues, and given the province's 50-year amortization, the plan overall reduces Ontario's annual budget deficit. This caused widespread debate, protests and criticism of premier Dalton McGuinty by politicians and local groups. As {{a result of the}} postponement, the plan has since been scaled down and <b>expected</b> <b>completion</b> <b>dates</b> have been further pushed back.|$|R
25|$|Given {{the wait}} for the Richmond Hill extension, there were plans to have Viva Bus Rapid Transit bus lanes along Yonge Street from Finch Avenue to Highway 7. However, by April 2014, the plans were revised to run the busway from Highway 7 (at the {{proposed}} terminal of the North Yonge Subway Extension) north to Newmarket with some portions of the route operating in mixed traffic through Richmond Hill. The <b>expected</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of the revised busway is 2020.|$|E
25|$|Early {{proposals}} {{planned to}} extend SkyTrain west along the Broadway corridor, but stopped {{well short of}} UBC because of the cost, estimated at $700 million in 1999. However, the Provincial Transit Plan, released in February 2008, included funding for the entire Broadway corridor to UBC. The line would replace the region's busiest bus routes, where over 100,000 trips are made daily. The line would also include an interchange with the Canada Line at Cambie Street. In 2008, the new line was estimated to cost $2.8 billion, with an <b>expected</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of 2020.|$|E
25|$|Construction was not {{expected}} to start until 2013, and the earliest <b>expected</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> was 2017. However, the financial downturn meant that TfL requested a delay to the public enquiry while funding was clarified. Given {{that the purpose of}} the extension was to serve as-yet unbuilt homes, it became very difficult to predict timescales for this project. The project has been reported to have been cancelled by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson as a cost-cutting measure, although there have been calls for this to be reconsidered, the extension being regarded by Barking and Dagenham council as essential to regenerating the area.|$|E

40|$|Overall, {{this project}} is on {{schedule}} and proceeding as planned. Two approach changes are recommended. One is to rely on commercially developed software, in particular that developed by OLI Systems, Inc., and now being expanded in a collaborative effort between OLI Systems, Inc. and IPST to provide a simulation package for the {{pulp and paper industry}} and to integrate it with existing process simulation tools used by that industry. The second is the development of a detailed brownstock/bleached fiber washer model as a tool to evaluate the data and methods developed in this study, and to demonstrate its utility to industry. Both of these are discussed in more detail in the Approach Changes section of this report. Two tasks are behind schedule. They are Task A- 2. 3, Measurement of stability constants for wood organics with metal ions (scheduled completion date: 6 / 98), and Task C- 1. 2, Estimation of unavailable thermodynamic parameters (scheduled completion date: 12 / 97).

25|$|Beginning in September 2013, the LAPD {{started a}} trial {{program for the}} use of body worn cameras with 30 {{officers}} in the Skid Row area. Reports from the trial program indicated that the cameras functioned well and that they assisted in deescalating situations although there were some technical issues with the cameras along with slight issues with the cameras falling off of officers during movement. In November 2014 in a sign of body camera purchases to come, the department chose Taser International as the vendor for body cameras to be used by the LAPD after their use in the trial program earlier in the year. On December 16, 2014 Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the city would purchase 7,000 body worn cameras from Taser for use by the department. Patrol officers will be equipped with the cameras which will be purchased in the next fiscal year in order to outfit all patrol officers by the <b>expected</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> in June 2016. 700 of the cameras will first be deployed to patrol officers in the Central, Mission and Newton patrol areas of the city beginning in January 2015. $1.55 million was raised from private donors to start the body camera program for the initial rollout phase in order to ease budget constraints for the city with another $1 million coming from the National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Department of Justice. In total, the body cameras will most likely cost less than $10 million and will be included in Garcetti's proposed fiscal year 2016 budget. Before all of the cameras are deployed to patrol officers, the Police Commission will create a policy that governs the use of the cameras and video footage while consulting with department and city officials along with outside organizations including other departments who already use body cameras. While the commission has not created a policy yet as of December 2014, several guidelines were already outlined by the Mayor including that officers would have to turn on the cameras whenever they arrest or detain someone for interrogation, but many public interactions such as domestic violence interviews would not be recorded. The cameras may also be turned off in situations where police use deadly force. Prior to the rollout of any body worn cameras, officers were able to carry personally owned audio recording devices starting in 1994 if they file an application and obtain the requisite permission.|$|E

40|$|The two {{approach}} {{changes that}} were discussed and recommended in the Quarter 8 (April 1 [...] June 30, 1998) progress report {{have been implemented}} in the current project plan. The OLI software {{has been used to}} develop a preliminary process model for predicting the distribution of NPE`s in a two stage brownstock washer, and the OLI database has been upgraded to include improved chemical equilibrium data for metal-organic interactions. This exercise served as a tool to evaluate the data and methods developed in this study, and to demonstrate its utility to industry. The Weyerhaeuser-NAELS software has also been applied to predicting inorganic solubility behavior. Task C- 1. 2, Estimation of unavailable thermodynamic parameters (scheduled completion date: 12 / 97), has been combined with Task D- 2. 1, Evaluation of the estimation procedure (scheduled completion date: 3 / 99) with a new scheduled <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of 8 / 99. A model for the adsorption of metal ions on wood pulp fibers will include transport effects as well as adsorption equilibrium, and will be combined with a brownstock washer model to evaluate its predictive capability in comparison with mill data, and to demonstrate the applicability of the results obtained in this project. Three tasks are behind schedule: Task A- 2. 3, Measurement of stability constants for wood organics with metal ions (scheduled completion date: 6 / 98), Task B- 2. 1, Measure metal adsorption isotherms on wood pulp (scheduled completion date: 9 / 97), and Task B- 2. 3, Measure metal ion adsorption kinetics for strongly adsorbing metal species (scheduled completion date: 3 / 98).

[...] By this time, all road bridges in London east of the ferry at Chiswick were toll-free, but these were of little use to the two fifths of London's population that lived {{to the east of}} London Bridge. The Thames Tunnel (Blackwall) Act was created in August 1887, which provided the legal framework necessary to construct the tunnel. The initial proposal, made by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, called for three parallel tunnels, two for vehicular traffic and one for foot, with an <b>expected</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of works within seven years.
