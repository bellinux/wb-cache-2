40|$|A {{study of}} erosion rates by in-situ 10 Be {{concentrations}} in granites of Miocene high-elevation paleosurfaces in Corsica indicates maximum erosion rates between 8 and 24 mm/kyear. The regional distribution of measured erosion rates {{indicates that the}} local climatic conditions, namely precipitation, the petrographic composition of granites, {{and the degree of}} brittle deformation govern erosion rates. Chemical erosion dominates even at elevations around 2, 000 m in presently subalpine climate conditions. Field evidence indicates that erosion operates by continuous dissolution and/or disintegration to grains (grusification). The erosion rates are relatively high with respect to the preservation of inferred Early Miocene landscapes. We infer temporal burial in the Middle Miocene and significantly lower erosion rates in the Neogene until ∼ 3 Ma to explain the preservation of paleosurfaces, in line with fission track data. Valley incision rates that are a magnitude higher than erosion rates on summit surfaces result in relief enhancement and long-term <b>isostatic</b> <b>surface</b> uplift. On the other hand, widening and deepening of valleys by cyclic glaciation progressively destroys the summit surface relics...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} Loki Patera on Io as {{the surface}} {{expression of a}} large uniform body of magma. Our model of the Loki magma sea is some 200 km across; larger than a lake but smaller than an ocean. The depth of the magma sea is unknown, but assumed to be deep enough that bottom effects can be ignored. Edge effects at the shore line can be ignored to first order {{for most of the}} interior area. In particular, we take the dark material within Loki Patera as a thin solidified lava crust whose hydrostatic shape follows Io's <b>isostatic</b> <b>surface</b> (approx. 1815 km radius of curvature). The dark surface of Loki appears to be very smooth on both regional and local (subresolution) scales. The thermal contrast between the low and high albedo areas within Loki is consistent with the observed global correlation. The composition of the model magma sea is basaltic and saturated with dissolved SO 2 at depth. Its average, almost isothermal, temperature is at the liquidus for basalt.

Key outcrops have been studied in the eastern Greater Caucasus, and the region has been divided into several major tectonic zones that are diagnostic of different former sedimentary realms representing a complete traverse from a passive margin setting to slope and distal basin environments. Subsequent deformation has caused folds and thrusts that generally trend from NW–SE to WNW–ESE. Offshore data has been analysed to provide insights into the regional structural and stratigraphic evolution of the SCB to the east of Azerbaijan. Several structural trends and subsidence patterns have been identified within the study area.

The surface uplift of mountain belts is in large part controlled by the effects of crustal thickening and mantle dynamic processes (e. g., lithospheric delamination or slab breakoff). Understanding the history and driving mechanism of uplift of the southern Tibetan Plateau requires accurate knowledge on crustal thickening over time. Here we determine spatial and temporal variations in crustal thickness using whole-rock La/Yb ratios of intermediate intrusive rocks from the Gangdese arc. Our {{results show that the}} crust was likely of normal thickness prior to ca. 70 [*]Ma (~ 37 [*]km) but began to thicken locally at ca. 70 [*]−[*] 60 [*]Ma. The crust reached (58 [*]−[*] 50) [*]±[*] 10 [*]km at 55 [*]−[*] 45 [*]Ma extending over 400 [*]km along the strike of the arc. This thickening was likely due to magmatic underplating as a consequence of rollback and then breakoff of the subducting Neo-Tethyan slab. The crust attained a thickness of 68 [*]±[*] 12 [*]km at ca. 20 [*]−[*] 10 [*]Ma, as a consequence of underthrusting of India and associated thrust faulting. The Gangdese Mountains in southern Tibet broadly attained an elevation of > 4000 [*]m at ca. 55 [*]−[*] 45 [*]Ma as a result of <b>isostatic</b> <b>surface</b> uplift driven by crustal thickening and slab breakoff, and reached their present-day elevation by 20 [*]−[*] 10 [*]Ma. Our paleoelevation estimates are consistent not only with the C[*]−[*]O isotope-based paleoaltimetry but also with the carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometer, exemplifying the promise of reconstructing paleoelevation in time and space for ancient orogens through a combination of magmatic composition and Airy isostatic compensation.

40|$|In {{the paper}} the {{determination}} of topographic and <b>isostatic</b> redress <b>surface</b> influence on verticals in mountain regions is presented. Relative verticals, i. e. verticals determined {{on the base of}} astronomical and geodetic measurements, are a subject of solution. The graphic method according to J. R. Clarke for determining topographic elements (corrections) of verticals is presented. The Clarke graphic method goes out from the Newton gravitational low. This method operates with a simple topographic map and a constructed sculptured glass of sectors of sphere. Numerical procedures for the calculation of isostatic elements of verticals are based on several hypotheses (theories) about hydrostatic balance (isostatic redress) of mass in the earth crust: the Pratt hypothesis, Airy hypothesis, Hayford hypothesis and the Heiskanen hypothesis. Their hypotheses have been confirmed as theories. The presented graphic and numerical procedures in solving topographic and isostatic elements of relative verticals were applied to a model mountain conditions in the Èerme¾ valley nearby Koice. Six points at a various height were chosen on the south slope of this valley. A topographic map in the scale 1 : 10000 was used to determine the topographic elements of verticals. The sculpture glass of sectors of sphere following out from the theoretical procedure according to j. R. Clarke was produced. The simple software was developed to numerically solve both vertical elements, i. e. the topographic and isostatic elements. The tables in this paper give a review of the reached results in the determined topographic and isostatic elements of verticals. The values of these elements do not exceed 20 " what is a maximum value for verticals in our geographical latitudes and longitudes. The presented problem of estimating of verticals is of significance in many adjustments of geodetic networks where verticals have an sizeable influence on the geodetic network accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} sea level change become {{increasingly}} relevant for the Dutch coast. Therefore we construct two scenarios for regional sea-level {{change in the}} 21 st century. They are designed to follow two temperature pathways, in which global mean temperature rises moderately ('G', + 1. 5 K in 2085) or more substantially ('W', + 3. 5 K in 2085). Contributions from all major processes leading to sea level rise are included (ocean expansion, glacier melt, ice-sheet changes, and landwater changes), except glacial <b>isostatic</b> adjustment and <b>surface</b> elevation changes. As input we use data from 42 coupled global climate models that contributed to CMIP 5. The approach {{is consistent with the}} recent fifth assessment Report of IPCC, but provides an alternative viewpoint based on global temperature changes rather than RCPs. This makes them rather accessible and readily applicable to policy makers and the general public. We find a likely range for the G-scenario of + 25 – 60 cm in 2085, and + 45 – 80 cm for the W-scenario. These numbers have been rounded to 5 cm precision, to emphasise to any end-user of these scenarios that estimated lower and upper limits themselves are uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{kinematic}} {{model of}} lithosphere deformation {{has been developed}} that integrates the following components: structural deformation of the crust and mantle lithosphere; thermal con-ditioning, perturbation and subsequent re-equilibration of the lithosphere temperature field; flex-ural <b>isostatic</b> adjustments; and <b>surface</b> processes, including both lateral and temporal variations in basin fill and bathymetry. This approach enables the forward modelling of extensional basin evol-ution in two and three dimensions followed by deformation due to subsequent extensional and compressional (i. e. inversion) events. The model {{has been applied to}} the Black Sea, {{which is one of the}} deepest basins in the world and yet it is poorly understood in terms of the mechanisms that have controlled its evolution. Although it is widely accepted that this basin was initiated by Mesozoic back-arc extension related to the subduction of the Tethys Plate to the south, most of the subsidence observed today occurred within the Palaeogene and Neogene (i. e. within the framework of the Alpine–Himalayan orogenic belt). The modelling approach described above has been used to test possible geological and geo-dynamic mechanisms that have controlled the subsidence history of the Black Sea. In particular, the investigation has focused on trying to explain the anomalously thick post-rift subsidence tha...|$|R
40|$|The {{geologic}} {{activity at}} Enceladus's south pole remains unexplained, though tidal deformations {{are probably the}} ultimate cause. Recent gravity and libration data indicate that Enceladus's icy crust floats on a global ocean, is rather thin, and has a strongly non-uniform thickness. Tidal effects are enhanced by crustal thinning at the south pole, so that realistic models of tidal tectonics and dissipation should {{take into account the}} lateral variations of shell structure. I construct here the theory of non-uniform viscoelastic thin shells, allowing for depth-dependent rheology and large lateral variations of shell thickness and rheology. Coupling to tides yields two 2 D linear partial differential equations of the 4 th order on the sphere which take into account self-gravity, density stratification below the shell, and core viscoelasticity. If the shell is laterally uniform, the solution agrees with analytical formulas for tidal Love numbers; errors on displacements and stresses are less than 5 % and 15 %, respectively, if the thickness is less than 10 % of the radius. If the shell is non-uniform, the tidal thin shell equations are solved as a system of coupled linear equations in a spherical harmonic basis. Compared to finite element models, thin shell predictions are similar for the deformations due to Enceladus's pressurized ocean, but differ for the tides of Ganymede. If Enceladus's shell is conductive with <b>isostatic</b> thickness variations, <b>surface</b> stresses are approximately inversely proportional to the local shell thickness. The radial tide is only moderately enhanced at the south pole. The combination of crustal thinning and convection below the poles can amplify south polar stresses by a factor of 10, but it cannot explain the apparent time lag between the maximum plume brightness and the opening of tiger stripes. In a second paper, I will study tidal dissipation in a non-uniform crust. Comment: 71 pages, 12 figures, 5 table...|$|R
40|$|The gravity anomaly field {{over the}} whole Earth {{obtained}} by the GOCE satellite is a revolutionary tool to reveal geologic information on a continental scale for the large areas where conventional gravity measurements {{have yet to be}} made. It is, however, necessary to isolate the nearsurface geologic signal from the contributions of thickness variations in the crust and lithosphere and the <b>isostatic</b> compensation of <b>surface</b> relief. Here Africa is studied with particular emphasis on selected geological features which are expected to appear as density inhomogeneities. These include cratons and fold belts in the Precambrian basement, the overlying sedimentary basins and magmatism, as well as the continental margins. Regression analysis between gravity and topography shows coefficients that are consistently positive for the free air gravity anomaly and negative for the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The error and scatter on the regression is smallest in oceanic areas, where it is a possible tool for identifying changes in crustal type. The regression analysis allows the large gradient in the Bouguer anomaly signal across continental margins to be removed. After subtracting the predicted effect of known topography from the original Bouguer anomaly field, the residual field shows a continent-wide pattern of anomalies that could be attributed to regional geological structures. A few of these are highlighted, such as those representing Karoo magmatism, the Kibalian foldbelt, the Zimbabwe Craton, the Cameroon and Tibesti volcanic deposits, the Benue Trough and the Luangwa Rift. A reconstruction of the pre-break up position of Africa and South America (the plates forming West Gondwana) is made for the residual GOCE gravity field. The reconstruction allows the positive and negative anomalies to be compared across the continental fragments, and so helps identify common geologic units that extend across both the now-separate continents...|$|R
