25|$|In August the 29th Indian Brigade was {{secretly}} moved from Helles to ANZAC Cove, but {{were greeted by}} shellfire on landing on 5 August, {{and part of the}} 14th Sikhs had to wait until the next night to land. They then took part in the Battle of Sari Bair on 7 August alongside Australian troops, all under Cox's command. Palin commanded one of the four attacking columns, but like Cox and the other commanders was provided with no staff and the objectives set for them were beyond attainment. 14th Sikhs got onto Rhododendron Spur and made contact with 4th Australian Brigade on their flank. The Australians were ordered to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sikhs and assault Hill 305 (Koja Chemen Tepe), but it was found to be impossible. In the subsequent attempt to capture Hill 60, the artillery preparation was again inadequate, casualties were very heavy, and the objective remained untaken.|$|E
25|$|After the 31 July decision, {{contempt}} of court notices were issued to the judges who took the Provisional Constitutional Order oath. On 9 November 2010, a four-member Supreme Court bench took up the {{contempt of}} court charges against the nine justices who have not apologised for taking the oath. Although these judges petitioned the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court rejected the petitions and will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{contempt of court}} proceedings. Objections to {{the composition of the}} bench were raised by Justice Abdul Baist against the presence of Justices Sair Ali, Tariq Pervez, and Shahid Siddiqui. Following these objections, Ali refused {{to be part of the}} bench and requested Chaudhry create a new bench to hear the case. On 11 December 2010, Dogar also challenged the bench presiding over the case, on the grounds that two of the judges making up the bench had been appointed per his recommendation. However, this challenge was rejected. On 3 March 2011, Dogar and Zahid Hussain apologised to the Supreme Court. Chaudhry accepted their apologies.

25|$|UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy {{and a team}} {{of lawyers}} were in court until 4:30p.m. {{on the day of the}} fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An {{ultimatum}} was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up his mind that he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken nose, and cracked ribs. His injuries combined with the rule change, he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the LRR {{conducted}} a trojan horse operation at a drag race to either kill or capture Abu Sayyaf target Sihata Latip, who was wanted for kidnapping 21 people in Malaysia in 2000. He {{went on to}} conduct a string of kidnappings in the Philippines over subsequent years, but as the Philippines got better at counter terrorism operation, the Islamists were cut off from overseas international terrorist finance networks, particularly the ones originating in Saudi Arabia {{and in order to}} make up for this loss in income, they engage in kidnapping for ransom. The 24 LRR soldeirs trained for a week to execute the mission. They dressed up as if going to a Muslim wedding, rented local jeeps and decorated it. Some soldiers dressed up as women to avoid raising suspicion. One soldier with a M249 light machine gun dressed as a pregnant woman, but forgot to shave {{on the day of the}} operation and had to loan a hand fan from one of the female soldiers on the base to cover his goatee. On the way to the drag race one of the jeeps broke down. The commander of the operation decided to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mission with only one jeep and 13 men. When they arrived at the drag race, the LRR operators identified their High Value Target from about 50 civilians and terrorists, approached and drew weapons. A firefight ensued in which the target was killed, but at the loss of a LRR operator who got shot in the neck. The operators loaded up the two bodies and made their getaway, while being shot at by Abu Sayyaf and Moro Islamic Liberation Front.|$|E

[...] In a statement following the broadcast, Discovery Channel re-affirmed that the safety of Rosolie and the anaconda were a top priority, and that he [...] "created this challenge to get maximum attention {{for one of the most}} beautiful and threatened parts of the world, the Amazon Rainforest and its wildlife.

500|$|The Rhodesians {{were then}} summoned {{back out into}} the main lounge, where Kissinger insisted that their prime {{minister}} sit next to him. [...] "Ian Smith made accepting the deal worse by acting like a gentleman," [...] the American later said. Vorster opened the discussion by announcing that he had applied no pressure to the Rhodesian delegates, which caused further consternation amongst the Rhodesians which they had difficulty suppressing. It was agreed that the Rhodesians should return to Salisbury and consult their cabinet, then announce their answer. Despite expressing [...] "incredulity" [...] at what had happened in Pretoria, and showing deep reluctance, the politicians in Salisbury resolved that despite what they perceived as [...] "South African treachery" [...] the responsible course of action could only be to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> peace process, and that meant accepting Kissinger's terms, which they agreed were better than any they could get in the future should they refuse. Smith announced his government's answer on the evening of 24 September 1976: [...] "Yes." [...] South Africa's wavering financial and military assistance suddenly became available again, but the Frontline States then abruptly changed tact and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any interim period before majority rule was unacceptable. A new constitutional conference in Geneva, Switzerland was hastily organised by Britain to try to salvage something from the wreckage, with 20 October 1976 set as the start date.|$|E
500|$|While {{the army}} was {{studying}} a possible modernisation of its brand-new AMX-30E fleet, the Spanish Ministry of Defense had set aside 120billion pesetas (1.1billion dollars) for a future tank programme and attracted interest from five foreign companies. [...] A bid by Krauss-Maffei's, known as the Lince, provided the clearest technical designs. The tank would be [...] and equipped with a 120-millimeter main gun. It could fire this gun on the move and aim at targets with effectiveness in day and night operations. Fitted with a 1,200horsepower (894.84kW) engine, the Lince could travel as fast as 70kilometers per hour (43.50mph) on the roads. [...] Although heavily based on the Leopard 2A4, the Lince was smaller and lighter, trading protection for mobility. Specifically, the Lince prioritised enhanced mobility over the irregular Spanish terrain. [...] Furthermore, size restrictions were imposed due to the existing capabilities of Spain's railroad and highway network. [...] Although the reduced armor conflicted with the problems that the Spanish had with AMX-30E's thin armour, the Lince used a multi-layer armor {{similar to that of}} the German Leopard 2A4, providing greater protection than standard armour for a similar weight. The protection was further enhanced by the low profile turret, again {{similar to that of the}} Leopard 2A4. [...] Despite the offer and ongoing collaboration with the Italians, Spanish investment in the German-Spanish Lince programme grew up to 200billion pesetas (1.8billion dollars). However, the Spanish government did not announce any winner for the contract. This indecision led Krauss-Maffei to freeze their bid for the Lince. Krauss-Maffei also cited the loss of millions of dollars due to failures on part of Santa Bárbara Sistemas, who would manufacture the Lince. [...] In 1987, the Lince program was pushed aside and postponed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense's decision to instead <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> modernisation of the Spanish Army's AMX-30E fleet. [...] Ultimately, the purchase of a number of M60 Patton tanks, the modernisation of the AMX-30E and the continued fiscal problems finally caused the Spanish Ministry of Defense to cancel the Lince programme in 1989.|$|E
