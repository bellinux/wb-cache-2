25|$|The {{negative}} sign <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> {{because we}} {{are concerned with the}} faster moving liquid (top in figure), which is being slowed by the slower liquid (bottom in figure). By Newton's third law of motion, the force on the slower liquid is equal and opposite (no negative sign) to the force on the faster liquid. This equation assumes that the area of contact is so large that we can ignore any effects from the edges and that the fluids behave as Newtonian fluids.|$|E

500|$|Well, let’s see… the {{guy with}} the poodle on his head would be me. The very {{pregnant}} woman with the sunglasses is my wife Suzanne. The guy in the surgical scrubs is my friend Joel Miller. The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin-once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for [...] "The Saga Begins"). Uh Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay's son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for The Weird Al Show, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne's oldest friends. Bermuda's wife Leslie <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> too. Plus there’s my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt's boyfriend… I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.|$|E

500|$|... is a kunoichi from Konohagakure and {{a classmate}} of Team Minato's. She was {{assigned}} to a team {{under the tutelage of}} Orochimaru. The two became fond of each other, and Orochimaru ultimately decided to give Anko some of his research. However, this resulted in Anko being the only survivor of ten Cursed Seal subjects, and also develop various snake-like abilities. After Orochimaru abandoned his village, Anko blamed herself for what happened and made it her personal goal to redeem him. At the start of the series, she is a loud, brash tokubetsu jonin and the proctor of {{the second part of the}} Chunin Exams. After prematurely arriving to take the examinees to the Forest of Death, she ends up frightening Naruto when he complains about her [...] "exaggerations" [...] of the forest. She also fights Orochimaru in the forest alone when she discovers he <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> During Part II, Anko is sent by the Allied Shinobi Forces to find and locate Kabuto. However, Kabuto ends up defeating her in battle, and uses her Cursed Seal to fuel his Reanimation Jutsu while she is unconscious. Taka later finds her and uses her Cursed Seal to release Orochimaru, causing the Seal to be cured. In the epilogue, Anko is revealed to have been found, and is an instructor at the Academy, while also becoming rather fat. In Japanese, Anko is voiced by Takako Honda. In the English dub, she is voiced by Julianne Buescher until Episode 169, when Laura Bailey takes over; Anko is also voiced by Kari Wahlgren in [...]|$|E
500|$|That night, Michael, Vega and the SWAT team {{watch the}} {{warehouse}} {{but no one}} shows up; Vega wonders if Jake had given incorrect information. Back in the [...] "green reality", Michael goes to the hotel, since Alina had left {{in the middle of}} the night. Once there, Marcus warns Michael and Bird that if they do not find her, Marcus will give himself up to Maxim Basayev, his mobster boss. Back at the station, after looking at evidence, Michael decides to talk to the hotel staff where Alina and Marcus are staying, with Bird, rather than Alina's friends. Later, Michael and Bird go to the home of Greg Hollander (Ron Melendez), one of Alina's friends, but do not find Greg, the person they would like to question regarding Alina's whereabouts. Hollander, who is tied up, kicks down a table as the detectives leave, notifying the cops that he <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> As the criminals run away, Bird and Michael break into the house; Bird and Michael enter the house, while Bird shoots the two gang members. After that, they speak to Greg, who tells them that Alina constantly talks about how she and her husband have grown apart. Michael goes to search for Alina at a beach and finds her there. The two talk about Marcus and everything that happened previously. Michael explains that she has a chance to start over and takes her back to the hotel. In the [...] "red reality", at Jake's home, Jake says he and Vega can have dinner alone to get to know each other. That night, Michael and Hannah go nude swimming at the college pool.|$|E
500|$|For {{the roles}} of Jane, Ricky, and Angela, DreamWorks gave Mendes carte blanche. By November 1998, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari had been cast in the parts—in Birch's case, despite the fact she was underage for her nude scene. As Birch was 16 {{at the time she}} made the film, and thus {{classified}} as a minor in the United States, her parents had to approve her brief topless scene in the movie. Child labor representatives were on the set for the shooting of the scene. Bentley overcame competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast. The 2009 documentary My Big Break followed Bentley, and several other young actors, before and after he landed the part. To prepare, Mendes provided Bentley with a video camera, telling the actor to film what Ricky would. Peter Gallagher and Alison Janney were cast (as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fitts) after filming began in December 1998. Mendes gave Janney a book of paintings by Edvard Munch. He told her, [...] "Your character <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> somewhere." [...] Mendes cut much of Barbara's dialogue, including conversations between Colonel Fitts and her, as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair—their humanity and vulnerability—was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence. Chris Cooper plays Colonel Fitts, Scott Bakula plays Jim Olmeyer, and Sam Robards plays Jim Berkley. Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal, happy—and boring—couple in the film. Ball's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a [...] "bland, boring, heterosexual couple" [...] who wore matching clothes: [...] "I can't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring." [...] Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same forename.|$|E
