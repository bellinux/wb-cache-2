500|$|In August 1910, the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean fleet {{conducted}} a gunnery practice using the old ironclad Fulminant as a target; Démocratie scored 22.7percent hits, the second best {{performance in the}} squadron and surpassed only by her sister Justice. During a fleet exercise on 28 May 1914, Démocratie collided with the [...] battleship [...] when the latter vessel lost power. Suffren was only lightly damaged, with her port anchor and <b>hawsepipe</b> carried away.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1906 Suffrens above-water torpedo tubes were removed. She was drydocked {{adjacent}} to Iéna on 12 March 1907 at Toulon when the latter ship's magazine exploded. Burning fragments started a small fire aboard Suffren, {{but she was not}} otherwise damaged by the explosion. In early 1908 a [...] Barr and Stroud rangefinder was mounted on the navigation bridge. During manoeuvres off Golfe-Juan on 13 August 1908 the ship's port propeller shaft broke and the propeller fell off in water [...] deep. While a new shaft was ordered from Indret, Iénas corresponding shaft was used with such success that the ship's engineers requested to keep it in place and save the new shaft as a spare. This proposal was rejected by the Naval Ministry and the offending shaft was exchanged. The opportunity was also taken to successfully rework the centre propeller shaft's mounting so that it would overheat less often. In November 1910 the starboard propeller shaft broke and the propeller was lost in deep water. No shaft was immediately available so Suffren had to wait three months for repairs. In the meantime, however, her boilers were overhauled. On 14 February 1911 the port anchor chain broke, killing one sailor and injuring two others. During another fleet exercise on 28 May 1914 Suffren suddenly lost power and was struck by the battleship [...] She was only lightly damaged with her port anchor and <b>hawsepipe</b> carried away.|$|E
500|$|On 6 March 1862, {{the ship}} {{departed}} New York bound for Fort Monroe, Virginia, towed by the ocean-going tug Seth Low {{and accompanied by}} the gunboats [...] and [...] Worden, not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull, and ignoring Ericsson's advice, wedged the former in the up position and stuffed oakum and sail cloth in the gap. Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret, {{as well as through}} the <b>hawsepipe,</b> various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished {{over the course of the}} next day; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it near impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. Monitor was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.|$|E
50|$|Claw types have {{difficulty}} penetrating weedy bottoms and grass. They offer a fairly low holding-power-to-weight ratio and generally {{have to be}} oversized to compete with newer types. On the other hand, {{they have a good}} reputation in boulder bottoms, perform relatively well with low rode scopes and set fairly reliably. They cannot be used with <b>hawsepipes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The stockless anchor, {{patented}} in England in 1821, {{represented the}} first significant departure in anchor design in centuries. Though their holding-power-to-weight ratio is significantly lower than admiralty pattern anchors, their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption. In contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors, stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the <b>hawsepipes,</b> and the flukes against the hull (or inside a recess in the hull).|$|R
25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 8 June 2007, Newcastle Port Corporation radioed the 56 moored ships waiting off the coast to load coal to warn them to move out to sea to escape an {{approaching}} storm. Pasha Bulker, along with 10 other ships, did not heed the warning. As the storm hit, Pasha Bulker could not clear the coast and it beached at 9:51am. The ship never called for tug assistance, ran aground with a fully operational engine room and still had both anchors stored in the <b>hawsepipes</b> leading some maritime experts to believe that proper precautions were not taken by the ship's captain.|$|R

50|$|American Richard Danforth {{invented the}} Danforth {{pattern in the}} 1940s for use aboard landing craft. It uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat {{triangular}} flukes are attached. The stock is hinged so the flukes can orient toward the bottom (and on some designs may be adjusted for an optimal angle depending on the bottom type). Tripping palms at the crown act to tip the flukes into the seabed. The design is a burying variety, and once well set can develop high resistance. Its lightweight and compact flat design {{make it easy to}} retrieve and relatively easy to store; some anchor rollers and <b>hawsepipes</b> can accommodate a fluke-style anchor.|$|R

50|$|Owing {{to the use}} of lead {{or other}} {{dedicated}} tip-weight, the plough is heavier than average for the amount of resistance developed, and may take more careful technique and a longer period to set thoroughly. It cannot be stored in a <b>hawsepipe.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The trailboards are {{a pair of}} {{boards that}} may {{be found at the}} bow of certain sailing vessels, where they run from the figurehead or billethead back to or towards the <b>hawsepipe.</b> They are in the main decorative, though they often bear the name of the ship; they may be more or less elaborately carved and painted.|$|E

Hawsepiper refers to {{climbing}} up the <b>hawsepipe,</b> a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. This is in turn derived from the traditional British Naval usage of [...] "came up through the hawsehole," [...] referring to sailors who first entered the ship as foremast jacks before becoming officers, metaphorically by climbing up the hawser without great honor or respect, rather than being received directly onto the quarterdeck.There is also the phrase, [...] "going down the hawse pipe" [...] which is an officer who cannot find a ship's billet and signs on as an ordinary seaman or wiper.Several [...] offer their membership the required training to help them advance. [...] Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance {{to pay for the}} training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training.|$|E

5000|$|Handling {{and storage}} of these anchors {{requires}} special equipment and procedures. Once the anchor is hauled {{up to the}} <b>hawsepipe,</b> the ring end is hoisted {{up to the end}} of a timber projecting from the bow known as the cathead. The crown of the anchor is then hauled up with a heavy tackle until one fluke can be hooked over the rail. This is known as [...] "catting and fishing" [...] the anchor. Before dropping the anchor, the fishing process is reversed, and the anchor is dropped from the end of the cathead.|$|E
50|$|The {{next two}} months were uneventful, and Weehawken lay {{anchored}} off Morris Island during a moderate gale early {{on the morning of}} 6 December. Suddenly, the ironclad signalled for assistance and appeared to observers ashore to be sinking. Attempts to beach the vessel failed, and she sank bow first five minutes later in 30 ft of water. A court of inquiry found that Weehawken had recently taken on a considerable amount of heavy ammunition in her forward compartments. This change excessively reduced her forward freeboard, causing water to rush down an open <b>hawsepipe</b> and hatch during the storm. As the bow sank, and the stern rose, water could not flow aft to the pumps and the vessel foundered.|$|E
5000|$|Stockless anchors {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{used in the}} British mercantile marine and in some other navies. In 1903 they were adopted generally for the British Navy, after extensive anchor trials, begun in 1885. Their advantages are: handiness combined with a saving of time and labor; absence of davits, anchor-beds, and other gear, with a resulting reduction in weight; and a clear forecastyle for [...] "right ahead" [...] gun fire or for working ship. On the other hand a larger <b>hawsepipe</b> is required, and {{there appears to be}} a consensus that a stockless anchor, when [...] "let go" [...] does not hold so quickly as a stocked one, is more uncertain in its action over uneven ground, and is more liable to [...] "come home" [...] (drag).|$|E
5000|$|The anchor is {{shackled}} to {{the anchor}} cable (US anchor chain), the cable passes {{up through the}} <b>hawsepipe,</b> through the pawl, over the windlass gypsy (US wildcat) down through the [...] "spurling pipe" [...] to the chain/cable locker under the forecastle (or poop if at the stern (US fantail)) - the anchor [...] are on a bulkhead in the cable locker and the [...] of the cable {{is connected to the}} bitts using the bitter pin, which should be able to be released from outside the locker to [...] "slip" [...] the anchor. This would occur if the windlass brake has slipped (in a storm, for example) and the cable has reached [...] "the bitter end". This is the origin of the term [...] "to the bitter end". It originally applied in sailing vessels where the cable was a rope, and the windlass or capstan was powered by many sailors below decks.|$|E
50|$|The {{lower part}} of the bow of the vessel, instead of being made solid as usual, is {{composed}} of two iron flaps, each hinged at the top, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When closed, the outer surfaces of these flaps correspond to the general shape of the bow, and, when the torpedo machinery is not being worked, they are kept down in their places by means of chains attached to them near their lower edges, and passing in through a pair of hawsepipes situated between the flaps. Each chain, after entering its <b>hawsepipe,</b> is attached to an iron rod, these rods passing into the vessel through stuffing-boxes at the inner ends of the hawsepipes. From the inner ends of these rods chains are led, over guide pulleys, to the ends of a winch, situated as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and by means of this winch, which is worked by hand, the flaps can be closed when required. The opening of the flaps is effected by the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 4, from which it will be seen that each flap has a chain attached to its outside, and that these chains, after being led up over guide pulleys supported by brackets placed {{at the level of the}} gunwale, are crossed and then led down through hawseholes in the deck to the winch below. The chains for opening, in fact, form continuations of those for closing the flaps, or vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the night}} around 1:15 a.m. the storm increased, her port anchor chain broke, and {{half an hour}} later the {{starboard}} anchor chain snapped close the <b>hawsepipe.</b> Left to the mercy of the raging seas the pounding schooner was smashed starboardside on against Shag Rock near Annet by tremendously heavy seas after having grounded on the dangerous underwater rocks. All seven masts broke off and fell into the sea with all of the seamen who had climbed the rigging for safety, on their captain's command. The stern section broke apart behind mast no. 6, drifting from the capsizing and sinking ship. In the morning light the ship's upturned keel could be seen near the reef from which the wreck slid off into deeper water later on. Some 16 of the 18 crew and the Scillonian pilot Wm. [...] "Cook" [...] Hicks who was already on board having climbed up the spanker rigging for safety were lost. Captain George W. Dow and engineer Edward L. Rowe from Boston were the only survivors, probably because they managed to get on deck from the rigging and jumped into the sea before the ship capsized. Both were lucky in being washed to a rock in the Hellweathers, to the south of the wrecking site, to be rescued hours later on, by the pilot's son, in the six-oared gig Slippen, looking for his father, Despite wearing their lifebelts, the other seamen died in the thick oil layer, the smashing seas, and the schooner's rigging that had drowned so many of the crew, including the pilot. Four bodies were found later - those of Mark Stenton from Brooklyn, cabin boy, of two seamen from Germany and Scandinavia, and that of a man from Nova Scotia or Maine. Furthermore, some bodies without heads, legs or arms were also found which could not be identified. They were all buried in a mass grave in St Agnes cemetery.|$|E
