30|$|All traits were {{analysed}} through two-way ANOVA using a nested {{design with}} two levels and a covariate. Mother plants and sites are random nested factors within provenance, provenance is a fixed factor and seed mass is the covariate, which was tested {{at both the}} between- and within-provenance levels. This was done with type-III sum of squares, using SPSS software version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The mean values showing significant differences were compared with the Tukey test at P[*]≤[*] 0.05. In the <b>germination</b> <b>experiment,</b> the germination capacity {{at the end of}} the <b>germination</b> <b>experiment</b> and seed mass were analysed. The results of all tests are presented as both final germination percentage and as Czabator’s factor (Czabator 1962). This factor combines maximum daily average germination (called “peak value”) and average daily germination {{at the end of the}} test to form one statistic called “germination value”. In the growth experiment, comparisons for categorical variables (i.e. SUR) were done using a chi-square test. Associations between germination capacity with latitude and climatic variables were analysed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Climatic data for the study area was obtained from Santibáñez and Uribe (1993).|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{salinity}} stress effects resulted from sodium chloride on germination, vegetative growth, elements concentration and proline accumulation in five canola cultivars, two experiments were conducted. They were carried out in germinator and greenhouse at the Research Station of the Faculty of Agriculture in Baku State University. The first factor of the experiment was canola cultivar - Licord, Fornax, Okapi, Elite, SLM 046, and the second factor was salinity stress level: 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mM NaCl in a <b>germination</b> <b>experiment</b> and 0, 75, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mM NaCl in a pot experiment. The results showed that different salinity stress levels had significant effect on germination percentage, germination speed and shoot and root length. In the pot experiment there was significantly effect on plant height, leaf area, dry matter, elements concentration, proline accumulation and seed yield due to salinity stress. It was observed significant effect of the cultivar on investigated traits except leaf area. Increase of salinity level decreased all variable except sodium, chlorine and proline concentration. Sodium, chlorine and proline concentration were increased by salinity stress. Response of canola cultivars was different at germination and vegetative growth stages. In <b>germination</b> <b>experiment,</b> the most sensitive and most tolerate cultivars were Elite and Licord, respectively. However, in pot experiment, Licord cv. had least growth rate and yield than SLM 046 and Okapi. Significant differences between these cultivars were observed. It seems that evaluation of germination properties is not useful for assessment of salinity tolerance of canola cultivars...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} trait locus analysis was carried out to unravel the genetic basis of dormancy in wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) from Israel. Two accessions, Ashkelon and Mehola, from divergent environments were crossed to produce a mapping population. A linkage map was produced from the F 2 population, and F 4 seeds were used for <b>germination</b> <b>experiments.</b> Five {{quantitative trait}} loci (QTL) were detected for dormancy across the different <b>germination</b> <b>experiments.</b> These QTL were found on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. The variation explained by each QTL varied between 8 and 25 %. Ashkelon alleles increased the germination except for the QTL on chromosome 5. Three out of these five QTL co-locate with QTL found earlier in cultivated barley crosses, although this does not necessarily imply {{that they would be}} the same loci. The level of dormancy is much higher in wild barley than in cultivated barley and wild barley may have alleles that have not yet been utilised in breeding for optimally dormant barley...|$|R

Several techniques for enhancement of germination and culture of seedlings (scarification, dark/cold pretreatment, surface disinfection, and addition of growth-enhancing chemical agents) were evaluated. Maximal germination rates did not exceed 10 percent, suggesting that culture of Ceratophyllum from seed {{may not be a}} viable means for axenic propagation of plants under laboratory conditions...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacterial blooms are {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent worldwide. Sparse historic phytoplankton records often result in uncertainty as to whether bloom-forming species have always been present and are proliferating in response to eutrophication or climate change, or {{if there has been}} a succession of new arrivals through recent history. This study evaluated the relative efficacies of <b>germination</b> <b>experiments</b> and automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) assays in identifying cyanobacteria in a sediment core and thus reconstructing the historical composition of cyanobacterial communities. A core (360 mm in depth) was taken in the central, undisturbed basin of Lake Okaro, New Zealand, a lake with a rapid advance of eutrophication and increasing cyanobacteria populations. The core incorporated a tephra from an 1886 volcanic eruption that served to delineate recent sediment deposition. ARISA and <b>germination</b> <b>experiments</b> successfully detected akinete-forming nostocaleans in sediment dating 120 bp and showed little change in Nostocales species structure over this time scale. Species that had not previously been documented in the lake were identified including Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi, a potent anatoxin-a producer. The historic composition of Chrococcales and Oscillatoriales was more difficult to reconstruct, potentially due to the relatively rapid degradation of vegetative cells within sediment...|$|R
40|$|A {{successful}} in situ <b>germination</b> <b>experiment</b> with Cypripedium calceolus, the European Lady’s slipper, is reported {{here for the}} first time. The seeds originated from controlled pollinations within and between two closely related Danish populations. The seeds were sown ripe in seed packets in proximity of mother plants. Germination was first observed after 4. 5 y in the ground, following two successive cold and snowy winters, and only in one population. Seedlings expanded through the sides of the broken testa and were hair-less. A corresponding set of seeds, germinated in vitro as asymbiotic controls, responded positively to repeated cold stratifications after long incubation, suggesting that time (leaching?) and chilling are dormancy breakage factors...|$|E

40|$|Folsom Lake is a dammed {{reservoir}} experiencing anthropogenic lake level fluctuations {{that have}} created a novel germination time for Lupinus nanus. The recently discovered summer germinating plants begin to grow in May-June, just after the typical winter germinating plants in that location die. Since flowering of summer and winter germinating plants is temporally isolated, and plants are subject to differing selective pressures, they could be two independently evolving populations. Alternatively, they {{could be part of}} one population that can respond to both natural and anthropogenic germination cues. Through a common garden experiment, a <b>germination</b> <b>experiment,</b> and microsatellite analyses of plants from these environments, these hypotheses are tested.
