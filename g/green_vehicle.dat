25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{vehicles are}} not usually included in the <b>green</b> <b>vehicle</b> category, but Personal rapid transit (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track {{have the advantage of}} potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential PRT energy efficiency is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>green</b> <b>vehicle,</b> {{or clean}} vehicle, or {{eco-friendly}} vehicle or environmentally-friendly vehicle is a road motor vehicle that produces less harmful impacts {{to the environment}} than comparable conventional internal combustion engine vehicles running on gasoline or diesel, or one that uses certain alternative fuels. [...] Presently, in some countries the term is used for any vehicle complying or surpassing the more stringent European emission standards (such as Euro6), or California's zero-emissions vehicle standards (such as ZEV, ULEV, SULEV, PZEV), or the low-carbon fuel standards enacted in several countries.|$|E

2500|$|A 2012 {{study by}} the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) funded by the RAC Foundation found that the government's drive to promote green {{vehicles}} with a lower carbon footprint {{could result in a}} significant loss of revenue from motoring taxes, estimated at [...] billion by 2029 at current prices, according to forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility. This revenue decline is partly due to improved vehicle efficiency and the growth of plug-in electric vehicles. Among the options available to the government to offset the loss, a further increase of the duty on petrol and diesel or the introduction of new taxes on alternative energy sources such as electricity for vehicles were considered. However, due to lack of popularity of the former and the risks of hindering the entire <b>green</b> <b>vehicle</b> strategy, the IFS study recommended to introduce a nationwide system of road pricing to charge drivers by each mile driven, with higher pricing in congested areas at peak times, while reducing the existing motoring taxes. Under this strategy drivers in the countryside would be likely to pay less, as rural motorists are currently overtaxed according to the study.|$|E

25|$|In {{practice}} {{there is}} a sliding scale of green transport depending on the sustainability of the option. <b>Green</b> <b>vehicles</b> are more fuel-efficient, but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronised public transport networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Green</b> public transport <b>vehicles</b> including electric trains, trams and electric buses combine the advantages of <b>green</b> <b>vehicles</b> with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are cycling and other human-powered vehicles, and animal powered transport. The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is walking.|$|R
