5|$|In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann {{suggests}} that Shaw {{was a key}} forerunner—"godfather, if not actually <b>finicky</b> paterfamilias"—of the Theatre of the Absurd. Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaw's short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.|$|E
25|$|The Willamette Valley of Oregon is at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as the Burgundy region of France, and has a similar climate in which the <b>finicky</b> Pinot noir grapes thrive. In 1987, Drouhin purchased land in the Willamette Valley, and in 1989 built Domaine Drouhin Oregon, a state-of-the-art, gravity-fed winery. Throughout the 1980s, the Oregon wine industry blossomed.|$|E
25|$|On its face, {{quantum field}} theory allows {{infinite}} numbers of particles, and leaves {{it up to the}} theory itself to predict how many and with which probabilities or numbers they should exist. When developed further, the theory often contradicts observation, so that its creation and annihilation operators can be empirically tied down. Furthermore, empirical conservation laws like that of mass-energy suggest certain constraints on the mathematical form of the theory, which are mathematically speaking <b>finicky.</b> The latter fact both serves to make quantum field theories difficult to handle, but has also lead to further restrictions on admissible forms of the theory; the complications are mentioned below under the rubrik of renormalization.|$|E
500|$|Early in life, Dewey was {{diagnosed}} with megacolon, which was expected to shorten his lifespan. The condition was aggravated by his refusal to eat foods that would ease his condition, as he was a notoriously <b>finicky</b> eater. In later years he was also afflicted with arthritis. In October 2006 he was discovered to be suffering from hyperthyroidism. Shortly before November 18, he {{was diagnosed}} with a painful stomach tumor. Myron had Dewey euthanized on November 29. He had achieved an age equivalent to a human in his nineties.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, reviewers from GamesRadar and Computer and Video Games {{appreciated}} the linear nature; the former stated that [...] "the streamlined, focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down", {{while the latter}} felt it was [...] "a clever move", and kept the player from being [...] " [...] down with mundane number crunching, [...] <b>finicky</b> and repetitive leveling-up." [...] Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player's abilities over this {{first part of the}} game, from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader. Combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as [...] "boring" [...] until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed. Edge noted that while it did not do enough {{to make up for the}} opening chapters, at Gran Pulse the game [...] "hits a sweet spot" [...] as the narrative offers [...] "hunting side-quests and the simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is around the next corner." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} critical acclaim. Christopher John Farley of Time {{called the}} album [...] "the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet". Farley wrote, [...] "One gets {{the feeling that}} the band [...] charged ahead on gut instincts; the sheer scope of the album (28 songs) didn't allow for second-guessing or contrivance." [...] Time selected Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness as the best album of the year in its year-end [...] "Best of 1995" [...] list. Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A rating; reviewer David Browne praised the group's ambition and wrote, [...] "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is more than just the work of a tortured, <b>finicky</b> pop obsessive. Corgan presents himself as one of the last true believers: someone for whom spewing out this much music results in some sort of high art for the ages. He doesn't seem concerned with persistent alterna-rock questions of 'selling out', and good for him: He's aiming for something bigger and all-conquering." [...] IGN gave the album a score of 9.5 out of 10 and said, [...] "As the band's magnum opus it single-handedly changed the face of Alternative Rock. That said, it's not just music, but a work of art." [...] The Music Box gave it all five stars and said, [...] "Indeed, for all its melodramatic self-indulgence, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness {{is one of the best}} double albums of new material to be released by anyone in a long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} criticised for some {{negative}} issues, such as lapses {{in the control}} system. The New York Times noted that [...] "...its <b>finicky</b> controls can frustrate at times." [...] Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer found, [...] "There are ... a few occasions where the platforming lets you down ... despite the feeling you were jumping in the right direction." [...] IGN described certain repetitive gunfight sequences as [...] "a little aggravating" [...] and complained about the [...] "very linear" [...] climbing sections, yet calling it a forced complaint.|$|E
2500|$|Time Out New York said, [...] "The {{dominating}} creative contribution {{comes from}} Minnelli and Cecil Beaton… The {{combination of these}} two visual elitists is really too much—it's like a meal consisting of cheesecake, and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down. No doubt inspired by the <b>finicky,</b> claustrophobic sets and bric-à-brac, the cast tries (with unfortunate success) to be more French than the French, especially Chevalier. The exception is Gingold, who inhabits, as always, a world of her own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Polyhistidine-tagging {{can be used}} {{to detect}} protein-protein {{interactions}} {{in the same way as}} a pull-down assay. [...] However, this technique is generally considered to be less sensitive, and also restricted by some of the more <b>finicky</b> aspects of this technique. [...] For example, reducing conditions cannot be used, EDTA and many types of detergents cannot be used. Recent advances in dual polarisation interferometry is amenable to EDTA and a wider use of reagents, and the use of such site-specific tags greatly simplifies the direct measurement of associated conformational change.|$|E
2500|$|Diwan-i-Aam, the Hall of Public Audience, is {{a marble}} floored chamber located between the armoury {{and the art}} gallery. There are two huge {{sterling}} silver vessels of [...] height and each with capacity of 4000 litres and weighing , on display here. They were made from 14,000 melted silver coins without soldering. They hold the Guinness World Record as the world's largest sterling silver vessels. These vessels were specially made by Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II, who was a highly pious Hindu, to carry {{the water of the}} Ganges to drink on his trip to England in 1901 (for Edward VII's coronation) as he was <b>finicky</b> about committing religious sin by consuming the English water. Hence, the vessels are named as Gangajelies (Ganges-water urns). There are a number of crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling (normally covered with plastic sheets to prevent dust collection), which are uncovered on special occasions.|$|E
2500|$|The Wall of Sound {{was a large}} {{sound system}} {{designed}} specifically for the Grateful Dead. The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played. After the Monterey Pop Festival, the band's crew 'borrowed' {{some of the other}} performers' sound equipment and used it to host some free shows in San Francisco. In their early days, soundman Owsley [...] "Bear" [...] Stanley designed a public address (PA) and monitor system for them. Bear was the Grateful Dead's soundman for many years; he {{was also one of the}} largest suppliers of LSD. Stanley's sound systems were delicate and <b>finicky,</b> and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970 the group contacted Bob Heil to use his system. In 1971, the band purchased their first solid-state sound system from Alembic Inc Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed Dan Healy into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} coming together of the University. It represented the unspoiled neighborliness and sex camaraderie of the West.

6000|$|He {{was one of}} {{the best}} dressed men in the school, and {{especially}} <b>finicky</b> about his collars and ties,--was, indeed, one of the earliest to purchase linen. He also parted his yellow hair in the middle (which was a very noticeable thing in those days) and was always talking of taking a girl to a social or to prayer meeting. But, like Burton, he never did.

Such feminine [...] "hanky-panky tricks," [...] he assured her, were the cause of [...] "all these <b>finicky,</b> unhappy marriages and these rotten divorces--lot of fool clubwomen and suffragettes and highbrows expecting a man to be like a nun.

Got a swell little house in Yonkers, and a vacuum cleaner, and a hired girl, and everything. Then, my God! she said she was lonely! Didn't have enough housework, that was the trouble with her; and darned if she doesn't kick when J. J. comes in all played out at night because he makes himself comfortable and sits around in his shirt-sleeves and slippers.

60|$|No {{one seems}} really {{to know the}} cause of the South Sea elephantiasis. One theory is that it is caused by the {{drinking}} of polluted water. Another theory attributes it to inoculation through mosquito bites. A third theory charges it to predisposition plus the process of acclimatization. On the other hand, no one that stands in <b>finicky</b> dread of it and similar diseases can afford to travel in the South Seas. There will be occasions when such a one must drink water. There may be also occasions when the mosquitoes let up biting. But every precaution of the <b>finicky</b> one will be useless. If he runs barefoot across the beach to have a swim, he will tread where an elephantiasis case trod a few minutes before. If he closets himself in his own house, yet every bit of fresh food on his table will have been subjected to the contamination, be it flesh, fish, fowl, or vegetable. In the public market at Papeete two known lepers run stalls, and heaven alone knows through what channels arrive at that market the daily supplies of fish, fruit, meat, and vegetables. The only happy way to go through the South Seas is with a careless poise, without apprehension, and with a Christian Science-like faith in the resplendent fortune of your own particular star. When you see a woman, afflicted with elephantiasis wringing out cream from cocoanut meat with her naked hands, drink and reflect how good is the cream, forgetting the hands that pressed it out. Also, remember that diseases such as elephantiasis and leprosy {{do not seem to be}} caught by contact.|$|E

I {{remember}} telling Matthew, that evening when he brought me to Green Gables, that I never {{expected to be a}} bride because I was so homely no one would ever want to marry me--unless some foreign missionary did. I had an idea then that foreign missionaries couldn't afford to be <b>finicky</b> in the matter of looks if they wanted a girl to risk her life among cannibals. You should have seen the foreign missionary Priscilla married. He was as handsome and inscrutable as those daydreams we once planned to marry ourselves, Diana; he was the best dressed man I ever met, and he raved over Priscilla's 'ethereal, golden beauty.' But of course there are no cannibals in Japan." ...|$|E
60|$|On weekdays {{the women}} who passed the window were meagrely dressed; mothers in draggled winsey gowns, {{carrying}} infants that were armfuls of grandeur. The Sabbath clothed every one in her best, and then the women went by with their hands spread out. When I was with Hendry cloaks with beads were the fashion, and Jess sighed {{as she looked at}} them. They were known in Thrums as the Eleven and a Bits (threepenny bits), that being their price at Kyowowy's in the square. Kyowowy means <b>finicky,</b> and applied to the draper by general consent. No doubt it was very characteristic to call the cloaks by their market value. In the glen my scholars still talk of their school-books as the tupenny, the fowerpenny, the sax-penny. They finish their education with the ten-penny.|$|E
6000|$|What a strange, {{new world}} this ancient city was to us, as we issued {{from the old}} Hoosac Tunnel station! The {{intersection}} of every street {{was a bit of}} history. The houses standing sidewise to the gutter, the narrow, ledge-like pavements, the awkward two-wheeled drays and carts, the men selling lobsters on the corner, the newsboys with their [...] "papahs," [...] the faces of the women so thin and pale, the men, neat, dapper, small, many of them walking with <b>finicky</b> precision as though treading on eggs,--everything had a Yankee tang, a special quality, and then, the noise! We had thought Chicago noisy, and so it was, but here the clamor was high-keyed, deafening for the reason that the rain-washed streets were paved with cobble stones over which enormous carts bumped and clattered with resounding riot.|$|E

(Not but what he might be just as good at all these intellectual and art things as some other folks, if he had the time for it!)" [...] Dr. Will Kennicott was brooding in his office, during a free moment {{toward the end of the}} summer afternoon. He hunched down in his tilted desk-chair, undid a button of his shirt, glanced at the state news in the back of the Journal of the American Medical Association, dropped the magazine, leaned back with his right thumb hooked in the arm-hole of his vest and his left thumb stroking the back of his hair.|$|E
6000|$|We {{took our}} {{position}} on K Street, on the corner, I think, of Fifth. It {{was early in}} the evening and the street was crowded. Bob studied the head-gear of every Chinaman that passed. I used to wonder how the road-kids all managed to wear [...] "five-dollar Stetson stiff-rims," [...] and now I knew. They got them, the way I was going to get mine, from the Chinese. I was nervous--there were so many people about; but Bob was cool as an iceberg. Several times, when I started forward toward a Chinaman, all nerved and keyed up, Bob dragged me back. He wanted me to get a good hat, and one that fitted. Now a hat came by that was the right size but not new; and, after a dozen impossible hats, along would come one that was new but not the right size. And when one did come by that was new and the right size, the rim was too large or not large enough. My, Bob was <b>finicky.</b> I was so wrought up that I'd have snatched any kind of a head-covering.|$|E
6000|$|Just {{one word}} upon another {{eighteenth-century}} novel before I finish this somewhat didactic chat. You {{will admit that}} I have never prosed so much before, but the period and the subject seem to encourage it. I skip Sterne, for I have no great sympathy with his <b>finicky</b> methods. And I skip Miss Burney's novels, as being feminine reflections of the great masters who had just preceded her. But Goldsmith's [...] "Vicar of Wakefield" [...] surely deserves one paragraph to itself. There is a book which is tinged throughout, as was all Goldsmith's work, with a beautiful nature. No one who had not a fine heart could have written it, just as no one without a fine heart could have written [...] "The Deserted Village." [...] How strange it is to think of old Johnson patronizing or snubbing the shrinking Irishman, when both in poetry, in fiction, and in the drama the latter has proved himself far the greater man. But here is an object-lesson of how {{the facts of life}} may be treated without offence. Nothing is shirked. It is all faced and duly recorded. Yet if I wished to set before the sensitive mind of a young girl a book which would prepare her for life without in any way contaminating her delicacy of feeling, there is no book which I should choose so readily as [...] "The Vicar of Wakefield." ...|$|E
