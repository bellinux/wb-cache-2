40|$|A new {{methodology}} for retrieval of glacier and ice sheet <b>elevations</b> and <b>elevation</b> changes from CryoSat- 2 data is presented. Surface <b>elevations</b> and <b>elevation</b> changes determined using this approach show significant improvements over ESA's publicly available CryoSat- 2 <b>elevation</b> product (L 2 Baseline-B). The results are compared to near-coincident airborne laser altimetry from NASA's Operation IceBridge and seasonal height amplitudes from the Ice, Cloud, and <b>Elevation</b> Satellite (ICESat). Applying this methodology to CryoSat- 2 data collected in interferometric {{synthetic aperture mode}} (SIN) over the high-relief regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet we find an improvement in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 27 and 40  % compared to ESA's L 2 product in the derived <b>elevation</b> and <b>elevation</b> changes, respectively. In the interior part of the ice sheet, where CryoSat- 2 operates in low-resolution mode (LRM), we find an improvement in the RMSE of 68 and 55  % in the derived <b>elevation</b> and <b>elevation</b> changes, respectively. There is also an 86  % improvement in {{the magnitude of the}} seasonal amplitudes when compared to amplitudes derived from ICESat data.

40|$|Abstract- Since 1991, {{terrestrial}} geodetic {{measurements on}} the Greenland ice sheet are performed {{in order to}} determine height change, ice flow velocity and deformation (strain) in a test field around the Swiss-Camp near equilibrium line (1150 m a. s. l.). A new test field (ST 2) in lower altitude (1000 m) was established in 2004. The stakes in the test fields are measured by static GPS and topographical survey by kinematic GPS on an area of about 2 x 2 km 2 each. Digital elevation models are derived in every epoch, so elevation changes and volume changes between different epochs could be calculated. At the Swiss-Camp the horizontal flow vector between 1991 and 2004 gives a velocity of 0, 317 m/d and azimuth of 260, 24 gon, so towards Jakobshavn Isbrae. Between 1991 and 2002 the long periodic elevation change is – 0, 22 m/a, but- 0, 85 m/a most recently between 2002 – 2004, indicating an acceleration of ice mass decreasing. All the terrestrial measurements can also be used as control areas for calibration and validation of remote sensing methods, such as ICESat (USA), CryoSat (ESA/Europe) or ERS 1 / 2 (Europe) and some laser altimetry surveys by airplanes (USA, Denmark).

40|$|Abstract The {{northern}} Antarctic Peninsula {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} changing regions on Earth. The disintegration of the Larsen-A Ice Shelf in 1995 caused tributary glaciers to adjust by speeding up, surface lowering, and overall increased ice-mass discharge. In this study, we investigate the temporal variation of these changes at the Dinsmoor–Bombardier–Edgeworth glacier system by analyzing dense time series from various spaceborne and airborne Earth observation missions. Precollapse ice shelf conditions and subsequent adjustments through 2014 were covered. Our results show a response of the glacier system some months after the breakup, reaching maximum surface velocities at the glacier front of up to 8. 8 m/d in 1999 and a subsequent decrease to ∼ 1. 5 m/d in 2014. Using a dense time series of interferometrically derived TanDEM-X digital elevation models and photogrammetric data, an exponential function was fitted for the decrease in surface <b>elevation.</b> <b>Elevation</b> changes in areas below 1000 m a. s. l. amounted to at least 130 ± 15 m between 1995 and 2014, with change rates of ∼ 3. 15 m/a between 2003 and 2008. Current change rates (2010 – 2014) are in the range of 1. 7 m/a. Mass imbalances were computed with different scenarios of boundary conditions. The most plausible results amount to − 40. 7 ± 3. 9 Gt. The contribution to sea level rise was estimated to be 18. 8 ± 1. 8 Gt, corresponding to a 0. 052 ± 0. 005 mm sea level equivalent, for the period 1995 – 2014. Our analysis and scenario considerations revealed that major uncertainties still exist due to insufficiently accurate ice-thickness information. The second largest uncertainty in the computations was the glacier surface mass balance, which is still poorly known. Our time series analysis facilitates an improved comparison with {GRACE} data and as input to modeling of glacio-isostatic uplift in this region.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 A {{case study}} was {{performed}} in 2000 and 2001 to characterize the thermal pattern of four morphologically similar eastern Oregon streams and to identify the physical and environmental factors that expressed significant and functionally viable relationships with stream temperature (daily maximum, daily minimum and daily rate of heating). Stream and environmental attributes were measured at various locations along each stream to provide a data set comprised of variables representing daily stream temperatures (minimum, maximum and rates of heating), daily air temperatures (minimum and maximum), shade, <b>elevation,</b> <b>elevation</b> change and length. Data from the 20 hottest days were analyzed using analysis of variance and regression-based path analysis. With the exception of those reaches that were influenced by groundwater or subsurface flow, downstream reaches consistently experienced increases in the daily maximum stream temperature. The most significant parameter with respect to daily maximum stream temperature appeared to be reach elevation; expressed through reach location in the watershed. Maximum air temperature also positively influenced maximum stream temperature however, only on streams that expressed significant variation in maximum air temperature. The dominant influence of groundwater on maximum stream temperature was also apparent. Significant reach level variation in daily minimum stream temperatures was not observed in this study, however most streams did record increases in the downstream direction. Daily minimum air temperature was consistent across all streams in expressing the most significant relationship with daily minimum stream temperature. With the exception of groundwater influenced reaches, all streams exhibited obvious downstream increases in the daily rate of stream heating. Daily minimum air temperature consistently exhibited a significant negative association with the rate of heating and a relationship was also implied between reach elevation, maximum stream temperature and minimum stream temperature and this stream temperature response. Groundwater and subsurface flow, when present, also appeared to influence the daily rate of stream heating.
