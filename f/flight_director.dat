5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft retired as a <b>flight</b> <b>director</b> to concentrate on management and mission planning. In 1972, he became director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (later Johnson Space Center), {{following in the footsteps of}} his mentor Robert R. Gilruth. He held the position until his 1982 retirement from NASA. During his retirement, Kraft has consulted for numerous companies including IBM and Rockwell International, and he published an autobiography entitled Flight: My Life in Mission Control.|$|E
5|$|Lunney worked backup on Gemini 3, {{taking charge}} of the newly {{established}} Mission Control Center in Houston, {{at a time when}} flights were still controlled from Cape Canaveral in Florida. On Gemini 4, he again was working backup, this time in Florida, supporting the first mission that was controlled entirely from Houston. After spending some time on unmanned testing for the Apollo program, he returned to work as a <b>flight</b> <b>director</b> on Gemini 9, 10, 11 and 12.|$|E

5|$|While at Lewis Research Center, Lunney met Marilyn Kurtz, {{who worked}} there as a nurse. They have been married since 1960 and have four children: Jennifer, Glynn, Jr. (Distinguished Professor of Law at Tulane University), Shawn, and Bryan. Their {{youngest}} son Bryan has also pursued a career at NASA, becoming a <b>flight</b> <b>director</b> in 2001 and working missions including STS-115, STS-120, STS-123, STS-131 and STS-133.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{worked through the}} {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry <b>Flight</b> <b>Director</b> Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E
5|$|Glynn Stephen Lunney (born November 27, 1936) is {{a retired}} NASA engineer. An {{employee}} of NASA since its creation in 1958, Lunney was a <b>flight</b> <b>director</b> during the Gemini and Apollo programs, and was on duty during historic {{events such as the}} Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours of the Apollo 13 crisis. At the end of the Apollo program, he became manager of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United States and the Soviet Union. Later, he served as manager of the Space Shuttle program before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming {{a vice president of the}} United Space Alliance.|$|E

5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft expected to return to his role in Mission Control. He would have been lead <b>flight</b> <b>director</b> on the first manned Apollo mission (later known as Apollo 1), which was scheduled to launch in early 1967. However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test on the pad. At the time of the fire, Kraft was in Mission Control, but under the circumstances there was little he could do. He was asked by Betty Grissom, the widow of astronaut Gus Grissom, {{to be one of the}} pallbearers at Grissom's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead <b>Flight</b> <b>Director</b> Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E
