5000|$|The {{original}} specification for ballistic nylon was an 18 ounce nylon fabric {{made from}} 1050 <b>denier</b> high tenacity nylon yarn in a 2×2 basketweave. Today {{the term is}} often used to refer to any nylon fabric that is made with a [...] "ballistic weave", typically a 2×2 or 2×3 basketweave. It can be woven from nylon yarns of various <b>denier</b> such as 840 <b>denier</b> and 1680 <b>denier.</b> <b>Denier</b> refers to the weight, not the strength, of the fabric. Laboratory tests have been run and the double weave 1050 <b>denier</b> fabric is the strongest and most durable fabric for its <b>denier</b> weight level. The 1680 <b>denier</b> is a good alternative that has a similar strength but lighter weight than the 1050 as it resists abrasion and tearing. Ballistic nylon is hard to dye, so it is often found in black or similar dark colors.|$|R
