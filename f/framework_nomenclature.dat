40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} and applied that determines the sensitivities of the probability-of-fracture {{of a gas}} turbine disk fatigue analysis {{with respect to the}} parameters of the probability distribution of the random variables. This information is useful in determining the importance of the random variable parameters and the relative ranking of the variables. The methodology is demonstrated using a probabilistic fatigue analysis of a gas turbine compressor disk using the computer program DARWIN®. Although originally intended for use with titanium alloys, DARWIN has been extended to allow analyses to be conducted on other common materials used in the production of gas turbine disks that contain high-frequency anomalies. This paper takes into account this new capability and provides a systematic technique for computing sensitivities in a zone-based probabilistic <b>framework.</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> a = defect size min a = minimum defect size in exceedance curve ma...|$|E
40|$|Linearizability {{has become}} the key {{correctness}} criterion for concurrent data structures, ensuring that histories of the concurrent object under consideration are consistent, where con-sistency is judged {{with respect to a}} sequential history of a corresponding abstract data struc-ture. Linearizability allows any order of concurrent (i. e., overlapping) calls to operations to be picked, but requires the real-time order of non-overlapping to be preserved. A history of overlapping operation calls is linearizable if {{at least one of the}} possible order of operations forms a valid sequential history (i. e., corresponds to a valid sequential execution of the data structure), and a concurrent data structure is linearizable iff every history of the data structure is linearizable. Over the years numerous techniques for verifying linearizability have been de-veloped, using a variety of formal foundations such as refinement, shape analysis, reduction, etc. However, as the underlying <b>framework,</b> <b>nomenclature</b> and terminology for each method differs, it has become difficult for practitioners to judge the differences between each approach, and hence, judge the methodology most appropriate for the data structure at hand. We com-pare the major of methods used to verify linearizability, describe the main contribution of each method, and compare their advantages and limitations. ...|$|E

Then you realize how many times you {{actually}} use your limbs and how many ways of walking you practice: normal walking, jogging, running, hopping, race walking, strolling, crutch walking after an accident, and so on. You may start wondering what the differences are between normal walking and running, and why you make a transition from one gait pattern to another in a natural way. The mentioned gait patterns all have in common that they are periodic motions in which one step is set after the other. The center of gravity goes up and down regularly and the arms are moving like a pendulum. Gait analysis deals with a scientific description of human locomotion. Mathematics and physics {{play an important role in}} it and video measurement is a frequently used research tool. We have created learning materials for students in upper pre-university education to act like human movement scientists in the classroom. They record video clips of their own ways of walking with a web cam and they use the Coach computer learning environment for measuring on these movies and analyzing the collected data. They determine gait signatures and hip-knee cyclograms of their movements, and they compare their results with those of fellow students. We interpret the authentic nature of our activities as the opportunity for students to work directly with high-quality, real-time data about human gait in much the same way movement scientists do.

The strength of spatial integration in the models that are considered is always some function of the distances and relative alignments in perceptual space of the centers of units representing orien-tational features or energy in a visual scene. We discuss the signicance of variations of the constituents of an activation function for spatial integration, and also consider the larger modeling framework in which this function is applied in each approach.

New discoveries, many thanks to systematic time-domain surveys, have underlined the role of binary star interactions in a range of astrophysical events, including some that were previously interpreted as due uniquely to single stellar evolution. Here, we review classical binary phenomena such as type Ia supernovae, and discuss new phenomena such as intermediate luminosity transients, gravitational wave-producing double black holes, or the interaction between stars and their planets. Finally, we examine the reassessment of well-known phenomena in light of interpretations that include both single and binary stars, for example supernovae of type Ib and Ic or luminous blue variables. At the same time we contextualise the new discoveries within the <b>framework</b> and <b>nomenclature</b> of the corpus of knowledge on binary stellar evolution. The last decade has heralded an era of revival in stellar astrophysics as the complexity of stellar observations is increasingly interpreted with an interplay of single and binary scenarios.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Selective {{publication}} of studies, which is commonly called publication bias, is widely recognized. Over the years a new nomenclature for {{other types of}} bias related to non-publication or distortion related to the dissemination of research findings has been developed. However, several of these different biases are often still summarized by the term 'publication bias'. METHODS/DESIGN: As part of the OPEN Project (To Overcome failure to Publish nEgative fiNdings) we will conduct a systematic review with the following objectives:- To systematically review highly cited articles that focus on non-{{publication of}} studies and to present the various definitions of biases related to the dissemination of research findings contained in the articles identified. - To develop and discuss a new <b>framework</b> on <b>nomenclature</b> of various aspects of distortion in the dissemination process that leads to public availability of research findings in an international group of experts {{in the context of}} the OPEN Project. We will systematically search Web of Knowledge for highly cited articles that provide a definition of biases related to the dissemination of research findings. A specifically designed data extraction form will be developed and pilot-tested. Working in teams of two, we will independently extract relevant information from each eligible article. For the development of a new framework we will construct an initial table listing different levels and different hazards en route to making research findings public. An international group of experts will iteratively review the table and reflect on its content until no new insights emerge and consensus has been reached. DISCUSSION: Results are expected to be publicly available in mid- 2013. This systematic review together with the results of other systematic reviews of the OPEN project will serve as a basis for the development of future policies and guidelines regarding the assessment and prevention of publication bias...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of PCR-based tools for characterisation of organisms has greatly advanced {{our understanding of}} the phylogenies and species boundaries in entomopathogenic fungi, especially the widespread taxa Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae. These fungi have received a lot of interest due to their potential as biocontrol agents of pests. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the fundamental ecology of these fungi in both managed and natural ecosystems, but such information is necessary both for risk assessments prior to release of biocontrol agents in the environment as well as if we wish to understand the distribution of the fungi and their impact on host populations. This latter focus is essential if the fungi are to be included in pest management strategies based on conservation biological control. 	A series of unspecific PCR methods have been used to characterise isolates of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae, and many studies have concluded that the fungi contain a lot of genetic diversity. The problem with these methods is that they provide little phylogenetic information of the fungi and the characters {{can not be used to}} explicitly compare data between studies. Sequences from specific targets in the DNA provide tools for explicit comparison between isolates across studies. There is now a range of primer sets published along with reference sequences in GenBank to make these comparisons possible. Multi-gene phylogenies have revealed that both B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are complexes of species that contain cryptic taxa or clades. Using merely morphological characteristics will not result in the same degree of taxa identification as will the use of DNA sequence data. Similarly, when using microsatellite markers for population genetic studies of fungal communities, it is necessary to first separate the populations in clades as allele sizes can convert across populations. In the near future, USDA-ARS in Beltsville will launch a web-based platform (MBID, Metarhizium-Beauveria ID) including lists of primers, databases of reference sequences and type isolates of new described species for the reliable identification of taxa for the scientific community. This tool should provide a common <b>framework</b> and <b>nomenclature</b> for scientists and create basis for making comparisons among studies. There should be great potential to learn more about the ecology of the entomopathogenic fungi with the application of these molecular markers. However, designing an appropriate sampling scheme in the environment is absolutely necessary to conduct these ecological studies. The use of isolates from culture collections should be avoided. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Septins are cytoskeletal GTPase {{proteins}} {{first discovered}} in the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae where they organize the septum and link nuclear division with cell division. More recently septins {{have been found in}} animals where they are important in processes ranging from actin and microtubule organization to embryonic patterning and where defects in septins have been implicated in human disease. Previous studies suggested that many animal septins fell into independent evolutionary groups, confounding cross-kingdom comparison. Results In the current work, we identified 162 septins from fungi, microsporidia and animals and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. There was support for five groups of septins with orthology between kingdoms. Group 1 (which includes S. cerevisiae Cdc 10 p and human Sept 9) and Group 2 (which includes S. cerevisiae Cdc 3 p and human Sept 7) contain sequences from fungi and animals. Group 3 (which includes S. cerevisiae Cdc 11 p) and Group 4 (which includes S. cerevisiae Cdc 12 p) contain sequences from fungi and microsporidia. Group 5 (which includes Aspergillus nidulans AspE) contains sequences from filamentous fungi. We suggest a modified nomenclature based on these phylogenetic relationships. Comparative sequence alignments revealed septin derivatives of already known G 1, G 3 and G 4 GTPase motifs, four new motifs from two to twelve amino acids long and six conserved single amino acid positions. One of these new motifs is septin-specific and several are group specific. Conclusion Our studies provide an evolutionary history for this important family of proteins and a <b>framework</b> and consistent <b>nomenclature</b> for comparison of septin orthologs across kingdoms. </p...|$|R

In this Analysis article, we propose rational taxonomic boundaries for high taxa of bacteria and archaea on the basis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence identities and suggest a rationale for the circumscription of uncultured taxa that is compatible with the taxonomy of cultured bacteria and archaea. Our analyses show that only nearly complete 16 S rRNA sequences give accurate measures of taxonomic diversity. In addition, our analyses suggest that most of the 16 S rRNA sequences of the high taxa will be discovered in environmental surveys {{by the end of the}} current decade. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers LimitedThis work has been co-funded by the Max Planck Society and the European Union (EU) project SYMBIOMICS (grant number 264774).

40|$|Concurrent {{programs}} {{are known to}} be complicated because synchronisation is required amongst the processes in order to ensure safety (nothing bad ever happens) and progress (something good eventually happens). Due to possible interference from other processes, a straightforward rearrangement of statements within a process can lead to dramatic changes in the behaviour of a program, even if the behaviour of the process executing in isolation is unaltered. Verifying concurrent programs using informal arguments are usually unconvincing, which makes formal methods a necessity. However, formal proofs can be challenging due to the complexity of concurrent programs. Furthermore, safety and progress properties are proved using fundamentally different techniques. Within the literature, safety has been given considerably more attention than progress. One method of formally verifying a concurrent program is to develop the program, then perform a post-hoc verification using one of the many available frameworks. However, this approach tends to be optimistic because the developed program seldom satisfies its requirements. When a proof becomes difficult, it can be unclear whether the proof technique or the program itself is at fault. Furthermore, following any modifications to program code, a verification may need to be repeated from the beginning. An alternative approach is to develop a program using a verify-while-develop paradigm. Here, one starts with a simple program together with the safety and progress requirements that need to be established. Each derivation step consists of a verification, followed by introduction of new program code motivated using the proofs themselves. Because a program is developed side-by-side with its proof, the completed program satisfies the original requirements. Our point of departure for this thesis is the Feijen and van Gasteren method for deriving concurrent programs, which uses the logic of Owicki and Gries. Although Feijen and van Gasteren derive several concurrent programs, because the Owicki-Gries logic does not include a logic of progress, their derivations only consider safety properties formally. Progress is considered post-hoc to the derivation using informal arguments. Furthermore, rules on how programs may be modified have not been presented, i. e., a program may be arbitrarily modified and hence unspecified behaviours may be introduced. In this thesis, we develop a framework for developing concurrent programs in the verify-while-develop paradigm. Our framework incorporates linear temporal logic, LTL, and hence both safety and progress properties may be given full consideration. We examine foundational aspects of progress by formalising minimal progress, weak fairness and strong fairness, which allow scheduler assumptions to be described. We formally define progress terms such as individual progress, individual deadlock, liveness, etc (which are properties of blocking programs) and wait-, lock-, and obstruction-freedom (which are properties of non-blocking programs). Then, we explore the inter-relationships between the various terms under the different fairness assumptions. Because LTL is known to be difficult to work with directly, we incorporate the logic of Owicki-Gries (for proving safety) and the leads-to relation from UNITY (for proving progress) within our <b>framework.</b> Following the <b>nomenclature</b> of Feijen and van Gasteren, our techniques are kept calculational, which aids derivation. We prove soundness of our framework by proving theorems that relate our techniques to the LTL definitions. Furthermore, we introduce several methods for proving progress using a well-founded relation, which keeps proofs of progress scalable. During program derivation, in order to ensure unspecified behaviour is not introduced, {{it is also important to}} verify a refinement, i. e., show that every behaviour of the final (more complex) program is a possible behaviour of the abstract representation. To facilitate this, we introduce the concept of an enforced property, which is a property that the program code does not satisfy, but is required of the final program. Enforced properties may be any LTL formula, and hence may represent both safety and progress requirements. We formalise stepwise refinement of programs with enforced properties, so that code is introduced in a manner that satisfies the enforced properties, yet refinement of the original program is guaranteed. We present derivations of several concurrent programs from the literature...|$|R
