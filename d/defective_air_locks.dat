The device was developed by Dr. Allan Bloxsom, a pediatrician at St. Joseph Hospital in Houston, Texas. At its peak, the device was utilized in more than 700 hospitals. The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> produced unfavorable results in a 1956 clinical trial. By that time physicians had also become leery of the link between high-concentration oxygen and eye disease in premature babies, and the device fell out of favor. The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> is sometimes cited as an example of technology that gained wide acceptance following inadequate evaluation.|$|R

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>lock</b> {{problems}} {{often occur}} {{when one is}} trying to recommission a system {{after it has been}} deliberately (for servicing) or accidentally emptied. For example, a central heating system using a circulating pump to pump water through radiators. When filling such a system, air is trapped in the radiators. This air has to be vented using screw valves built into the radiators. Depending on the pipe layout - if there are any upside down 'U's in the circuit - {{it will be necessary to}} vent the highest point(s). If not, <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> may stop flow through that part of the circuit completely. Note that circulating pumps usually do not generate enough pressure to overcome <b>air</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bloxsom {{developed}} the <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> device {{based on his}} assumptions {{about the role of}} uterine contractions in establishing effective breathing at birth. The <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> was a sealed steel cylinder that delivered warmed and humidified 60% oxygen to newly born babies. The device has been compared to an iron lung, but it did not utilize negative pressure. The pressure inside the chamber alternated between 0.07 and 0.2 atmospheres above sea level. Rather than alternating the pressures at the rate of normal respirations as other devices did, the Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> cycled the pressure once per minute to mimic the rate of uterine contractions in late labor. Babies in distress were placed in the chamber immediately after delivery.|$|R

5000|$|The {{higher the}} {{volatility}} of the fuel, {{the more likely it}} is that vapor lock will occur. Historically, gasoline was a more volatile distillate than it is now and was more prone to vapor lock. Conversely, diesel fuel is far less volatile than gasoline, so that diesel engines almost never suffer from vapor lock. However, diesel engine fuel systems are far more susceptible to <b>air</b> <b>locks</b> in their fuel lines, because standard diesel fuel injection pumps rely on the fuel being non-compressible. <b>Air</b> <b>locks</b> are caused by air leaking into the fuel delivery line or entering from the tank. <b>Air</b> <b>locks</b> are eliminated by turning the engine over for a time using the starter motor, or by bleeding the fuel system.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Injection {{is one of}} {{most painful}} and common medical {{interventions}} that more than 12 billion of it are administered annually throughout the world. Pain remains {{as one of the}} unresolved health problems. The objective of this research was to investigate the pain severity utilizing the z-track <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> technique during intra muscular injection procedure. Method:This study was conducted as an unblinded cinical trial, where 90 female subjects aged between 18 - 25 years old were randomly assigned to three groups of 30. Each group received z-track <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> (Group ZTAL), <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> (AL), and z-track (Group ZT) techniques. Neurobion 5000 vitamin used as an injection substance. A Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) on 0 – 3 was used to evaluate the severity of pain during procedure. Data were analized using the SPSS version 19. Groups’ age, Body Mass Index (BMI) and pain severity were analyzed through descriptive and One Way ANOVA statistics. Results: Results showed that there were no signifi cant differences of pain severity both within and between groups (p > 0. 05). Discussion: Both Z-track and <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> method are less pain compared to traditional method according to previous studies. Noncicepti stimulus inhibited nocicepti stimulus in z-track technique while locking effect inhibit leakeage of substance injection to subcutaneous layer of skin which contain of nerve fi bers.

[...] In 1950, St. Joseph pediatrician and Baylor professor Allan Penny Bloxsom introduced the Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> device for the delivery room resuscitation and oxygenation of distressed newborns. Bloxsom recognized that infants born by C-section more often required resuscitation. He theorized that uterine contractions (absent in many babies born by C-section) helped to prepare a fetus for the task of breathing. His tube-like device created fluctuations in air pressure that simulated contractions of the uterus. The Bloxsom <b>air</b> <b>lock</b> device was utilized by over 700 hospitals by late 1952.

40|$|Low-head bubbler {{irrigation}} systems are particularly well-suited for the irrigation of orchard crops, and these systems differ from other micor{{irrigation systems}} {{because they are}} based on gravity-flow, can operate at pressures as low as 1 meter (3. 3 ft), and do not require elaborate filtration systems. A design procedure for low-head bubbler systems is described in detail, and example designs for bubbler systems located on level ground and gradual slopes are also presented. The design procedure utilizes head loss gradient charts based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation to size the pipe diameters, and the delivery hose elevations are calculated by using a personal computer with spreadsheet software. The causes of <b>air</b> <b>locks</b> in the laterals and delivery hoses are also investigated, and minimum design flow rates for various pipe diameters are recommended to ensure flow velocities are high enough to prevent <b>air</b> <b>locks</b> from occurring within the delivery hoses...|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that the Blasius equation yields accurate estimates of head loss in small diameter plastic tubing and larger diameter PVC pipe for Reynolds numbers upto 100, 000.

The additional head needed to release the trapped air was found to be equal to the sum of heights of all the undulations. If the sum of their heights exceeds the design head loss in the delivery hose, <b>air</b> <b>locking</b> will result. The capital investment for bubbler system under study was comparable to that of a pressurized drip system. Long term savings in terms of energy and maintenance make low head bubbler systems an attractive alternative to pressurized drip systems for irrigating orchards or vineyards...|$|R
