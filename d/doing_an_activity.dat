50|$|Key {{studies that}} led to {{emergence}} of SDT included research on intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity {{for its own sake}} because it is interesting and satisfying in itself, as opposed to <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> to obtain an external goal (extrinsic motivation). Different types of motivations have been described based on the degree they have been internalized. Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioural regulations that were originally external.|$|E

Learning through play has been seen regularly in practice as the most versatile way a child can learn. Margaret McMillan (1860-1931) suggested that children should be given free school meals, fruit and milk, and plenty of exercise to keep them physically and emotionally healthy. Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) believed that play time allows children to talk, socially interact, use their imagination and intellectual skills.

The remaining three celebrities would form the panel which would attempt to guess the activity. Each round, one activity would be introduced to the audience with part of the film or live remote, which would be shown behind the panel (they could only see it if they turned around). The activity was silently displayed (usually via written cards they would hold up in the film or remote) for the audience.|$|E
50|$|Pricing {{a product}} {{based on the}} value the product has for the {{customer}} and not on its costs of production or any other factor.This pricing strategy is frequently used where the value to the customer is many times the cost of producing the item or service. For instance, the cost of producing a software CD {{is about the same}} independent of the software on it, but the prices vary with the perceived value the customers are expected to have. The perceived value will depend on the alternatives open to the customer. In business these alternatives are using competitors software, using a manual work around, or not <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity.</b> In order to employ value-based pricing, a one must know its customers' business, one's business costs, and one's perceived alternatives. It is also known as perceived-value pricing.|$|E

These rewards and benefits will stay constant for the Sim provided the hobby enthusiasm is kept high enough to warrant them. The highest reward is to be in 'The Zone' (as described above).|$|E
50|$|In {{the visual}} novel {{examples}} of the genre, the player proceeds in the story by selecting dialogue or action choices which affect their relationships in a decision tree format. In simulation otome games, there is also other gameplay which affects the plot, either by playing minigames or by raising stats. The main character often has several parameters, such as looks, style, intelligence, talent, etc., that can be raised through various activities in normal gameplay. The potential partners usually require a certain parameter or parameters {{to be at a}} certain level for them {{to fall in love with}} you. There is also often a pure dating aspect of gameplay in simulations. This involves asking or being asked on dates by the love interest, <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> with them, and responding to their questions or comments. The player has a choice of responses, and a correct answer will raise your standing with that character.|$|E
50|$|The goal of {{life cycle}} {{thinking}} {{is to make}} people and companies more aware of how their actions impact the environment in a holistic sense rather than a one time pollution that comes {{as a direct result}} of using a product or <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> at one specific time. Although it is nearly impossible to undergo consumption of anything with no environmental impact, life cycle thinking can help people make better alternative decisions to mitigate their environmental impact. One of the goals of life cycle thinking is to avoid burden shifting. This is to make sure that reducing the environmental impact at one stage in the life cycle does not increase the impact at other places in the cycle. For example, plug in electric cars reduce the amount of gasoline burned but they increase the amount of electricity used which is usually generated by other polluting energy sources such as coal. Life cycle thinking can also demonstrate the benefits to technological innovation. For example, movies can now be downloaded through television service providers and gaming devices which eliminates the need to drive to a DVD rental location. By identifying pollution costs, companies can innovate to mitigate their expenses while consumers can make better alternative choices to mitigate their impact.|$|E

50|$|With the {{development}} of new and improved technology with physical education, and especially adapted physical education, {{it is important for the}} APE teacher to know and understand different ways to implement technology for increased success for their students. APE teachers can develop an updated website regarding a fitness workout plan, in which students can download and follow at home with a sibling or parent. Students can be taught how to keep track of their physical fitness goals and record the data on a spreadsheet. Video files can also be used to demonstrate proper technique. Teachers can easily create videos of students <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> and download them onto an iPod or computer so students have an easily accessible reference to use during transition periods or after they graduate. Video files or iMovies can be utilized as report cards or as evidence of IEP goal attainment. In APE pedometers can easily be introduced into any lesson and taught how to use and how to keep track of steps. Teachers can also play appropriate and motivating music for aerobic activities. Video games are also starting to become more and more predominant in physical education classes, such games can be used outside of school as well. Some games are particularly accessible for individuals with disabilities including Wii and Eye Toy Play. New applications (Apps) are constantly being created to assist people with disabilities in numerous ways. With technology growing, APE teachers need to continue to develop as professionals in providing new ways to enhance their students physical development.|$|E
40|$|What makes people’s {{interest}} in <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> increase or decrease? Regulatory fit theory (E. T. Higgins, 2000) provides {{a new perspective}} on this classic issue by emphasizing the relation between people’s activity orientation, such as thinking of an activity as fun, and the manner of activity engagement that the surrounding situation supports. These situational factors include whether a reward for good performance, expected (Study 1) or unexpected (Study 2), is experienced as enjoyable or as serious and whether the free-choice period that measures {{interest in}} the activity is experienced as enjoyable or as serious (Study 3). Studies 1 – 3 found that participants were more likely to do a fun activity again when these situational factors supported a manner of doing the activity that fit the fun orientation—a reward or free-choice period framed as enjoyable. This effect was not because interest in <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> again is simply greater in an enjoyable than a serious surrounding situation because it did not occur, and even reversed, when the activity orientation was important rather than fun, where now a serious manner of engagement provides the fit (Study 4 a and 4 b) ...|$|E

40|$|Social {{participation}} {{is a key}} determinant of successful and healthy aging and therefore an important emerging intervention goal for health professionals. Despite the interest shown {{in the concept of}} social participation over the last decade, there is no agreement on its definition and underlying dimensions. This paper provides an inventory and content analysis of definitions of social participation in older adults. Based on these results, a taxonomy of social activities is proposed. Four databases (Medline, CINAHL, AgeLine and PsycInfo) were searched with relevant keywords (Aging OR Ageing OR Elderly OR Older OR Seniors AND Community involvement/participation OR Social engagement/involvement/participation) resulting in the identification of 43 definitions. Using content analysis, definitions were deconstructed as a function of who, how, what, where, with whom, when, and why dimensions. Then, using activity analysis, we explored the typical contexts, demands and potential meanings of activities (main dimension). Content analysis showed that social participation definitions (n =  43) mostly focused on the person's involvement in activities providing interactions with others in society or the community. Depending on the main goal of these social activities, six proximal to distal levels of involvement of the individual with others were identified: 1) <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> in preparation for connecting with others, 2) being with others, 3) interacting with others without doing a specific activity with them, 4) <b>doing</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> with others, 5) helping others, and 6) contributing to society. These levels are discussed in a continuum that can help distinguish social participation (levels 3 through 6) from parallel but different concepts such as participation (levels 1 through 6) and social engagement (levels 5 and 6). This taxonomy might be useful in pinpointing the focus of future investigations and clarifying dimensions specific to social participation.
