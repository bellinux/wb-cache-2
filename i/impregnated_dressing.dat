40|$|Many {{alternative}} therapies {{are used as}} first aid treatment for burns, despite limited evidence supporting their use. In this study, Aloe vera, saliva and a tea tree oil <b>impregnated</b> <b>dressing</b> (Burnaid) were applied as first aid to a porcine deep dermal contact burn, compared to a control of nothing. After burn creation, the treatments were applied for 20 min and the wounds observed at weekly dressing changes for 6 weeks. Results showed that the alternative treatments did significantly decrease subdermal temperature within the skin during the treatment period. However, they did not decrease the microflora or improve re-epithelialisation, scar strength, scar depth or cosmetic appearance of the scar and cannot be recommended for the first aid treatment of partial thickness burns.

40|$|Objective : Assessing the {{efficacy}} of a polyhydrated ionogen <b>impregnated</b> <b>dressing</b> {{in the treatment of}} recalcitrant diabetic foot ulcers. Summary Background Data : Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) continue to present. a formidable challenge in terms of morbidity and health care costs. Increasing evidence ascertains the important role of Matrix MetalloProteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors, TIMPs, in wound healing. Imbalance of MMPs in the DFU microenvironment has been associated with poor wound healing. Current research is directed towards therapeutic agents that could redress the imbalance of MMPs/TIMPs. Poly Hydrated Ionogen (PHI) formulation is based on metallic ions and citric acid. PHI application aims to positively restore MMP ratios within chronic wounds. This initial multi-centre pilot study aimed to investigate {{the efficacy}} of the PHI formulation in achieving stable wound closure in recalcitrant DFUs. Material and methods : Twenty patients with therapy resistant DFUs of at least 1 cm(2) and 3 months duration were treated with PHI formulation in an acetate carrier dressing. Wound debridement, digital imaging and wound perimeter tracing was performed weekly. Off-loading was performed by the use of appropriate shoe-wear (cut-out sandals) and crutches. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. A detailed evaluation sheet was kept for every patient and updated at each visit. Results : Stable wound closure with high patient satisfaction was achieved in 16 (80 %) DFUs. The mean time to full closure was 18 weeks. A stable wound epithelization was seen in all full closure patients up to latest follow-up of one year. Conclusions : Encouraging results of this pilot study prompt us to further investigate the PHI efficacy in DFU treatment in a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{demonstrate}} the effectiveness of a novel hydrogel <b>impregnated</b> gauze <b>dressing</b> in creating the ideal microcosm around a bioengineered alternative tissue to prevent tissue dehydration and cell death, accelerate angiogenesis, prevent infection and facilitate the interaction of growth factors with the target cells.

30|$|Pin-track {{infection}} (PTI) is {{a common}} complication of external fixation. Antimicrobial dressings of the pin-site interface should reduce the severity and incidence of PTI. This study is aimed at determining the efficacy of 1  % silver sulphadiazine dressings in preventing PTI in external fixation. We compared the incidence of PTI between group A (dry sterile gauze dressing) and group B (1  % silver sulphadiazine <b>impregnated</b> gauze <b>dressing).</b> PTI was diagnosed when there was: (1) redness around any pin-site, (2) tenderness near a pin-site and (3) serous or purulent discharge from the pin-skin interface. With infection, swab was obtained for microscopy, culture and sensitivity. Pin-track infections were diagnosed in 22.5 and 4.1  % of patients in groups A and B, respectively. This difference was statistically significant. The commonest organism isolated from swabs was Staphyloccus aureus. In patients with external fixation, 1  % silver sulphadiazine lowered PTI. This further underlines the need for antimicrobial dressings of pin-sites. We recommend the use of 1  % silver sulphadiazine impregnated ribbon gauze for pin-site dressings.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{choice of}} the theme risk related to central venous {{catheter}} (CVC) infection in highly complex client {{was based on the}} facts of the nurse be responsible for carrying out the sterile dressing and that the dressing is an effective means of protecting the colonization of the insertion site by bacteria and an important tool for the reduction of the bloodstream infection. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the literature to guide the nurse about the best dressing for the CVC. Method: Literature review conducted through electronic search in databases and virtual libraries, understood in the period 2009 to 2014. We selected 10 articles, 6 and 4 foreign national, as the sample to be analyzed. The results were analyzed in relation to studies that fitted the theme of evidence-based practice. Results: The dressing with gauze and tape has greater absorption of exudate, presents possibility of developing local reaction in the contact areas of the tape with skin and your exchange must be made {{less than or equal to}} 48 hours; the transparent film should be changed every 7 days, has good acceptance for being impervious to personal hygiene, offers better visualization of the ostium and is impractical for patients with profuse sweating; the use of chlorhexidine <b>impregnated</b> <b>dressing</b> is associated with cases of hypersensitivity, skin maceration and hyperemia, presents conflicting results regarding prevention of infection associated with CVC. Conclusion: The literature review on the subject revealed inconsistency studies about the best type of dressing to prevent the risk of infection related to CVC in critically ill patients. However, the available studies guide the intensive care nurses, who are responsible for evaluating the ostium of the puncture, choose the best dressing for specificity / individuality of each patient...|$|E

40|$|In {{a time of}} {{outburst}} of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the search for alternatives is essential. Bacteriophages are starting to re-emerge as a viable therapeutic option to treat acute infections where antibiotics are not effective any longer. However, it is key to incorporate bacteriophages into suitable formulations {{if they are to}} be applied, for example, topically. Emulsions, and specifically nano-emulsions are well-established vehicles for drug delivery in healthcare applications. This work focuses on the stabilisation of bacteriophages using oil-in-water nano-emulsions in order to develop the basis of a commercial cream or <b>impregnated</b> wound <b>dressing</b> for the treatment of burn wound infections. It was found that nano-emulsions have a dramatic effect on bacterial growth, and such influence was qualitatively determined using a Response Surface Method for design of experiments, followed by a quantitative analysis that allowed for the formulation of a modification of the logistic model of growth. Most importantly, it was discovered that nano-emulsions enhance bacteriophage infectivity both against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections in planktonic culture when compared to simple phage suspensions in buffer. The mechanisms why this enhanced infectivity occurs were investigated, and it was concluded that nano-droplets shield bacteriophages against environmental inactivation and they diminish the possible electrostatic repulsion between bacteriophages and bacteria, since they are both negatively charged. Bacteriophage/nano-emulsion formulations were then applied for the eradication of biofilms, which constitute the most common form of existence of bacteria in wounds. A flow system that mimics the continuous but slow supply of nutrients in a wound was used for this purpose. The infectivity of the developed formulations against such biofilms was found to be significant as well, proving the efficacy of stabilised bacteriophages in nano-emulsions. Finally, mathematical modelling approaches were successfully utilised to determine infection parameters and develop a predictive tool for mixed infections treated with bacteriophage ‘’cocktails’’...|$|R
30|$|All {{patients}} were treated by 15 fellowship-trained, pediatric orthopedic surgeons at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. General indications for surgical treatment were patients aged 12 {{or more years}} with Neer–Horowitz grade four fractures or angulation of 40 ° or more; however, the treating attending surgeon made the ultimate determination for surgical intervention. Patients {{were taken to the}} operating room for attempted CR and fixation with either PP (buried or exposed) or IMN. If CR could not be obtained, OR using a deltopectoral approach was performed to facilitate reduction prior to internal fixation. All patients received preoperative antibiotics between 30 and 60  min prior to procedure and a total of 24  h of antibiotics was administered for those patients who underwent open reduction and fixation. For PP fixation, 2 or 3 pins were placed [average 2.4 pins (5 / 64 or 3 / 32 inch diameter)]. Pins were placed through the lateral metaphysis of the distal fracture fragment and passed superomedially across the fracture site into the humeral head fragment. Pins were started inferiorly and only after careful blunt spreading of the subcutaneous tissues so as to avoid iatrogenic injury to the axillary nerve. In rare situations, a third pin was started in the greater tuberosity and passed inferomedially across the fracture site and into the medial humeral cortex of the distal fragment. Pins were cut beneath the skin in 35  % (17 / 49) of cases. The decision to bury pins or leave them through the skin was based on surgeon preference. IMN fixation was employed with 1 or 2 titanium flexible nails (Synthes, West Chester, PA), through a distal lateral entry site. Nails were introduced by making a small incision and spreading bluntly down to bone, where a drill was used to make an entry portal into the intramedullary canal superior to the olecranon fossa. The nails were then driven retrograde until they entered the proximal fragment. If necessary, rotation of the nail was used to optimize reduction. IMN implants were then trimmed and buried under the skin in all cases. In all cases, wounds were <b>dressed</b> with antibiotic <b>impregnated</b> gauze, dry <b>dressing,</b> and sterile silk tape, which remained in place until the first postoperative visit. In general, a sling and swathe was used for postoperative immobilization.|$|R
