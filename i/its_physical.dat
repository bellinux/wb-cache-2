5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding <b>its</b> <b>physical</b> structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
5|$|Each console has {{a variety}} of games. Most games {{released}} on the original PlayStation are backwards compatible and can be played directly on its successors, the PlayStation 2, PSX and PlayStation 3. Some of these games can also be played on the PlayStation Portable but they must be purchased and downloaded from a list of PS one Classics from the PlayStation Store. Games released on the PlayStation 2 can currently only be played on the original console as well as the PSX and the early models of the PlayStation 3 which are backwards compatible. The PlayStation 3 has two types of games, those released on Blu-ray Discs and downloadable games from the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Portable consists of numerous games available on both <b>its</b> <b>physical</b> media, the Universal Media Disc and the Digital Download from the PlayStation Store.

5|$|Following {{the rise}} of {{classical}} genetics, many biologists—including {{a new wave of}} physical scientists in biology—pursued the question of the gene and <b>its</b> <b>physical</b> nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundation—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E

This causes problems for the Enterprise, which is transporting dangerous plague strains. The child's presence on the ship begins to endanger the crew due to effects on a virus sample being transported by the ship.

5|$|Silver {{is similar}} in <b>its</b> <b>physical</b> and {{chemical}} properties to its two vertical neighbours in group 11 of the periodic table, copper and gold. Its 47 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4d105s1, similarly to copper (3d104s1) and gold (4f145d106s1); group 11 {{is one of the}} few groups in the d-block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations. This distinctive electron configuration, with a single electron in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell, accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver.|$|E

5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20.

It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E

5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of <b>its</b> <b>physical</b> properties have been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s the Auxois reached {{the peak of}} <b>its</b> <b>physical</b> development. It was described, like the Ardennais and the Trait du Nord, as a born plowhorse, with a neck {{naturally}} held so low that the nose almost touched the ground. It was developed entirely for traction, and its conformation allowed it to move huge weights over short distances. At the same time, it became more popular than the Nivernais, and was considered a southern representation of the Ardennais breed. Merchants visiting Burgandy horse fairs appreciated the breed, and deemed its bay coloration better able to hide dirt {{than that of the}} light gray Percheron or black Nivernais. The peak populations and usage of the Auxois and other French draft horses was short due to the advent of mechanization in the 1960s.|$|E
