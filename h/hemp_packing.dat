50|$|The split {{piston ring}} {{was invented by}} John Ramsbottom who {{reported}} the benefits to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1854. It soon replaced the <b>hemp</b> <b>packing</b> hitherto used in steam engines. The use of piston rings at once dramatically reduced the frictional resistance, the leakage of steam, and {{the mass of the}} piston, leading to significant increases in power and efficiency and longer maintenance intervals.|$|E
50|$|Bramah had {{designed}} a hydraulic press, but was having problems sealing both the piston and the piston rod where it fitted into the cylinder. The usual method was <b>hemp</b> <b>packing</b> but the pressures {{were too high}} for this to work. Maudslay {{came up with the}} idea of a leather cup washer, which gave a perfect seal but offered no resistance to movement when the pressure was released. The new hydraulic press worked perfectly thereafter. But Maudslay, who had made a major contribution to its success, received little credit for it.|$|E
50|$|Magoksa Temple (Korean: 마곡사, Chinese: 麻谷寺, Pronounced “Ma-gok-sa”) was {{established}} in 640 by Vinaya Master Jajang Yulsa, who also built Tongdosa Temple upon his return from China. Silla’s Queen Seondeok then gave him 200 gyeol (an ancient measurement of land estimated at about 6,800 square meters) of land on which he built a brick pagoda and Magoksa Temple. The name “Magoksa” (literally “Hemp Valley Temple”) originated with Ven. Bocheol Hwasang, a monk who lived there later, because the way many people gathered {{to listen to his}} Dharma talks reminded him of <b>hemp</b> stalks closely <b>packed</b> together.|$|R
