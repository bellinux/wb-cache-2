Long, who completed his clinical psychology training at Sydney University, added impetus to what Wong had earlier embarked upon.

In May, psychological assessment was extended to the selection of renal patients <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> at the Renal Unit in the Singapore General Hospital. In July 1968, Dr Ho Eng Siong (designated child psychiatrist) and Long commenced weekly child guidance clinic for cases from Gimson Boys' School and welfare homes.

40|$|During {{the past}} 10 years {{the type of}} {{vascular}} access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> procedures have changed markedly in our centre: more elbow AV fistulae and more central venous catheters are now used.

Methods: Forty-four haemodialysis and 11 CAPD centres were enrolled in this study in 2001. Sixty patients, 30 from each modality, were evaluated. Micro-costing {{was used to determine}} costs. Results: The number of haemodialyses conducted ranged from 402 to 23 000 procedures per year, while for CAPD, output ranged from 70 to 2300 patient months/year. Cost ranged from RM 79. 61 to RM 475. 79 per haemodialysis treatment, with a mean cost of RM 169 per HD (USD 1 = RM 3. 80). The cost of CAPD treatment ranged from RM 1400 to RM 3200 per patient month, with a mean of RM 2186. Both modalities incurred similar outpatient costs.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesDialysis-dependent {{patients}} {{often have}} central venous drainage complications. In patients with functioning arm arteriovenous fistula, this {{may result in}} venous hypertension, arm oedema and vascular access failure. Percutaneous angioplasty and stent implantation might be inadequate to resolve these issues. In these cases, new access can potentially be created with anastomosis to the subclavian vein, iliac vein or vena cava or by making a veno-venous graft to bypass the thrombosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the utility of unusual bypasses in vascular access in patients with the central vein thrombosis. MaterialsA total of 49 patients were treated. The mean number of previous vascular access surgery procedures was 7. 6 (3 – 17).

40|$|Background Autologous {{arteriovenous}} fistulae (AVF) are {{the optimal}} form of vascular access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> AVFs typically require 6 to 8  weeks to “mature” {{from the time}} of surgery before they can be cannulated. Patients with end-stage renal disease needing urgent vascular access therefore traditionally require insertion of a tunnelled central venous catheter (TCVC). TCVCs are associated with high infection rates and central venous stenosis. Early cannulation synthetic arteriovenous grafts (ecAVG) provide a novel alternative to TCVCs, permitting rapid access to the bloodstream and immediate needling <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> Published rates of infection in small series are low. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare whether TCVC[*]±[*]AVF or ecAVG[*]±[*]AVF provide a better strategy for managing patients requiring immediate vascular access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> Methods/design This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the strategy of TCVC[*]±[*]AVF to ecAVG[*]±[*]AVF. Patients requiring urgent vascular access will receive a study information sheet and written consent will be obtained. Patients will be randomised to receive either: (i) TCVC (and native AVF if this is anatomically possible) or (ii) ecAVG (± AVF). 118 patients will be recruited. The primary outcome is systemic bacteraemia at 6  months. Secondary outcomes include culture-proven bacteraemia rates at 1  year and 2  years; primary and secondary patency rates at 3, 6, 12 and 24  months; stenoses; re-intervention rates; re-admission rate; mortality and quality of life. Additionally, treatment delays, impact on service provision and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated. Discussion This is the first randomised controlled trial comparing TCVC to ecAVG for patients requiring urgent vascular access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis.</b> The complications of TCVC are considered an unfortunate necessity in patients requiring urgent haemodialysis who do not have autologous vascular access. If this study demonstrates that ecAVGs provide a safe and practical alternative to TCVC, this could instigate a paradigm shift in nephrology thinking and access planning. </p...|$|E

30|$|The AV fistula is {{considered}} the best long-term vascular access <b>for</b> <b>haemodialysis</b> because it provides adequate blood flow, is long-lasting and has a lower complication rate than other types of access.

AV fistulas also present some disvantages, including the incomplete maturation of the vein, and a 1 – 4 -month period may be required before the AV fistula can be used.
