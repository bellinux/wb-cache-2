500|$|At the 2009 NHL General Managers' Meeting, it was {{discussed}} whether the rule should be eliminated {{as a solution}} to the increasing number of injuries on defenseman who were being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, [...] "If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful." [...] He also expressed his concern for defencemen, [...] "It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to sit and watch all the time... You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find something because so many guys are getting hurt." [...] At the time of his statement, Devils defencemen Paul Martin, Johnny Oduya and Bryce Salvador were all out with injuries.|$|E
500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record they have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E
500|$|During 2007 spring practice, Scott {{was third}} on the depth chart, but {{suffered}} a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just {{a different type of}} animal." [...] Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, [...] "I think I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us." [...] The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68yards against Virginia, three for 56yards against Clemson, and two for 40yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended to be in it. Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. I looked up, and it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked [...] Zacharias about it Sunday and he started laughing. I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'" ...|$|E

After a rocky May Chicago demoted Glover to the Triple-A Charlotte Knights, but he returned to the team in mid-June after posting a 1.88 ERA in six starts. On July 27 Glover made his first career major league start in place of the just-traded James Baldwin; like his debut and first win, it came against the Cleveland Indians.
