40|$|AbstractA {{three-dimensional}} model {{is used to}} study the influence of facies heterogeneity on energy production under different operational conditions of low-enthalpy <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> <b>systems.</b> Process-based facies modelling is utilised for the Nieuwerkerk sedimentary formation in the West Netherlands Basin to construct realistic reservoir models honouring geological heterogeneity. A finite element based reservoir simulator is used to model the fluid flow and heat transfer over time. A series of simulations is carried out {{to examine the effects}} of reservoir heterogeneity (Net-to-Gross ratio, N/G) on the life time and the energy recovery rate for different discharge rates and the production temperature (Tmin) above which the doublet is working. With respect to the results, we propose a design model to estimate the life time and energy recovery rate of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet.</b> The life time is estimated as a function of N/G, Tmin and discharge rate, while the design model for the energy recovery rate is only a function of N/G and Tmin. Both life time and recovery show a positive relation with an increasing N/G. Further our results suggest that neglecting details of process-based facies modelling may lead to significant errors in predicting the life time of low-enthalpy geothermal systems for N/G values below 70 %...|$|R

The amount of heat would be sufficient to provide our national heat demand for decades without any greenhouse gas emissions. Exploitation {{of this type of}} resource started some 10 years ago in the Netherlands. In 2016, 16 <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> <b>systems</b> had been installed that produce geothermal heat, and each year 2 to 3 new systems are realised. A <b>doublet</b> <b>system</b> consists of a production well that extracts hot formation water from kilometer deep aquifers. After the heat is extracted from the water in heat exchangers, the cooled water is reinjected into the same aquifer at approximately 1 to 1. 5 km distance from the production well. Most of the current Dutch <b>doublet</b> <b>systems</b> provide heat for the horticulture sector. These systems have an average net energy production of approximately 10 MWth and therefore hundreds of additional systems are required to significant amounts of our heat consumption with geothermal energy. This PhD thesis investigated <b>doublet</b> <b>system</b> design and deployment strategies to optimise exploitation and increase the possible number of <b>doublet</b> <b>systems</b> exploiting the same aquifer. Based on detailed geological models, subsurface flow simulations are used to evaluate parameters such as required injector-producer distance, the preferred orientation of a well pair with respect to geological trends and required doublet distance to avoid negative interference.

40|$|Budapest {{is famous}} for its thermal springs and spas and {{outstanding}} thermal water resources. In the 21 st century renewable energy utilization — including the use of geothermal energy — became the focus of interest. Improving the use of the different forms of geothermal energy requires the assessment of their possibilities. The potential for deep <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> <b>systems</b> for direct heating in Budapest was evaluated based on the temperature conditions, the depth and reconnaissance of the carbonate reservoir. NW Buda is not appropriate for thermal water exploration. SW and SE Budapest have better temperature conditions but the lithology of the reservoir is uncertain. Beneath Pest the thermal water is well exploitable. It is obvious from the map of the region that the area is promising; however, due to the hydraulic continuity of the system, reinjection is desirable. Considering the reliability of the employed data the geothermal potential map is suitable only for general orientation and guidance. The geothermal potential map for Groundwater-sourced Heat Pump Systems (GHPS; scale = 1 : 40, 000) was assembled by evaluating the thickness and appearance of the gravel strata and water table, complemented by the sulfate content as an aggressive component of groundwater. The original geothermal potential map series can be used for the evaluation of potential sites in Budapest. It can be concluded that the Buda side of the Danube River is almost entirely unsuitable for shallow groundwater-based heat pump installations. The only areas under consideration are Óbuda and the riverbanks. On the Pest side, there is no gravel in the central part; the largest areas close to the river and in the immediate surroundings are uncertain, with patches of suitable and possible categories. The southern and eastern area of Pest is the most prospective for GHPS installation. The potential maps only consider natural parameters; however, installation may be strongly influenced by the urbanization and the city environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Fractures {{occur at}} varying scales and orientations in the subsurface. The role of {{fractures}} as conduits for fluid flow in a reservoir must be well constrained {{for planning and}} development of a geothermal system. This study examines the uncertainty associated with fractures in a rock matrix using a discrete fracture network modelling approach; fractures are considered as discrete elements embedded in a rock matrix. Many fractures are below the resolution of geophysical investigation methods and are therefore typically described by a statistical distribution of permeability, length and orientation. A Monte Carlo approach is used whereby multiple reservoir simulations are conducted using fracture network parameters drawn randomly from a pre-defined distribution. The simulation results show that fracture permeability is the major factor which influences the production. An increase in fracture network permeability from 8 : 33 x 10 -^ 12 m 2 to 8 : 33 x 10 -^ 10 m 2 showed an increase of uncertainty in reservoir production by up to a factor of six when considering the standard deviation. The results show that this uncertainty increases by up to 200 % with {{the life of the}} reservoir for the high permeability case. Stochastic analysis of the azimuth uncertainty revealed an opposite trend where a decrease in uncertainty of 34 % was observed over the 30 year simulated lifetime of the reservoir. The orientation of fractures in the reservoir was found {{to play an important role}} in the temperature field in the reservoir with increases in production temperature ranging from 0 : 5 K to 3 K resulting from the proximity of fractures to the production well. The results also indicate that discrete fracture networks which possess similar orientations of fractures produce statistically similar production profiles. The findings of this study show that a stochastic approach can be used for efficient planning of <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> <b>systems</b> based on expected trends in production.

40|$|Required {{distance}} between <b>doublet</b> <b>systems</b> in low enthalpy geothermal heat exploitation {{is often not}} fully elucidated. The required distance aims to prevent negative interference influencing the utilisation efficiency of <b>doublet</b> <b>systems.</b> Currently production licence areas are often issued based on the expected extent of the reinjected cold water plume on the moment of thermal breakthrough. The production temperature, however, may not immediately drop to non-economic values after this moment. Consequently, heat production could continue increasing {{the extent of the}} cold water plume. Furthermore, the area influenced by pressure because of injection and production spreads beyond the cold water plume extent, influencing not only the productivity of adjacent <b>doublet</b> <b>systems</b> but also the shape of cold water plumes. This affects doublet life time, especially if adjacent doublets have different production rates. In this modelling based study a multi parameter analysis is carried out to derive dimensionless relations between basic doublet design parameters and required doublet distance.

The large amount of data gathered for the hydrocarbon industry shows good potential {{in the north of}} the Netherlands often in the same areas in which hydrocarbon production occurs.

40|$|International audienceWell {{and surface}} {{equipments}} (exchangers, filters) clogging {{is a major}} issue that affects many <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets</b> in shallow aquifers (open-loop groundwater heat pump). In the case of wells, injection wells in particular, clogging of screens, porosity of gravel pack filters, and more widely the pores of the aquifer lead to severe losses in hydraulic performance in a long run. These clogging processes involve complex interactions between abiotic chemical processes (precipitation of carbonate minerals; iron and manganese oxides), physical processes (mobilisation and precipitation of particles) and biological processes (mineral precipitation linked to bacterial metabolism or biofouling). Each of these processes is well known and documented individually. However, prediction of clogging phenomena using a global approach that could integrate parameters related to operating conditions (temperature, pressure, flow rate [...] .) as well as water chemical, physical, and biological characteristics is a scientific challenge. Except for carbonates species, the small temperature variation (< 15 °C) induced by <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> operation {{seems to have a}} limited effect on the concentration of the major chemical components of groundwater but does impact redox equilibria. The main impact on hydrochemical characteristics and equilibrium states of the groundwater induced by <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets</b> operating at injection temperatures below 30 °C is related to mixing of waters with different chemical facies (Bonte et al, 2013; Possemiers et al, 2016). From a biological point of view, the microbial communities responsible for clogging are highly sensitive to temperature variations, redox variations, and operating conditions (Vetter et al, 2012). Redox equilibria and their influence on biochemical reactivity are very sensitive to very small changes in physico-chemical parameters. Such variations might occur on surface or in-depth installations due to the impact of pumping and/or injection. The impact of mixing of waters with different chemical compositions on biochemical reactions in a context of heterogeneous geological environments is a research question debated over recent years. We present the initial results of a research project carried out jointly by Antea Group and the Geosciences Rennes laboratory, launched in April 2015 aiming at studying the origin of clogging problems and analyzing the effects of preventive and curative treatments. In this framework, field investigations of <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets</b> are performed to evaluate and identify the possible origins of clogging phenomena. For selected doublets, a real-time monitoring of operating conditions and water physico-chemical characteristics is performed. In addition, chemical and bacteriological analyzes are carried out on deposits and water samples. The first challenge is linked to the selection of the most relevant geochemical and hydrogeological tools to characterise clogging of <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets</b> under operation. The second issue is related to the characterisation and simulation of biogeochemical reactions induced by the operation of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet.</b> In this context, the evaluation of reaction mechanisms and controlling parameters is critical to assess the clogging risk of an installation and to select the appropriate preventive or curative solutions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the framework of the CO 2 -DISSOLVED project (Kervévan et al., 2013, 2014), funded by the ANR (French National Research Agency). The CO 2 -DISSOLVED project proposes to assess the feasibility of a novel CO 2 injection strategy in deep saline aquifers, combining injection of dissolved CO 2 (instead of supercritical CO 2) and recovery of the geothermal heat from the extracted brine. This approach relies on the <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> technology (commonly used in the Paris Basin, France), where the warm water is extracted at the production well and the cooled brine re-injected in the same aquifer via a second well (injection well). As a consequence, the amount of CO 2 that can be injected in the geothermal aquifer is physically limited by CO 2 solubility in brine. For that reason and unlike the standard approach (supercritical CO 2) which focuses on very large CO 2 emitters (ca. > 1 Mt/yr), the CO 2 -DISSOLVED concept targets specifically low tonnage emitters (ca. 10 - 150 kt/yr) compatible with a local single doublet facility. Injecting CO 2 -rich acidified water is expected to induce an enhanced reactivity at the immediate vicinity of the injection well, particularly in presence of carbonated minerals. Similarly, acidified water will be much more aggressive for the well casing and cement than standard cold brine in classical <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets.</b> However, since this injection option has been much less studied than the standard injection of supercritical CO 2, we need to improve our knowledge on these aspects.

The aim of this work is to stay {{as closely as possible}} to the original well configuration. An IMPEXS model for the movement of the cold-water and thermal front is built to calculate the possible potential of the field. Wellbore heat losses and pump capacity were taken into account to evaluate the exergy (useful energy) created by the <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet.</b> The results obtained by the model show that the amount of injected cold-water and consequently the amount of heat extraction from the gas field is very sensitive to the permeability of the field and the viscosity of the fluid. Inclusion of heat gain from over- and under-burden in the numerical model causes the thermal front to move slower. Since {{the feasibility}} of the project is predominantly dependent on the duration of the saturation of the field, this effect will not improve {{the feasibility of}} the project. Because only gas at a low pressure is still present in the reservoir, the field has to be saturated with cold water before production of hot water can be started. This process takes around 30 years. After that, a production rate of 5 m 3 /hr can be established. The temperature of the production would be 69. 7 °C initially and becomes 64 °C after 500 years. When taking into account a pump that uses 100 KW to pump the water out of the formation, an exergy of 200 KW can be established.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of geothermal projects mainly {{depends on the}} thermal breakthrough (thermal breakthrough occurs when a cold water front reaches the producer). Currently, geothermal-energy production is marginally economical because of its uncertainties and risks associated with the subsurface such as lifetime, flow rate, temperature. Lifetime of a geothermal reservoir plays the most {{important role in the}} use of geothermal energy because it mainly determines whether or not geothermal-energy production is economically viable. Through optimization of the well positions from one or more <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublets</b> in a homogeneous or heterogeneous reservoir, the profitability of the project, which is largely dependent on the time of compositional breakthrough, temperature breakthrough and the rate of temperature decline, can be improved. This thesis studies optimization of the well positions such that the Net Present Value (NPV) of a project is maximized in a 2 D geothermal reservoir for the selected heterogeneity structure. For this purpose an automated, gradient-based optimization method is used. The approach is based on the concept to surround the wells, whose locations have to be optimized, by so-called pseudo-wells. The reservoir simulations are performed using the Finite Element Method in the program COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 2 a. The major features of the simulation results are discussed in detail. The compositional front moves faster than the thermal front (the ratio of these two is the thermal retardation factor). Breakthrough of water with altered composition will therefore occur at an early stage in the doublet lifetime. Reservoir heterogeneities influence the time at which thermal and compositional breakthrough occur and also determine the rate at which temperature and composition decline after breakthrough. The temperature and compositional decline curves after breakthrough are generally steeper in a homogeneous reservoir than in a heterogeneous reservoir. Therefore, the thermal breakthrough does not necessarily mean the end of the {{lifetime of}} a doublet. It is also shown that the effect of heterogeneities on the thermal retardation factor is small. Three successful optimization sequences in two different reservoirs are described in this thesis. It is shown that, from an economical standpoint, is makes little sense to assume a doublet lifetime of more than 30 years. Furthermore, the effectiveness at which a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> is able to deplete a reservoir (recovery factor) and profitability of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> are closely interlinked. However, a higher recovery factor {{does not necessarily mean that}} the doublet is more profitable and vice versa. There exists an optimum well spacing for doublets positioned in homogeneous reservoirs, such that additional gain of later breakthrough (when placing the production well further away from the injector) is negated by the loss in pressure support of the injection well. This optimum well spacing is found to be an important factor, influencing the profitability in homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs. In addition, it is found that the optimum well spacing of a doublet for greenhouse heating is the same as the optimum well spacing of a doublet for spatial heating. The heat production from an aquifer can be maximized through the usage of multiple doublet layouts. It is found that, even in a heterogeneous reservoir, it is best to use a checkers-board well arrangement, which is more effective than a tramrail well arrangement.

This approach relies on the <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> technology, where the warm water is extracted at a production well and re-injected as cooled water, after heat extraction, in the same aquifer via a second well (injection well). The objective of the work presented here was to identify and to quantify the thermo-hydro-geochemical processes induced by a massive injection of dissolved CO 2 into (1) a carbonated aquifer (Dogger of the Paris basin- 1, 500 to 2, 000 m deep- 70 °C) and (2) a clastic reservoir (Triassic sandstones of the Paris basin- 2, 000 to 2, 500 m deep- 90 °C), and to evaluate their possible consequences on the feasibility of the CO 2 -DISSOLVED concept...|$|R
40|$|In Germany, drect {{geothermal}} energy use {{is restricted to}} selected sites only, due to the geological and present economic conditions. The totally installed low-enthalpy geothermal heating plant capacity is 38. 7 MW,, and another 115 MW, are under construction or planned. However, there is an increasing demand on long-term high-temperature energy storage which results from the peculiarities of {{combined heat and power}} generation. The experience gathered in geothermal reservoir engineering (injection, reservoir modelling, geochemical analysis) has proven the suitability of those aquifers for energy storage. The present paper describes two up-to-date projects, namely aqulfer cold and heat storage as essential part of the energy supply system of the buildings of the German Parliament in Berlin (first energy storage project in Germany which is under construction right now) improvement of the thermal yield from a low-enthalpy <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet</b> being operated for 8 years now by increasing the temperature in the reservoir through injection of the excess and waste heat from a co-generation plant @reject under planning for the Hannover 2000 World Exhibition).

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} well spacing and Net Present Value of a Hot Sedimentary Aquifer <b>geothermal</b> <b>doublet.</b> First, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the effect of uncertainty of geological and production parameters on the Net present Value. Second a finite-element approach is utilized to study the effect of fluvial facies architecture on geothermal energy production. For this purpose detailed fluvial facies architecture models are created utilizing a process-based facies modelling approach. These models and reservoir properties {{are based on a}} geological dataset of the Lower Cretaceous Nieuwerkerk Formation in the West Netherlands Basin (WNB). Results of the sensitivity analysis show that a 10 % variation in well spacing from a 1000 m base case scenario could vary the NPV by 10 %. The minimal required well spacing is dependent on the reservoir thickness, flow rate and the allowed production temperature drop. The simulations results show that the theoretical advantage of a reduction in well spacing could be balanced by a poor well connectivity between the wells because of the characteristic of fluvial reservoir architecture.
