However, the usually used hydrothermal synthesis way for zeolite shell preparation limits the design and preparation of various zeolite shell enwrapping different core catalysts, the industrial scalability of zeolite capsule catalyst, and so on. In this report, with a traditional FTS catalyst of 10 wt% Co/SiO 2 as core catalysts, we present two methods for H-ZSM- 5 zeolite capsule catalyst preparation. One is an improved hydrothermal synthesis process named stepwise-synthesis, another is an initially reported method that does not employ hydrothermal synthesis approach for H-ZSM- 5 zeolite shell preparation. For the last one, we call it physically adhesive (PA) method in this report. The two types of H-ZSM- 5 zeolite capsule catalysts prepared by these two methods are investigated via FTS reaction to evaluate their catalytic performance on the direct synthesis of light <b>isoparaffin</b> from syngas. Since the space-confined and synergistic function offered by the special core-shell structure, both of two types of H-ZSM- 5 zeolite capsule catalysts could readily realize the one-step synthesis of light <b>isoparaffin</b> with higher selectivity, better than that of the conventional hybrid catalyst.

When platinum is impregnated before rhenium and germanium the metals are reduced separately resulting in catalysts with high dehydrogenation activity and low hydrogenolysis activity.

The influences of the reaction conditions on the olefinic polymerizations were investigated in detail. The properties of hydrocarbons in the synthetic fuels were determined by the GC-MS analyses combined with H- 1 NMR, and C- 13 NMR analyses. The formation of C- 8 -C- 15 hydrocarbons from gaseous light olefins was illustrated by the identified products and the functional groups. This transformation potentially provides a useful avenue {{for the production of}} the most important components of iso-paraffins required in jet fuels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The syntheses of HZSM- 5 or H- zeolite-shell encapsulated catalysts for FTS have been reported previously, however, conventional zeolite-shell synthesis generally employs an organic template, which is neither economic nor environmentally benign. Here we report the synthesis, without using an organic template, of a millimeter-sized defect-free capsule catalyst covered by a MOR zeolite shell (thickness of 23 m) on FI pellets. The capsule catalyst (HMOR/FI) exhibited excellent performance for FTS, greatly increasing the selectivity of middle <b>isoparaffins.</b> Compared with the pure FI catalyst, the CO conversion of the HMOR/FI capsule catalyst increased remarkably and the iso/n ratio was almost 8 times that of the pure FI catalyst. This report provides an effective route to synthesize a capsule catalyst, which can reduce costs effectively and is also more environmentally benign than the current conventional zeolite-shell synthesis...|$|R
