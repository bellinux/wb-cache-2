Here bears gather in large numbers to feast on concentrated food sources, including sedges in the salt marshes, clams in the nearby tidal flats, salmon in the estuary streams, and berries on the neighboring hillsides.|$|E
25|$|The McNeil River State <b>Game</b> <b>Sanctuary</b> and Refuge, on the McNeil River, {{is home to}} the {{greatest}} concentration of brown bears in the world.

The McNeil River State Game Refuge, containing Chenik Lake and a smaller number of grizzly bears, has been closed to grizzly hunting since 1995. All of the Katmai-McNeil area is closed to hunting except for Katmai National Preserve, where regulated legal hunting takes place. In all, the Katmai-McNeil area has an estimated 2,500 grizzly bears.|$|E

50|$|Several {{species of}} {{wildlife}} have become extinct in Uttar Pradesh. Among {{them are the}} lion from the Gangetic plain and the rhinoceros from the terai. The fate of many species is uncertain, including the tiger, black buck, serow, swamp deer, bustard, pink-headed duck, and mural pheasants and four-horned antelope. Although a determined enforcement of laws against poaching and hunting has yielded some results, the wildlife population today is alarmingly low. Gharials are poached for their skin.

50|$|After his Ph.D., Harthoorn went {{initially}} to Uganda, then to Kenya and Tanzania. There {{he studied the}} effects of various sedative drugs on wild African mammals and with a team invented the M-99 (etorphine hydrochloride) capture drug and refined the tranquilliser gun, or 'Capture gun', for darting animals. This was an enormous breakthrough in animal transport and enabled the safe movement of many rare animals from places {{in which they were}} at risk from poaching or development to <b>game</b> <b>sanctuaries.</b> The research effort and its eventual triumph is recorded in Dr Harthoorn's first book: The Flying Syringe. Capture gun technology is today used extensively in wildlife parks, urban animal management, criminal human capture and zoological gardens. Before the invention of this technology animals were usually caught manually by being rounded up, penned, and transported without sedation, resulting in the death from stress of many hundreds of animals.|$|R

Until the late 1930s and early 1940s, well-organized groups of hunters from Togiak traveled in kayaks to Round Island (the most reliable hunting location) and other islands armed with spears and harpoons to harvest walrus. Most parts of the walrus were used for food, raw materials, and sharing with inland villages. Another use of walrus which began in the early 19th century and has continued is the taking of walrus for their ivory for trade and sale. Walrus hunting was an important activity in Nushagak Bay and surrounding area during the Russian period. In addition to hunting for food, walrus ivory was traded at the Russian America company post, Alexandrovski, on Nushagak Bay. Walrus were hunted off Hagemeister Island, among other places. The Russian-era trade in walrus ivory peaked from 1821-1842. The Aglegmiut Eskimos of Bristol Bay were known for their skill as ivory carvers.|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{this study}} shows the {{importance}} of considering individual behaviour such as movement. It also shows how sustainable ecosystems could manipulate their movement characteristics to remain stable and viable. In other words, the different species have evolved movement and predation strategies that enable co-dependent stable interactions. It also points to management strategies that should take movements into account. For example, <b>game</b> <b>sanctuaries</b> and reserves need to be large enough for the particular predators and prey to have movement characteristics that enable sustainability. Where the reserve is too small, strong predation and relatively slow movement of prey (or {{not being able to}} escape) might occur and, as predicted, prey and predators could die out. The models developed here could be extended to help with predictions of actual reserves and help management practices. For future work, we will consider a food chain in the ecology and we will explicitly incorporate some external factors (such as logistics, weather, or resource). However, {{the importance of}} considering the individual movement strategies of animals for understanding ecosystem dynamics is highlighted here.|$|R
