40|$|International audienceI {{propose a}} relevance-based {{independence}} axiom {{on how to}} aggregate individual yes/no <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> given propositions into collective judgments: the collective <b>judgment</b> <b>on</b> a proposition depends only <b>on</b> people's <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> propositions which are relevant to that proposition. This axiom contrasts with the classical independence axiom: the collective <b>judgment</b> <b>on</b> a proposition depends only <b>on</b> people's <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> the same proposition. I generalize the premise-based rule and the sequential-priority rule to an arbitrary priority order of the propositions, instead of a dichotomous premise/conclusion order resp. a linear priority order. I prove four impossibility theorems on relevance-based aggregation. One theorem simultaneously generalizes Arrow's Theorem (in its general and indifference-free versions) and the well-known Arrow-like theorem in judgment aggregation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of the birth control pill <b>on</b> <b>divorce.</b> To {{identify}} its effect, we use a quasi experiment exploiting the differences {{in the language of the}} Comstock anti-obscenity statutes approved in the 1800 s and early 1900 s in the US. Results suggest that banning the sales of oral contraceptive methods has a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>divorce.</b> These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for observed (such as female labour force participation, or changes in the early legal access to the birth control pill) and unobserved state-specific factors, and time-varying factors at the state level. Additional analysis, developed to examine whether the impact of subsequent <b>divorce</b> law reforms <b>on</b> <b>divorce</b> is modified after controlling for the birth control pill effect, shows that, although sales bans matter, the impact of <b>divorce</b> law reforms <b>on</b> <b>divorce</b> rate does not vary. ...|$|R
