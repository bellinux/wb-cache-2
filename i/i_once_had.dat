2500|$|Baldwin's {{schools were}} St Michael's School, {{at the time}} located in Slough, Berkshire, {{followed}} by Harrow School. He later wrote that [...] "all the king's horses and all the king's men would have failed to have drawn me into the company of school masters, and in relation to them <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> every qualification as a passive resister." [...] Baldwin {{then went on to}} the University of Cambridge, where he studied history at Trinity College. His time at university was blighted by the presence, as Master of Trinity, of Montagu Butler, his former headmaster who had punished him at Harrow for writing a piece of schoolboy smut. He was asked to resign from the Magpie & Stump (the Trinity College debating society) for never speaking, and, after receiving a third-class degree in history, he went into the family business of iron manufacturing. His father sent him to Mason College (the future University of Birmingham) for one session of technical training in metallurgy as preparation. As a young man he served briefly as a Second Lieutenant in the Artillery Volunteers at Malvern, and in 1897 became a JP for the county of Worcestershire.|$|E
2500|$|Maugham's father, Robert Ormond Maugham, was {{a lawyer}} who handled the legal affairs of the British embassy in Paris. Since French law {{declared}} that all children born on French soil could be conscripted for military service, his father arranged for Maugham to be born at the embassy, technically on British soil. His grandfather, another Robert, was a prominent lawyer and co-founder of the Law Society of England and Wales. Maugham refers to this grandfather's writings in Chapter 6 his literary memoir, The Summing Up: [...] "...in the catalogue of the Library at the British Museum {{there is a long}} list of his legal works. [...] He wrote only one book that was not of this character. [...] It was a collection of essays that he had contributed to the solid magazines of the day and he issued it, as became his sense of decorum, anonymously. <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> the book in my hands, a handsome volume bound in calf, but I never read it and I {{have not been able to}} get hold of a copy since. [...] I wish I had, for I might have learnt from it something of the kind of man he was." [...] His family assumed Maugham and his brothers would be lawyers. His elder brother, Viscount Maugham, enjoyed a distinguished legal career and served as Lord Chancellor from 1938 to 1939.|$|E

5000|$|Or weep as <b>I</b> could <b>once</b> <b>have</b> wept o'er many a vanish'd scene,- ...|$|R
6000|$|Thro' many an hour {{of summer}} suns [...] By many {{pleasant}} ways, [...] Against its fountain upward runs [...] The current of my days: [2] [...] I kiss the lips <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>have</b> kiss'd; [...] The gas-light wavers dimmer; [...] And softly, thro' a vinous mist, [...] My college friendships glimmer.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{watching}} of {{me at my}} chambers (which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> {{reason to}} suspect)," [...] I said to Wemmick when he came back, [...] "is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted; is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do not {{set your}} hopes too firmly on your child. Remember how the nobles of Rome have {{destroyed}} the household <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had,</b> and tremble for your own.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] said Bertie, opening wide his {{wonderful}} blue eyes. [...] "Well, I {{never was}} afraid of responsibility. <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> thoughts of being a bishop, myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I may {{be talking}} like one, but I'm not one. <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> {{the makings of}} one--of a good one,--a 'proper' one, as the English would say." [...] She sighed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, Miss Mordaunt must be right, and I have {{forgotten}} the affair. <b>I</b> must <b>once</b> <b>have</b> kept a woman's school, somewhere^ in my younger days, but forgotten it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, dear Mrs. Poynsett," [...] exclaimed Lady Tyrrell, [...] "I am {{sure you}} never {{encouraged}} them. I am quite enough aware--whatever <b>I</b> may <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been--of the unfortunate contrast between our respective families." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} prop their faith: and yet Many I had known: with all I sympathized; And though struck speechless, I did not forget That what was mourned for, <b>I,</b> too, <b>once</b> <b>had</b> prized.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should be}} almost afraid to try, John dear. Was he {{much the better}} for his wealth? Was I much the better for the little part <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> in it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would remain}} to be found out. You must remember, Buddy, that they are down on me because of that row <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> with their father over that gold mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|So; {{all other}} plans discarding, I {{resolved}} on entrance, bent on seeing what <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> seen, And approached the gangway of my earlier knowledge, disregarding [...] The tract of time between.|$|E
60|$|BECKET. O Herbert, Herbert, in my chancellorship <b>I</b> {{more than}} <b>once</b> <b>have</b> gone against the Church.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>I</b> hadn't <b>once</b> <b>had</b> a gal of my own--beyond seas now--that {{was proud}} of her hair,' said Mrs Brown, 'I'd have had every lock of it. She's far away, she's far away! Oho! Oho!' ...|$|R
6000|$|The Bardling thought, 'A pipe is all <b>I</b> need; <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sought me out a clear, smooth reed, And shaped {{it to my}} fancy, I proceed To breathe such strains as, yonder mid the rocks, The strange youth blows, {{that tends}} Admetus' flocks. And all the maidens shall to me pay heed.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. COADE (not more deceived {{than the}} others). How lovely {{it is in}} the moonlight. Roses, roses, all the way. (Dreamily.) It is like a hat <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> when I was young.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] sighed the old woman, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> a dear little son so named. He {{died when}} he was about your age, and your kindly ways are so like his that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{because they}} are so very, very funny. Sit down beside me, and I'll tell you about three kittens <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had.</b> They were very little--at least they were little before they got big." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘The way I {{came to be}} {{anxious about}} the Vis-count,’ he continued, ‘is that I believe he might be induced to form an ’asty judgment. And the business, in a pecuniary point of view, is all that I could ask; only trying, sir—very trying. It’s making an old man of me before my time. You might have {{observed}} yourself, sir, that I ’aven’t got the knees <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>’ad.</b> The knees and the breathing, there’s where it takes me. But I’m very sure, sir, I address a gentleman as {{would be the last}} to make trouble between friends.’ ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> begun, {{it seemed}} to me I had to go through with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Positively, though <b>I</b> <b>once</b> knew, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}}, quite forgotten it. Strange. But never mind. You will easily {{learn in}} St. Louis. He {{is well known}} there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather not," [...] said Archie. [...] "Never stole a {{snake in}} my life. None of the Moffams have ever gone about {{stealing}} snakes. Regular family tradition! Though <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> an uncle who kept gold-fish." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remarked that}} I {{knew what that}} meant: {{he had lost his}} sense of {{direction}} and had now all at once recovered it; such a thing had often happened; <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> such an experience myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bully for you! Well, say, I {{just been}} {{shooting}} the dope into Kirk upstairs. I been--you didn't happen {{to read the}} report of a scrap <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> with a gazook called Kid Mitchell, did you, ma'am?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, madame, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>once</b> {{or twice}} <b>had</b> the honour of {{attending}} upon you {{though it may}} not have been my good fortune to address you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] the {{newcomer}} said, with an angry scowl. [...] "Any beauty <b>I</b> <b>once</b> may <b>have</b> had is gone forever. I have lost {{three of my}} upper teeth, and two of my lower, and I am learning now to speak with my lips shut, so as to hide the gap." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{pressed his}} hand in silence, for I could not forget that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> meant to desert him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is of no}} use. She {{never entered}} into my views. She does not understand. It is her {{situation}} I blame, not herself. She is a dear creature, and <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> a strong girlish enthusiasm for her.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE PRINCESS. You {{must not}} expect too much. There is my uncle. He is very severe and hasty; {{and he is}} my guardian. <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> a maid I liked very much; but he sent her away the very first time.|$|E
6000|$|... "I could. But {{he should}} not drive me from him, as you say you did her; never--never--never. He might kill me if he would; but if <b>I</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> told him that I loved him, I would never leave him afterwards." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had spoken}} to the Sagoths as I had {{for the purpose of}} {{throwing}} them off the scent of my purposed attempt at escape. If they thought that I was so satisfied with my lot within Phutra that I would voluntarily return when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> so excellent an opportunity to escape, they would never for an instant imagine that I could be occupied in arranging another escape immediately upon my return to the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{the most}} arrant nonsense, Fan. You must be a goose, or what is almost as bad, a hypocrite, to say that I have any love or {{tenderness}} in me. I confess that <b>I</b> did <b>once</b> <b>have</b> a little affection for you, but that is pretty well over now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Daily Telegraph man {{is such a}} {{delightful}} creature," [...] she answered. [...] "I do not like reporters, but I fancy that <b>I</b> must <b>once</b> <b>have</b> been civil to this one by mistake. Henry, you have had the road shortened. I am perfectly certain of it. We cannot be there." ...|$|R
