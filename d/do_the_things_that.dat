25|$|Sisko angrily confronts Garak, {{who admits}} he planted a bomb on Vreenak's ship {{in case the}} forgery was not accepted. Garak also admits he killed Tolar {{in order to keep}} his work secret. Garak {{maintains}} that when the Romulans scan the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion, and thus the recording will implicate the Dominion as planned. Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which he calls a bargain.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> work for them. If I can {{teach you how to}} hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you.

But when McCall was appointed the new manager in June 2007, Wetherall was reinstated as club captain for the 2007–08 season. On 20 February 2008 he announced the 2007–08 season {{would be his last}} as a player, although Bradford City would keep his registration, and instead he would join the club's coaching staff. Wetherall said: [...] "I was becoming increasingly frustrated at not being able to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I {{used to be able to}} do. Situations I would normally deal with comfortably were suddenly becoming a struggle." [...] Bradford fans held a special day to celebrate Wetherall's career, when they took banners and wore fancy dress and laboratory coats during the club's 1–1 draw with Rotherham United on 22 March 2008. In his penultimate month as a footballer, Wetherall was also named the League Two fans' player of the month by the Professional Footballers' Association. He played his final game for Bradford against Wycombe Wanderers on 3 May 2008 in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E

Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people.

But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving etymology of {{the word}} is from late antiquity. The 5th century (AD) Etymologicon by Orion of Thebes offers two alternative origins for the word eunuch: first, to tēn eunēn ekhein, [...] "guarding the bed", a derivation inferred from eunuchs' established role {{at the time as}} [...] "bedchamber attendants" [...] in the imperial palace, and second, to eu tou nou ekhein, [...] "being good with respect to the mind", which Orion explains based on their [...] "being deprived of male-female intercourse (esterēmenou tou misgesthai), the things that the ancients used to call irrational (anoēta, literally: 'mindless')". Orion's second option reflects well-established idioms in Greek, as shown by entries for noos, eunoos and ekhein in Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, while the first option is not listed as an idiom under eunē in that standard reference work. However, the first option was cited by the late 9th century Byzantine emperor Leo VI in his New Constitution 98 banning the marriage of eunuchs, in which he noted eunuchs' reputation as trustworthy guardians of the marriage bed (eunē) and claimed that the very word eunuch attested to this kind of employment. The emperor also goes further than Orion by attributing eunuchs' lack of male-female intercourse specifically to castration, which he said was performed with the intention [...] "that they will no longer <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> males do, or at least to extinguish whatever has to do with desire for the female sex". The 11th century Byzantine monk Nikon of the Black Mountain, opting instead for Orion's second alternative, stated that the word came from eunoein (eu [...] "good" [...] + nous [...] "mind"), thus meaning [...] "to be well-minded, well-inclined, well-disposed or favorable", but unlike Orion he argued that this was due to the trust that certain jealous and suspicious foreign rulers placed in the loyalty of their eunuchized servants. Theophylact of Ohrid in a dialogue In Defence of Eunuchs also stated that the origin {{of the word}} was from eunoein and ekhein, [...] "to have, hold", since they were always [...] "well-disposed" [...] toward the master who [...] "held" [...] or owned them. The 12th century Etymologicum Magnum (s.v. eunoukhos) essentially repeats the entry from Orion, but stands by the first option, while attributing the second option to what [...] "some say". In the late 12th century, Eustathius of Thessalonica (Commentaries on Homer 1256.30, 1643.16) offered an original derivation of the word from eunis + okheuein, [...] "deprived of mating".|$|E
