50|$|The {{prototype}} aircraft was {{fitted with a}} , five cylinder Walter NZ 70 radial engine in a rounded nose, with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling. Behind the engine the fuselage, all wood like the wings, was rectangular in section and built around four longerons with plywood surfacing; the upper surface was subdivided longitudinally into a ridge with two sloping faces. There were two open cockpits with small windscreens, one centred at about one-third chord and the other over the trailing edge. <b>Disengagable</b> dual control was fitted. The fuselage tapered towards the tail, where the empennage was conventional. Its parallel chord horizontal tail with rounded tips was placed at mid-fuselage height {{and there was a}} quadrant shaped fin and curved rudder hinged at the extreme tail, sloping in below to allow elevator movement. Control surfaces were unbalanced.|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} connection system comprises a first body {{defining a}} receptable {{and a second}} body defining a pin matingly receivable in the receptacle by relative movement in a first directional mode. A primary latch is engagable between the two bodies to retain the pin in the receptacle. The primary latch is reciprocable in a second directional mode transverse to the first directional mode. A lock member carried {{by one of the}} bodies is operatively associated with the primary latch and movable, transverse to the second directional mode, between a locking position maintaining engagement of the primary latch and a releasing position permitting release of the primary latch. The lock includes an operator portion engagable to move the lock member from its locking position to its releasing position. The operator is located internally of the first body. An actuator is selectivity insertable into and <b>disengagable</b> from the first body. The actuator is movable relative to the first body when it is inserted for engagement with and operation of the operator...|$|E
40|$|A {{quick connect}} {{fastener}} and {{method of use}} is presented wherein the quick connect fastener is suitable for replacing available bolts and screws, the quick connect fastener being capable of installation by simply pushing a threaded portion of the connector into a member receptacle hole, the inventive apparatus being comprised of an externally threaded fastener having a threaded portion slidably mounted upon a stud or bolt shaft, wherein the externally threaded fastener portion is expandable by a preloaded spring member. The fastener, upon contact with the member receptacle hole, has the capacity of presenting cylindrical threads of a reduced diameter for insertion purposes and once inserted into the receiving threads of the receptacle member hole, are expandable for engagement of the receptacle hole threads forming a quick connect of the fastener and the member to be fastened, the quick connect fastener can be further secured by rotation after insertion, {{even to the point}} of locking engagement, the quick connect fastener being <b>disengagable</b> only by reverse rotation of the mated thread engagement...|$|E
