5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for <b>him.</b> <b>Some</b> contemporaries speculated that Priestley's {{outspokenness}} had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield {{argues that the}} most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, {{she did not like}} the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Nolan was the last male member of his family, and the line died with <b>him.</b> <b>Some</b> friends had a plaque erected in his memory at Holy Trinity Church in Maidstone, {{although}} his body remained in the Crimea.

They also allowed him to say to Hitler that he was pursuing an aggressive approach, even as the front moved steadily to the west.|$|E
5|$|Five Finger Death Punch {{was founded}} in 2005 by former U.P.O. bassist Zoltan Bathory and drummer Jeremy Spencer, Zoltan {{deriving}} the band's name from classic martial arts cinema. Bassist Matt Snell joined in early 2006. Later that year, Bathory contacted former Motograter vocalist Ivan Moody, sending <b>him</b> <b>some</b> of the material the band had recorded {{and asked him to}} audition for the vocalist position.

5|$|Gandhi's statements, {{letters and}} life have {{attracted}} much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced <b>him.</b> <b>Some</b> writers present {{him as a}} paragon of ethical living and pacifism, others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.|$|E

5|$|He {{also carried}} out studies on {{education}} and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition. Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of evolutionism in the natural and social sciences. In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively critical {{of the influence of}} religion. These views gained <b>him</b> <b>some</b> critics, as he was seen as a priest who had abandoned religion.|$|E
5|$|In 1215 William {{joined the}} baronial {{rebellion}} against John, {{and lost his}} naval offices, the royal forester's office for Somerset, and custody of Lydford Castle. In May 1216 the king offered William a safe conduct, which noted that William had fled overseas. The letters were witnessed by Peter des Roches. In mid-1217, he rejoined the royalist cause, returning {{to the side of}} Henry III. This action regained <b>him</b> <b>some</b> of his lost lands.|$|E

Controversial through his political and peace activism, {{he moved from}} London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the Nixon administration to deport <b>him.</b> <b>Some</b> of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.|$|E

5|$|At both Portsmouth and Cirencester, Hammond {{excelled at}} sports {{including}} cricket (playing for the Portsmouth Grammar School second eleven), football and fives. At Cirencester, he played football {{for the school}} first eleven in his first term. He quickly reached the school cricket first eleven, where he outperformed the other players and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents' team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against very weak bowling. These achievements brought <b>him</b> <b>some</b> local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and he preferred to be out playing cricket.|$|E

He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave <b>him</b> <b>some</b> local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|Coltrane was the Simpsons fourth cat, {{adopted from}} an animal shelter {{shortly after the}} death of Snowball III.

Upon bringing Coltrane home, Lisa decides to play <b>him</b> <b>some</b> of John Coltrane music on her saxophone, but the noise frightens him and he commits suicide by jumping out the window. Coltrane was the Simpsons only cat since Snowball I to have been white, although {{he was the only one}} not to be named Snowball. However, Lisa evidently considers him as part of the Snowball lineage, as she names her next cat Snowball V, implying that Coltrane was Snowball IV.|$|E

5|$|Crowley left Busch and {{returned}} to London, where he took Pearl Brooksmith as his new Scarlet Woman. Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that {{he was invited to}} be guest of honour at Foyles' Literary Luncheon, also being invited by Harry Price to speak at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. In need of money, he launched a series of court cases against people whom he believed had libelled <b>him,</b> <b>some</b> of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against Constable and Co for publishing Nina Hamnett's Laughing Torso (1932) – a book he thought libelled him – but lost the case. The court case added to Crowley's financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley had been spending three times his income for several years.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{was born}} in England but was sent to Hanover in his {{adolescence}} for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces near Tournai against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. In 1799, he was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Although his marriage in 1815 to the twice-widowed Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz met with the disapproval of his mother, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved a happy one. By 1817, King George III had only one legitimate grandchild, Princess Charlotte of Wales, and when she died in childbirth, Ernest was the senior son to be both married and not estranged from his wife. This gave <b>him</b> <b>some</b> prospect of succeeding to the British throne. However, both of his unmarried older brothers quickly married, and King George's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, fathered the eventual British monarch, Victoria.|$|E
5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring <b>him</b> <b>some</b> relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as many years of second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
