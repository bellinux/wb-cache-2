40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a paraconsistent <b>description</b> logic based on quasi-classical logic. Compared to the four-valued descrip-tion logic, quasi-classical <b>description</b> logic {{satisfies}} all of the three basic inference rules (i. e., modus ponens, modus tollens and disjunctive syllogism) so that the inference ability of quasi-classical <b>description</b> logic is closer to that of classical logic. Quasi-classical <b>description</b> logic combines three inclusions (i. e., mate-rial inclusion, internal inclusion and strong inclusion) of four-valued <b>description</b> logic so that quasi-classical <b>description</b> logic satisfies the intuitive equivalence. Moreover, we develop a ter-minable, sound and complete tableau algorithm for quasi-classical <b>description</b> logic. As an important result, the complexity of rea-soning problems in quasi-classical <b>description</b> logic is proved to be no {{higher than that of}} reasoning problems in <b>description</b> logic.

30|$|The errors on the {{identified}} parameters can have different origins. They {{can be related}} to errors on the measured displacement (i.e. DIC errors), on the geometry <b>description</b> (domain and boundaries), on the behavior law (<b>description</b> of the secant tensor B_n^s), on the phase <b>description</b> (material mesh), or on the stress <b>description</b> (stress mesh and boundary conditions used for the stress computation). In this paper we address the influence of DIC errors, of phase <b>description</b> errors and, in a lesser extent of stress <b>description</b> errors. Since conform meshes are used, phase <b>description</b> errors are related both to stress <b>description</b> errors and to measured displacement errors.|$|R
