40|$|Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (5 ′-phosphorylated) {{of varying}} lengths were capped using a {{polyamide}} linker to form thermodynamically stable, <b>endcapped</b> DNA duplexes containing 8 – 14 bp.

The results of the study revealed that a 11 bp <b>endcapped</b> duplex was the shortest duplex effectively ligated. Dependence of ligation efficiency on nick position demonstrates that T 4 DNA ligase bound asymmetrically to its DNA substrate. The use of a set of thermodynamically stable <b>endcapped</b> deoxyribonucleoside duplexes as a tool to elucidate the DNA footprint provides an efficient strategy for footprinting, which avoids ambiguities associated with chemical and biochemical footprinting methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{operation of}} the CMS <b>Endcap</b> Muon detector will entail meeting several significant technical challenges. Among these challenges will be the ability to accurately estimate {{the performance of the}} <b>Endcap</b> Muon detector and to anticipate or correct any potential problems during the design stage. This thesis presents the simulation and study of the <b>Endcap</b> Muon Alignment Scheme, a component of the <b>Endcap</b> Muon Detector designed to determine and track the location of Cathode Strip Chambers. ^ Information about the performance of the CMS <b>Endcap</b> Alignment System was gathered through an extensive testing of a prototype system and then used to create a simulation to predict the behavior of the system as designed. The results of these simulations indicate that the design of the EMU Alignment System is viable and can successfully reconstruct chamber locations along designated alignment lines throughout the CMS <b>Endcap.</b> A detailed error analysis and subsequent examination of the principle sources of uncertainty across multiple simulations show that the tolerances on components and their calibration are well understood and will ensure the successful reconstruction of CSC chamber positions within approximately 200 μm in CMS RΦ and 500 μm in CMS Z. In addition, physics studies of single muon events were performed with the general CMS Reconstruction Software (ORCA 5 _ 3 _ 1) to understand CSC misalignment effects on muon track reconstruction and predict how the Alignment System will impact the final determination of muon pt and trigger rates in the <b>Endcap</b> Muon System. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the normal}} {{operation}} of quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers, the trapped ions are ejected symmetrically through both the upper (detector) and lower(source) <b>endcap</b> electrodes during mass selective boundary ejection experiment. This reduces {{the sensitivity of}} the instrument by almost 50 %. In this preliminary study, we altered the geometry parameters of the quadrupole ion traps to introduce asymmetry. The asymmetry displaced the ion cloud towards the detector <b>endcap</b> which resulted in a preferential ejection through this <b>endcap,</b> thus imparting directionality to the ejected ions and hence to the sensitivity enhancement. Two symmetrical mass analyzers have been taken up for numerical study. They include the Paul trap(QIT) and the cylindricaliontrap(CIT). Asymmetry to these geometries is introduced in two ways, one by varying the upper <b>endcap</b> hole radius alone and in other by stretching the trap along the upper <b>endcap</b> only. The escape velocity plots and mass selective boundary ejection simulations are used to demonstrate the directionality of ion ejection for these geometries.

50|$|Penning traps use {{a strong}} {{homogeneous}} axial magnetic field to confine particles radially and a quadrupole electric field to confine the particles axially.

For trapping of positive (negative) ions, the endcap electrodes are kept at a positive (negative) potential relative to the ring.

The electric field causes ions to oscillate (harmonically {{in the case of an}} ideal Penning trap) along the trap axis.
