In this prospective clinical trial 34 patients received escalating doses of <b>defibrotide.</b> For patients with persistent VOD despite doses of 60  mg/kg/day, doses were increased to a maximum of 110  mg/kg/day.

40|$|Background. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is a {{rare and}} {{potentially}} severe complication of chemotherapy. We describe five patients who developed VOD after chemotherapy for Wilms tumor (WT) and evaluate the role of plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) and <b>defibrotide</b> for diagnosis and therapy of VOD, respectively. Patients and methods. Thirty-five patients treated from 2002 to 2009 for WT were eligible. Diagnosis of VOD was according McDonald's criteria that required two of the following: jaundice, hepatomegaly and/or right upper quadrant pain, weight gain with or without ascites. Results. VOD occurred in 5 of 35 patients (14 %) after 21 - 105 days from starting chemotherapy. Two patients developed multiorgan failure (MOF). PAI- 1 was high in four patients who were tested. Three patients were treated with <b>defibrotide</b> and no side effects were reported while two patients received supportive measures only. Four patients recovered and three of them received <b>defibrotide.</b> They are all alive and well after a median follow-up of 35 months. One of two patients not treated with <b>defibrotide</b> died of MOF. Conclusions. PAI- 1 levels were abnormal in WT-VOD. <b>Defibrotide</b> was a safe, well-tolerated, and potentially efficacious therapy in this group of patients.

40|$|Abstract: Cathepsin G (CatG) is a chymotrypsin-like {{protease}} released upon degranulation of neutrophils. In several inflammatory and ischaemic diseases the impaired {{balance between}} CatG and its physiological inhibitors leads to tissue destruction and platelet aggregation.

Moreover, short DNA fragments are more inhibitory than genomic DNA. <b>Defibrotide,</b> a single stranded polydeoxyribonucleotide with antithrombotic effect is also a potent CatG inhibitor. Given the above experimental evidences we employed a selection protocol to assess whether DNA inhibition of CatG may be ascribed to specific sequences present in <b>defibrotide</b> DNA.

Patients receiving <b>defibrotide</b> showed a significant increase of the Winsor index after exercise at 90 days versus basal (mean 0. 47 +/- 0. 04 vs. 0. 43 +/- 0. 05, p less than 0. 05), and a parallel increase of walking distance (basal 288 +/- 42. 3 m vs. 368 +/- 46. 6 at 60 days, p less than 0. 05, and 407 +/- 64. 3 m at 90 days, p less than 0. 01). No improvement {{was seen in the}} placebo group. These preliminary results suggest that <b>defibrotide</b> may prove beneficial to patients with PVD; further studies are needed to find the most appropriate dosage regime...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the production and}} characterization of cationic microparticles based on pullulan and starch for the delivery of nucleic acids. The microparticles were prepared by chemically cross-linkinking of a polymer solution dispersed in organic phase, followed by amination with N, N-diethyl- 2 -chloroethyl amine hydrochloride or N-glycidyl-N, N-dimethyl-N-methylammonium chloride. The association of desoxyribonucleotide <b>Defibrotide</b> (DFT) with positively charged microparticles was determined. The association capacity and the affinity of microspheres for DFT were investigated {{as a function of}} type of polysaccharide, content and basicity of the aminogroups. It was found that the both types of carriers synthetized display a high affinity for <b>Defibrotide</b> due to the high porosity of polysaccharide microspheres. In addition, the in vitro release kinetics from microspheres were determined...|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Defibrotide</b> {{is a novel}} orally {{bioavailable}} polydisperse oligonucleotide with anti-thrombotic and anti-adhesive effects. In SCID/NOD mice, <b>defibrotide</b> showed {{activity in}} human myeloma xenografts. This phase I/II {{study was conducted to}} identify the most appropriate dose of <b>defibrotide</b> in combination with melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide in patients with relapsed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and to determine its safety and tolerability as part of this regimen. Design and Methods This was a phase I/II, multicenter, dose-escalating, non-comparative, open label study. Oral melphalan was administered at a dose of 0. 25 mg/kg on days 1 - 4, prednisone at a dose of 1. 5 mg/kg also on days 1 - 4 and thalidomide at a dose of 50 - 100 mg/day continuously. <b>Defibrotide</b> was administered orally at three dose-levels: 2. 4, 4. 8 or 7. 2 g on days 1 - 4 and 1. 6, 3. 2, or 4. 8 g on days 5 - 35. 3 Results Twenty-four patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. In all patients, the complete response plus very good partial response rate was 9 %, and the partial response rate was 43 %. The 1 -year progression-free survival and 1 -year overall survival rates were 34 % and 90 %, respectively. The most frequent grade 3 - 4 adverse events included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and fatigue. Deep vein thrombosis was reported in only one patient. Conclusions This combination of melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide together with <b>defibrotide</b> showed anti-tumor activity with a favorable tolerability. The maximum tolerated dose of <b>defibrotide</b> was identified as 7. 2 g p. o. on days 1 - 4 followed by 4. 8 g p. o. on days 5 - 35. Further trials are needed to confirm the role of this regimen and to evaluate the combination of <b>defibrotide</b> with new drugs (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT 00406978). This multicenter, open-label, non-comparative phase II trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of salvage therapy with lenalidomide, melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (RMPT) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Oral lenalidomide (10 mg/day) was administered on days 1 - 21, and oral melphalan (0. 18 mg/kg) and oral prednisone (2 mg/kg) on days 1 - 4 of each 28 -day cycle. Thalidomide was administered at 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day on days 1 - 28; six cycles were administered in total. Maintenance included lenalidomide 10 mg/day on days 1 - 21, until unacceptable adverse events or disease progression. Aspirin (100 mg/day) was given as thromboprophylaxis. A total of 44 patients with relapsed/refractory MM were enrolled and 75 % achieved at least a partial response (PR), including 32 % very good PR (VGPR) and 2 % complete response (CR). The 1 -year progression-free survival (PFS) was 51 % and the 1 -year overall survival (OS) from study entry was 72 %. Grade 4 hematologic adverse events included neutropenia (18 %), thrombocytopenia (7 %) and anemia (2 %). Grade 3 non-hematologic adverse events were infections (14 %), neurological toxicity (4. 5 %) and fatigue (7 %). No grade 3 / 4 thromboembolic events or peripheral neuropathy were reported. In conclusion, RMPT is an active salvage therapy with good efficacy and manageable side effects. This study represents the basis for larger phase III randomized trials...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) {{remains one}} of the commonest and most serious {{complications}} after myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Clinical diagnosis of hepatic VOD is based on the finding of the triad of painful hepatomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, and unexplained fluid retention occurring within 21 days of the transplant. However, the uncommon clinical entity of late-onset VOD can occur even beyond 20 days and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any liver disease of more than 3 weeks&#x 2032; duration. While mild cases usually resolve spontaneously, severe VOD is associated with a grim prognosis. <b>Defibrotide,</b> a polydisperse mixture of single-stranded oligonucleotide with antithrombotic and fibrinolytic effects on microvascular endothelium, has emerged as an effective and safe therapy for patients with severe VOD. We describe a patient who presented 55 days post transplant with clinical features suggestive of VOD. Upon treatment with oral <b>defibrotide,</b> he showed complete resolution of the VOD...|$|E
40|$|Cathepsin G (CatG) is a chymotrypsin-like {{protease}} released upon degranulation of neutrophils. In several inflammatory and ischaemic diseases the impaired {{balance between}} CatG and its physiological inhibitors leads to tissue destruction and platelet aggregation. Inhibitors of CatG {{are suitable for}} the treatment of inflammatory diseases and procoagulant conditions. DNA released upon the death of neutrophils at injury sites binds CatG. Moreover, short DNA fragments are more inhibitory than genomic DNA. <b>Defibrotide,</b> a single stranded polydeoxyribonucleotide with antithrombotic effect is also a potent CatG inhibitor. Given the above experimental evidences we employed a selection protocol to assess whether DNA inhibition of CatG may be ascribed to specific sequences present in <b>defibrotide</b> DNA. A Selex protocol was applied to identify the single-stranded DNA sequences exhibiting the highest affinity for CatG, the diversity of a combinatorial pool of oligodeoxyribonucleotides being a good representation of the complexity found in <b>defibrotide.</b> Biophysical and biochemical studies confirmed that the selected sequences bind tightly to the target enzyme and also efficiently inhibit its catalytic activity. Sequence analysis carried out to unveil a motif responsible for CatG recognition showed a recurrence of alternating TG repeats in the selected CatG binders, adopting an extended conformation that grants maximal interaction with the highly charged protein surface. This unprecedented finding is validated by our results showing high affinity and inhibition of CatG by specific DNA sequences of variable length designed to maximally reduce pairing/folding interactions...|$|E
40|$|In an open-study design five healthy {{volunteers were}} first given 2500 IV sodium heparin {{intravenously}} and then, after 72 h, another injection {{of the same}} dosage of sodium heparin followed immediately by 400 mg <b>defibrotide</b> intravenously. In two separate experiments, prothrombin time, activated partial prothrombin time, antithrombin III, tissue plasminogen activator, its inhibitor and plasma heparin levelswere measured at baseline and after 15 min in one experiment, and at baseline and after 2 h in the other experiment. The most important finding was that an interaction exists between heparin and <b>defibrotide</b> on haemostatic activity: activated partial prothrombin time was increased three-fold in volunteers given the defibrotide-heparin combination compared with volunteers given heparin alone. This statistically and clinically significant effect was evident 15 min after administration of detibrotide- heparin and was still present after 2 h. Possible explanations for this effect are discussed briefly. KEY WORDS: Sodium heparin; defibrotide; haemostasis; intravenous administration. 3...|$|E
