5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is exposed; by pushing this <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for this change.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} levels of door {{protection}}. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{side of the door}} unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.|$|E
40|$|During {{refurbishing}} of a {{pilotless target aircraft}} after a sortie, the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> which {{connect the}} elevator to a connecting flange was found broken on both port and starboard sides. These pins had been cadmium plated. Electron fractography indicated that {{the failure of the}} pins was due to hydrogen embrittlement. Also the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> did not conform to material specifications...|$|R
5000|$|The HX {{was shown}} with a slant-back configuration, wearing a desert-inspired matte olive paint scheme, and {{featured}} removable doors with exposed <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> and removable composite fender flares that are attached with quarter-turn quick-release fasteners.|$|R

25|$|Pistol grips, butt {{stocks and}} {{fore-ends}} {{have been made}} available in stained walnut, or in recoil reducing composite materials. Different pistol fore-ends are required for the octagonal versus the round versus the bull barrels. The fore-ends have had an assortment of either one or two screw attachment points, used for attaching the fore-ends to the barrel with its matching one or two attachment points. Universally, the fore-ends, in addition to attaching to the barrel, cover the single <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> that connects the barrel to the receiver.|$|E
5000|$|Hinge screws — {{longer or}} {{specialized}} screws that prevent {{the door from}} being simply pulled out after removing the hinge pins. Often the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> itself is screwed, from the inside while the door is open, into the hinge to prevent removal of the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> without first opening the door.|$|E

50|$|Coiled pins {{are used}} {{extensively}} in cosmetic cases, automotive door handles and locks, and latches as <b>hinge</b> <b>pins.</b> They {{are also used}} as pivots and axles, for alignment and stopping, to fasten multiple components together—such as a gear and shaft—and even as ejector pins to remove motherboards from PCs. The automotive and electrical industries use coiled pins in such products as steering boxes and columns, pumps, electric motors and circuit breakers.|$|R
50|$|As {{reported}} by Professor M. Milazzo (M.Milazzo P.Sardella analisi XRF quantitativa nelle applicazioni archeometriche), The XRF {{analysis performed on}} the metal of the crown revealed that all the foils, rosettes and bezels were made with the same alloy, made of 84 - 85% gold, 5 - 7% silver, and 8 - 10% copper, suggesting a contemporary construction of {{the main part of}} the crown, while the fillets external to the enamel plates and the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> were made of 90 - 91% gold and 9 - 10% silver, suggesting one or more subsequent reworking.|$|R
50|$|Traditional working {{dinghies}} have a lee {{board that}} can be hooked over the side. This does not split the cargo space. A sailing rudder is usually tied or clipped to a simple pair of pintles (<b>hinge</b> <b>pins)</b> on the transom with the bottom pintle being longer so that the rudder can be mounted one pintle at a time. The rope keeps the rudder from floating off in a wave. Both rudders and lee boards have swiveling tips so the dinghy can be landed. Rudders are often arranged so the tiller folds against the rudder to make a compact package.|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes were}} implemented, some during the war, {{but not all}} M1917s {{received}} these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919 series guns. While the World War I pattern top cover <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{appears to have been}} retained on most converted M1917s, the later production M1917A1s had a positive locking top cover <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> that allowed the top cover to remain open lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one's hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919 series guns.|$|E

40|$|The {{state space}} {{approach}} {{is used to}} provide analytical solution for fundamental frequency analysis of functionally graded sandwich beams. The classical beam theory, first-order and higher-order shear deformation theories are employed to consider beams of various classical and non-classical boundary conditions. Governing equations of motions are derived from Hamilton's principle. The research investigates the effect of boundary conditions on the fundamental frequency with nine combinations of classical boundary conditions created from clamped, <b>hinged,</b> <b>pinned</b> and free conditions in accordance with three combinations of non-classical boundary conditions created from the assumption of an elastic support. In addition, the influence of material parameter and arrangement of layers {{as well as the}} slenderness ratio in vibration of functionally graded sandwich beams is examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} {{in question is}} an existing personnel access platform located in the D-Zero Assembly Building. This platform is used to access the preamplifiers located on the central calorimeter. The platform {{will need to be}} shortened to a 'fold-out' length of 36 in. due to some modifications recently made to the detector. The purpose of this note is to determine whether this modification affects the safety and the rated load of the platform. Three of the load carrying members were analyzed; the gusset supports, the hinge supports, and the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins.</b> The long and short beams which make up the platform's flooring were not analyzed. The long beams will not be affected by this modification because there is no change in the length of their moment arms. The short beams will be affected, but will see a smaller bending stress because of the decrease in the length of their moment arms. Any weld results previously found will also not be affected...|$|R
50|$|The Contender, first {{introduced}} in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle {{with a number}} of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is exposed; by pushing this <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.|$|E
5000|$|With a rifle barrel mounted above a [...]410 shotgun barrel, this {{is known}} as a superposed [...] "over-under" [...] design. The barrel {{assembly}} is connected to the stock/action group by means of a removable <b>hinge</b> <b>pin.</b> Whether folded or disassembled, the overall length for storage is approximately 18.5 inches.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} levels of door {{protection}}. Front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{side of the door}} unprotected. Full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected.Which level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a risk assessment of the door.|$|E
2500|$|The quoit brooch {{is a type}} of brooch found {{from the}} 5th century and later during the Anglo-Saxon {{settlement}} of Britain that has given its name to the Quoit Brooch Style to embrace all types of Anglo-Saxon metalwork in the decorative style typical of the finest brooches. [...] The brooches take their modern name from the rings thrown in the game of quoits, and have the form of a broad ring, or circle with an empty centre, usually in bronze or silver (sometimes inlaid with silver or gold respectively), and often highly decorated. The forms are in a very low relief, so contrasting with other early Anglo-Saxon styles, with detail added by shallow engraving or punching within the main shapes. Dots or dashes are often used to represent fur on the animal forms, as well as lines emphasizing parts of the body. [...] They are fixed with a single, straight <b>hinged</b> <b>pin</b> like those of other Anglo-Saxon ring or Celtic brooches and are further defined by the presence of a slot and pin-stops on the ring.|$|R
5000|$|The silver disc at {{the back}} of the brooch is about 4.5 inches across, and the brooch is secured by a <b>hinged</b> <b>pin</b> (a later replacement) and catch behind it. Underneath the central stone is an empty {{compartment}} (said in 1905 to contain fragments of human bone), probably designed to hold a relic; the stone is set well above the base disc, and is surrounded by eight detached chatons or turrets, about 1.25 inches high, and each topped by a Scottish freshwater pearl. There is [...] "a profusion of filigree work in the form of stellate appliqué ornaments and cabled borders". The style of decoration appears influenced by European workshops, and the brooch lacks the post-Insular motifs seen in the Lochbuie Brooch, and other late medieval West Highland objects in various media. The use of [...] "turrets" [...] as decoration was popular in late medieval jewellery, but usually in far less elaborate forms, with brooches having a number of small projecting turrets around a ring forming the brooch.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the outcomes of}} the research aimed at the verification of the computational model simulating a reinforced concrete beam employing spar and 3 D finite elements, with account taken of physical nonlinearity. Structural calculations involved in R&D and design effort must factor in non-linear structural behavior both of the material and of structural elements. In particular, this is valid {{for the analysis of}} special types of impact (seismic, accidental etc.). However, design models under development may incorporate significantly varying models of nonlinear materials as well as different kinds of finite elements, and both have to be verified. This article considers two models of a <b>hinged</b> (<b>pinned)</b> beam. In the first case, the modeling was based on 3 D elements for concrete and on spar elements for reinforcement using Euler-Lagrange coupling of finite elements belonging to concrete and reinforcement (three-dimensional model). The second case the simulation based on spar finite elements (spar model). Both the spar model and 3 D model allow for non-linear nature of concrete and reinforcement. In case of concrete the material was set using the Continuous Surface Cap Model, while the reinforcement was modeled involving a bilinear diagram of material behavior...|$|R
50|$|Lubrication fixes this. Suitable {{lubricants}} include plumber's {{grease and}} silicone spray. Oil {{is not so}} suitable as it can drip off when in excess. Graphite is also unsuitable as it spreads to other surfaces and makes a mess. To give complete coverage of lubricant, the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is removed to be covered in the lubricant, and then reinserted. Oiling a squeaky hinge is considered a masculine behaviour.|$|E
50|$|On July 7, 1980, after Shiue {{left for}} work, Mary Stauffer managed {{to remove the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> from the locked closet door. Despite being chained to each other, Mary and Elizabeth were able to reach {{the phone in the}} kitchen and call law enforcement. After making the call, they hid behind the car at Shiue's {{residence}} until police arrived. Both were immediately freed after seven weeks of imprisonment.|$|E
50|$|The {{receiver}} on a Contender, whether G1 or G2, is {{the portion}} of the combined grip/buttstock assembly containing the trigger mechanism, and this is legally considered the serial-numbered gun. Hence, barrels with iron sights, barrels with telescopic sights, and even the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin,</b> are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.|$|E
40|$|Timoshenko beam {{equations}} {{with external}} damping and internal damping terms and forcing terms are investigated, and boundary conditions (end conditions) {{to be considered}} are <b>hinged</b> ends (<b>pinned</b> ends), hinged-sliding ends, and sliding ends. Unboundedness of solutions of boundary value problems for Timoshenko beam equations is studied, and it is shown that {{the magnitude of the}} displacement of the beam grows up to ∞ as under some assumptions on the forcing term. Our approach is to reduce the multidimensional problems to one-dimensional problems for fourth-order ordinary differential inequalities...|$|R
50|$|In a tilting {{block or}} {{pivoting}} block action, the breechblock is <b>hinged</b> on a <b>pin</b> mounted at the rear. When the lever is operated, the block tilts down and forward, exposing the chamber. The best-known pivoting block designs are the Peabody, the Peabody-Martini, and Ballard actions.|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrical}} cubicle manufacture, a pintle hinge is a hinge with {{fixed and}} moving parts. The <b>hinge</b> has a <b>pin</b> [...] "pintle" [...] {{and can be}} both external and internal. The most common type consists of 3 parts. One part {{on the body of}} the cubicle, one part on the door and the third part is the pintle.|$|R
50|$|A {{substantial}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{joins the}} {{two parts of the}} rifle or shotgun; the stock with its firing mechanism and the fore-piece and barrel, which hold the round to be fired. In some cases the hinging pin may be easily removable, allowing the two portions of the weapon to be compactly and safely stored. In other cases the hinge will consist of a hook over a pin; releasing an auxiliary latch will allow sufficient travel to allow the hinge to be unhooked.|$|E
50|$|In door hinges, {{bearings}} sit {{between the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> and housing to ensure smooth {{movement of the}} door when it is opened and closed by passengers. Composite bearings are used {{in a number of}} automotive hinge systems due to their durability under high loads and corrosion resistance. Bearings also play a role in obtaining a quality paint finish on the car. Composite bearings’ PTFE compound liners are conductive and can transfer electricity to the hinges to facilitate the electrostatic painting process.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{the design}} is simple and {{effective}} with some clever touches; for example the bolt guide rod assembly guides the bolt in the receiver, retains the recoil springs and the rear end of the top handguard, as well as serving as the latch holding {{the upper and lower}} receivers together in the closed position. Disassembly is somewhat similar to the AR-15, with the working parts accessed by the rifle pivoting open on a <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> immediately forward of the magazine well.|$|E
