5|$|Thomas Davis GAA club instituted {{judicial}} review proceedings in the High Court in May 2006. Their main argument was that {{the decision of the}} council on 13 February 2006 to revert to the original plans for the stadium, which did not include a senior GAA pitch, was unlawful. Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that 'the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football' and that a soccer-only ground would place the 'applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club, the sport and the GAA culture. The stadium, however, with the original design, could accommodate junior GAA games as the pitch used at this level <b>fits</b> <b>within</b> the stadium's dimensions. It was only senior GAA games {{that would not have been}} facilitated.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer <b>fits</b> <b>within</b> the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{scholarly}} {{consensus is}} that {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth rests on a very slim historical foundation. However, some writers take it as significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, although the details of each vary. In this view, the virgin conception and birth constitute a tradition that <b>fits</b> <b>within</b> the criterion of multiple attestation, because the accounts of Matthew and Luke are taken as two independent testimonies of the tradition.|$|E
25|$|Biblical {{scholars}} such as Michael Licona or Ray Van Neste who ascribe {{the books}} to Paul find their placement <b>fits</b> <b>within</b> his life and work and see the linguistic differences as complementary to differences in the recipients. Other Pauline epistles have fledgling congregations as the audience, the pastoral epistles are directed to Paul's close companions, evangelists whom he has extensively worked with and trained. In this view, linguistic differences are to be expected, if one is to assert Pauline authorship to them. Johnson asserts the impossibility of demonstrating {{the authenticity of the}} Pastoral Letters.|$|E

25|$|The Germania (Latin title: De Origine et situ Germanorum) is an ethnographic {{work on the}} Germanic tribes {{outside the}} Roman Empire. The Germania <b>fits</b> <b>within</b> a {{classical}} ethnographic tradition which includes authors such as Herodotus and Julius Caesar. The book begins (chapters 127) {{with a description of}} the lands, laws, and customs of the various tribes. Later chapters focus on descriptions of particular tribes, beginning with those who lived closest to the Roman empire, and ending with a description of those who lived on the shores of the Baltic Sea, such as the Fenni. Tacitus had written a similar, albeit shorter, piece in his Agricola (chapters 1013).|$|E
25|$|Juvenal wrote {{at least}} 16 poems in the verse form dactylic hexameter. These poems cover {{a range of}} Roman topics.

The Satires are a vital source {{for the study of}} ancient Rome from a number of perspectives, although their comic mode of expression makes it problematic to accept the content as strictly factual. At first glance the Satires could be read as a critique of pagan Rome. That critique may have ensured their survival in the Christian monastic scriptoria although the majority of ancient texts did not survive.|$|E

The poem was also used in the advertisements for Gap on NBC. Upon viewing them, Madonna contacted Blagg for obtaining permission to use the poem in her new musical material. While composing her 1998 album Ray of Light, Madonna and Blagg reached a deal which would allow the singer to include excerpts of What <b>Fits?</b> <b>within</b> her song [...] "Sky Fits Heaven"; in exchange, Blagg would receive no credit.

[...] Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the Marvel-Netflix shows) or on just being [...] "support and tie-in {{to the world of the}} Avengers". Grauso concluded, [...] "The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world." ...|$|E
