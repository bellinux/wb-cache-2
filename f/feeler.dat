In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), <b>feeler</b> fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Meskó earned Northeast Ohio Inland All-District Division II {{football}} team honorable mention recognition {{from the media}} while performing as a punter and placekicker for Twinsburg High School. [...] He was also selected as Western Reserve North Division First-team by the coaches {{as well as the}} All-Summit County Team kicker. [...] The Plain Dealer listed him as their first team kicker. [...] During the year, he was 10 for 14 on field goals, while only missing one point after touchdown attempt and averaging 36yards per punt. [...] He placed 80% of his kickoffs in the end zone and maintained a 4.0 grade point average. [...] During the season, he made a 41-yard field goal and a game-winning 31-yard field goal. [...] By the end of the season, he had started 31 consecutive games. [...] Twinsburg qualified for the state playoffs {{for the first time in}} ten years thanks in part to a solid kicking game. During his junior year, he got his first recruiting <b>feeler</b> from Division III Mount Union College.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy re-entered Harvard in {{the summer}} of 1953 and {{improved}} his study habits. His brother John was a U.S. Senator and the family was attracting more public attention. Ted joined The Owl final club in 1954 and was also chosen for the Hasty Pudding Club and the Pi Eta fraternity. Kennedy was on athletic probation during his sophomore year, and he returned as a second-string two-way end for the Crimson football team during his junior year and barely missed earning his varsity letter. Nevertheless, he received a recruiting <b>feeler</b> from Green Bay Packers head coach Lisle Blackbourn, who asked him about his interest in playing professional football. Kennedy demurred, saying he had plans to attend law school and to [...] "go into another contact sport, politics." [...] Kennedy became a starter at end for Harvard in his senior season in 1955, and worked hard to improve his blocking and tackling to complement his , [...] size. In the season-ending Harvard-Yale game in the snow at the Yale Bowl on November 19 (which Yale won 21–7), Kennedy caught a pass to score Harvard's only touchdown; the team finished the season with a 3–4–1 record. Academically, Kennedy received mediocre grades for his first three years, improved to a B average for his senior year, and finished barely in the top half of his class. Kennedy graduated from Harvard at age 24 in 1956 with an AB in history and government.|$|E

He thought very highly of the capabilities of the country, and hinted that his chief object in acquiring power here would be to promote the return" ...|$|E
