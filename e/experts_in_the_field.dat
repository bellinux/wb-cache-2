5|$|Scientists and U.S. {{courts have}} {{rejected}} this objection {{on the grounds}} that science is not based on appeals to popularity, but on evidence. The scientific consensus of biologists determines what is considered acceptable science, not popular opinion or fairness, and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Fresnel's {{hypothesis}} was empirically successful in explaining Fizeau's results, many leading <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> including Fizeau himself (1851), Éleuthère Mascart (1872), Ketteler (1873), Veltmann (1873), and Lorentz (1886) were united in considering Fresnel's partial aether-dragging hypothesis {{to be on}} shaky theoretical grounds. For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E

5|$|The {{program was}} {{initially}} proposed in 1964. The first version {{was produced by}} William Peters, with production supervised by executive producer Fred W. Friendly. Upon accepting the assignment, Peters began his research by reading books and consulting with <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Peters suggested that the program focus exclusively on gay men and that he cover lesbians in a second program, and Friendly agreed. Principal filming took place starting {{in the fall of}} 1964 and continued through early 1965. Peters interviewed men in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Charlotte and New York City, accumulating 30 hours of footage.|$|E
5|$|A global {{strategy}} {{to stem the}} crisis was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.|$|E
5|$|Civil and {{criminal}} cases commenced after its completion, as was intended. In an uncommon case, heard at the Castellania in 1774, was when an intersex person, 17-year-old Rosa Mifsud from Luqa, petitioned for a sex change by wearing as a man, {{instead of the}} female clothing worn ever since born. Two medical experts were appointed by the court to perform an examination. This case gives detail {{of the use of}} <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> similar to the late modern period. The examiners were the Physician-in-Chief (during the British period was replaced by the Chief Government Medical Officer) and a senior surgeon, both working at the Sacra Infermeria. The Grandmaster took the decision for Mifsud to wear only men clothes from then on. The decision was taken to the court of appeals, which appointed other seven medical experts that agreed with the observations of the previous two experts.|$|E

5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by <b>experts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
