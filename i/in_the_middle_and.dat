5|$|In Hindu philosophy, yoga is {{the name}} of one of the six {{orthodox}} (which accept the testimony of Vedas) philosophical schools.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> <b>and</b> not to Michelangelo’s liking, {{stood the}} {{original}} equestrian {{statue of the}} emperor Marcus Aurelius. Michelangelo provided an unassuming pedestal for it. The sculpture was held in regard because it was thought to depict Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Emperor. The bronze now in position is a modern copy; the original is in the Palazzo dei Conservatori nearby.|$|E

5|$|M3 is a small, {{triangular}} tooth. There {{is large}} basin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> <b>and</b> a mesoloph is present. At {{the back of}} the tooth, there is a distinct posteroloph. In A.donovani, there are two roots at the front (labial and lingual) and one at the back. There are no M3 of A.praeuniversitatis with preserved roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are {{somewhat}} oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle),</b> <b>and</b> measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} faces of the tubes) are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} known from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, southeastern Mexico, and western Panama. It lives in humid {{evergreen}} forests that are sometimes interspersed with pine trees. It {{can be found}} at the edges of these forests typically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> higher levels within these trees. It is also normally found only where cloud forest is uninterrupted.|$|E

5|$|Among the Eolambia {{specimens}} {{found to}} date, the best-preserved sacrum includes seven vertebrae. Given that this individual is immature, and hadrosaurs increase their sacral vertebra count with age, adults {{may have had}} more sacrals. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are amphicoelous, having both {{the front and back}} ends being concave. They have pedestal-like prezygapophyses and tab-like postzygapophyses, the latter of which are separated by a depression. The prezygapophyses lengthen to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (concave in front and convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well.|$|E
5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that the system would have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> <b>and</b> they could not imagine a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hinde opposed slavery. Although their parents owned slaves, {{he and his}} {{siblings}} repudiated slavery on religious grounds. Hinde's opposition increased and eventually he and other friends became outspoken critics of the institution in Kentucky, where slavery was commonplace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> western parts of the state. In the Great Awakening, Methodists were prominent among those who opposed slavery, although they also converted slaves and welcomed them into congregations. In Kentucky Hinde joined other Methodist ministers in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> <b>and</b> develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream. Its {{watershed}} {{is relatively}} narrow. In {{the upper reaches}} of the creek's watershed, residential areas are sparse and tend to be somewhat removed from the creek itself. In Blakely, it follows Pennsylvania Route 347 closely and crosses it several times. A gas line crosses the creek upstream of US Route 6. There are several patches of wetlands in the watershed's upper reaches, and two more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> lower reaches. Upstream of Blakely, the watershed contains forested land and pastures on a rolling plateau.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} plants are found {{throughout}} {{the middle and upper}} basin, including California poppy, white alder, Oregon ash, oak, poison oak, bigleaf maple, Indian rhubarb, buttonbush, willow, whiteleaf manzanita, and historically, sugar pine, before heavy logging in the late 19th century. Squirrels, raccoon, jackrabbits, bats, skunks, beavers, mule deer, coyote, bobcat and black bear are among the mammal species found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> upper watershed.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September 1777, in Stillwater, New York, Hamilton {{commanded}} 1,100 men of {{the centre}} column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd Regiments of Foot, which attacked the heights at the Battle of Freeman's Farm. His column was arrayed with the 21st on the right, the 20th on the left, the 62nd <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> <b>and</b> the 9th in reserve. To his left, Friedrich Adolf Riedesel commanded the 47th Regiment of Foot and some German troops. To Hamilton's right, Simon Fraser commanded the 24th Regiment of Foot along with light infantry and grenadiers. Even though Hamilton was considered the commander, Burgoyne led the attack.|$|E
5|$|On special occasions, such as Uposatha day, {{an orange}} stole is placed around its {{shoulders}} by the presiding monk and is fanned. A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals; some men {{sit in the}} front enclosure while others including women and children sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> rear end of the foyer. Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed. During the winter season, the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order.|$|E

5|$|Special state service flags {{are used}} by state-employed civil {{special-purpose}} ships while on duty. These flags all follow the same basic design; a white flag with a horizontal stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is emblazoned with the national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> does not touch the anchor or the arms.

5|$|Tangascootack Creek is {{considered}} to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, though <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> upper parts of the creek, there is virtually no life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these locations are upstream of the strip mines and acid mine drainage. The main species of fish in the creek are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live in the creek.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Maha Monthien (พระมหามณเฑียร) {{group of}} {{buildings}} are located roughly at {{the centre of the}} Middle Court, therefore {{at the very heart of}} the Grand Palace itself. The traditional Thai style building group is enclosed by a low wall, as this was once the residential and sleeping abode of kings. Thus it is considered the most important set of throne halls in the entire Grand Palace. All of the buildings within the Maha Monthien face north and are arranged from front to back with the public reception hall being at the front, ceremonial halls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>and</b> residential halls at the back, all of them inter-connected to each other.|$|E
