40|$|The paper {{studies the}} effect of <b>edge</b> <b>stitching</b> on tensile static and fatigue {{properties}} of graphite fiber reinforced laminates. The influence of Kevlar stitchings on edge delaminations, ultimate tensile strength and tension-tension fatigue life were examined on laminates of two stacking sequences ([± 45 / 0 / 90]s and [± 30 / 90]s), as representative of two classes of fiber-dominated and matrix-dominated laminates. Through-thickness stitching offered a significant improvement in the static delamination resistance of laminated composites, but had varying effects on the ultimate tensile stress of the laminates under study, {{with an increase in}} strength of [± 30 / 90]s laminates and a decrease in strength of [± 45 / 0 / 90]s laminates. Similarly the fatigue life of matrix dominated [± 30 / 90]s specimens was considerably extended by stitching, while the fatigue resistance of fiber-dominated [± 45 / 0 / 90]s specimens was reduced, particularly at high fatigue stresses. Stitching appeared very efficient in arresting delamination in [± 30 / 90]s specimens for both static and fatigue loads, but did not prove to be as efficient in stopping fatigue delaminations in [± 45 / 0 / 90]s specimens, since Kevlar threads were found to be prone to breakage under cyclic loading. As a conclusion, while the static delamination resistance of laminated composites is improved by stitching, this does not automatically result in better fatigue performance for all lamination sequences...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} {{faced by}} structural designers {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult as the imposed design criteria of energy absorbing structures requires weight reduction of structures without compromising cost and crushing performance. The current research is thus aimed at investigating the energy absorption of fibre reinforced composites measured {{as a function of}} geometry and scale within weight-critical structures. At the first stage, an innovative structure composed of four intersecting composite plates was tested. It was found that the structural stability {{played a crucial role in}} this intersecting structure. In order to avoid generating buckling failure before turning to a progressive crushing regime, Finite Element Method (FEM) was used on composite structures as a technical tool. At the second stage, three geometric structures containing corrugated composite laminates and possessing better structural stability were designed and examined. To increase the interlaminar fracture toughness properties of composite materials, through-thickness stitching methods were introduced. Fracture toughness (Mode-I and Mode-II) and flexure tests were performed on composite materials for comparing the effectiveness of different crushing mechanisms. Fracture toughness results presented a significant improvement of using stitching methods on Mode-I properties, while slight reduction on Mode-II properties was also detected. They also indicated the flexural properties of structural composites can significantly affect their energy absorption capabilities. At the final stage, six different factors including resin type, fibre architecture, crushing speed and stitching parameters were scaled in several levels in a modified geometric structure. An optimization approach based on Taguchi methods was utilised in order to statistically determine the relationship and assist in evaluating the contribution of each factor on crushing properties. It showed that by selecting the combinations of these factors with correct levels, the energy absorbed can be improved remarkably. It found that the crushing performance of this structural composite was mainly dominated by resin and fibre architecture, which contributed 71 % capability of energy absorption. The other 29 % capability was dominated by trigger, beam web length, <b>edge</b> <b>stitching</b> density and the crushing speed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} stitching together plywood panels {{with some sort}} of wire or other suitable device, such as cable ties or duct tape and staples. All these methods of stitching or suturing the plywood panels of the hull are simple methods of clamping the hull parts together before they are permanently welded or fused by epoxy and fiberglass tape joints. Once the epoxy sets solid in most cases the stitches or other clamping structures are removed leaving only the fused plywood panels behind. Copper wire is popular because the wires can be twisted tighter or looser to precisely adjust fit, and because it is easy to sand after gluing, and it is suitable in a marine environment if left in place, but mild steel electric fencing wire can be used just as easily and then can be removed completely from the hull structure. To join, the cut panels are drilled with small holes along the joining <b>edges</b> and <b>stitched.</b> Once together, the joint is glued, usually with thickened epoxy and fiberglass {{on the inside of the}} hull.|$|R

40|$|Standard {{subdivision}} rules, such as Catmull-Clark and Loop {{allow the}} creation of smooth surfaces with C 2 continuity over almost the whole domain except at extraordinary vertices. Normally, the subdivision schemes are limited to one mesh and need special rules for handling {{the boundaries of the}} domain. This issue leads to complications in straightforward approaches to compose objects out of multiple joined meshes. We propose a new method for stitching control meshes at common faces. The new approach uses the stitching information to smoothly subdivide the meshes across the <b>stitching</b> <b>edges,</b> while maintaining the meshes as separate units in memory. This makes it possible to compose large, complex geometries using simple components, without the necessity to subdivide the complete mesh down to the same detail level...|$|R
