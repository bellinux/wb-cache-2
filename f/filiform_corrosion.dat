40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The rate of {{interaction}} {{of carbon dioxide}} with eight detached organic films commonly used as coatings for metal surfaces was examined. The films studied were lacquers of several different formulations including oleoresinous, phenolic, vinyl, alkyd, epoxy, and hydrocarbon types. The sorption was measured on a McBain type gravimetric adsorption balance fitted with quartz helixes with an extension sensitivity of about one mm. /mg. Rates of sorption were measured at three temperatures, - 45. 3 ° C., - 63. 5 ° C. and - 76. 5 ° C., and at three pressures at each temperature, 461. 0 torr, 326. 5 torr and 117. 5 torr. Theoretical examination of the data lead {{to the conclusion that}} the rate controlling mechanism was a diffusion process. Sorption coefficients were calculated from the kinetic data and limiting diffusion coefficients determined by extrapolation to zero CO₂ activity. Values on the order of 10 ⁻¹² cm. ²/sec. were obtained. From these were calculated activation energies for the diffusion process, which were compared to the calculated isosteric heats of sorption. Oxygen sorption isotherms were attempted and no oxygen uptake was detected. A few water vapor rate experiments were performed for comparison with the CO₂ results. The rate of water vapor interaction was found to be two to three orders of magnitude faster than that for CO₂. The eight films studied have been rated as to their relative resistance to <b>filiform</b> <b>corrosion</b> growth. This relative resistance to <b>filiform</b> <b>corrosion</b> was compared with the relative diffusion rate of CO₂.

It is shown that simply abrading with 180 grit SiC produces a surface potential up to 0. 5 V lower than the bulk. When the abraded sample is overcoated with a 30 micron layer of PVB (polyvinyl butyral) and exposed to HCl a fast, superficial <b>filiform</b> <b>corrosion</b> (FFC) is observed in which metal loss is limited to the thickness of the surface layer.

Immersion tests were performed in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution at 37. The bending strength of the samples was determined using the four-point bending test according to ISO 9585 : 1990. The initial strength of the noncorroded ZEK 100 plate was 11 % greater than that of the MgCa 0. 8 plate; both were approximately 65 % weaker than a titanium plate. The bending strength was determined after 48 and 96 h of immersion in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution; both magnesium alloys decreased by approximately 7 % after immersion for 96 h.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} for <b>filiform</b> <b>corrosion</b> (FFC) {{is thought to}} involve oxygen diffusion through the tail to the active head. The primary cathodic region is near {{the back of the}} head (at the head/tail boundary), where oxygen concentration is higher, and the primary anodic region is at the front edge of the head of the filament. Although there is experimental support for this mechanism, a high-resolution description of the FFC process has not been presented. The aim of this study was to provide detailed information about the mechanism of FFC on coated steel using the high spatial resolution of scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy. Segments of active filaments were successfully investigated through 150 and 300 nm thin epoxy coatings in air of 93 % relative humidity. Volta potential and topographic maps showed separation of active anodes and cathodes in the head and revealed the presence of voids associated with delamination of the coating along the edge of the tail. The morphology of filaments and Volta potential distributions were strongly dependent on the film thickness. Differences in growth characteristics were explained by mass transport considerations. <b>Filiform</b> <b>corrosion</b> (FFC) affects many metals underneath organic, inorganic, or metallic coatings and results in networks of thread-like corrosion products propagating across the metal surface.

The corrosion protective efficiency of these coatings was investigated on aluminium alloys Al 6013 -T 6 and AlCu 4 MgSi by salt spray test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), both on coatings with an artificial damage. Here, the pure coating matrix showed first corrosion attack by <b>filiform</b> <b>corrosion</b> and pitting after 10 days on Al 6013, and after 2 days on AlCu 4 MgSi.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} andphysics {{involved at}} the metal/atmosphereinterface is interesting both from a fundamental and an appliedperspective. Since iron {{is the most}} important of all metalsthis interface is of particular interest. The objective withthis thesis is to obtain new information on a molecular levelof the iron/atmosphere interface with a special emphasis on theinitial atmospheric corrosion. The work presented herein combines a large variety ofdifferent analytical surface science techniques. Both ultrahigh vacuum and ambient pressure investigations were conductedwith single crystals as well as polycrystalline samples. The interaction of segregated sulfur with a Fe(110) surfacewas investigated by means of atomically resolved scanningtunneling microscopy (STM). A large variety of high and lowcoverage reconstructions were reported. Comparable studies ofoxygen adsorption on the same surface were also completed. Similar to the sulfur experiments, oxygen induced a number oflow coverage reconstructions. At higher coverage, oxideformation was observed and ordered oxides could be fabricatedat elevated temperatures. The oxygen interaction with Fe(110) and Fe(100) surfaces wasalso investigated with synchrotron radiation basedphotoelectron spectroscopy. Detailed information of the initialadsorption and subsequent oxidation was obtained. The Fe 2 pcore level of the clean Fe(110) surface was subject to furtherinvestigations because of its complicated line profile that wasinterpreted as an exchange split of the final state. Iron exposed to humidified air with low concentrations ofsulfur dioxide (SO 2) shows a surprisingly passive behavior. Themeasured mass gain was significantly lower than that of acopper sample exposed in the same environment. In-situtechniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), quartzcrystal microbalance (QCM) and infrared reflection absorptionspectroscopy (IRAS) showed little or no corrosion. Initiationof corrosion was observed upon introduction of additionaloxidants. The conclusion drawn challenge the established modelfor formation and growth of sulfate nests. The condition andformation of sulfate nests are discussed in view of thegenerated in-situ observations. During further experiments, iron was exposed to humid airand sodium chloride aerosols. The surface was investigated within-situ techniques, which provided new useful information. Ahigh corrosion rate was observed and the corrosion attacks formfilaments characteristic of <b>filiform</b> <b>corrosion.</b> A schematicmodel for propagation of the corrosion filaments wasproposed. <b>Filiform</b> <b>corrosion</b> was observed on aluminum surfaces aswell. The corroded surfaces were investigated with synchrotronradiation based photoelectron microscopy and scanning over afiliform head revealed different oxidation states within the Al 2 p spectrum. The microscopy data was interpreted as anenrichment of aluminum chloride containing compounds within thefiliform corrosion head. NR 2014080...|$|E
