The magazine also felt that while the collecting of supplies added strategy to the action, the limited amount restricted the paths the player might take through the level. Another critic said the [...] "real-time, living battlefield enhances the urgency of the missions and the player's involvement" [...] and also noted [...] "practically no load time." [...] GameFan complained of a high difficulty and a steep curve, long levels which return the player to the beginning should he die, infrequent opportunities to repair armour and the enemies' tendency to attack the player from beyond his limited viewpoint, and was thankful for the Saturn version's optional easier difficulty setting. Next Generation also criticised the player's restricted view, calling it the game's [...] "worst problem". One reviewer said revisiting levels to discover missed set pieces aided the game's longevity; Sega Saturn Magazine had [...] "some reservations" [...] about the game's replay-value, with only 5 missions, but said it was [...] "very playable and enjoyable", while another reviewer called it [...] "a load of fun". Gerstmann criticised the poor scrolling, erratic motion and imprecise control, Great Drakon praised the controls, while GameFan noted they had improved in the Saturn version. The reviewer also enjoyed this version's new weaponry. Another reviewer pointed to some [...] "minor flaws", saying the HUD [...] "smacks of 16-bit era graphics"; The game impressed Great Drakons reviewer, who praised the attention to detail and the reviewer found the story convincing.
