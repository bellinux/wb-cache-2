50|$|From about 1985, {{like many}} other banks, Takugin opened {{branches}} in Tokyo and Osaka, and became concerned with real estate. In ordinary banking activity,finance is not provided above the 70% of real estate value, {{but at the time}} of the bubble it was foreseen that land values would rise steeply, so real estate financing was offered at 120-130% of value. Many credit facilities at this time were taking a similar <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> but Takugin had been somewhat slow off the mark. It therefore had to set collateral at a lower precedence than the collateral which had been already given to other credit providers. This meant that the part of the loan repayable to Takugin would be less if the borrowing real estate company were to go bankrupt. Ultimately, this is exactly what was to happen.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the pioneers}} of Islamic banking, Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui, {{suggested}} a two-tier mudarabah model {{as the basis of}} a riba-free banking. The bank would act as the capital partner in mudarabah accounts with the depositor {{on one side and the}} entrepreneur on the other side. (Another pioneer Taqi Uthmani called mudarabah and another profit-sharing <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> musharakah, the [...] "real and ideal instruments of financing in Shari‘ah".) This model would be supplemented by a number of fixed-return models—mark-up (murabaha), leasing (ijara), cash advances for the purchase of agricultural produce (salam) and cash advances for the manufacture of assets (istisna`), etc. In practice, the fixed-return models, in particular murabaha model, became the industry staples, not supplements, as they bear results most similar to the interest-based finance models. Assets managed under these products far exceed those in [...] "profit-loss-sharing modes" [...] such as mudarabah and musharakah.|$|E

50|$|Heller was {{a pioneer}} {{of the use of}} {{factoring}} and developed it into a more sophisticated <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> of company business accounts receivable, thus providing capital for businesses to grow by giving them cash to expand the business cycle by purchasing an account receivable at a discount, with or without recourse to the seller. Then, by owning it, he would collect the balance of the receivable in full. The profit was derived by the amount of discount collected by the factor. As the factoring business expanded, it was done in bulk with contractually obligated clients selling their receivables by assignment to the factoring company. Advances against these receivables purchased were made and the client paid a fee to the factor. As American businesses became more sophisticated and manufacturing became more prominent after World War II, certain industries primary used factoring as a form of business finance and credit insurance on the credit risk of its customers. These industries were primarily involved with the manufacturing of textiles and carpeting, although other businesses used this type of financing model for their own credit needs. Capital for businesses was not then available from banks because the banks felt business loans were too risky.|$|E

40|$|Financing {{from family}} and friends is the {{predominant}} type of informal finance. This paper proposes a theory that reconciles two seemingly paradoxical traits of this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> namely, it is often provided at negative prices but nevertheless eschewed by borrowers. A central prediction is that such finance, while breeding trust, deters risk taking. Demand is thus constrained: entrepreneurs may forgo risky investment rather than finance it through family and friends. Formal finance is valuable precisely because it is regulated only by contract. The highlighted trade-offs between formal and informal finance are potentially relevant for the provision of microventure capital. ...|$|E
