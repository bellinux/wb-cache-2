Protocols utilizing multiple trophic and <b>glial</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> have been established to induce glial-like differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). However, the reported transition of BMSCs to Schwann cell-like cells was reversible, suggesting against a complete differentiation process. In recapitulation of embryonic events leading to Schwann cell determination, commitment of Schwann cell-like cells into mature Schwann cells can be achieved when they receive necessary signals from neurons of developing dorsal root ganglia. In this study, we mimic the course of Schwann cell development and established a new protocol to fulfill a cell-intrinsic switch of human BMSCs to a Schwann cell fate. As shown by our results, derivatives of human BMSCs underwent the commitment to mature Schwann cells even when all exogenous differentiation-inducing cues are not presented in cultures. First, the derived cells acquired a Schwann cell phenotype indicated by bipolar morphology and expression of Schwann cell markers. Second, these cells maintained myelination capacities, shown by forming basic myelin protein-positive segments along axons of sensory neurons. Third, the gene expression profiles of the derived cells and human Schwann cell line are similar, demonstrated by a high correlation of the two populations.

Such factors may act simply as selective mitogens or survival factors for cells that undergo lineage restrictions stochastically. Alternatively, they may instruct or bias multipotent cells to choose one lineage at the expense of others. Here we show that <b>glial</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (GGF), previously defined as a Schwann cell mitogen, strongly suppresses neuronal differentiation of rat neural crest stem cells while promoting or allowing glial differentiation. Quantitative clonal analysis suggests that the action of GGF is likely to be instructive rather than selective. Taken together with the expression pattern of GGF, these data suggest a lateral signaling model for the diversification of cell types within developing peripheral ganglia...|$|E
40|$|In this report, we have {{investigated}} the signaling pathways that are activated by, and mediate the effects of, the neuregulins and axonal contact in Schwann cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK kinase) are strongly activated in Schwann cells by <b>glial</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (GGF), a soluble neuregulin, and by contact with neurite membranes; both kinase activities are also detected in Schwann cell-DRG neuron cocultures. Inhibition of the PI 3 -kinase, but not the MAP kinase, pathway reversibly inhibited Schwann cell proliferation induced by GGF and neurites. Cultured Schwann cells undergo apoptosis after serum deprivation and can be rescued by GGF or contact with neurites; these survival effects were also blocked by inhibition of PI 3 -kinase. Finally, we have examined the role of these signaling pathways in Schwann cell differentiation in cocultures. At early stages o...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method for genetically modifying Schwann cells (SCs) in vitro and then assessed whether these SCs could interact normally with axons in vivo. Rat SCs were transduced in vitro with the lacZ gene by using a retroviral vector and then expanded with the SC mitogens forskolin and <b>glial</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor.</b> These mitogen-expanded SCs had an abnormal phenotype as compared to both SCs in vivo and primary SCs in vitro, yet when they were introduced into a regenerating rat sciatic nerve, they formed morphologically normal myelin sheaths around the axons. These results demonstrate that SCs can be genetically altered, their numbers expanded in culture, and yet respond appropriately to axonal signals in the peripheral nervous system. This approach offers a plausible way to manipulate genes involved in axon-SC interactions, including genes that may be defective in some inherited peripheral neuropathies...|$|E
40|$|The vgf gene (non-acronymic) is induced in vivo by neurotrophins {{including}} Nerve <b>Growth</b> <b>Factor</b> (NGF), Brain Derived <b>Growth</b> <b>Factor</b> (BDNF) and <b>Glial</b> Derived <b>Growth</b> <b>Factor</b> (GDNF), by synaptic {{activity and}} by homeostatic and other stimuli. Post-translational processing {{of a single}} VGF precursor gives raise to a varied multiplicity of neuro-endocrine peptides, {{some of which are}} secreted upon stimulation both in vitro and in vivo. Several VGF peptides, accounting for ∼ 20 % of the VGF precursor sequence, have shown biological roles including regulation of food intake, energy balance, reproductive and homeostatic mechanisms, synaptic strengthening, long-term potentiation (LTP) and anti-depressant activity. From a further ∼ 50 % of VGF derive multiple "fragments", largely identified in the human cerebro-spinal fluid by proteomic studies searching for disease biomarkers. These represent an important starting point for discovery of further VGF products relevant to neuronal brain functions, as well as to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disease conditions. A distinct feature of VGF peptides is their cell type specific diversity in all neuroendocrine organs studied so far. Selective differential profiles are found across the cell populations of pituitary, adrenal medulla and pancreatic islets, and in gastric neuroendocrine as well as some further mucosal cells, and are yet to be investigated in neuronal systems. At the same time, specific VGF peptide/s undergo selective modulation in response to organ or cell population relevant stimuli. Such pattern argues for a multiplicity of roles for VGF peptides, including endocrine functions, local intercellular communication, as well as the possible mediation of intracellular mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Axonal {{injury in}} the adult human central nervous system often results in loss of {{sensation}} and motor functions. Promoting regeneration of severed axons requires the inactivation of growth inhibitory influences from the tissue environment and stimulation of the neuron intrinsic <b>growth</b> potential. Especially <b>glial</b> cell derived factors, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, Nogo-A, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and myelin in general, prevent axon regeneration. Most of the <b>glial</b> <b>growth</b> inhibiting <b>factors</b> converge onto the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway in neurons. Although conditions in the injured nervous system are clearly different from those during neurite outgrowth in vitro, here we use a chemical approach to manipulate Rho/ROCK signalling with small-molecule agents to encourage neurite outgrowth in cell culture. The development of therapeutic treatments requires drug testing not only on neurons of experimental animals, but also on human neurons. Using human NT 2 model neurons, we demonstrate that the pain reliever Ibuprofen decreases RhoA (Ras homolog gene family, member A GTPase) activation and promotes neurite growth. Inhibition of the downstream effector Rho kinase by the drug Y- 27632 results in a strong increase in neurite outgrowth. Conversely, activation of the Rho pathway by lysophosphatidic acid results in growth cone collapse and eventually to neurite retraction. Finally, we show that blocking of Rho kinase, but not RhoA results {{in an increase in}} neurons bearing neurites. Due to its anti-inflammatory and neurite growth promoting action, the use of a pharmacological treatment of damaged neural tissue with Ibuprofen should be explored...|$|R
