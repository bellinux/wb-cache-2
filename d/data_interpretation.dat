25|$|The {{majority}} of issues with tissue residue {{arise in the}} interpretation of tissue residue <b>data.</b> <b>Interpretation</b> complication can be caused by choice of endpoints, species choice, life stage sensitivity, data quality, and toxicity data extrapolation. Choice of tissue for tissue residue analysis can also be difficult and has an effect on tissue residue data. When choosing tissue, a scientist needs to consider: mode and mechanism of action of chemical being tested, site of toxic action for the chemical and species combination being studied and strength of the tissue residue-response relationship. There is also a lack of reliable tissue residue relationships available for comparison.|$|E
25|$|Off-targeting {{is another}} {{challenge}} {{to the use of}} siRNAs as a gene knockdown tool. Here, genes with incomplete complementarity are inadvertently downregulated by the siRNA (in effect, the siRNA acts as a miRNA), leading to problems in <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> and potential toxicity. This, however, can be partly addressed by designing appropriate control experiments, and siRNA design algorithms are currently being developed to produce siRNAs free from off-targeting. Genome-wide expression analysis, e.g., by microarray technology, can then be used to verify this and further refine the algorithms. A 2006 paper from the laboratory of Dr. Khvorova implicates 6- or 7-basepair-long stretches from position 2 onward in the siRNA matching with 3'UTR regions in off-targeted genes.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD, and satellite images, do not detect tornadoes or hail, only indications that the storm has the potential. Radar and satellite <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> will usually give a warning before there is any visual evidence of such events, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine it is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what these remote sensing devices cannot is especially important as distance from a radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, due to curvature of Earth {{and the spread of}} the beam with distance. Therefore, when far from a radar, only precipitations and velocities high in the storm are observed. The important areas might not then be sampled or the resolution of the data might be poor. Also, some meteorological situations leading to tornadogenesis are not readily detectable by radar and on occasion tornado development may occur more quickly than radar can complete a scan and send the batch of data.|$|E
