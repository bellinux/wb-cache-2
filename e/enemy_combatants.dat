5|$|On October 17, 2006, Bush {{signed into}} law the Military Commissions Act of 2006, a law enacted {{in the wake of}} the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, , which allows the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful <b>enemy</b> <b>combatants</b> by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees, but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.|$|E
50|$|Other scholars, however, {{believe the}} Supreme Court imprudently {{enhanced}} the Executive's power. The Supreme Court allowed the Executive to unilaterally determine that Hamdi was an <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant.</b> Further, the Supreme Court {{determined that the}} Executive was not required to provide any process when making the <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> classification. The Supreme Court's only requirement was that a person classified as an <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> must be provided with minimal due process. In effect, this allowed the Executive branch to lower the due process requirements on an American citizen, solely because the Executive branch claimed he was an <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant.</b>|$|R

5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{may have}} raised again {{the issue of}} which court would hear cases such as Hamdan's.

5|$|Confederate Army {{officers}} {{indicated their}} military affiliation with different colored facing on their coats or jackets. The colors were red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, light blue for infantry, and black for medical. A very distinctive {{feature of the}} Confederate officers uniforms was the gold braid Austrian knots on their sleeves. More elaborate braiding indicated higher rank and some knots almost reached the shoulder. However, a general order, issued in 1862, called for the Austrian knots not to be worn in the field, as this made officers conspicuous to <b>enemy</b> <b>combatants.</b>|$|E

Manuel Lamparo was captured on Puerto Rico's east coast, {{and some of his}} crew joined Cofresí and other fugitives.|$|E

5|$|The {{use of a}} {{military}} tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles, who believed that a civil court should have presided; but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as <b>enemy</b> <b>combatants</b> and that martial law was in force {{at the time in}} the District of Columbia. (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan, the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson.|$|E

25|$|In {{regard to}} the {{detention}} of detainees without charge, in section I of the O'Connor plurality opinion, the plurality relied on the time-honored traditions of war, the Geneva Convention, and {{a long list of}} other international treaties, to hold that the government had authority under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (2001) to hold any <b>enemy</b> <b>combatants,</b> provided <b>enemy</b> <b>combatants</b> had been seized on the battlefield participating in active hostilities, for the sole objective of preventing an enemy combatant from returning to the battlefield, and then only so long as there continued to be “active hostilities.” The plurality held that such protective detention could be applied to both citizen and non-citizen <b>enemy</b> <b>combatants.</b>|$|E
40|$|This Note {{examines}} Padilla v. Bush as {{an example}} of the contemporary application of <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> law. This Note argues that in present and future applications of <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> law, courts should treat Padilla as the preferred model of application because Padilla preserves more Constitutional protections, specifically the right to counsel in bringing a habeas petition, than do Hamdi or Quirin. The Padilla decision is preferable to Hamdi because Padilla restricts the movement of <b>enemy</b> <b>combatant</b> law away from the ex- press criminal protections of the Constitution. In contrast, Hamdi greatly accelerates such movement...|$|R
