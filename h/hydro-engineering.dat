50|$|The Eckbach Mill Path, {{which was}} created in 1997 on the {{initiative}} of the Kleinkarlbach mill researcher, Wolfgang Niederhöfer, runs for 23 kilometres along the Eckbach stream and past 23 old water mills from southwest to northeast through the Leiningerland. In 2007 in the Großkarlbach village mill the Leiningerland Mill Museum (Mühlenmuseum Leiningerland) was opened. From a <b>hydro-engineering</b> perspective the 20-Pipe Well of Altleiningen is important; it is fed from a mine gallery which was driven deep into the rock around 1600 in order to supply the castle. Today, the well delivers most of the water for the Eckbach.|$|E
50|$|In {{the course}} of the decades there were further, very {{different}} designs: Small solutions and larger ones, which envisaged the Schützenplatz (shooting range) as an island in the lake. In September 1925 the newly elected city mayor Arthur Menge commissioned Otto Franzius, a water engineer and professor at the Hanover Technical College (now University of Hanover), to work out the details of the construction of a lake together with the city’s building authorities. Franzius was to be responsible for the designing of the <b>hydro-engineering</b> and hydrological elements of the project, while the city authorities, led by Karl Elkart, would handle the urban development aspects.|$|E
50|$|In the Rhine Plain {{the course}} of the river was made more {{complicated}} by numerous <b>hydro-engineering</b> measures, especially the Acher-Rench Correction between 1936 and 1967. Even in the Black Forest foothill zone above Oberachern, the Acherner Mühlbach was cut short by the Acher at a weir, which has an average discharge here of around 5 m³/s. The Acher itself - from Oberachern also called the Feldbach - then crosses the borough of Achern and is finally led to the Rhine and Rench with some of its water (high water discharge) into the Acher Flood Control Channel. Just before the flood channel and the Acher divide, the Fautenbach joins it. The originally, partially canalised river runs northwards as the Acher (Feldbach) to Greffern. Before the construction of the Rhine Side Canal (Rheinseitenkanal) it emptied into the Rhine here. The Acher is now led parallel to it to the Rhine Dyke (Rheindeich). A section of the Rhine Plain Canal used to pass under it coming from the left, being joined by the water-rich Sulzbach, the lower reaches of the Sasbach and Laufbach as well as the Acherner Mühlbach. The Rhine Plain Canal then used to empty into the Acher itself from the right. Further north the Sandbach finally joins the Altrheinzug ("Old Course of the Rhine") as the lower reaches of the Acher are called. It empties below the Iffezheim Lock into th Rhine, a good 10 kilometres below its old confluence. From Greffern the Acher is used as a link for the different areas of the Söllingen/Greffern Polder. In order to protect the Acher even when the polder floods, in 2005 a pumping station near Greffern was brought into operation.|$|E
5000|$|As John Olson, {{president}} of OLSON, a Minneapolis-based advertising, interactive and PR agency, put it, [...] "It's {{as good a}} landmark and touchstone -- and so, maybe, headstone -- as a body can expect from his hometown." [...] Perhaps that's also what Harry Wild Jones had in mind in 1932 when he first put this masterpiece onto paper. Jones, a well-known Minneapolis architect who also designed Butler Square and Lakewood Cemetery Chapel (both {{of which are in}} Minneapolis), was well ahead of his time in creating the structurally sound Washburn Park Water Tower. Along with William S. Hewett (an engineer from the Interlachen Bridge project), the two men not only implemented modern <b>hydro-engineering</b> methods to the tower's design, but also its very own unique character. The story goes that as Jones was clearing underbrush at his home nearby, which was also in its construction phase, a giant eagle (with nearly an 8 ft wingspan) had attacked him. He had the eagle maimed, captured, and brought to town where it began attracting much attention. In part, he used the eagle's extraordinary dimensions (and the artistic skills of John Karl Daniels) to cast eight concrete look-alikes, that now sit atop the tower to watch over their former domain. In addition, eight 18 ft [...] "Guardians of Health" [...] were placed around the tower (one under each eagle), to prevent any bad-tasting or bad-smelling water pollutants from contaminating the water supply, which were believed to be the cause of many typhoid fever outbreaks around that time. Jones's house is located near the tower. It is hard to see it because of trees and newer houses but at the right angles you can see parts of it. It looks old and castle like compared to other houses nearby ...|$|E

40|$|Sediment {{transport}} in rivers {{is important}} regarding to environmental and <b>hydro-engineering</b> issues. The complexity {{of this phenomenon}} derives on several assumptions for its theoretical analysis. One of these assumptions is to consider the water density and viscosity as constants; another is to neglect {{the influence of the}} flow through the porous medium on the water velocity profile. The presence of a movable sandybed is determinant for the variation of the fluid 9 ̆ 2 s density and viscosity because of the processes that take place on the boundary between the porous medium and the fluid in motion. This paper describes at a glance some experimental investigations on how the water density varies {{as a function of the}} depth, velocity and channel roughness. In addition, the flow through the sandy layer is not neglected because a numerical model is developed to find the velocity field on the boundary between the bed and the water...|$|E
40|$|More {{computational}} {{models have}} been developed for applications to the investigations of a variety of problems in hydroscience and engineering. Some of them have been utilized in not only engineering designs; but also planning, management and even policy decisions of large scale and highly complex projects costing huge amounts of funds and having long-term impact to our society. The lack of a rigorous methodology for establishing the quality standard, or the assurance of the models ’ reliability and accuracy, has raised great concerns by a number of professional societies, research institutions, governmental agencies and professionals in the field worldwide. This paper is to introduce the findings of the ASCE-EWRI Task Committee on 3 D Free Surface Flow Model Verification and Validation. The Task Committee consisting of more than 15 members from 6 countries have actively worked on this task for more than 8 years. The detailed findings shall be soon published in an ASCE Monograph on this topic. The paper intends to present only the highlights briefly. A rigorous validation and verification process of computational model for <b>hydro-engineering</b> investigations should include three steps: Mathematical Verification, Physical Process Validation...|$|E
40|$|Salt marsh {{formation}} can {{be initiated}} by the colonization of bare tidal flats by pioneer halophytes such as Spartina anglica. In the present study, growth of S. anglica in the edge and centre zones of pioneer patches colonizing a tidal flat in a marine bay in the south-west Netherlands was investigated. Average biomass and shoot length was significantly lower in centre zones than in edge zones of the patches. Multiple linear regression showed that 84 % {{of the variance in}} aboveground biomass in the centre zones could be explained by sediment phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. No such relationship existed in the edge zone. This suggests that biomass production in the centre zones of the patches is nutrient limited, but that factors other than sediment nitrogen and phosphorus content determine growth of Spartina in the edge zones. The sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the centre zones of the patches were significantly related with sediment carbon concentrations, indicating that the pool of particle- bound nutrients in the sediment to an important extent is associated with organic particles. Determination of stable carbon isotope signatures of the sedimentary organic matter showed that an increasing carbon content of the sediment in the centre zone of the patches land a rise in plant biomass) coincides with a higher contribution of non-Spartina derived carbon to the sedimentary organic matter pool. Sustained biomass production in the centre zones of the patches, thus, probably depends on deposition of allochthonous organic particles and the nutrient inputs inherent in this process. Due to the construction of large-scale <b>hydro-engineering</b> works, however, conditions for deposition of waterborne particles are currently unfavourable. The consequences of reduced carbon and nutrient inputs into the patches will be particularly in the (older) centre zones, where the nutrient pools in non- refractory organic matter have been drained in the years of previous growth. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the canopy-enhanced sedimentation for which Spartina is well-known, via positive feed-back effects on plant growth can be crucial for plant vitality, and, hence, for successful colonization of unvegetated areas.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{state-building}} in Sudan {{in the modern}} era cannot be understood without a multilevel analysis of the links between water, civilisation and power. More particularly, it focuses on the hydropolitical economy of the Al-Ingaz Revolution since its launch in 1989. I analyse the efforts by Sudan's military-Islamist leaders at material and immaterial transformation of society through visions of <b>hydro-engineering</b> civilisation. “Economic Salvation” -the rescue of Sudan’s economy through a “hydro-agricultural mission” that will create an ‘Islamic’ middle class- is central to this ideology. The hydro-agricultural mission is a revolutionary attempt at Islamist state-building through a hyper-ambitious Dam Programme and an Agricultural Revival in Sudan’s riverain core. It intends to entrench Al-Ingaz in power by delivering for those riverain constituencies and external partners on the Arabian Peninsula and in East Asia deemed critical to continued hegemony. This thesis is fundamentally about Islamist Sudan's hydropolitical economy, but makes broader contributions. First, it highlights how, far from being exceptional, the hydro-agricultural mission is deeply embedded in historical ways of thinking about water, civilisation and power in Sudan and the Nile Basin more broadly, echoing assumptions, policy prescriptions and logics of political control and high-modernist development that have been salient for almost 200 years. In the past, grand state-building projects, predicated on the dream of controlling the water to control the people, have been characterised by high levels of violence and developmental mirages in the desert. I show why, under military-Islamist rule, this experience is being repeated in Sudan. Second, this thesis is situated in wider debates in the early 21 st century, with fears about resources crunches proliferating amidst rising global commodity prices and the impact of climate change. The idea that environmental scarcity, as an exogenous variable, is the main shaper of societies and their politics is enduring, but both theoretically and empirically misguided. Moreover, it has often been manipulated by elites in processes of power and wealth accumulation that reproduce the very societal and ecological problems they claim to be resolving. I argue that the links between water, civilisation and power in Sudan highlight not just the endogeneity of environmental scarcity to political-economic processes, but also the violent consequences of a modernist paradigm that is seen by ruling elites as both enlightened science and the route to hegemony while reproducing conflict at the local, national and regional level.
