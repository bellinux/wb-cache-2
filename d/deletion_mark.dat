40|$|Three main {{features}} regarding {{the loss of}} mitochondrial genetic markers among rho- mutants induced by ultraviolet irradiation are reported: (a) the frequency of loss of six loci examined increases with UV dose; (b) preferential loss of one region of the mitochondrial genome observed in spontaneous rho- mutants is enhanced by UV; and (c) the loss of each marker results from large <b>deletions.</b> <b>Marker</b> loss in rho- mutants was also investigated under conditions that modulate rho- induction. Liquid holding of irradiated exponential or stationary phase cells, {{as well as a}} split-dose regime applied to stationary phase cells, results in rho- mutants in which the loss of markers is correlated with rho- induction: the more sensitive the cells are to rho- induction, the more frequent are the marker losses among rho- clones derived from these cells. This correlation is not found in exponential-phase cells submitted to a split-dose treatment, suggesting that a different mechanism is involved in the latter case. It is known that UV-induced pyrimidine dimers are not excised in a controlled manner in mitochondrial DNA.

This study {{aims to examine}} the expression profiles of the miR- 183 cluster (miR- 96 / 182 / 183) in pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma tissues were prospectively collected from 50 patients with pheochromocytoma. Expression of miR- 183 cluster members and SDHB protein expression were analysed in these tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry respectively. The expression of miR- 183 cluster members in pheochromocytomas was correlated with the clinical and pathological parameters of these patients. The expression levels of miR- 183 cluster members were predominantly downregulated or deleted in pheochromocytoma. Low expression or deletion of miR- 96 was predominantly noted in younger age patients with pheochromocytoma (< 50 years, P =. 01). Female patients in the study group showed <b>marked</b> <b>deletion</b> of miR- 182 (P =. 05). Deletion of the cluster was also associated with SDHB protein expression in pheochromocytoma. Moreover, patients with low miR- 183 cluster expression had a slightly better survival rate when {{compared to patients with}} high expression. To conclude, the findings indicate a role for miR- 183 cluster members in the pathogenesis and clinical progression of pheochromocytoma.

The � epitope was originally generated {{by a pair of}} somatic mutations that arose naturally during an immune response. By crossing this TCR Tg mouse with mice expressing the � chain of mAb 36 - 71, we found that �-specific T cells were centrally deleted in thymi of progeny that inherited the �Tg. Maternally derived �Tg antibody also induced central <b>deletion.</b> In <b>marked</b> contrast, adoptive transfer of TCR Tg T cells into �Tg recipients resulted in T and B cell activation, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and the production of IgG antichromatin antibodies by day 14. In most recipients, autoantibody levels increased with time, Tg T cells persisted for months, and a state of lupus nephritis developed. Despite this, Tg T cells appeared to be tolerant as assessed by severely diminished proliferative responses to the V � peptide. These results reveal the importance of attaining central and peripheral T cell tolerance to BCR V regions.

The HIV- 1 epidemic in Trinidad/Tobago and the Caribbean shares many features with such heterosexual epidemics, including a prominent role for coincident sexually transmitted diseases. This study evaluates the molecular epidemiology of HIV- 1 in Trinidad/Tobago during a period when abrupt transition from homosexual to heterosexual transmission occurred {{in the absence of}} injecting drug use, concomitant with a rapid rise in HIV- 1 prevalence in the heterosexual population. Of 31 viral isolates studied during 1987 – 1995, all cluster with subtype B reference strains. In the analysis of full env genes from 22 early seroconverters, the Trinidad isolates constitute a significant subcluster within the B subtype. The Trinidad V 3 consensus sequence differs by a single amino acid from the prototype B V 3 consensus and demonstrates stability over the decade of this study. In the majority of isolates, the V 3 loop of env contains a signature threonine <b>deletion</b> that <b>marks</b> the lineage of the Trinidad HIV- 1 clade B epidemic from pre- 1984. No phenotypic features, including syncitium induction, neutralization profiles, and chemokine receptor usage, distinguish this virus population from other subtype B viruses. Thus, although the subtype B HIV- 1 viruses being transmitted in Trinidad are genetically distinguishable from other subtype B viruses, this is probably the result of a strong founder effect in a geographically circumscribed population rather than genetic selection for heterosexual transmission. These results demonstrate that canonical clade B HIV- 1 can generate a typical heterosexual epidemic...|$|R

Inhibition of CDC 42 or NF-kB signaling attenuated the sustained up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes in senescent human endothelial cells. Endothelium-specific activation of the p 53 /p 21 pathway, a key mediator of senescence, also resulted in up-regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules in mice, which was reversed by Cdc 42 deletion in endothelial cells.

We next tested RIII S/J with mAb 44 - 22 - 1, which is specific for V beta 6 TCR, and found it also to be negative. The (B 10 X RIII) F 1 mice showed a 50 % expression of V beta 6 gene, indicating a genomic rather than a clonal deletion. mAb KJ 25, detecting V beta 3, was positive in RIII S/J, denoting the downstream boundary for the deletion. Southern blot analysis of liver DNA using TCR V beta-specific probes confirmed the deletion of V beta 8 gene subfamily and V beta 5 gene subfamily, along with V beta 9, V beta 11, V beta 12, and V beta 13 genes similar to the known TCR V beta deletion mutants (SWR, SJL, C 57 L, and C 57 Br).

We found that a single injection of SEA with an optimal dose of 10 μg increased the expression of both CD 4 and CD 8 significantly. There was expansion of SEA-reactive T cells in vivo after SEA re-injection and the time interval between injections strongly influenced the responsiveness of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Anergy of T cells was observed after three SEA treatments. The time interval between injections mainly affected the unresponsiveness of CD 4 + T cells, not CD 8 + T cells. <b>Marked</b> <b>deletion</b> followed by anergy of CD 4 + T cells was induced at short intervals, and anergy without obvious deletion of CD 4 + T cells was induced at long intervals.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{target of}} rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) is activated by extracellular factors that control bone accrual. However, the direct role of this complex in osteoblast biology {{remains to be}} determined. To investigate this question, we disrupted mTORC 1 function in pre-osteoblasts by targeted deletion of Raptor (Rptor) in Osterix-expressing cells. Deletion of Rptor resulted in reduced limb length that was associated with smaller epiphyseal growth plates in the postnatal skeleton. Rptor <b>deletion</b> caused a <b>marked</b> reduction in pre- and post-natal bone accrual, which was evident in skeletal elements derived from both intramembranous and endochondrial ossification. The decrease in bone accrual, and associated increase in skeletal fragility, was due {{to a reduction in}} osteoblast function. In vitro, osteoblasts derived from knockout mice display a reduced osteogenic potential and an assessment of bone-developmental markers in Rptor knockout osteoblasts revealed a transcriptional profile consistent with an immature osteoblast phenotype suggesting osteoblast differentiation was stalled early in osteogenesis. Metabolic labeling and an assessment of cell size of Rptor knockout osteoblasts revealed a significant decrease in protein synthesis, a major driver of cell growth. These findings demonstrate that mTORC 1 {{plays an important role in}} skeletal development by regulating mRNA translation during pre-osteoblast differentiation...|$|R

The electrophoretic mobility of the linear multimers was analyzed in polyacrylamide gels {{and the size of}} the circular DNA was determined by electron microscopy. A 1 -base <b>deletion</b> produced a <b>marked</b> retardation in the mobility of the linear multimers coincident with the formation of a population of multimeric circles of a smaller average size than the deletionless 32 -mer; 2 -, 3 -, or 4 -base deletions at the same site produced proportionately greater effects. Two 1 -base deletions separated by 10 bp on the same strand produced a greater reduction in mobility than a 1 -base deletion, whereas two 1 -base deletions spaced by 5 bp on the same strand yielded a molecule that behaved more like the deletionless DNA. We conclude that deletions of 1 - 4 bases at a single site on duplex DNA produce molecules that behave as if they contain sharp bends or kinks.

Our results showed that increased expression of α 1, α 5, and β 1 was observed during angiogenesis of differentiated MSCs, and the Rho/MRTF-A signaling pathway was demonstrated to be involved in regulating the expression of integrins α 1, α 5, and β 1. Luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay determined that MRTF-A could bind to and transactivate the integrin α 1 and α 5 promoters. Treatment with the Rho inhibitor C 3 transferase, the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y 27632 or with shMRTF-A inhibited both the upregulation of α 1, α 5, and β 1 as well as angiogenesis.

Most previous contrastive studies of relative clauses in Korean and English were confined to superficial differences and problem points. This study broadens the scope of investigation and includes an explanation for most syntactic distinctions between Korean and English relative clauses. Although on the surface, Korean clausal modifiers lack relative pronouns, their underlying structures share similarities with English relative clauses. Both languages produce relative clauses by embedding the subordinate sentences into head NP's. The language specific transformational rules in relative clause formation for English are Pronominalization, Relative Pronoun Deletion, Modifier Shifting. For Korean the language specific rules are Modality Adjustment and Case <b>Marker</b> <b>Deletion.</b> Relative Clause Reduction in English and Copular and Existential Verb Deletion in Korean are similar rules. Constraints such as the Pied Piping Constraint, the Complex NP Constraint, the Sentential Subject Constraint, and the Coordinate Constraint are applied on relative clause formation in both languages. Although pseudo-relative clauses have similar semantic clues, they are derived from different underlying structures...|$|R
40|$|Repetitive DNA {{elements}} {{frequently are}} precursors to chromosomal deletions in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. However, {{little is known}} about the relationship between repeated sequences and deletion formation in mammalian cells. We have created a novel integrated plasmid-based recombination assay to investigate repeated sequence instability in human cells. In a control cell line, the presence of direct or inverted repeats did not appreciably influence the very low deletion frequencies (2 × 10 − 7 to 9 × 10 − 7) in the region containing the repeat. Similar to what has been observed in lower eukaryotes, the majority of deletions resulted from the loss of the largest direct repeat present in the system along with the intervening sequence. Interestingly, in closely related cell lines that possess a mutant p 53 gene, deletion frequencies in the control and direct-repeat plasmids were 40 to 300 times higher than in their wild-type counterparts. However, mutant p 53 cells did not preferentially utilize the largest available homology in the formation of the deletion. Surprisingly, inverted repeats were approximately 10, 000 times more unstable in all mutant p 53 cells than in wild-type cells. Finally, several <b>deletion</b> junctions were <b>marked</b> by the addition of novel bases that were homologous to one of the preexisting DNA ends. Contrary to our expectations, only 6 % of deletions in all cell lines could be classified as arising from nonhomologous recombination...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the typical development of speech in first language Setswana speaking children. Thirty-six children, aged 3; 0 – 6; 0 years, attending preschools in Hebron in the North-West Province of South Africa, participated in the study. The objectives {{of the study were}} documenting the children’s ability to produce consonants and vowels, different syllable structures, as well as the nature of phonological processes occurring at various ages. The study followed a cross-sectional design with six children grouped into each six month age band. Due to the preliminary and exploratory nature of the project, an assessment tool was developed and used to document speech development in Setswana-speaking children. This was done as none is currently available. Words and pictures selected for this assessment tool were culturally and linguistically appropriate for the study population, and an expert panel was used to ensure this. Assessments were transcribed online by a first language Setswana speaker using the IPA convention and were audio-recorded and re-transcribed by the same Setswana speaker to ensure reliability. Findings {{of this study indicate that}} the majority of Setswana consonants are acquired by 3; 0 years. The rounded alveolar trill /rw/ is among the phonemes which continue to develop after 6; 0 years, particularly in the penultimate syllable. Phonological processes found in the speech of younger children mainly occur in multisyllabic words and include <b>deletion</b> of <b>marked</b> and unmarked syllables, gliding of liquids, assimilation, as well as the simplification of -Cw- digraphs and words with five syllables. Older children (5; 6 – 5; 11 years) present with fewer phonological processes than the younger group of children (3; 0 – 5; 5 years). Findings of the study are discussed in relation to normative data from other languages, and in particular to those belonging to the same language group such as Sesotho. Knowledge of Setswana speech development will better equip Speech-Language Therapists working in Southern Africa to assess and manage speech difficulties in Setswana-speaking children. Future research may focus on developing a standardised Setswana speech assessment tool. The results contribute to an increasing body of locally relevant information about the typical development of children’s speech...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{diagnosis}} of benign renal oncocytomas (RO) and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCC) {{based on their}} morphology remains uncertain in several cases. Methods We have applied Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 250 K NspI high-density oligoarrays to identify small genomic alterations, which may occur beyond the specific losses of entire chromosomes, and also Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U 133 Plus 2. 0 oligoarrays for gene expression profiling. Results By analysing of DNA extracted from 30 chRCCs and 42 ROs, we have confirmed the high specificity of monosomies of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 10, 13, 17 and 21 in 70 – 93 % of the chRCCs, while ROs displayed loss of chromosome 1 and 14 in 24 % and 5 % of the cases, respectively. We demonstrated that chromosomal gene expression biases might correlate with chromosomal abnormalities found in chromophobe RCCs and ROs. The vast majority genes downregulated in chromophobe RCC were mapped to chromosomes 2, 6, 10, 13 and 17. However, most of the genes overexpressed in chromophobe RCCs were located to chromosomes without any copy number changes indicating a transcriptional regulation as a main event. Conclusion The SNP-array analysis failed to detect recurrent small <b>deletions,</b> which may <b>mark</b> loci of genes involved in the tumor development. However, we have identified loss of chromosome 2, 10, 13, 17 and 21 as discriminating alteration between chromophobe RCCs and ROs. Therefore, detection of these chromosomal changes {{can be used for}} the accurate diagnosis in routine histology. </p...|$|R
40|$|Association of Shal gene-related {{voltage-gated}} potassium (Kv 4) channels with cytoplasmic Kv channel {{interacting proteins}} (KChIPs) influences inactivation gating and surface expression. We investigated both functional and biochemical consequences of mutations in cytoplasmic N and C-terminal Kv 4. 2 domains to characterize structural determinants for KChIP interaction. We performed a lysine-scanning mutagenesis within the proximal 40 amino acid portion and a structure-based mutagenesis in the tetramerization 1 (T 1) domain of Kv 4. 2. In addition, the cytoplasmic Kv 4. 2 C-terminus was truncated at various positions. Wild-type and mutant Kv 4. 2 channels were coexpressed with KChIP 2 isoforms in mammalian cell lines. The KChIP 2 -induced modulation of Kv 4. 2 currents was studied with whole-cell patch clamp and the binding of KChIP 2 isoforms to Kv 4. 2 channels with coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Our results define one major interaction site for KChIPs, including amino acids in the proximal N-terminus between residues 11 and 23, where binding and functional modulation are essentially equivalent. A further interaction site includes residues in the T 1 domain. Notably, C-terminal <b>deletions</b> also had <b>marked</b> effects on KChIP 2 -dependent gating modulation and KChIP 2 binding, revealing a previously unknown involvement of domains within the cytoplasmic Kv 4. 2 C-terminus in KChIP interaction. Less coincidence of binding and functional modulation indicates a more loose ‘anchoring’ at T 1 - and C-terminal interaction sites. Our results refine and extend previously proposed structural models for Kv 4. 2 /KChIP complex formation...|$|R
