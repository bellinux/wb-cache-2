Hudson, who for some years was Minister of Justice, became Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of pillboxes had been {{constructed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>World</b> War and where possible these were integrated into the defence plans. Some pillboxes may pre-date {{the publication of the}} FW3 designs, but in any case some local commanders introduced modifications to the standard FW3 designs or introduced designs of their own. These non-standard design pillboxes may be produced in some numbers or completely ad hoc designs suited to local conditions. Other designs were produced as commercial ventures.|$|E

After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.|$|E

5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>World</b> War, and it {{was decided}} that those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Denmark's {{neutrality}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>World</b> War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers {{for the duration of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Bioluminescence {{attracted}} the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters can create a bright enough wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>World</b> War, having been detected in this way. The navy was interested in predicting when such detection would be possible, and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose was {{a smaller}} {{community}} during the war, but it kept going. Once again, union with Lincoln College was discussed: {{but in other}} areas, temporary merger was more appropriate; thus, Brasenose and Christ Church fielded single sports teams. The College hosted military personnel as it had <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>World</b> War; a Nissen hut was even set up in Deer Park. Brasenose sent a flood of undergraduates into the forces; in particular, the college's sporting, masculine ethos meant many joined the Royal Air Force. This would contribute significantly to a high death total– 123 for the Allies and 1 for the Germans– more than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>World</b> War, although proportionately less. Many of Brasenose's sporting heroes died; among survivors were future Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie and cricketer Pieter van der Bijl.|$|E
