40|$|The task of <b>handwritten</b> Chinese <b>character</b> <b>recognition</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} areas of human handwriting classification. The main reason for this is related to the writing system itself which encompasses thousands of characters, coupled with high levels of diversity in personal writing styles and attributes. Much of the existing work for both online and off-line <b>handwritten</b> Chinese <b>character</b> <b>recognition</b> has focused on methods which employ feature extraction and segmentation steps. The preprocessed data from these steps form the basis for the subsequent classification and recognition phases. This paper proposes an approach for <b>handwritten</b> Chinese <b>character</b> <b>recognition</b> and classification using only an image alignment technique and does not require the aforementioned steps. Rather than extracting features from the image, which often means building models from very large training data, the proposed method instead uses the mean image transformations as a basis for model building. The use of an image-only model means that no subjective tuning of the feature extraction is required. In addition by employing a fuzzy-entropy-based metric, the work also entails improved ability to model different types of uncertainty. The classifier is a simple distance-based nearest neighbour classification system based on template matching. The approach is applied to a publicly available real-world database of <b>handwritten</b> Chinese <b>characters</b> and demonstrates that it can achieve high classification accuracy and is robust in the presence of noise. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
