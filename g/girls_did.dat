When her parents realized she was doing little beyond playing chess and sleeping, they urged her to help with her sister Marie's basketball team. Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was exasperating in some ways, as the <b>girls</b> <b>did</b> not take it seriously, but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.|$|E

The students were provided with three meals a day, and were given plenty of time to sleep and play. Religious study was regularly kept up, and included church on Sunday and praying each morning and evening every day of the week. Every night at dinner, along with singing and praying, every student had to recite a verse, or part of a verse, of Scripture from the Bible.|$|E

25|$|Pamela Jelimo {{was born}} in Kiptamok village, Nandi District, Rift Valley Province. Her mother, Esther Cheptoo Keter, was a {{promising}} 200 metres and 400 metres runner, but the customs of the Nandi tribe meant that as the last-born daughter she could not marry and had {{to care for her}} parents in their old age. However, she was allowed to bear children to different men; thus, Jelimo was raised by her mother in a family of three brothers and six sisters. Jelimo began running in 2003, aged 13, at Koyo Secondary in the Kaptumo division, near Kapsabet. She quickly established herself as an accomplished athlete, winning at schools' championships in the 100 metres, 200m, 400m, 800 metres, 400 metres hurdles and heptathlon. Her high school games teacher Philip Ng'eno remarked that she used to compete with the boys in sprint events as the <b>girls</b> <b>did</b> not provide the competition she needed.|$|E

500|$|Cher has six tattoos. The Baltimore Sun {{called her}} the [...] "Ms. Original Rose Tattoo". She {{got her first}} tattoo in 1972. According to Sonny Bono, [...] "Calling her {{butterfly}} tattoos nothing was like ignoring a sandstorm in the Mojave. That was exactly the effect Cher wanted to create. She liked {{to do things for}} the shock they created. She still does. She'll create some controversy and then tell her critics to stick it." [...] In the late 1990s, she began having laser treatments to remove her tattoos. The process was still underway in the 2000s. She commented, [...] "When I got tattooed, only bad <b>girls</b> <b>did</b> it: me and Janis Joplin and biker chicks. Now it doesn't mean anything. No one's surprised." [...] In 1992, Madame Tussauds wax museum honored Cher as one of the five [...] "most beautiful women of history" [...] by creating a life-size statue. She was ranked 26th on VH1's list of the [...] "100 Sexiest Artists" [...] published in 2002.|$|E

500|$|The Coonleys {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. in 1916, and while Queene {{continued}} to devote {{her time and}} money, she left the day-to-day direction of the school to Morse. Under her direction, the Junior Elementary School built upon the educational foundations established at the Cottage School, with its focus on the active participation of the students. Drama, music, and dance were important parts of the curriculum, and nature study remained an integral component of students' activities. These ideas, and nature study in particular, were largely the creation of Colonel Francis Wayland Parker, whom John Dewey once referred to as [...] "the father of progressive education". The Junior Elementary School was a proving ground for these principles, which called for {{a new way of}} relating to students, allowing them to freely experience their lessons on their own terms. No distinction was made between boys' and girls' activities, which included gardening, carpentry, and cooking. Coonley recalled that [...] "e had boys and girls. We made no distinction, boys and girls cooked, boys and <b>girls</b> <b>did</b> carpenter work, boys and girls took an equal part in all matters of government." [...] Students re-enacted history and literature, composed their own music, and spent much of their time outdoors. In 1924, Coonley and Morse helped found a journal entitled Progressive Education, in which they published their own practical experiences at the school, accompanied by articles written by leading educational theorists, including John Dewey. It became the leading professional journal of the progressive education movement and was published until 1957.|$|E
500|$|Scant {{details are}} {{known about the}} early history of the Dumas Brothel; however, two early {{boarders}} of the house listed their occupations as [...] "gambler" [...] and [...] "saloon man" [...] in census records. By 1900 the brothel was occupied by Madam Grace McGinnis, her servant, a Chinese cook and four prostitutes. The cost of sex in the brothel {{at the turn of the}} 20th century was fifty cents, with the working girls receiving about 40 percent of that amount. [...] Despite the size of the brothel, by 1902 Madame McGinnis had only five working girls and a musician under her employment. In 1903 the Dumas and businesses like it in Butte's red light district were unusually lucrative ventures. These businesses were frequented by miners from the local Anaconda Copper Mining Company. That year, traffic grew to a point where the Dumas's operations had to be expanded, building [...] "cribs" [...] (tiny cubicles where the girls worked) in the basement of the house. There were several ways potential clients could access the brothel. A back door of the Dumas opened into Pleasant Alley, near South Wyoming Street, which was the busiest section of Butte's red light area. The basement cribs could also be accessed by a staircase from the front sidewalk. Even though the Dumas operated 24 hours a day with several girls taking three shifts, by 1910 there were only two women reported to actually be living there. Instead the prostitutes lived in other parts of Pleasant Alley, and commuted to the brothel for their shifts. In Butte, the activities of the city's prostitutes were generally restricted to Galena and Mercury Street. From the windows of their street-facing cribs, the girls would attract prospective clients in varying states of undress. The Butte Miner, a local newspaper, explained how the <b>girls</b> <b>did</b> this: ...|$|E

2500|$|Children {{older than}} {{toddlers}} continued to wear clothing {{which was in}} many respects simply a smaller version of adult clothing. [...] Although {{it is often said}} that children wore miniature versions of adult clothing, this is something of a myth. [...] Girls wore back-fastening gowns, trimmed much more simply than women's. The skirt of a girl's gown was not split down the front, as women's typically were. [...] <b>Girls</b> <b>did</b> not wear jackets or bedgowns. [...] Boys wore shirts, breeches, waistcoats and coats a man would, but often wore their necks open, and the coat was fitted and trimmed differently from a man's, and boys often went bareheaded. [...] During some decades of the 18th Century, boys' shirts and coats had different collars and cuffs than a man's.
