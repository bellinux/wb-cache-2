500|$|Greene's {{corruption}} is exposed by the Plain Dealer newspaper and Cleveland Police Detective Joe Manditski, {{who grew up}} with Greene in Collinwood, arrests him. Bankrupt and facing prison, Greene plea bargains to lesser charges in return for becoming an FBI informant and being banned for life from organized labor. Greene is released and moves his unhappy wife and daughters back to Collinwood. Nardi gets him work as an enforcer for Hungarian Jewish loan shark Shondor Birns, and later helps pitch a deal to Mafia Capo Jack Licavoli: Greene will force the city's garbage haulers to join the union Licavoli controls. Greene, McComber, Sneperger, and ex-Hells Angel Keith Ritson terrorize many into joining, but Greene's friend Mike Frato refuses. Licavoli orders Greene to kill Frato, but Greene balks because Frato has ten children. Nardi tells him privately, though, that, [...] "You wanted to play in the big leagues. Sometimes you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> you don't wanna do." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things,</b> they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E
2500|$|Ballinger {{was able}} to turn the {{popularity}} of her videos into income from a percentage of advertising fees or occasionally fixed sponsorship fees. She told the Wall Street Journal: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> like torture myself to keep people watching" [...] her YouTube videos. To this end, she made a popular cinnamon challenge video in character as Miranda, Until March 2013, Ballinger' YouTube audience was modest, but in that month, her Miranda Sings channel's audience reached 150,000 subscribers, and both of her YouTube channels began to expand far more rapidly. Ballinger offers merchandise on her mirandasings.com website, {{and some of the}} videos contain brand endorsements. For example, a 2016 video, [...] "Sexy Buttery Love Song" [...] promoted Jack in the Box restaurants. In 2016, Forbes magazine ranked Ballinger as the ninth highest-earning YouTuber.|$|E

6000|$|No Frenchman {{said as much}} as this to me, {{but their}} meaning was as plain as daylight. I tackled one of my guides on this matter; I {{said that it was}} the plain duty of the French {{military}} people to criticise British military methods sharply if they thought they were wrong. [...] "It is not easy," [...] he said. [...] "Many British officers do not think they have anything to learn. And English people do not like being told things. What could we do? We could hardly send a French officer or so to your headquarters in a tutorial capacity. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> in your own way." [...] When I tried to draw General Castelnau into this dangerous question by suggesting that we might borrow a French general or so, he would say only, [...] "There is only one way to learn war, and that is to make war." [...] When it was too late, in the lift, I thought of the answer to that. There is only one way to make war, and that is by the sacrifice of incapables and the rapid promotion of able men. If old and tried types fail now, new types must be sought. But to do that we want a standard of efficiency. We want a conception of intellectual quality in performance that is still lacking....|$|E

6000|$|Please don't {{measure by}} my not-to-be-avoided delay (of three or four--or five, days) to {{acknowledge}} it, {{the degree of}} pleasure and blest relief your most kind letter represents for me. I have fallen these last years on evil days, physically speaking, and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> only when and as I rather difficultly can, and not after a prompter fashion. But {{you give me a}} blest occasion, and I heartily thank you for it. Ever since that so pleasant meeting of ours in Piccadilly toward the end of 1909--nearly four long years ago--have I been haunted with the dreadful sense of a debt to your benevolence that has remained woefully undischarged. I came back to this place that same day--of our happy encounter--to be taken on the morrow with the preliminaries of a wretched illness that dismally developed, that lasted actively, in short, for two long years, and that has left {{me for the rest of}} my ancient days much compromised and disqualified (though I should be better of some of it all now--I mean betterer!--if I weren't so much older--or olderer!) However, the point is that just as I had begun, on that now far-off occasion, to take the measure of what was darkly before me--that is had been clapped into bed by my Doctor here and a nurse clapped down beside me (the first of a perfect procession)--I heard from you in very kind terms, asking me to come and see you and Archibald in the country--probably at the Pollards inscribed upon your present letter. Well, I couldn't so much as make you a sign--my correspondence had so utterly gone to pieces on the spot. Little by little in the aftertime I picked up some of those pieces--others are forever scattered to the winds--and this particular piece you see I am picking up now, with a slight painful contortion, only after this lapse of the years! It is too strange and too graceless--or would be so if you hadn't just put into it a grace for which, as I say, I can scarce sufficiently thank you. The worst of such disasters and derelictions is that they take such terrific retrospective explanations and that one's courage collapses at all there is to tell, and so the wretched appearance continues. However, I repeat, you have transformed it by your generous condonation--you have helped me to tell you a small scrap of my story. It was on your part a most beautiful inspiration, and I bless my ponderous volume for its communication to you of the impulse. Quite apart from this balm to my stricken conscience, I do rejoice that the fatuous book has beguiled and interested you. I had pleasure in writing it, but I delight in the liberality of your appreciation. But I wish you had told me too something more of yourself and of Grove, more I mean than that you are thus ideally amiable--which I already knew. Your [...] "we" [...] has a comprehensive looseness, and I should have welcomed more dots on the i's. Almost your only detail is that you were here at some comparatively recent hour (I infer,) and that you only gave my little house a beautiful dumb glare and went your way again. Why do you do such things?--they give you almost an air of exulting in them afterwards! If I only had a magic [...] "car" [...] of my own I would jump into it tomorrow and come over to see you at Crowborough--I was there in that fashion, by an afternoon lift from a friend, exactly a year ago. My brother William's only daughter, a delightful young woman, and her eldest brother, a most able and eminent young man, are with me at this time, though he too briefly, and demand of me, or receive from me, all the attention my reduced energies are capable of in a social (so to speak) and adventurous way, but if anything is possible later on I will do my best toward it. I wish you were both conceivable at luncheon here. Do ask yourselves candidly if you aren't--and make me the affirmative sign. I should so like to see you. I recall myself affectionately to Archibald--I think of the ancient wonders, images, scenes--all fantasmagoric now. Yours and his all faithfully, ...|$|E
