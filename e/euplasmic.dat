40|$|The electrophoretic {{characteristics}} of the cytoplasmically controlled large subunit of the Fraction I protein of 36 alloplasmic and three <b>euplasmic</b> control lines are reported. These lines, representing the cytoplasms of 32 Triticum and Aegilops species, had either H- or L-type large subunits in their Fraction I protein; the diploid Triticum and most Aegilops species, including Ae. bicornis and Ae. sharonensis, had the L-type subunits; whereas, all the polyploid Triticum species (emmer, timopheevi, common wheats), Ae. speltoides, Ae. aucheri, and Ae. longissima had H-type subunits. Therefore, section Sitopsis of Aegilops exhibits interspecific heterogeneity. The H-type {{is believed to have}} originated in the Sitopsis section from an L-type subunit because of the prevalence of the latter among the diploid species...|$|E

They may be the mostuseful sources of cytoplasmic variability for broadeningthe genetic diversity of wheat for seed carotenoidcontent since both cytoplasm types do not produceany detrimental eVect on agronomic traits, as previouslyreported by other researchers.

40|$|Growth and {{photosynthetic}} performance {{were analyzed}} in alloplasmic tomato at a high- (25 / 17 °C; HTR) and low-temperature regime (12 / 6 °C; LTR) {{in order to}} establish the role of cytoplasmic variation on low-temperature tolerance of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Four alloplasmic tomato lines, containing the nuclear genome of tomato and the plastome of L. hirsutum LA 1777 Humb. & Bonpl., an accession collected at high-altitude in Peru, were reciprocally crossed with 11 tomato entries with a high inbreeding level and a wide genetic variation, resulting in a set of 44 reciprocal crosses. Irrespective of growth temperature, alloplasmic families with alien chloroplasts of L. hirsutum (h) were on average characterized by a high shoot biomass, a large leaf area, and a low specific leaf area in comparison with their <b>euplasmic</b> counterparts. These results do not directly point to an advantageous effect of h-chloroplasts on biomass accumulation at low temperature but rather towards a small general beneficial effect on growth and/or distribution of assimilates. Significant chloroplast-related differences in photosynthetic performance, however, were not detected at both temperature regimes, indicating that h-chloroplasts can properly function in a variable nuclear background of L. esculentum. It is concluded that chloroplast substitution is not an effective method for breeding tomato plants with improved low-temperature toleranc...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} phylogenetic {{relationships among}} plasmons in Triticum Aegilops, PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analyses {{were made of}} 14. 0 -kb chloroplast (ct) and 13. 7 -kb mitochondrial (mt) DNA regions that were isolated from 46 alloplasmic wheat lines and one <b>euplasmic</b> line, These plasmons represent 31 species of the two genera, The ct and mtDNA regions included 10 and 9 structural genes, respectively, A total of 177 bands were detected, of which 40. 6 % were variable, The proportion of variable hands in ctDNA (51. 1 %) was {{higher than that of}} mtDNA (28. 9 %), The phylogenetic trees of plasmons, derived by two different models, indicate a common picture of plasmon divergence in the two genera and suggest three major groups of plasmons (Einkorn, Triticum, and Aegilops), Because of uniparental plasmon transmission, the maternal parents of all but one polyploid species were identified, Only one Aegilops species, Ae. speltoides, was included in the Triticum group, suggesting that this species is the plasmon and B and G genome donor of all polyploid wheats, ctDNA variations were more intimately correlated with vegetative characters, whereas mtDNA variations were more closely correlated with reproductive characters, Plasmon divergence among the diploids of the two genera largely paralleled genome divergence, The relative times of origin of the polyploid species were inferred from genetic distances from their putative maternal parents...|$|E
40|$|The compatibility-inducing {{action of}} the scs(ti) (species cytoplasm-specific gene derived from Triticum timopheevii) and Vi (vitality) genes can be {{observed}} when a durum (T. turgidum) nucleus is placed in T. longissimum cytoplasm. These two genes restore compatibility between an otherwise incompatible nucleus and cytoplasm. The objective {{of this study was}} to localize the scs(ti) gene on a linkage map of chromosome 1 A, which could eventually be used to clone the gene. The mapping population consisted of 110 F 2 individuals derived from crossing a Langdon-T. dicoccoides chromosome 1 A substitution line with a <b>euplasmic</b> (normal cytoplasm) line homozygous for the scs(ti) gene. Through a series of testcrosses the genotypes of the 110 individuals were determined: 22 had two copies, 59 had one copy, and 29 had no copy of the scs(ti) gene. Data from RFLP, AFLP, and microsatellite analysis were used to create a linkage map. The flanking marker loci found for the scs(ti) gene were Xbcd 12 and Xbcd 1449 - 1 A. 2 with distances of 2. 3 and 0. 6 cM, respectively. Nearly 10 % of individuals in this population were double recombinant for a genetic interval of < 3 cM. A blistering phenotype reminiscent of the phenotype observed in maize brittle- 1 mutable was also evident in these individuals. The higher frequency of double recombination within this region and seed-blistering phenotype could be an indication of a transposable element(s) in this locus...|$|E
40|$|Growth and {{photosynthesis}} of an alloplasmic tomato (cybrid), i. e. line AH 47, {{containing the}} nuclear genome of the chilling-sensitive cytoplasmic albino mutant of L. esculentum Mill. 'Large Red Cherry' (LRC) and the plastome {{of a more}} chilling-tolerant high-altitude accession of the related wild species L, hirsutum Humb. & Bonpl. LA 1777, were investigated at an optimal (25 / 20 degrees C) and suboptimal (16 / 14 degrees C) day/night temperature regime and their performance {{compared with that of}} both <b>euplasmic</b> parents. The cybrid shoot had a similar biomass and development rate to the nuclear tomato (L. esculentum) parent at both temperature regimes. Compared with the biomass production of shoots grown at optimal temperature, the reduction in shoot biomass at suboptimal temperature was smaller for L. hirsutum than for L, esculentum and the cybrid. This difference was related to a stronger inhibition of leaf area expansion in L, esculentum and the cybrid in the suboptimal temperature regime than in L. hirsutum. Irrespective of the temperature regime under which the plants were grown, photosynthetic performance and leaf pigment, carbohydrate and soluble-protein contents of the cybrid resembled those of the nuclear parent. No advantages of the alien L. hirsutum chloroplast with respect to growth and photosynthesis-related characteristics were observed in the cybrid in the suboptimal temperature regime, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by nuclear genes, An adverse consequence of interspecific chloroplast transfer was the increased susceptibility to chill-induced photoinhibition of the cybrid. It is concluded that cybridization is not a useful tool for improving low-temperature tolerance of tomato. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany Company...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Alloplasmic lines {{provide a}} unique tool to study nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. Three {{alloplasmic}} lines, with nuclear genomes from Triticum aestivum and harboring cytoplasm from Aegilops uniaristata, Aegilops tauschii and Hordeum chilense, were investigated by transcript and metabolite profiling {{to identify the}} effects of cytoplasmic substitution on nuclear-cytoplasmic signaling mechanisms. Results In combining the wheat nuclear genome with a cytoplasm of H. chilense, 540 genes were significantly altered, whereas 11 and 28 genes were significantly changed in the alloplasmic lines carrying the cytoplasm of Ae. uniaristata or Ae. tauschii, respectively. We identified the RNA maturation-related process {{as one of the}} most sensitive to a perturbation of the nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction. Several key components of the ROS chloroplast retrograde signaling, together with the up-regulation of the ROS scavenging system, showed that changes in the chloroplast genome have a direct impact on nuclear-cytoplasmic cross-talk. Remarkably, the H. chilense alloplasmic line down-regulated some genes involved in the determination of cytoplasmic male sterility without expressing the male sterility phenotype. Metabolic profiling showed a comparable response of the central metabolism of the alloplasmic and <b>euplasmic</b> lines to light, while exposing larger metabolite alterations in the H. chilense alloplasmic line as compared with the Aegilops lines, in agreement with the transcriptomic data. Several stress-related metabolites, remarkably raffinose, were altered in content in the H. chilense alloplasmic line when exposed to high light, while amino acids, as well as organic acids were significantly decreased. Alterations in the levels of transcript, related to raffinose, and the photorespiration-related metabolisms were associated with changes in the level of related metabolites. Conclusion The replacement of a wheat cytoplasm with the cytoplasm of a related species affects the nuclear-cytoplasmic cross-talk leading to transcript and metabolite alterations. The extent of these modifications was limited in the alloplasmic lines with Aegilops cytoplasm, and more evident in the alloplasmic line with H. chilense cytoplasm. We consider that, this finding might be linked to the phylogenetic distance of the genomes. The authors thank Prof. S. S.
