25|$|A {{feature of}} the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK {{actually}} encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a <b>hex</b> <b>wrench</b> in the box. Another {{feature of the}} Sebenza {{is the use of}} a bushing system around the blade's pivot that keeps the blade at a constant tight fit which is always centered.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{generation}} Umnumzaan saw numerous modifications that utilizes {{some of the}} newer technologies found on the Sebenza 25. The single-most visual change was replacing the oversized custom pivot with a more traditional (Sebenza-style) pivot brushing. This new pivot no longer requires the Umnumzaan Take-down Tool and instead a traditional <b>hex</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is all that is}} needed to disassemble and reassemble the knife. This pivot is larger than most blade pivot brushing systems and is identical to the one used on the newer Large Sebenza 25 (mid-2012 release and with a pivot that is significantly thicker than the pivot used on the previous Large Sebenza 21). This pivot also incorporates a newer generation washer system with larger washer perforations, which helps retain lubricating grease better than previous designs, while simultaneously keeping elements out of the pivot system to increase service intervals. The change in pivot and washers is complimented by the modifications made to the ceramic ball and detent system, in which a larger ceramic ball in a slightly different location is used to make opening smoother and reduce wear (although it is unclear as to exactly when this specific change began).|$|E
5000|$|Metric <b>hex</b> <b>wrench</b> {{sizes are}} {{sometimes}} referred to using the designation [...] "M" [...] followed by the size in millimeters of the tool or socket, e.g. [...] "M6", although this may {{be confused with the}} standard use of [...] "M6" [...] which refers {{to the size of a}} metric screw or bolt.|$|E
50|$|Park Tool Company is {{a leading}} American designer, {{manufacturer}} and marketer of bicycle tools and equipment for both professional and home bicycle mechanics. It manufactures over 300 products that range from wheel truing stands to <b>hex</b> <b>wrenches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{security}} {{version of}} the hex head includes a pin in the center. These fasteners {{are said to have}} a [...] "center pin reject" [...] feature to prevent standard <b>hex</b> <b>wrenches</b> from working. A special driver must be used to fasten or remove these fasteners. The TORX head's security variant also has such a pin for the same reason.|$|R
30|$|<b>Hex</b> <b>wrenches</b> and Allen {{keys are}} {{available}} in the supplied instrument sets for mounting half pins in Rancho cubes. In our experience, they are associated with a risk of breakage at the head–driver interface, causing difficulties should the fixator assembly need to be dismantled. The third part of the experiment showed that higher torques can be applied safely when using bolts.|$|R
50|$|The barrel is {{interchangeable}} {{with other}} calibres; {{this can be}} done in the field in about 15 minutes. With the barrel clamped in a barrel vice, the barrel is removed from the action, and another one screwed into the action and tightened in place with a torque wrench. Newer versions of Accuracy International rifles including the AX, AT (Accuracy Tactical), and AXMC (AX Multi-Calibre) feature a switch-barrel system that allow the user to change out the barrel with only the use of a 4mm <b>hex</b> <b>wrench,</b> allowing field barrel changes in under a minute.|$|E
5000|$|The XCR is a multi-caliber weapon system. The base rifle is {{chambered}} in 5.56×45mm NATO. Conversions {{to other}} calibers and barrel lengths {{can be performed}} in 2 to 3 minutes without the need of a trained armorer, and using only a standard <b>hex</b> <b>wrench,</b> and consist of changing to the appropriately chambered barrel and bolt, replacing brass deflector (optional) and insertion of appropriate magazine[...]300 AAC Blackout, 6.8mm Remington SPC, and 7.62×39mm are the current conversion kits available. 6.5mm Grendel was slated for release in 2009, but is currently on hold due to technical issues.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2014, Quintana Roo {{released}} the PRsix. Called [...] "the SuperBike Reconsidered," [...] the PRsix featured a simplicity {{and ease of}} fit and maintenance not found on other [...] "superbikes," [...] {{as it could be}} quickly assembled with only a pedal wrench and two sizes of <b>hex</b> <b>wrench.</b> The PRsix featured SHIFT+ technology, combining the SHIFT technology of the CD0.1 and Illicito with a [...] "boat tail" [...] tube-section that further increased the aerodynamic advantage of SHIFT technology. The bike was compatible with any standard diameter aerobar, as well as any brake produced by Shimano, TRP, Magura, or TriRig.|$|E
5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a {{socket head cap screw}} or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or bolt as a socket does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen <b>hex</b> <b>wrenches</b> (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various screw head types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a [...] "socket spinner" [...] screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to many different types of sockets, bit drivers and extensions.|$|R
5000|$|A {{standoff}} is a threaded separator of defined length used {{to raise}} one assembly above another. They are usually round or <b>hex</b> (for <b>wrench</b> tightening), often made of aluminum, brass, or nylon, {{and come in}} male-female or female-female forms. In electronics they are frequently used to raise a printed-circuit board above a surface. Insulating standoffs keep two parts from touching each other, thereby preventing electrical shorts. When used to fasten cable connectors (i.e. [...] "D" [...] connectors) together, they are called [...] "jack screws".|$|R
5000|$|On set-neck {{electrics}} [...] - [...] under a cover-plate {{behind the}} nut. Gibson & Epiphone guitars have their truss rod bolt {{covered with a}} signature bell-shaped plate. Most Gibson electrics have a 5/16” (8 mm) or a 1/4" [...] (6 mm) hex adjustable truss rod nut that can be adjusted with a <b>hex</b> box spanner <b>wrench.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Using a <b>hex</b> <b>wrench</b> on {{a socket}} {{that is too}} large may result in damage to the {{fastener}} or the tool. An example would be using a 5 mm tool in a 5.5 mm socket. Because hex-style hardware and tools are available in both metric and Imperial and customary sizes (the latter sometimes labelled [...] "SAE"), {{it is also possible}} to select a tool that is too small for the fastener by using an Imperial/customary tool on a metric fastener, or the converse. There are some exceptions to that. For example, 4 mm keys are almost exactly the same size as 5/32", and 8 mm keys are almost exactly the same size as 5/16", which makes 4 mm and 8 mm preferred numbers for consumer products such as self-assembly particle-board furniture, because end users can successfully use an imperial key on a metric fastener, or vice versa, without stripping. 19 mm keys are so close to the same size as ¾" [...] that they are completely interchangeable in practical use.|$|E

5000|$|First {{introduced}} in 1990, the basic model has a sand-blasted titanium handle and a stonewashed finish CPM S30V steel blade.There are numerous {{options for the}} embellishment of the Sebenza's titanium handles, such as computer-generated graphics, custom (unique) graphics, or inlays such as exotic wood, micarta, or mammoth ivory.Originally the Chris Reeve Sebenza was available with a blade of ATS-34 steel. [...] In 1996, the blade material was changed to BG-42 blade steel, and later in 2001, the Sebenza blade material transitioned to CPM S30V steel. CPM S30V was developed by Crucible Steel with the collaboration of Chris Reeve. [...] Damascus steel blades are also available as an option on the Sebenza. Since 2012, all Chris Reeve knives have transitioned to CPM S35VN steel.A feature of the Sebenza that is highly praised by users is the ease of maintenance, as CRK actually encourages the customer to disassemble and maintain the knife by including a <b>hex</b> <b>wrench</b> in the box.

50|$|Klein Tools {{was founded}} in 1857 in Chicago, Illinois by German {{immigrant}} Mathias Klein. The first tool Klein made {{was a pair of}} side-cutting pliers for a telegraph lineman. The company grew as the telegraph and eventually telephone and electrical industries grew after the Civil War by adding 100 types of pliers in the 1910s. From the 1960s-1980s, the company expanded their product line to include leather and canvas products, occupational safety equipment, <b>hex</b> key <b>wrenches,</b> screwdrivers, nut drivers, as well as electrical terminals and connectors. Along the way, Klein acquired the R.H. Buhrke Company of Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1968 and the Vaco Products Company of Jonesville, Michigan in 1986. Also in the mid 1980s, the company started manufacturing adjustable wrenches in the US, which they had previously been purchasing from a Japanese supplier.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{specialized}} bicycle {{tools for}} use {{both in the}} shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a hand pump or CO2 Pump, tire levers, spare tubes, self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing [...] "cones". [...] and sometimes even a block of French chalk.), <b>wrenches,</b> <b>hex</b> keys, screwdrivers, and a chain tool. There are also cycling specific multi-tools that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|A {{coupling}} nut, {{also known}} as extension nut, is a threaded fastener for joining two male threads, most commonly a threaded rod, but also pipes. The outside of the fastener is usually a <b>hex</b> so a <b>wrench</b> can hold it. Variations include reducing coupling nuts, for joining two different size threads; sight hole coupling nuts, which have a sight hole for observing the amount of engagement; and coupling nuts with left-handed threads. These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the coupling nut for a certain distance. Coupling nut dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either cold drawn or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. Coupling nuts threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called reducing coupling nuts.|$|R
