5|$|The Fort Steuben Bridge, {{originally}} the Weirton-Steubenville Bridge, was a suspension bridge which spanned the Ohio River from Steubenville, Ohio to Weirton, West Virginia and carried U.S. Route 22 and then Ohio State Route 822 during its existence. Completed in 1928 and opened as a toll bridge, the Fort Steuben Bridge {{was a more}} direct route for the flow of traffic across the river; particularly for trucks and <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> from the industrial area. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 and closed in 2009 due to deterioration. The bridge was demolished by Joseph B. Fay Co. on February 21, 2012.|$|E

40|$|Most highly {{motorized}} {{countries in}} the world have implemented different speed limits for light weight and <b>heavy</b> weight <b>vehicles.</b> The <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed limit is usually chosen to be lower than that of passenger cars due to the difficulty for the drivers to safely maneuver the <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> at high speed and greater impact during a crash. However, in many cases, the speed limit for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> is set by only considering the vehicle size or category, mostly due to simplicity in enforcement. In this study, traffic and vehicular data for all vehicle types were collected using a weigh-in-motion system installed at Federal Route 54 in Malaysia. The first finding from the data showed that the weight variation for each vehicle category is considerable. Therefore, the effect of gross vehicle weight (GVW) and category of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> on free flow speed and their interaction were analyzed using statistical techniques. Empirical analysis results showed that statistically for each type of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle,</b> there was a significant relationship between free flow speed of a <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> and GVW. Specifically, the results suggest that the mean and variance of free flow speed decrease with an increase GVW by the amount unrelated to size and shape for all GVW range. Then, based on the 85 th percentile principle, the study proposed a new concept for setting the speed limit for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> by incorporating GVW where a different speed limit is imposed to the <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle,</b> not only based on vehicle classification, but also according to its GVW.

5|$|In 1867 the {{formerly}} independent Hammersmith and City Railway was {{absorbed by the}} Metropolitan Railway and the Great Western Railway, and was operated from then on by Metropolitan Railway trains. The plan for a terminus in Fulham was abandoned, and the line instead turned west at Hammersmith to run over London and South Western Railway tracks to Richmond. Although Wandsworth Town railway station, near {{the southern end of}} the bridge, had provided direct connections to central London since 1846, the lack of rail connections opening on the north bank meant the area on the Fulham side remained undeveloped, and bridge usage was low. Tolmé's design was not sturdy enough to carry <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and drainage problems on the approach road to the north discouraged vehicles from using Wandsworth Bridge.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, {{also known}} as Bridge Formula B or the Federal Bridge Formula, is a {{mathematical}} formula in use in the United States by truck drivers and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials to determine the appropriate maximum gross weight for a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) based on axle number and spacing. The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> from damaging roads and bridges.

5|$|A bushfire burnt {{through the}} area in December 1993, {{destroying}} the former railway's bridge over Clackline Brook. Clackline Bridge survived, weakened but in a reasonable condition. The damage included internal expansion joints that had failed, split bedlogs, and other deteriorated timbers. Steel props were installed to support the bridge, and the substructure was repaired in 1995, which mainly involved replacing connecting bolts. A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western abutment in 1998, and in 2013 the concrete deck near pier13 was repaired. Clackline Bridge was the crossing point for Great Eastern Highway until the highway's bypass of Clackline opened in February 2008.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{chassis frame}} forms the {{backbone}} of a <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle,</b> its principle function is to safely carry the maximum load for all designed operating conditions. This paper describes design and analysis of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> chassis. Weight reduction is now the main issue in automobile industries. In the present work, the dimensions of an existing <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> chassis of a TATA 2515 EX vehicle is taken for modeling and analysis of a <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> chassis with three different composite materials namely, Carbon/Epoxy, E-glass/Epoxy and S-glass /Epoxy subjected to the same pressure {{as that of a}} steel chassis. The design constraints were stresses and deflections. The three different composite <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> chassis have been modeled by considering three different cross-sections.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{transportation}} {{continues to}} grow internationally; yet crash rates are high, {{and the risk of}} injury and death extends to all road users. The work environment for the <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> driver poses many challenges; conditions such as scheduling and payment are proposed risk factors for crash, yet the precise measure of these needs quantifying. Other risk factors such as sleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnoea have been shown to increase crash risk in motor vehicle drivers however the risk of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> crash from this and related health conditions needs detailed investigation. Methods and Design The proposed case control study will recruit 1034 long distance <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers: 517 who have crashed and 517 who have not. All participants will be interviewed at length, regarding their driving and crash history, typical workloads, scheduling and payment, trip history over several days, sleep patterns, health, and substance use. All participants will have administered a nasal flow monitor for the detection of obstructive sleep apnoea. Discussion Significant {{attention has been paid to}} the enforcement of legislation aiming to deter problems such as excess loading, speeding and substance use; however, there is inconclusive evidence as to the direction and strength of associations of many other postulated risk factors for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> crashes. The influence of factors such as remuneration and scheduling on crash risk is unclear; so too the association between sleep apnoea and the risk of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> driver crash. Contributory factors such as sleep quality and quantity, body mass and health status will be investigated. Quantifying the measure of effect of these factors on the <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> driver will inform policy development that aims toward safer driving practices and reduction in <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> crash; protecting the lives of many on the road network. </p...|$|R
5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} {{because the two}} companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis. Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Main Roads Western Australia {{monitors}} {{traffic volume}} across the state's road network, including various locations along Great Eastern Highway. In 2008/09, the busiest section was {{east of the}} Graham Farmer Freeway interchange, averaging 60,760 vehicles per weekday. The lowest volume was an average of 850 vehicles per day near Ryans Find Road, partway between Southern Cross and Coolgardie; however, this point also received the largest proportion of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles,</b> at 40.2% of all traffic. , Great Eastern Highway between Mundaring and Northam is the state's worst section of National Highway, in terms of road safety. Casualty crash rates had decreased since 2007, although the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) still considered it a risky section of road needing close attention from road authorities. In 2013, Great Eastern Highway remained as a road of particular concern, with the Australian Automobile Association giving 67% of the highway a low one- or two-star rating (out of five), and 77% of the route between The Lakes and Northam a one-star safety rating.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E

40|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{overloading}} {{and road}} safety {{continue to be}} major problems in South Africa notwithstanding efforts at more effective enforcement by the road and traffic authorities.

5|$|The area {{south of}} Lake Ladoga is a heavily forested area with many {{wetlands}} (especially peat deposits) {{closer to the}} lake.

World War II was over before the company could start series production; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja. Subsequently, the production consisted of outdated lorry models, partly built from military surplus materials. After overcoming initial difficulties, the company modernised its products, became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s. Many major components, including engines, were imported. Diesel engines became widely available in 1955, and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation, the full load lifting tandem axle mechanism, which improved off-road capability significantly; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The 2/7th {{returned}} to Australia in early October 1943. After {{a period of}} leave, the battalion concentrated around Wondecla, on the Atherton Tablelands. During this time the units of the 6th Division were converted to the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} battalion's vehicle allocation and a reorganisation of its specialist platoons, with its Bren carriers and <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> being replaced by jeeps and the anti-aircraft platoon being disbanded. A medium machine gun platoon was added and new anti-tank weapons were also received. The battalion's authorised strength was also reduced to around 800 personnel; however, throughout late 1943 and into early 1944 the 2/7th was well below this due to illnesses and recurring diseases, such as malaria, amongst personnel who had returned from New Guinea. Nevertheless, a long period of training followed and the battalion was rebuilt over time and did not see further action until late in the war when the 6th Division was committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign, in order to release US troops for operations in the Philippines. At the start of the new campaign, Guinn was relieved of his command and appointed commandant of the Land Headquarters Tactical School. In his place, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Parbury took command of the battalion, which deployed aboard the US transport ship Mexico.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the lateral {{performance}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combinations, specifically longer combination vehicles, is discussed. The use of longer combination vehicles is promoted by their {{positive impact on}} the traffic congestion problem, as well as their economic and environmental benefits due to reduced fuel consumption and emissions. However, from a safety perspective, there are concerns about their impact on the traffic. In a <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combination maneuvering at high speeds, lateral motions get amplified at the towed units, which causes trailer swing and large path deviation and side slip. These amplified motions are dangerous for any nearby cars as well as the vehicle combination itself and can lead to instability. The main goal of the research presented in this thesis is to develop control strategies for improving the lateral performance of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combinations at high speeds by suppression of amplified motions at the towed units. As a starting point, the <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> accidents are investigated and the relevant critical maneuvers are identified. Subsequently, the lateral performance of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combinations in the identified critical maneuvers is investigated by simulations to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} causes behind rearward amplification of motions in <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combinations and to specify the control objectives. Accordingly, a generic controller for improving the lateral performance of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combinations by active steering of the towed units is developed. The developed controller is verified for various <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combinations by simulation, with respect to the identified critical maneuvers. The verification results confirm the effectiveness of the controller and show significant reductions in yaw rates, side slip and path deviation of the towed units of the <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combinations, up to 70 %. Additionally, the robustness of the controller is evaluated by extensive analysis of its performance in various driving conditions and presence of parameter uncertainties for a sample <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> combination. Furthermore, the controller is implemented on a truck-dolly-semitrailer test vehicle and verified in a series of single and double lane changes. The experimental results approve the simulation outcomes. The developed controller can be easily implemented on steerable trailers; since it utilizes common sensors for steering input, speed and yaw rates and does not require large computing capacity. The significant improvements obtained by the developed controller can promote the use of longer combination vehicles in traffic, which will result in a reduction of traffic congestion problem, as well as substantial environmental and economic benefits...|$|R

5|$|The RAAF began {{considering}} {{options for}} heavy transport aircraft {{to provide a}} strategic airlift capability during the early 2000s. This investigation was initiated after the ADF deployment to East Timor in 1999 and operations in the Middle East from 2001 revealed shortcomings in the RAAF's ability to transport the increasingly large and <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> and other items of equipment used by the Australian Army. To support these operations, the ADF found that it needed long-range aircraft capable of carrying larger loads than could be accommodated in the RAAF's force of Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports. As {{a result of this}} capability gap, the ADF needed to use USAF transports and chartered Russian-built commercial heavy lift aircraft to move supplies and equipment from Australia to its forces in Afghanistan and the Middle East. This experience proved frustrating, as both categories of aircraft were often not available and the commercial transports were expensive to lease. The crash of a civil-chartered Ilyushin Il-76 in East Timor in 2003 also raised concerns within the ADF about the safety of the Russian transport aircraft. Following advocacy from the military, the Australian Government announced as part of an update to its national security strategy in December 2005 that it would consider acquiring heavy lift aircraft to supplement the RAAF's Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules transports. This initiative was one of several measures announced in the government's Defence Update 2005 paper, which sought to better prepare the ADF to operate in locations distant from Australia.|$|E
5|$|The 2/43rd was {{withdrawn}} to Khassa in Palestine in December and {{took part in}} a divisional parade that month in Gaza, before embarking aboard the Queen Mary, bound for Australia, in January 1943. The Queen Mary formed part of a large convoy established under Operation Pamphlet to transport the 9th Division back to Australia to fight the Japanese in the Pacific. After around a month at sea, the division arrived at Fremantle on 18 February and, after the Western Australian members disembarked, it continued eastwards, reaching Sydney on 27 February. From there, the battalion entrained from Pyrmont, and by 1 March 1943 had arrived in Adelaide, after which members were granted three weeks leave. A welcome-home parade through the city streets was held that month, watched by a crowd of over 200,000, after which the battalion concentrated at Springbank in Adelaide. They entrained for the Atherton Tablelands on 29 March 1943, reaching Kairi, on 6 April 1943. They would remain there for the next four months, training in preparation for jungle warfare against the Japanese in New Guinea. During this time, the battalion was converted to the jungle divisional establishment, which saw the reduction of its authorised strength to about 800 personnel. The number of vehicles allocated to the battalion was also reduced with <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> being replaced by jeeps. The carrier and anti-aircraft platoons were removed from the battalion's establishment, while a Vickers machine-gun platoon was raised and the number of mortars allocated for organic indirect fire support was increased.
