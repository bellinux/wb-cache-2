5|$|A {{number of}} stone circles {{were built in}} the area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Hampton Down ring was erected on an open downland ridge overlooking the coast. It originally contained either eight or nine sarsen stones and had a diameter of 20 feet (6.5 metres) across with a track leading to it from the north. By 1908 the circle had been shifted east of its original position, with a hedge built across the site, and the number of stones <b>increased</b> <b>to</b> sixteen. By 1964 the number of stones had further <b>increased</b> <b>to</b> twenty-eight. In 1965, Geoffrey J. Wainwright oversaw an archaeological excavation which revealed the circle's original location and dimensions, after which it was reconstructed in its original location with the extraneous stones removed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{functional}} properties of peanut protein were determined under different conditions of ultrasonic waves {{which are used}} for processing the solution of peanut protein powder. The {{functional properties}} of peanut protein were enhanced remarkably by ultrasonic waves. Processed by ultrasonic waves for 20 min, foaming ability <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 60 % from 30 %, and foam stability <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 50 % from 17 %. Processed by ultrasonic waves for 15 min, emulsifying ability <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 49. 3 % from 38. 9 % obviously, and emulsion stability <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 100 % from 91. 4 %. When the solution’s PH equals 4, foaming ability of peanut protein to be minimum. Foaming ability <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 27. 9 % from 26. 2 % by ultrasonic waves. When the solution’s PH is from 6 to 10, emulsifying ability <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 50. 7 % from 44. 3 % by ultrasonic waves. When the concentration of the solution of NaCl is 0. 2 mol/L~ 0. 4 mol/L, emulsifying ability <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 45 % from 38. 4 % by ultrasonic waves, but it will drop if we continue <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the concentration of the solution of NaCl. Processed by ultrasonic waves for 6 min,oil absorption ability <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 1. 51 mL/g from 1. 26 mL/g. Processed by ultrasonic waves for 8 min, the solubility of low concentration peanut protein solution(1 g / 100 mL~ 2 g/ 100 mL) enhanced doubly, and the water holding capacity <b>increases</b> <b>to</b> 2. 9 % from 2. 4 %...|$|R
