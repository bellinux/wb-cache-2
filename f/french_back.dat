5|$|Hotze's force took {{relatively}} high casualties—1,000men killed, wounded or missing (12.5 percent) of his entire force of 8,000—although his losses were comparable to Ney's 800 killed wounded or missing, from his 7,000-man force (11.5 percent). More importantly, though, Hotze succeeded {{not only in}} pushing the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> from Winterthur, but also in uniting his force with Nauendorf's and Charles'. The unified Austrian force completed the semicircle around Masséna's positions at Zürich.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February, Wellington's army {{broke out}} of its small area of conquered {{territory}} near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> from several river lines. After a pause in the campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded and isolated Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and fall back east toward Toulouse. The next action was the Battle of Toulouse.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the union}} {{took place in}} the first two days of June, Archduke Charles, {{supported}} by Hotze's command, attacked French positions at Zürich. In first Battle of Zürich, on 4–7 June 1799, Hotze commanded the entire left wing of Archduke Charles' army, which included 20 battalions of infantry, plus support artillery, and 27 squadrons of cavalry, in total, 19,000 men. Despite being wounded, he remained on the field. His troops not only pushed the <b>French</b> <b>back,</b> but harassed their retreat, forcing them across the Limmat river, where they took up defensive positions.|$|E

5000|$|The {{strategy}} of [...] "Divide and Rule" [...] was employed by most imperial powers in Indian subcontinent. The British and <b>French</b> <b>backed</b> various Indian states in conflicts between each other, {{both as a}} means of undermining each other's influence and consolidating their authority.|$|R
5|$|The Danish cavalry, {{under the}} Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt (not to be {{confused}} with the Duke of Württemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> from the water's edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed by a French musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the <b>French</b> <b>back,</b> and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E
5|$|Hoepner now {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} French. Being impatient, {{he did not}} wait for his infantry divisions to catch up. Instead, he hoped to continue pushing the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> and not give them time to construct a coherent defence line. German formations pursued the enemy to Gembloux. The Panzer Corps ran into retreating French columns and inflicted heavy losses on them. The pursuit created severe problems for the French artillery. The combat was so closely fought that the danger of friendly fire incidents were very real. Nevertheless, the French, setting up new anti-tank screens and Hoepner, lacking infantry support, caused the Germans to attack positions head-on. During the following Battle of Gembloux the two Panzer Divisions reported heavy losses during 14 May and were forced to slow their pursuit. The German attempts to capture Gembloux were repulsed.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 June Cornwallis {{returned}} to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on {{the morning of}} 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard. Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship HMS Mars, until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect Mars, Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship HMS Royal Sovereign between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the <b>French</b> <b>back.</b> At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate HMS Phaeton to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as Cornwallis's Retreat.|$|E
5|$|The British commanders, Jeffery Amherst and James Abercromby {{drew up a}} plan {{to assault}} the French at Louisbourg, which {{is located on the}} Atlantic coast of Cape Breton Island, north of Halifax. The French {{garrison}} consisted of only 800 men, while the British force had 13,142 troops supported by 23 ships of the line and 13 frigates. On June 8, 1758, the attack on the fort began. Montgomery landed on the beach under heavy fire and ordered his troops to advance with fixed bayonets. The outer French defenses withdrew back toward the city. Montgomery's unit {{and the rest of the}} British force chased the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> to a point just outside the Fort's guns. At this point, the British prepared to besiege the city. Due to bad weather, artillery and other materials needed for the siege took several weeks to arrive onshore. Montgomery had his men dig entrenchments and build breastworks, also ordering his men stay alert to the possibility of a French attack. On July 9, the French attempted a breakout, but it failed. On July 26, following a series of actions resulting in the destruction of most their fleet, the French surrendered. General Amherst was impressed by Montgomery's action during the siege, and promoted him to lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{led to the}} {{complete}} occupation of Rome by the French. Firstly, {{the entrance of the}} Russian army into Northern Italy pushed the <b>French</b> <b>back.</b> Secondly, on December 28, 1797, in a riot created by some Italian and French revolutionists, the French general Mathurin-Léonard Duphot of the French embassy was killed and a new pretext furnished for invasion.|$|E

25|$|Augereau's two {{divisions}} advanced, that of Haudelet {{on the left}} from Ruskow and Desjardins on the right from Wadkow. Desjardin's division at first drove back Shcherbatov, but being reinforced by an infantry battalion and {{with the support of}} their guns the Russians drove the <b>French</b> <b>back.</b> Heudelet's division made very little progress.

25|$|The Treaties of Breslau and Berlin {{cost the}} Habsburg Monarchy its wealthiest province, and capitulating {{to a lesser}} German prince {{significantly}} dented the House of Habsburg's prestige. However, peace in the Silesian theater gave the united Austrian and British–Hanoverian forces a free hand to reverse the gains made by the French and Bavarians in 1741. By the summer of 1743, the Austrians would recover control of Bohemia, drive the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> across the Rhine into Alsace, and occupy Bavaria, exiling the Bavarian Elector (now crowned Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII) to Frankfurt.|$|E
50|$|A {{more serious}} {{disadvantage}} {{was that the}} French viewed Wade's system as anglophone. The top position in the post office was held by Postal Secretary Théophile Piry, who had been appointed in 1901 {{in part from the}} influence of the French government. Until 1911, the post office remained part of the Maritime Customs Service. As customs inspector general, Hart was Piry's boss, but <b>French</b> <b>backing</b> effectively gave Piry a postal fiefdom.|$|R

Goumba's parliamentary immunity was repealed, and together with seven other MEDAC leaders he was arrested.|$|R
50|$|The {{reign of}} Emperor Maximilian was engulfed in {{constant}} conflict between his <b>French</b> <b>backed</b> {{government and the}} government in exile of Benito Juárez. In 1866, France withdrew its army from Mexico and in June 1867, Emperor Maximilian was captured by Juárez forces in Querétaro City and executed along {{with two of his}} generals, thus ending the empire. After the execution of Maximilian, diplomatic relations between Austria and Mexico were severed until 1901.|$|R
25|$|All Austrian columns {{started at}} dawn. Marching on the {{all-weather}} highway, Kollowrat's column made good time despite heavy snow. At 7:00am, his advance guard under General-Major Franz Löpper collided with Colonel Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet's 108th Line Infantry Demi-Brigade of Grouchy's division. Defending {{deep in the}} forest, the 108th held their ground at first. But, General-Major Lelio Spannochi sent a grenadier battalion in a flank attack and drove the <b>French</b> <b>back.</b> Kollowrat committed General-Major Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy's Bavarian brigade and a second grenadier battalion to keep the attack rolling.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, the Austrians thrust across the Zrmanja and forced the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> to the fortified cities. After the Austrian defeat and subsequent retreat from Italy of the army of Archduke John of Austria, Marmont launched his own offensive. The French beat the Austrians at Pribudić, capturing Stoichevich, and moved north. Two more actions were fought at Gračac on 17 May and Gospić on 21 May before Marmont reached Ljubljana (Laibach) in Carniola. Continuing north, the French general fought in the Battle of Graz on 25 and 26 June and in the decisive Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July.|$|E
25|$|Richthofen {{found himself}} under {{pressure}} in other sectors on 10 May, {{the first day}} of the offensive. In the early phase of the Battle of the Netherlands, the Fallschirmjäger (paratrooper) forces had been tasked with capturing The Hague and the Dutch Royal Family. In the subsequent Battle for The Hague, German forces met heavy resistance. The French Seventh Army advancing through Belgium and the Netherlands, increasing the threat. Richthofen was ordered to throw in half of his force in the Hague battle and to attack the Scheldt estuary, near Antwerp, the Dutch border, to stop the French before they positioned themselves near the Moerdijk bridgehead. Despite thick cloud, I. and III./KG 4 and KG 54, along with Richthofen's Ju 87s, drove the <b>French</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under great pressure, the <b>French</b> {{were forced}} <b>back.</b> Bernadotte arrived with his Swedish army on the French left flank. The <b>French,</b> already falling <b>back</b> under heavy pressure, were routed. The French {{suffered}} 10,000 casualties, the Allies some 11,000.|$|R
25|$|A {{successful}} invasion required significant <b>French</b> <b>backing</b> {{but after}} the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht their priority was peace with Britain. The 1716 Anglo-French alliance removed French political and financial support for the exiled Stuarts, forcing them to leave France and settle in Rome. The birth of James' sons Charles and Henry kept the cause alive, while many British gentry visited the unofficial court in Rome regardless of political affiliation but by 1740 Stuart prospects seemed remote.|$|R
25|$|Still {{preoccupied with}} the war in France, Edward III tried again in 1354 with a simple demand of ransom, without {{settlement}} of the claim of England to superiority, but the Scots rejected this as well, perhaps because Robert Stewart was contemplating instead a stronger alliance with France. It was with <b>French</b> <b>backing</b> around 1355 that the Scottish forces began again to escalate against England. They launched a successful assault against Berwick, which fell under Scottish control.|$|R
25|$|Prussia was {{extremely}} alarmed by this development and lobbied hard {{for it to}} be reversed. In London too, there was shock at such a capitulation and Pitt recalled Cumberland to London where he was publicly rebuked by his father, the King, and forced to relinquish his commission. The terms of Klosterzeven were revoked, Hanover re-entered the war - and a new commander was selected to command the Allied Anglo-German forces. Ferdinand of Brunswick was a brother-in-law of Frederick the Great, and had developed a reputation as a competent officer. He set about trying to rally the German troops under his command, by emphasising the extent of the atrocities committed by the French troops who had occupied Hanover, and launched a counter-offensive in late 1757 driving the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> across the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|In {{a council}} {{of war on}} 2 January 1807, Buxhöwden and Bennigsen {{determined}} to take the offensive against the French. They intended to move north into East Prussia with seven divisions before turning west to attack Napoleon's left flank. The plan called for one division to remain northeast of Warsaw to distract the French. This division would soon be joined by two more that were due to arrive from Moldavia {{under the command of}} Lieutenant General Ivan Essen. Lieutenant Generals Dmitri Mikhailovich Volkonski (9th Division) and Petr Ivanovich Meller-Zakomelski (10th Division) led the two units. The Russian leaders hoped to damage Napoleon's left wing and force the French army to fall back to {{the west bank of the}} Vistula. The positions gained would be used to launch a spring campaign that might drive the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> to the Oder River.|$|E
25|$|The {{offensive}} by the French Second Army forced Falkenhayn {{to divert}} the XXI and I Bavarian corps {{as soon as they}} arrived, to extend the front northwards from Chaulnes to Péronne on 24 September and drive the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> over the Somme. Overcrowded and damaged railways behind the German front slowed the transit of German forces and infantry marched from Namur and Cambrai. On 25 September, the German reinforcements attacked, crossed the Somme south of Péronne and then advanced to take a bridge between Hem and Feuillères. A French attack north of the Somme against the II Bavarian Corps, forced a hurried withdrawal. As more Bavarian units arrived in the north, the 3rd Bavarian Division advanced north of the Somme through Bouchavesnes, Leforest and Hardecourt until held up at Maricourt. The 4th Bavarian Division further to the north, defeated the French Territorials and then attacked westwards towards Albert, through Sailly, Combles, Guillemont and Montauban.|$|E
50|$|Oribe took Rosas's {{side when}} the French navy {{blockaded}} Buenos Aires in 1838.

The Argentinian Unitarios then formed a government-in-exile in Montevideo and, with secret French encouragement, Rivera declared war on Rosas in 1839.
