25|$|June is ladylike and {{slightly}} formal in personal appearance, always seen with perfectly coiffed hair and tasteful facial makeup.

25|$|In {{the period}} of the 1930s through early 1960s, the evening glove was adapted for wear with certain high end {{lounging}} and sleeping outfits, or peignoir sets. Such gloves were typically made out of the same lightweight sheer nylon, rayon, or silk as of the lingerie set in a matching or complementary color and always of above elbow length. These gloves were introduced to bring the fashion for covered hands into the bedroom, protect skin during sleep and leisure time, and provide modesty for women during times of travel, visitation, or shared accommodation. While never widespread, these sleeping gloves were a desired component of the most expensive bedroom ensembles. Given the prevalence of gloves in mid-20th century women's fashion, a woman who added sleeping gloves to <b>her</b> <b>wardrobe</b> would have been gloved virtually at all times.|$|E

500|$|Pope's {{wardrobe}} {{is designed}} by Scandal costume designer Lyn Paolo (known for costume design on The West Wing, ER and Shameless), {{and it has}} {{caught the attention of}} the Vogue staff. In 2014, Washington's portrayal of Pope and her promotion of Pope's style earned her acclaim as a style influencer from the Accessories Council. Paolo attempted to make Pope stand apart from the black, gray and dark blue colors of DC by outfitting her in [...] "chic pastels" [...] {{going so far as to}} put her in pink pants or Louboutin shoes at times. Some of her most respected wardrobe pieces are from notable fashion houses such as Ferragamo, Burberry, Gucci, Armani, Prada, Valentino, Tory Burch, and Michael Kors. The Valentino was saved for the season 1 finale. In addition to the luxurious elements of <b>her</b> <b>wardrobe</b> that are on loan from designers, Pope wears modest elements that Paolo picks up from Nordstrom Rack, Bloomingdale's and Loehmann's. The Pope character has become somewhat of a style icon. Harper's Bazaar and Glamour analyze <b>her</b> <b>wardrobe</b> every week in a dedicated fashion watch columns. Time describes her as [...] "a real-world lifestyle tastemaker", pointing out that the Crate & Barrel wine glasses that she drinks from on the show sold out at the store. Washington and Paolo curated a Saks Fifth Avenue installation of Pope fashions in October 2013. That season, Pope's attire was part of a special collection at Saks Fifth Avenue. In September 2014, an Olivia Pope Scandal collection was set to debut at The Limited, in what was publicized as [...] "the first design collaboration between a national retailer and a top-rated network TV show, its costume designer and star". The collaboration included [...] "tops, pants, jackets and outerwear" [...] and incorporated items priced as low as $49. The collaboration includes 42 pieces. Vulture dedicated a feature to presenting every outfit Pope wore during season 2. When <b>her</b> <b>wardrobe</b> changed to more colorful and asymmetric looks in season 3, The Huffington Post dedicated a feature to this issue. During season 3, Entertainment Weekly ranked Pope's ten best outfits. Because Pope's wardrobe is pricey, there are features and websites dedicated to cheap alternatives to the exact wardrobe elements. Paolo suggests that the Pope style be purchased at Zara and Ann Taylor. In terms of jewelry, Pope wears long necklaces and exclusively wears Movado watches. She also generally uses one of her modest collection of Prada purses.|$|E

The clip sees Ferreira, dressed in underwear, applying lipstick on her entire face, and is interspersed with footage of its co-star, the spider [...] "Toby the Tarantula", crawling across her body.

Nancy's hair color was changed from blonde to strawberry-blonde, reddish-blonde, or titian {{by the end of}} the decade. The change was long rumored to have been the result of a printing ink error, but was considered so favorable that it was adopted in the text for books published after 1959, and by illustrator Polly Bolian for volumes she created for a special book club in 1959–60.|$|E

[...] Malhotra gave her a very young, [...] "girlie" [...] look. He designed clean lines with lots of colours, toning down Chopra's accessories: [...] "You will notice that none of her dresses have any embroidery or designs either.

500|$|Despite a storyline {{running over}} {{a course of}} seven days, Adrienne wears the same {{wardrobe}} throughout the entire game: an orange shirt and black pants. Williams said this is because many of Adrienne's actions throughout the game can be repeated by the player over and over, {{making it difficult to}} change <b>her</b> <b>wardrobe</b> without it becoming [...] "a nightmare of shooting". The only solutions she saw were to allow less decision-making by the player, or to keep the flexibility intact but not allow any costume changes. Williams said she decided the latter option was ultimately better for the game. An orange shirt was chosen for the character because it was the best color to shoot against the blue screen. None of the characters wear blue, purple, gray or any shade of green similar to the blue screen for that same reason.|$|E
