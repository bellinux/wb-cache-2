5|$|The storm {{contributed to}} {{numerous}} weather-related traffic accidents, {{at least one}} of them classified as major. Around 20 collisions occurred on the night of August 19 across the San Francisco Peninsula. Two crashes on Interstate 80 forced the closure of four lanes for 30 minutes, while California State Route 9 was blocked in Saratoga by a large tree which fell due to saturated soil. It is unclear how many injuries resulted from the various incidents.

25|$|The State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board {{considers}} {{the most significant}} water quality parameters <b>in</b> <b>Sonoma</b> Creek to be: turbidity, pathogens and nitrates. Turbidity is an issue because of historical problems of erosion of stream banks, especially {{in the presence of}} ongoing land development <b>in</b> <b>Sonoma</b> Valley. Increased sedimentation has a variety of adverse impacts including direct harm to aquatic organisms and the more specific impact of altering streambed gravels to reduce productivity of spawning habitats; additionally sedimentation of pools decreases the efficacy of anadromous fish summering habitat by increasing critical summer water temperatures in these pools. Pathogens appear to be linked to septic tank or leach field failures in some of the rural reaches, particularly in the upper valley sections. Nitrates enter the stream system from excess fertilizers applied to land uses in the drainage basin and may also be present in septic wastes improperly entering the creek. Sediment and nitrates may also enter the stream through urban stormwater runoff in the city of Sonoma reach.|$|E

25|$|The California Gold Rush in {{the mid-19th}} century brought waves of new {{settlers}} to the region, increasing the population and local demand for wine. The newly growing wine industry took hold in Northern California around the counties of Sonoma and Napa.

25|$|A {{diversity}} of aquatic and terrestrial organisms populate Sonoma Creek and its riparian zone. Winter-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tsawytscha), Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) {{are the most}} prominent fishes. Anadromous fish movements <b>in</b> <b>Sonoma</b> Creek have been studied extensively {{not only in the}} mainstem Sonoma Creek, but in some of the tributaries. These investigations have demonstrated a historical decline in spawning and habitat value for these species, primarily due to sedimentation and secondarily to removal of riparian vegetation since the 1800s.|$|E
