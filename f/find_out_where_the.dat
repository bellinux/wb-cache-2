2500|$|Fluorescent in situ {{hybridization}} [...] (FISH) is {{a molecular}} cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent probes that bind to only {{those parts of the}} chromosome {{with a high degree of}} sequence complementarity.

Fluorescence microscopy can be used to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> fluorescent probe is bound to the chromosomes. FISH is often used for finding specific features in DNA for use in genetic counseling, medicine, and species identification. FISH can also be used to detect and localize specific RNA targets (mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA) in cells, circulating tumor cells, and tissue samples. In this context, it can help define the spatial-temporal patterns of gene expression within cells and tissues.|$|E
