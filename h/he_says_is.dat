5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E
5|$|The Arbiter in {{the video}} games Halo 2 (2004) and Halo 3 (2007) is voiced by Keith David, a New York actor. David noted that he enjoys voicing {{complicated}} characters who have a past. To make an impact with voice acting, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> difficult—"it's either good acting or it's bad acting". David is not a frequent video game player, but stated that he has become more known for his work as the Arbiter than for his film and other voice roles.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E

25|$|The core of Prem Rawat's {{teaching}} {{is that the}} individual’s need for fulfillment can be satisfied by turning within to contact {{a constant source of}} peace and joy.

25|$|In The Work of Nations, {{he argues}} that a nation's {{competitiveness}} depends on the education and skills of its people and the infrastructure that connects them—rather than on the profitability of companies headquartered within it. Private capital, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> increasingly global and footloose—while a nation's people—its human capital—constitutes the one resource on which a nation's future standard of living uniquely depends. He urges policy makers to make such public investments the cornerstone of economic policy.|$|E
25|$|Fusanosuke Natsume {{said that}} prior to {{entering}} university, Urasawa's style showed influence from Shinji Nagashima and Osamu Tezuka's 1970s work. But claimed that in 1979 it became aligned with that of Katsuhiro Otomo. Although Urasawa's works like Yawara! had light entertainment with cute young girls, Natsume says Urasawa developed his own personal style with Monster. Which <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> realistic, or directorially based, with cinematic panel layouts similar to Otomo and gekiga artists. Natsume also noted {{that many of his}} characters resemble famous movie stars.|$|E

25|$|Rousseau {{turns to}} the topic of love, which, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> in the realm of women. Women {{naturally}} have power over men via resistance in the area of relationships and this power can be extended to the play, where women can have the same control over the audience. This extension of the empire of women is against natural order. Rousseau refers to ancient Sparta, where the most virtuous and appreciated women were those who were modest and generally not spoken about. In the decadence of France, Rousseau claims the most esteemed woman is the one who is most social, most talked about, judgmental and authoritative.|$|E
25|$|After giving Octavius the tritium, Harry {{prepares to}} kill Peter, {{only to be}} shocked to {{discover}} his real identity. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair. As Spider-Man, he arrives at the doctor's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly. Octavius discovers him and they fight once again as the nuclear reaction swells. Peter ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and persuades Octavius to let his dream go for the greater good. Octavius finally commands the tentacles to obey him, and gives his life to destroy the experiment. Mary Jane sees Spider-Man's true identity and feelings, which <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> why they cannot be together. Peter returns Mary Jane to John, and leaves.|$|E
25|$|One night, a thief fleeing through Georgetown in Washington, D.C., is {{shot by a}} man {{carrying}} a briefcase. A pizza delivery man who witnesses the incident is also shot by the killer and is left in a coma. The following morning, a young woman is killed by a Washington Metro train in {{what seems to be}} suicide. Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is distraught to hear that the woman was Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), a lead researcher on his staff. Collins, who has military experience, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a private defense contractor with controversial operations involving mercenaries. Collins tells his former college roommate and old friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), an investigative reporter, that he had been having an affair with Sonia and that she had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent and unusual behavior for someone about to commit suicide.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundation}} of Swedenborg's theology was {{laid down in}} Arcana Cœlestia (Heavenly Mysteries), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In {{a significant portion of}} that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in Apocalypse Revealed.) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the creation myth was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to Jesus Christ, and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of Genesis and Exodus.|$|E

500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment".

[...] He lamented that their expressions of nuance in gender identity and discussions of genderqueerness were absent from the broadcast edit of the show.|$|E
