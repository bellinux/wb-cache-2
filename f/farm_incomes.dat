5|$|<b>Farm</b> <b>incomes</b> {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression which {{followed}} the 1929 stock market collapse led to price deflation, massive unemployment, falling <b>farm</b> <b>incomes,</b> investment losses, bank failures, business bankruptcies and reduced government revenues.

25|$|In {{response}} to the agricultural depression of the 1930s, the government encouraged domestic production by imposing tariffs on agricultural imports. This policy enjoyed some success: the total area under cultivation increased, and <b>farm</b> <b>incomes</b> fell less sharply in Finland than in most other countries. Barriers to grain imports stimulated a return to mixed farming, and by 1938 Finland's farmers were able to meet roughly 90 percent of the domestic demand for grain.|$|E

The capacity-building aspect of the Peruvian model includes strengthening the operation and maintenance requirements of the systems, and improvement of financial performance through increased volumetric metering, water tariff structure, and collection rate. Improving financial performance of the WUBs is linked to increasing <b>farm</b> <b>incomes</b> and therefore farmers' capacity to contribute to O costs as well as irrigation improvement investments.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt was keenly {{interested}} in farm issues {{and believed that}} true prosperity would not return until farming was prosperous. Many different programs were directed at farmers. The first 100 days produced the Farm Security Act to raise <b>farm</b> <b>incomes</b> by raising the prices farmers received, which was achieved by reducing total farm output. The Agricultural Adjustment Act created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) in May 1933. The act reflected the demands of leaders of major farm organizations, especially the Farm Bureau, and reflected debates among Roosevelt's farm advisers such as Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, M.L. Wilson, Rexford Tugwell, and George Peek.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} shows that non-farm income diversification is associated with higher welfare among farm households. However, most studies have ignored market barriers and <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> risk in explaining income diversification behaviour. This study develops an analytical framework that includes both market barriers and <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> risk, {{in addition to other}} factors, in explaining income diversification behaviour. The analytical framework is used to test the hypotheses that: market barriers reduce the intensity of non-farm <b>income</b> diversification; and <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> risk increases the intensity of non-farm income diversification. The results confirm the hypotheses, suggesting that market barriers and <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> risk are key factors in explaining income diversification behaviour of farm households. Future studies should, therefore, consider the two factors in the analysis of income diversification behaviour. market barriers, <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> risk, income diversification, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Food Security and Poverty,...|$|R
30|$|Variability of <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> {{over time}} {{is high and}} most of it is coming from the revenue component. The DP {{stabilise}} <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> and this is mainly because DP are less variable than the remaining part of income. Indeed, DP are found to play a very limited countercyclical role against fluctuations of the remaining part of <b>farm</b> <b>income.</b> Finally, DP are not targeted to those farms facing the highest level of income variability. These latter two results suggest that, while DP stabilise <b>farm</b> <b>income,</b> there is a potentially large room of manoeuvre for increasing the efficiency of DP as income stabilising tool.|$|R
25|$|Before the 1980s, smallholders grew local, open-pollinated {{types of}} maize, using seed {{reserved}} from previous crops. With adequate rain, this needed 80 to 120 days to develop fully.

Local maize benefited from fertilizer, but hybrid maize yielded up to 4 tonnes per hectare only if sufficient fertilizer was applied. Growing hybrid maize required reasonable sale prices and low fertilizer costs for farmers. However, <b>farm</b> <b>incomes</b> started to declining after 1976, and from 1981 to 1986 {{the real value of}} Malawi maize producer prices fell to 40% to 60% of those of other Central and East African states.

25|$|For over a {{thousand}} years {{the basis of the}} economy in the North York Moors was agriculture. The rural scene, which attracts millions of visitors to the park each year, has been formed and maintained by generations of farmers. The 1996 Agricultural Census recorded a total workforce of 2,913 employed on 1,342 working farms. Sheep and cattle provide the prime source of farm income. The dale farms have rights to graze sheep on the open moor. The rights to moorland grazing are often essential to the economic viability of a farm. In recent years agriculture in Britain has suffered economic setbacks and the viability of hill farming has become questionable. A number of environmental schemes to improve <b>farm</b> <b>incomes</b> have been devised but the industry continues to decline.|$|E

For the second objective, which is to examine the impact of non <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> to income inequality, we used Gini decomposition techniques. Our result indicate that non <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> can improve the level of poverty or non <b>farm</b> <b>income</b> sources contributed towards poverty reduction among agricultural household. All of the poverty measures show that the inclusion of non-farm income into the agricultural household income reduce the level, depth and severity of poverty.
