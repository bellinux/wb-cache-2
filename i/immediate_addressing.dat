5000|$|The x86 {{architecture}} is a variable instruction length, primarily [...] "CISC" [...] design {{with emphasis on}} backward compatibility. The instruction set is not typical CISC, however, but basically an extended version of the simple eight-bit 8008 and 8080 architectures. Byte-addressing is enabled and words are stored in memory with little-endian byte order. Memory access to unaligned addresses is allowed for all valid word sizes. The largest native size for integer arithmetic and memory addresses (or offsets) is 16, 32 or 64 bits depending on architecture generation (newer processors include direct support for smaller integers as well). Multiple scalar values can be handled simultaneously via the SIMD unit present in later generations, as described below. <b>Immediate</b> <b>addressing</b> offsets and immediate data may be expressed as 8-bit quantities for the frequently occurring cases or contexts where a -128..127 range is enough. Typical instructions are therefore 2 or 3 bytes in length (although some are much longer, and some are single-byte).|$|E

Two 4 -hour brief Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR-B) training sessions were delivered involving sitting meditation, yoga, and body scan. Participants used the techniques 30 minutes per day for four weeks. Qualitative, individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted after the 4 -week practice period. Most felt the intervention structure was effective for learning MBSR-B. The benefit of MBSR-B was stronger for some, likely related to individual learning styles, comfort with self-discovery and sharing. The group setting helped maintain focus and accountability, but could also inhibit sharing. All participants indicated mindfulness helped reduce their stress. Enhanced self-awareness resulted in early detection of stress, ability to change negative perception, development of self-compassion, acceptance of competence, <b>immediate</b> <b>addressing</b> of stress, and use of internal coping mechanisms. Findings indicate this type of stress management support may benefit after-degree nursing students, which may prove useful when developing nursing curriculums...|$|E

The purpose of this research was to identify the key success factors of a merger and acquisition strategy given by the executives of construction companies and financial advisors who have dealt with mergers and acquisitions in South Africa. These key factors provide the construction executives with a set of recommendations which can be used as guidelines during merger and acquisition deals. Several sources of data collection were used as evidence for the research. A review of the available literature revealed ten key success factors, and these factors were used as propositions {{for the remainder of the}} research. A questionnaire containing open-ended questions, which were administered during face-to-face interviews with the various respondents were used. A content analysis was carried out on the data collected. The most significant factors identified in the study were sound implementation plans, <b>immediate</b> <b>addressing</b> of the softer key issues such as cultural differences, managing of management as well as open communication with all the relevant parties involved.

Several factors such as social networks, streaming applications, smartphones with high-quality cameras, and ubiquitous wireless connectivity are contributing to this phenomenon. Unlike isolated professional videos, live streams emerge at an unprecedented scale, poorly captured, unorganized, and lack user context. To utilize the full potential of this medium and enable new services on top, <b>immediate</b> <b>addressing</b> of open challenges is required. Smartphones are resource constrained [...] battery power is limited, bandwidth is scarce, on-board computing power and storage is insufficient to meet real-time demand. Therefore, mobile cloud computing is cited as an obvious alternative where cloud does the heavy-lifting for the smartphone. But, cloud resources are not cheap and real-time processing demands more than what the cloud can deliver. This dissertation argues that throwing cloud resources at these problems and blindly offloading computation, while seemingly necessary, may not be sufficient. Opportunities need to be identified to streamline big-scale problems by leveraging in device capabilities, thereby making them amenable to a given cloud infrastructure. One of the key opportunities, we find, is the cross-correlation between different streams of information available in the cloud. We observe that inferences on a single information stream may often be difficult, but when viewed {{in conjunction with other}} information dimensions, the same problem often becomes tractable.

We, the 2016 Arctic Task Force Team, {{have written}} this report in {{anticipation}} of the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the Arctic Council in the fall of this year. Through an in-depth analysis of the history and current state of Arctic Council governance, we seek to evaluate the short-comings and successes of Arctic policy and practice and produce a renewed vision for the future of Arctic governance, so that the next twenty years have the potential to be even more impactful. While there are a multitude of important topics and issues related to current Arctic affairs, we have chosen to report on eleven that we deem in need of <b>immediate</b> <b>addressing.</b> This report is organized in the following manner: Part I will discuss the impact and mitigation of climate change in the Arctic, focusing on the history and current state of resource extraction (Chapter 1), the effects of black carbon and methane pollution (Chapter 2), and the climate-induced displacement of Arctic communities (Chapter 3). Part II will discuss the capacity-building of Indigenous peoples in the Arctic, focusing on the promotion of food security for Inuit communities (Chapter 4), mental wellness and resilience (Chapter 5), and educational opportunities for Indigenous youth (Chapter 6). Part III will discuss the developing economic and legal structure of the Arctic, focusing on the analysis of economic development policies in the Far North (Chapter 7) and the future for international maritime law in the Arctic Ocean (Chapter 8). Part IV will discuss the future of security and cooperation in the Arctic, focusing on geopolitics and the Arctic security dilemma (Chapter 9) and search and rescue cooperation (Chapter 10). Part V will discuss the future of the Arctic Council, specifically how the Council can be reformed in order to adapt to the changing global dynamics of the North (Chapter 11) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} provides data of pH and conductivity, some anions (e. g. fluoride, chloride, bromide, nitrate, phosphate and sulphate), monovalent cations (e. g sodium, ammonium and potassium), divalent cations (e. g {{calcium and}} magnesium) heavy metals (e. g. iron, copper, zinc, nickel, cobalt, cadmium and manganese) and organic compounds – from water samples of rivers of Brunei Darussalam, namely, Brunei River, Belait River, Tutong River and Temburong River. The higher values of certain parameters {{with respect to}} the acceptable standard limits for river water indicate the pollution in river water samples of the study area, make the waters unsuitable for various applications and do pose a human health hazard. The pH levels in Brunei Darussalam is quite reassuring and mostly safe. Although there are some stretches of rivers that show slightly lower levels of pH, there is no cause for any alarm as these waterways are not sources of drinking water. As for anions and cations, the only anion of significant levels detected in Brunei Rivers is chloride whereas only monovalent cation detected in significant levels, is sodium. The concentrations of chloride and sodium ions are below the standard concentrations. Brunei Rivers are still free from chloride and sodium pollution. For heavy metals, only iron is detected in Brunei Rivers. Brunei being a oil based country experiments were done to identify levels of a numbers of significant toxic organic compounds, including, toluene and benzene which have been detected in the waters of the oil mining district of Belait District but are within normal limits. The use of a photolytic cell system to achieve the photodegradation of benzene, toluene, ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and the surfactant – hexadecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (C 19 H 42 NBr) is reported. The system has been optimised by investigating the effects of the addition of hydrogen peroxide (H 202) as an oxidant and the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) as a catalyst. The results show that the photolytic system can be used to achieve > 99 % degradation of organic contaminants. The research also includes a final chapter on management system which covers water protection, pollution control and solid waste management in Brunei. In addition to investigating various factors of the solid waste management in Brunei, the researcher has also exposed some of the weaknesses that need <b>immediate</b> <b>addressing.</b> Various measures have been suggested to make Brunei's water more efficient.
