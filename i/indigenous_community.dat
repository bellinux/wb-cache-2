5|$|The Government of the Republic of China officially recognizes {{distinct}} people groups {{among the}} <b>indigenous</b> <b>community</b> {{based upon the}} qualifications drawn up by the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP). To gain this recognition, communities must gather a number of signatures and a body of supporting evidence with which to successfully petition the CIP. Formal recognition confers certain legal benefits and rights upon a group, {{as well as providing}} them with the satisfaction of recovering their separate identity as an ethnic group. As of June 2014, 16 people groups have been recognized.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an <b>indigenous</b> <b>community</b> should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E

40|$|A {{historical}} {{backdrop of}} oppression and exploitation {{has set the}} stage for distrust in research relationships with many <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> Although distrust poses a barrier to conducting research with <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities,</b> it also provides a distinct opportunity to examine factors related to trust development. Therefore, {{the purpose of this article}} is to understand the factors that relate to trust development in research relationships with <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> in the United States. This qualitative descriptive study explored the experiences of 13 indigenous and non-indigenous researchers working with <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> Historical oppression, risk and reputation, power balancing across multiple levels, reciprocity and benevolence, and cross-cultural collaboration were emergent themes related to trust development with <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> Activities between researchers and <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> occurred within a broader context of historical oppression and were on a continuum between trust-building an...|$|R

5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far north. In 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the <b>indigenous</b> <b>community.</b> The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the <b>indigenous</b> <b>community</b> and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E
40|$|Compensation for <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> as {{a result}} of rural {{development}} projects has been a controversial subject. The elements of rights, entitlements, freedoms and justice are often difficult to value. Most of the compensation packages given to the <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> are in market values and non-market values are often ignored. The non-market values which are the social and cultural impacts are very difficult to determine and often not compensated by government. These non-market values are more important compared with market values to the <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> This paper identifies the reasons why there are conflicts between the policymakers (government) and <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> in terms of valuing compensation by reviewing the empirical literature on economic and social impacts on <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> resulting from relocation.

5|$|Tripura {{is noted}} for bamboo and cane handicrafts. Bamboo, wood and cane {{are used to}} create an array of furniture, utensils, {{hand-held}} fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials. Music and dance are integral {{to the culture of}} the state. Some local musical instruments are the sarinda, chongpreng (both string instruments), and sumui (a type of flute). Each <b>indigenous</b> <b>community</b> has its own repertoire of songs and dances performed during weddings, religious occasions, and other festivities. The Tripuri and Jamatia people perform goria dance during the Goria puja. Jhum dance (also called tangbiti dance), lebang dance, mamita dance, and mosak sulmani dance are other Tripuri dance forms. Reang community, the second largest scheduled tribe of the state, is noted for its hojagiri dance that is performed by young girls balanced on earthen pitchers. Bizhu dance is performed by the Chakmas during the Bizhu festival (the last day of the month of Chaitra in Hindu calendar). Other dance forms include wangala dance of the Garo people, hai-hak dance of the Halam branch of Kuki people, and sangrai dance and owa dance of the Mog. Alongside such traditional music, mainstream Indian musical elements such as Indian classical music and dance, Rabindra Sangeet are also practised. Sachin Dev Burman, a member of the royal family, was a maestro in the filmi genre of Indian music.|$|E

40|$|The future {{sustainability}} of remote communities is being questioned with increasing frequency. The {{current state of}} welfare dependency is fragile.

40|$|In Latin America, {{where in}} some {{countries}} the presence of <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> is still relatively high, the national governments have been confronted with moral obligations to consider the recognition and adherence to {{the human rights of}} the <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> within their domestic legislation. Nevertheless, from a legal point of view, human rights declarations do not contain any legally binding regulations, meaning that states cannot be sanctioned, which limits its value. Therefore, the main question that arises when looking at the concept of indigenous rights is about their purpose and effectiveness. The adherence and respect towards the guidelines of declarations continues to depend on influential actors such as the state, and its attitude towards the legal position of <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> is especially visible when conflicts arise that require the governments to protect certain rights of indigenous peoples. In Chile, most conflicts with the numerous <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> are caused by the mining industry. While at the one hand mining activity is the primary source of economic growth, its environmental and social impact on the lives of <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> receives growing attention by human rights rapporteurs, national and international non-governmental organizations and the representatives of the <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> This thesis is the result of an internship at a non-governmental organization in Santiago, Chile, where within the framework of Corporate Social Responsibility attention has been given to the situation of chilean <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Can the {{interests}} of both the extractive industries and <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> in the Arctic be balanced through the implementation of benefit-sharing practices in the places of resource extraction? Most transnational corporations in the Arctic oil and gas sector have declared their commitment to benefit-sharing arrangements that assist <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> and protect <b>Indigenous</b> rights to land and access to traditional resources, but the local implementation of these commitments is highly variable. Benefit-sharing arrangements between oil companies and <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> were investigated in several regions of Russia (Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Komi Republic, Yamalo-Nentsk Autonomous okrug, Irkutskaya oblast) and on the North Slope of Alaska (Barrow, Nuiqsut, Kaktovik). Research demonstrates that <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities</b> are not equally benefiting from oil and gas extraction, and moreover {{many of them are}} harmed as the industrial development threatens their traditional livelihoods of hunting, fishing, and reindeer herding. The following analysis explains how different types of benefit-sharing arrangements impact <b>Indigenous</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R
5000|$|With {{contact between}} Europeans, the black slaves that they brought, and {{indigenous}} populations, there was intermingling of the groups, with mixed-race castas, particularly mestizos, becoming {{a component of}} Spanish cities {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> The Spanish legal structure formally separated what they called the república de indios (the republic of Indians) from the república de españoles (republic of Spaniards), the latter of which encompassed all those in the Hispanic sphere: Europeans, Africans, and mixed-race castas. Although in many ways indigenous peoples were marginalized in the colonial system, [...] the paternalistic structure of colonial rule supported the continued existence and structure of <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities.</b> The Spanish crown recognized the existing ruling group, gave protection to the land holdings of <b>indigenous</b> <b>communities,</b> and communities' and individuals had access to the Spanish legal system.
