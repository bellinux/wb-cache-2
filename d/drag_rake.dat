40|$|In {{the context}} of an overall {{development}} of transonic, cryogenic wind tunnel technology, NASA has been investigating the onset of condensation effects in nitrogen gas. The temperature at which condensation occurs determines the minimum operating temperature (MOT) of cryogenic tunnels. The apparatus and airfoils are discussed, taking into account a description of the 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (TCT), the <b>drag</b> <b>rake,</b> the airfoils, and the technique used for determining the onset of condensation effects. Attention is also given to the types of nucleation processes, the relative sensitivity of <b>drag</b> <b>rake</b> and surface pressure measurements, correlations between data and theory, the prediction of minimum operating temperatures for the 0. 3 -m TCT, and MOT's for different tunnels...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{control of}} the Langley 0. 3 -meter Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (TCT) is a multivariable {{nonlinear}} control problem. Globally stable control laws were generated to hold tunnel conditions {{in the presence of}} geometrical disturbances in the test section and precisely control the tunnel states for small and large set point changes. The control laws are mechanized as four inner control loops for tunnel pressure, temperature, fan speed, and liquid nitrogen supply pressure, and two outer loops for Mach number and Reynolds number. These integrated control laws have been mechanized on a 16 -bit microcomputer working on DOS. This document details the model of the 0. 3 -m TCT, control laws, microcomputer realization, and its performance. The tunnel closed loop responses to small and large set point changes were presented. The controller incorporates safe thermal management of the tunnel cooldown based on thermal restrictions. The controller was shown to provide control of temperature to + or - 0. 2 K, pressure to + or - 0. 07 psia, and Mach number to + or - 0. 002 of a given set point during aerodynamic data acquisition in the presence of intrusive geometrical changes like flexwall movement, angle-of-attack changes, and <b>drag</b> <b>rake</b> traverse. The controller also provides a new feature of Reynolds number control. The controller provides a safe, reliable, and economical {{control of the}} 0. 3 -m TCT...|$|E
40|$|Inadequate Reynolds number {{similarity}} in testing of scaled models affects {{the quality of}} aerodynamic data from wind tunnels. This is due to scale effects of boundary-layer shock wave interaction {{which is likely to}} be severe at transonic speeds. The idea of operation of wind tunnels using test gas cooled to cryogenic temperatures has yielded a quantrum jump in the ability to realize full scale Reynolds number flow {{similarity in}} small transonic tunnels. In such tunnels, the basic flow control problem consists of obtaining and maintaining the desired test section flow parameters. Mach number, Reynolds number, and dynamic pressure are the three flow parameters that are usually required to be kept constant during the period of model aerodynamic data acquisition. The series of activity involved in modeling, control law development, mechanization of the control laws on a microcomputer, and the performance of a globally stable automatic control system for the 0. 3 -m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (TCT) are discussed. A lumped multi-variable nonlinear dynamic model of the cryogenic tunnel, generation of a set of linear control laws for small perturbation, and nonlinear control strategy for large set point changes including tunnel trajectory control are described. The details of mechanization of the control laws on a 16 bit microcomputer system, the software features, operator interface, the display and safety are discussed. The controller is shown to provide globally stable and reliable temperature control to + or - 0. 2 K, pressure to + or - 0. 07 psi and Mach number to + or - 0. 002 of the set point value. This performance is obtained both during large set point commands as for a tunnel cooldown, and during aerodynamic data acquisition with intrusive activity like geometrical changes in the test section such as angle of attack changes, <b>drag</b> <b>rake</b> movements, wall adaptation and sidewall boundary-layer removal. Feasibility of the use of an automatic Reynolds number control mode with fixed Mach number control is demonstrated...|$|E

5000|$|A sand {{cleaning}} machine, beach cleaner, or (colloquially) sandboni is {{a vehicle}} that <b>drags</b> a <b>raking</b> or sifting device over beach sand to remove rubbish and other foreign matter. They are manually self-pulled vehicles on tracks or wheels or pulled by quad-bike or tractor. Seaside cities use beach cleaning machines to combat the problems of litter left by beach patrons and other pollution washed up on their shores. A chief task in beach cleaning strategies is finding {{the best way to}} handle waste matter on the beaches, taking into consideration beach erosion and changing terrain. Beach cleaning machines work by collecting sand by way of a scoop or drag mechanism and then raking or sifting anything large enough to be considered foreign matter, including sticks, stones, litter and other items. Similar applications include lake beaches, sandfields for beach volleyball and kindergarten and playing field sandpits. The word [...] "sandboni" [...] is a back-formation referencing the ice-surfacing machine Zamboni.|$|R
50|$|Routine {{operations}} involved two trains moving ten {{or twelve}} loaded pulpwood cars south from Eagle Lake to Umbazooksus Lake, and empty pulpwood cars northward in a round trip taking about 3 hours. The two trains would pass at a midpoint siding. One Plymouth switcher shunted loading cars at Eagle Lake and the other shunted unloading cars at Umbazooksus Lake. The inland rail of the 600-foot (180 m) long pulpwood unloading pier was six inches (15 cm) higher than the lakeside rail to expedite unloading. The floor of each pulpwood car sloped 12 inches (30 cm) to the unloading side; and the slatted {{side of the car}} was hinged at the top to swing open when latches were released so the pulpwood would slide out of the car into Umbazooksus Lake. Bark breaking off the pulpwood logs accumulated so the Plymouth switcher periodically <b>dragged</b> a <b>rake</b> adjacent to the pier to keep the water deep enough to float the pulpwood logs being dumped. Normal operations transferred 6,500 cords of pulpwood per week enabling Great Northern Paper Company to manufacture approximately one fifth of the United States' annual paper production.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{obtain a}} check {{list of the}} {{attached}} algae and flowering plants associated with the marine environment in the Corpus Christi Bay area. Procedure: Vegetation was noted and samples collected in the field. Speci-mens were taken from periodically inundated salt flats and from submerged areas. A <b>rake,</b> <b>dragged</b> along the bottom, was used to obtain specimens from the benthic division. Collected specimens were preserved in bay water with 2 % formalin. Findings: The heaviest growth and greatest variety of attached algae was found in lower Red Fish Bay and along the eastern portion of Corpus Christi Bay extending from lower Shamrock Cove northward to the shipping channel. Flowering plans grow on the eastern salt flats and along the shorelines of spoil banks. Observed algae {{was found to be}} both epiphytic or epizooic, i. e. attached to other plans or animals. Most of the benthic forms were, however, lithophytic i. e. attached to sand, mud or shell. Only general observations were made as to density of growth and distribution, Bottom vegetation in the southern, western, northern and central areas o...|$|R
