40|$|The {{inventory}} routing problem {{considered in}} this paper {{is concerned with the}} repeated distribution of a commodity, such as <b>heating</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>over</b> {{a long period of time}} to a large number of customers. The problem involves a central depot as well as various satellite facilities which the drivers can visit during their shift to refill their vehicles. The customers maintain a local inventory of the commodity. Their consumption varies daily and cannot be predicted deterministically. In case of a stockout, a direct delivery is made and a penalty cost is incurred. In this paper we present incremental cost approximations to be used in a rolling horizon framework for the problem of minimizing the total expected annual delivery costs...|$|R
50|$|At 10:20 AM on November 2, 2007, {{a tanker}} truck {{carrying}} <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> plowed <b>over</b> the divider, knocking {{the side of}} a tractor trailer and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his Pit Bull canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} is a summary report of the New Hampshire Governor`s Office of Energy and Community Services (ECS) participation in the State <b>Heating</b> <b>Oil</b> and Propane Program (SHOPP) for the 1997 / 98 heating season. SHOPP is a cooperative effort, linking energy offices in East Coast and Midwest states, with the Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA) {{for the purpose of}} collecting retail price data for <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> and propane. The program is funded by the participating state with a matching grant from DOE. SHOPP was initiated in response to congressional inquires into supply difficulties and price spikes of <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> and propane associated with the winter of 1989 / 90. This is important to New Hampshire because <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> controls <b>over</b> 55 % of the residential heating market statewide. Propane controls 10 % of the heating market statewide and is widely used for water heating and cooking in areas of the state where natural gas is not available. Lower installation cost, convenience, lower operating costs compared to electricity, and its perception as a clean heating fuel have all worked to increase the popularity of propane in New Hampshire and should continue {{to do so in the}} future. Any disruption in supply of these heating fuels to New Hampshire could cause prices to skyrocket and leave many residents in the cold...|$|R
50|$|Hess Oil and Chemical Corporation was {{a company}} {{begun in the}} 1930s by Leon Hess of New Jersey to {{distribute}} <b>heating</b> <b>oil.</b> It expanded <b>over</b> the years to include refining and marketing of <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> and other petroleum products through terminals and gasoline stations. In 1968, Hess Oil and Chemical Corporation merged with Amerada Petroleum Corporation into Amerada Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES). Since 2006, the merged company has been called Hess Corporation. Before the merger, Hess Oil and Chemical developed the Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corporation (HOVIC) Refinery on St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, {{at the time the}} largest oil refinery in the world. After 1998 the refinery built by HOVIC operated under the name HOVENSA. It is a joint venture with PDVSA and is 50% owned by Hess Corporation.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact of {{temperature}} shock on both near-month and far-month natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns by extending the weather and storage models of the previous study. Several notable findings from the empirical studies are presented. First, the expected temperature shock significantly and positively affects both the near-month and far-month natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns. Next, significant temperature shock has effect on both the conditional mean and volatility of natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> prices. The results indicate that expected inventory surprises significantly and negatively affects the far-month natural gas futures returns. Moreover, volatility of natural gas futures returns is higher on Thursdays and that of near-month <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns is higher on Wednesdays than other days. Finally, it is found that storage announcement for natural gas significantly affects near-month and far-month natural gas futures returns. Furthermore, both natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns are affected more by the weighted average temperature reported by multiple weather reporting stations than that reported by a single weather reporting station...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between energy consumption and economic growth in Switzerland over the period 1950 – 2010. We apply bounds testing techniques to different energy types separately. Robustness tests are performed by including additional variables and restricting the analysis to the period after 1970. The results show that there exist robust long run relationships going from real GDP towards <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> and electricity consumption. The relationship between <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> and GDP is in fact bidirectional, although weaker from <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> towards GDP than in the reverse direction. When investigating the period 1970 – 2010 only, the estimate of the long run income elasticity of electricity consumption loses statistical significance and that for <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> becomes negative. Those results imply a possible decoupling between GDP growth and energy consumption, so that energy conservation policies are not necessarily {{expected to have a}} negative impact on Swiss economic growth...|$|R
