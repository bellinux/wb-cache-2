The diaphragm wall retains a 14. 5 m deep multi-propped excavation in soft clays in Shanghai, P. R. China. At this greenfield site, the maximum ground surface settlement (delta(v-max)) {{at the end}} of excavation ranged from 0. 25 % to 0. 32 % of the final excavation depth (He), and the influence <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> surface settlement was more than 2. 5 H(e) behind the wall. Both the measured delta(v-max) and the influence <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> settlements at this site are generally larger than for excavations in other, more densely built areas of Shanghai. Force and moment equilibrium analyses of the instrumented panel validate the reliability of the measured earth pressures and prop forces. The measured prop loads from this greenfield site are generally larger than those reported from similar excavations in Shanghai. Earth pressure measurements reveal that concreting of the diaphragm wall panel increased the lateral earth pressure coefficients at the soil/wall interface by a factor of more than 1. 4. The stress paths for the retained soil within the propped region generally moved towards the passive state during the last few stages of main excavation, and soil near the formation level approached the passive failure state prior to the completion of excavation...|$|R

Shearing periodically occurs between the westward moving pack ice (3 to 10 km/d) within the Pacific Gyre and the fast ice along the coast, forming major grounded shear and pressure ridges between the 10 to 40 m isobaths.

Here, we present the results of paleoliquefaction investigations from four sites in the plains of north Bihar and one in eastern Uttar Pradesh. The liquefaction features generated by successive earthquakes were dated at AD 829 - 971, 886 - 1090, 907 - 1181, 1130 - 1376, 1112 - 1572, 1492 - 1672, 1733 - 1839, and 1814 - 1854. One of the liquefaction events dated at AD 829 - 971, 886 - 1090, and 907 - 1181 may correlate with the great earthquake of AD similar to 1100, recognized in an earlier study from the sections across the frontal thrust in central eastern Nepal.

40|$|Understanding flood risk in Morayshire has {{required}} {{the adoption of}} a holistic work programme that brought together a multidisciplinary scientific team who used a variety of modelling techniques to investigate groundwater and coastal flood risk within the Lower Findhorn Catchment in Morayshire, N. E. Scotland. This work, which has been largely funded by Moray Council, delimits potential <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> water flooding and has informed the design and construction of flood defences, in parts of the catchment where both commercial and residential properties were at risk. It also assessed the potential for coastal flooding of the low-lying coastal zone. Determining the nature of the complex shallow Quaternary strata and the degree of continuity, heterogeneity and relative permeability of packages of sediment in 3 D was critical to establishing the areas at risk <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> water flooding. A ‘source to sink approach’ was adopted covering not only the floodplain of the River Findhorn, but also the interfluves and the surrounding coastal zone. This was achieved by construction of a GSI 3 D model of the shallow geology, based on extensive and detailed field investigation of the catchment geology, but also informed by conceptual models of the glacial and postglacial evolution of North East Scotland. The model was calibrated by borehole drilling and trial pitting, and subsequently reattributed with permeability values based on pumping test results and geotechnical analyses. The resulting 3 D distribution of shallow subsurface permeability provided a major set of parameters for ZOOM groundwater modelling. This was used, together with outputs from third party hydrological models, to model groundwater flow directions, changes in the water table relative to base level (sea level), and to establish the potential groundwater component of river flooding in the catchment. Regional modelling of changes in Relative Sea Level is also and important component in determining the probable future trends in flood risk in the Lower Findhorn. Unusually for the UK, conceptual models and proxies indicate that little rise in sea level has occurred during the last 100 years and that the coastline is prograding. Consequently, modelling indicates that the risk of inundation of this low-lying portion of Morayshire by coastal flooding is slight, when compared to that from river flooding events. ...|$|R
40|$|Past {{applications}} of electrical resistivity surveying have particularly focused on areas <b>of</b> subsurface <b>ground</b> investigations to locate boulder, bedrock, water table, etc. Traditionally, electrical resistivity surveys were directed by an expert geophysicist for data acquisition, processing and interpretation.

The anomalies highlighted uncertain geotechnical conditions that were often irregular and dependent on individual site condition, yielding a site-dependent electrical resistivity value (ERV) for the ground. This study therefore identifies co-relationships between ERV and some basic geotechnical properties (BGP) such as soil moisture content, grain size of geomaterial, density, porosity, void ratio, and Atterberg limit. Different soil {{samples were collected}} and tested under both field and laboratory conditions. Basic geotechnical properties of the samples were obtained immediately after the electrical resistivity measurements were made.

40|$|Integrated geophysical, geochemical and hydrogeological {{modelling}} {{techniques have}} been used in this PhD research study to characterise the ground contamination at four study sites. The primary aim of the research is to study the efficiency of using an integrated approach to study hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination in the subsurface soil, geology and groundwater systems. Each of the four sites have different industrial legacies (hence types of contamination) and periods of operation. The sites in increasing age are: Bromsgrove landfill, Cathays Railway Depot, Barry Docks and Weston-Super-Mare gasworks. The geophysical methods used in this study are Electrical Resistivity imaging (IRIS) and multifrequency ground conductivity (Gem- 2). These techniques can map the electrical properties of the sub-surface in both 2 D and 3 D. The electrical properties are then compared with independent professional geochemical sampling programmes for both soil and groundwater. The results of this project show that the geophysical methods provide a clear indication <b>of</b> the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> contamination (hydrocarbons and heavy metals) in both 2 D and 3 D. Electrical resistivity/conductivity mapping using both independent techniques show consistent results. The geophysical results also show a good correlation with the geochemical sampling programmes for soil, water and gas. The results are encouraging in that geophysics could be used more widely in professional contaminated land site investigations to supplement conventional invasive techniques and sampling programmes. The research has also investigated whether geophysical parameters such as electrical conductivity {{could be used as a}} groundwater modelling parameter in the Visual Modflow software. The advantage being that geophysics can provide a high intensity of data in 3 D and even temporal 4 D at a site. The geophysical results can define an accurate spatial distribution of the contaminated area. This can be used to assign a ‘concentration recharge’ in the modelling compared to the normal practice of using chemical data from a small number of discrete sampling points. However this approach will still require chemical data for validation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Reinforcing concrete with steel fibers does not affect the stiffness considerably, but the stability of models in loading and unloading increases. As expected, by the addition of steel fibers to the concrete mix, the absorption and dissipation of energy increase, but because of the limitation of damage at the length of the specimens the viscous damping decreases.|$|R

40|$|Daylight {{is present}} in {{tropical}} regions in a considerable intensity throughout the year. The sky characteristics are changeable and sunlight cannot be disregarded. Daylighting techniques are still wanted to answer particular tropical features. The main aim of this thesis is to present a daylighting analysis tool for the tropics developed out of existing procedures. It is structured in three parts. The first part provides a broad view of climatic aspects related to daylighting studies in a typical tropical city - Maceiö, Brazil. A brief climatic description {{of the city and}} a study relating climate and building are followed by a literature review of climatic fundamentals. A study is made of meteorological station measurements in relation to the city and a field investigation is described. These lead to a simplified method for sky type selection. It shows that a reasonable assumption about daylight climate can be made from very simple data and that new structure of CIE standard general sky could be applied everywhere. The second part investigates methods that could be appropriated for calculating daylighting in humid climates and concludes with a methodology based on an adaptation of existing techniques. The Monte Carlo and ray tracing techniques are reviewed, as well as the daylight coefficients concept. These are incorporated in prototype software, TropLux, written in MATLAB code. The development of the method in this thesis can be seen {{as an extension of the}} daylight factor concept to the CIE Standard General Sky and reflected sunlight. The software validation is done and results show that the level of prediction is comparable with those produced by Radiance and overall the results appear to be robust. Analysis indicates that it is not essential to have climate-specific calculation technique. Universal lighting software is viable, providing the local climate and architectural characteristics are taken into account. The last part applies TropLux to ground-reflected light.
