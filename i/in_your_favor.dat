25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>favor.</b>|$|E
500|$|Western gaming {{sites have}} also been very positive. Andrew Alfonso of IGN, {{reporting}} on the TGS 2004 demo, called the battle system [...] "very fun", and was generally impressed with the visual style {{with the exception of}} the world map. His main faults with the game were recurring issues with AI controls seen in previous games, but he made allowances for the fact that the version tested was a demo build. Anoop Gantayat, also writing for IGN when the game was released, was also impressed by the game, citing how quickly the game brought players into the action and how the battle mechanics had been improved over those in Destiny. GameSpy's Heidi Kemps was favorably impressed by the game, but had reservations as to whether it could improve on Symphonia. Siliconera writer Rolando, writing after the announcement of the PSP port, praised the game's ability to straddle the line between old and new, stating [...] "this Tales really is a good Tales game that, while retaining a somewhat oldschool Tales charm, manages to reinvent the original formula and introduce a ton of good ideas that worked <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>favor</b> and made character customization fun." [...] RPGFan writer Zain was highly positive about the game: he cited the graphics is beautiful barring a few reservations about dungeons and the overworld map, praised the voice acting, and was generally positive about the story and characters. He also commented that the game was easier than previous Tales titles, and ended by calling it [...] "one of the strongest games of this hardware generation, if not of all time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Phaedrus and Socrates {{walk through}} a stream and find {{a seat in the}} shade, and Phaedrus commences to repeat Lysias' speech. Beginning with [...] "You understand, then, my situation: I've told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out", the speech {{proceeds}} to explain all the reasons why it is better to give <b>your</b> <b>favor</b> to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving <b>your</b> <b>favor</b> to someone who is [...] "more sick than sound in the head" [...] and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give <b>your</b> <b>favor</b> to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.|$|R
