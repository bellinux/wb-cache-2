40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} long-term {{outcomes of}} laronidase enzyme replacement therapy {{in patients with}} attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I. Study designRetrospective analyses of case notes, laboratory results, and data from clinical trials were used to evaluate urinary glycosaminoglycans, forced vital capacity (FVC), 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT), height-for-age Z score, cardiac valve function, corneal clouding, and visual acuity in 35 patients with attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I (<b>Hurler-Scheie</b> and Scheie <b>syndromes)</b> for up to 10 years following the initiation of laronidase therapy. ResultsStatistically significant (P[*]<[*]. 001) reductions in mean urinary glycosaminoglycan levels relative to baseline were observed 6 months after treatment initiation and were sustained throughout follow-up. Disease remained stable after treatment initiation with no statistically significant changes in mean FVC, 6 MWT, or height-for-age Z score. At last assessments, mitral and aortic valve function remained stable in 65 % (22 / 34) of patients; corneal clouding remained stable in 78 % (18 / 23); visual acuity remained stable in 33 % (8 / 24) and improved in 42 % (10 / 24) of patients. Younger patients (< 10 years at treatment initiation) maintained disease measures closer to norms for age for FVC, 6 MWT, and height and showed fewer deteriorations in mitral and aortic valve disease and corneal clouding compared with patients aged ≥ 10 years at treatment initiation. ConclusionLaronidase treatment resulted in disease stabilization {{in the majority of}} patients with a mean follow-up of 6. 1 years.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to assess how the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) have changed over time. We used data from 891 patients in the MPS I Registry, an international observational database, to analyze ages at symptom onset, diagnosis, treatment initiation, and treatment allocation (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase, both, or neither) over time for all disease phenotypes (Hurler, <b>Hurler–Scheie,</b> and Scheie <b>syndromes).</b> The interval between diagnosis and treatment has become shorter since laronidase became available in 2003 (gap during 2006 – 2009 : Hurler— 0. 2  year, Hurler–Scheie— 0. 5  year, Scheie— 1. 4  years). However, the age at diagnosis has not decreased for any MPS I phenotype over time, and the interval between symptom onset and treatment initiation remains substantial for both Hurler–Scheie and Scheie patients (gap during 2006 – 2009, 2. 42 and 6. 71  years, respectively). Among transplanted patients, an increasing proportion received hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood (34 out of 64 patients by 2009) and was also treated with laronidase (42 out of 45 patients by 2009). Conclusions: Despite the availability of laronidase since 2003, the diagnosis of MPS I is still substantially delayed for patients with Hurler–Scheie and Scheie phenotypes, which can lead to a sub-optimal treatment outcome. Increased awareness of MPS I signs and symptoms by primary care providers and pediatric subspecialists is crucial to initiate early treatment and {{to improve the quality of}} life of MPS I patients...|$|R
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (i. e., Hurler, <b>Hurler-Scheie,</b> and Scheie <b>syndromes)</b> {{and type}} II (i. e., Hunter syndrome) are {{lysosomal}} storage disorders resulting from alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency and iduronate- 2 -sulfatase (IDS) deficiency, respectively. The {{a priori probability}} that both disorders would occur in a single individual is approximately 1 in 5 billion. Nevertheless, such a proband was referred for whom clinical findings (i. e., a male with characteristic facies, dysostosis multiplex, and mental retardation) and biochemical tests indicated these concomitant diagnoses. In repeated studies, leukocyte 4 methylumbelliferyl-alpha-L-iduronidase activities in this kindred were as follows: 4) -D-O- 2, 5 -anhydro[1 - 3 H]mannitol- 6 - sulfate activities were as follows: 0. 0 U/mg protein/h in the proband; 5. 7 in his sister; 4. 9 in mother; and 15. 0 in father (normal range 11. 0 - 18. 4). Multiple techniques, including automated sequencing of the entire IDS and IDUA coding regions, were employed to unravel the molecular genetic basis of these intriguing observations. The common IDS mutation R 468 W was identified in the proband, his mother, and his sister, thus explaining their biochemical phenotypes. Additionally, the proband, his sister, and his father {{were found to be}} heterozygous for a common IDUA mutation, W 402 X. Notably, a new IDUA mutation A 300 T was also identified in the proband, his sister, and his mother, accounting for reduced IDUA activity in these individuals; the asymptomatic sister, whose cells demonstrated normal glycosaminoglycan metabolism, is thus a compound heterozygote for W 402 X and the new allele.

40|$|Background Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) {{comprises}} {{a spectrum}} of clinical manifestations and {{is divided into three}} phenotypes reflecting clinical severity: Hurler, <b>Hurler-Scheie,</b> and Scheie <b>syndromes.</b> There may be important variations in clinical manifestations of this genetic disease in patients residing in different regions of the world. Methods Using data from the MPS I Registry (as of September 2009), we evaluated patients from Latin America (n= 118) compared with patients {{from the rest of the}} world [ROW (n= 727) ]. Results Phenotype distribution differed among patients in Latin America compared to ROW(Hurler 31 vs. 62 %, Hurler-Scheie 36 vs. 21 %, Scheie 10 vs. 11 %, and unknown 22 vs. 6 %). the frequency of certain symptoms, such as cardiac valve abnormalities, sleep impairment, and joint contractures, also differed between Latin America and ROW for some phenotypes. Median age at MPS I diagnosis was earlier in the ROW than Latin America for all phenotypes, and age at first treatment for Hurler and Hurler-Scheie patients was also earlier in the ROW. Hurler patients in Latin America showed a gap of 3. 1 years between median ages of diagnosis and first treatment compared to only 0. 5 years in the ROW. Treatment allocation in Latin America compared to ROW was as follows: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) only, 80 vs. 45 %; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) only, 0. 9 vs. 27 %; both ERT and HSCT, 0 vs. 16 %; and neither treatment, 19 vs. 13 %. Conclusion These data highlight important differences in MPS I patients between Latin America and ROW in terms of phenotypic distribution, clinical manifestations, and treatment practices.

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} {{studies were}} performed on the rectal mucosa from patients with mucopolysac-charidoses, mucolipidoses and sphingolipidoses. The following results were obtained. 1) Ultrastructural studies of the rectal mucosa obtained by biopsy using intestinal biopsy capsule {{were found to be}} useful in the diagnosis of lysosomal storage disease. 2) Between each pathological state a characteristic difference in intracellular accumulative deposits was seen in its distribution, volume and morphology. 3) Unlike mucolipidoses and sphingolipidoses, the intracellular accumulative deposits could not be seen in the endothelial cells in mucopolysaccharidoses. 4) Although an identical enzyme (a-L-iduronidase) {{is believed to be the}} underlying enzymatic defectof Hurle's <b>syndrome,</b> <b>Hurler-Scheie</b> compound and Scheie's syndrome, the intracellular accumulativedeposits in Schwann cells were found in Hurler's syndrome, but could not be seen in Hurler-Scheiecompound and Scheie's syndrome. 5) In Morquio's syndrome, the intracellular accumulative deposits were limited to histiocytes unlikeother mucopolysaccharidoses. 6) In Gsu-gangliosidosis type 2, the intracellular accumulative deposits showed characteristic struc-tures. These were limited to histiocytes unlike other mucolipidoses. 7) In a new type of mucolipidosis,described by Horino et al., the characteristic intracellularaccumulative deposits different from those in other mucolipidoses were seen in the histiocytes and Schwann cells. 8) Intracellular accumulative deposits in sphingolipidoses were characteristic each entity. In Tay-Sachs disease, the intracellular accumulative deposits were observed in Schwann cells and axons. In Gaucher's disease, no Gaucher cells or intracellular accumulative deposits could be seen in the lamina propria. In Niemann-Pick disease (acute neuronopathic form, type A), intracellular accumulative deposits were observed in the majority of cells of the lamina propria, but in Niemann-Pick disease (chronic nonneuro-nopathic form, type B), no intracellular accumulative deposits could be seen in Schwann cells and axons. 9) It is suggested that the presence and volume of intracellular accumulative deposits in Schwann cells and axons correlate to the degree of the mental retardation in the studied cases. 10) In the comparative studies of the various stages of the disease, an increase of intracellular accumulative deposits in histiocytes and Schwann cells occured in Hurler's syndrome; the number of histiocytes containing intracellular accumulative deposits increased in Gm-gangliosidosis type 1, and increases in the type of cells containing intracellular accumulative deposits occured in Mucolipidosis II, in advanced stages.

Here we review the pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that have been used to demonstrate that intravenous laronidase therapy is well tolerated and effective for treating MPS I patients who do not have neuronal pathology. Current challenges for a viable treatment strategy for all MPS I patients include development of an early screening protocol that identifies patients before the onset of irreversible pathology, methods to predict disease severity, appropriate treatment for neuropathology, and an effective patient monitoring regimen.

40|$|A disease {{discovered}} in three Plott Hound littermates {{was found to}} be associated with a profound and specific deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (mucopolysaccharide alpha-L-iduronohydrolase; EC 3. 2. 1. 76) in fibroblasts and leukocytes. The pedigree was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. A markedly increased amount of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate was excreted in urine. Fibroblasts cultured from the skin of the affected dogs accumulated excessive 35 S-labeled mucopolysaccharide; this accumulation could be decreased to a normal level by exogenous human high-uptake alpha-L-iduronidase (Hurler corrective factor) as well as by secretions of normal human or canine fibroblasts. The correction was inhibited by mannose 6 -phosphate. Maturation of alpha-L-iduronidase in normal canine fibroblasts followed the pathway previously observed in human fibroblasts; no cross-reactive material was observed in the cells or in secretions from the fibroblasts of the affected dogs. The canine disorder thus resembles mucopolysaccharidosis I in all biochemical parameters tested; the clinical appearance of the animals is closest to <b>Hurler-Scheie</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a form of alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency of intermediate severity.

40|$|Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is an {{inherited}} metabolic disease caused by deficiency of the enzymes needed for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) degradation. MPS type I {{is caused by}} the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase and is classified into Hurler syndrome, Scheie syndrome, and <b>Hurler–Scheie</b> <b>syndrome</b> based on disease severity and onset. Cardiac complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac valve disease, and coronary artery disease are often observed in MPS type I. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been available for MPS type I, but the efficacy of this treatment for cardiac valve disease is unknown. We report on a 56 -year-old female patient with attenuated MPS I (Scheie syndrome) who developed aortic and mitral stenosis and coronary artery narrowing. The cardiac valve disease progressed despite ERT and she finally underwent double valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. The pathology of the cardiac valves revealed GAG accumulation and lysosomal enlargement in both the mitral and aortic valves. Zebra body formation was also confirmed using electron microscopy.

40|$|AbstractMucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I; McKusick 25280; Hurler syndrome, <b>Hurler–Scheie</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Scheie syndrome) {{is caused}} by a {{deficiency}} in the lysosomal hydrolase, α-l-iduronidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 76). MPS I patients present within a clinical spectrum bounded by the extremes of Hurler and Scheie syndromes. The α-l-iduronidase missense mutations R 89 Q and R 89 W were investigated and altered an important arginine residue proposed to be a nucleophile activator in the catalytic mechanism of α-l-iduronidase. The R 89 Q α-l-iduronidase mutation was shown to result in a reduced level of α-l-iduronidase protein (≤ 10 % of normal control) compared to a normal control level of α-l-iduronidase protein that was detected for the R 89 W α-l-iduronidase mutation. When taking into account α-l-iduronidase specific activity, the R 89 W mutation had a greater effect on α-l-iduronidase activity than the R 89 Q mutation. However, overall the R 89 W mutation produced more residual α-l-iduronidase activity than the R 89 Q mutation. This was consistent with MPS I patients, with an R 89 W allele, having a less severe clinical presentation compared to MPS I patients with either a double or single allelic R 89 Q mutation. The effects of the R 89 Q and R 89 W mutations on enzyme activity supported the proposed role of R 89 as a nucleophile activator in the catalytic mechanism of α-l-iduronidase...|$|E
