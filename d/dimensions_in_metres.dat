5000|$|Distance {{signs are}} {{specified}} with miles or yards {{as the only}} allowable units. Vehicle height, width, and length limit signs are required to use feet and inches, with equivalent <b>dimensions</b> <b>in</b> <b>metres,</b> typically to one decimal place, allowed as optional secondary information. In 2014, following a consultation by the DfT, {{it was announced that}} the use of dual units on height and width restriction signs would become mandatory as of March 2015. The values on new weight limit signs are expressed in tonnes and since the introduction of regulation amendments in 2011, require the character [...] "t" [...] to be used as the symbol for tonnes, in accordance with the SI convention ("18 t" [...] for example). Earlier regulations also allowed the use of the character [...] "T" [...] ("7.5 T" [...] for example), so older signs using this notation are also in use; this notation conflicts with the SI symbol for the tesla. Speed limits are in miles per hour, most commonly with no units shown on the signs.|$|E
