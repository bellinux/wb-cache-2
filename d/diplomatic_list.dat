50|$|After Macedonia {{became an}} {{independent}} country in late 1991 with {{the breakup of}} Yugoslavia, Acevska, on her visits {{to the land of}} her birth, would often urge government officials there to send a representative to Washington. Eventually, President Kiro Gligorov asked her to take on that job, in what was intended to be only a temporary arrangement lasting for two months. She stepped down from her position at Gulf Enterprises in order to focus on the new appointment. At that point, the United States did not yet formally recognize Macedonia, which had several implications for her role. Rather than being accredited as an ambassador and appearing on the State Department's <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>List,</b> she instead registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. With a budget of only $40,000 per year from the Macedonian government, she took on both diplomatic tasks such as debt negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and dealing with complaints from the State Department about Macedonia's adherence to voluntary export restraints or alleged violations of sanctions against Serbia, and consular tasks such as travel advice to Macedonians holding expired Yugoslav passports.|$|E

40|$|Bilateral {{diplomacy}} is typically portrayed as under threat by European integration, which has forged direct links between sectoral ministries, introduced an all-embracing policy arena in Brussels and, arguably, rendered traditional embassy representation irrelevant. This paper questions whether this thesis indeed holds sway, inspired by insights from historical institutionalism. Drawing {{on data from}} <b>diplomatic</b> service <b>lists</b> we present a time-series analysis of embassy staff allocation. The results from five foreign services point towards maintained representation in EU 15 and a strong increase in EU 16 - 27, in line with an expectation of institutional robustness. As regards variation between the foreign services, convergence in representation patterns is a dominant trend. Furthermore, it is suggested, where the foreign ministry has a strong position, changes in the allocation of embassy staff will be less radical. Among the cases, France points itself out by its high and increasing priority of embassies in EU 15.

50|$|The North Atlantic Treaty {{gave the}} NAC {{the power to}} set up {{subsidiary}} bodies for various policy functions, including a defense committee to implement {{other parts of the}} treaty. Since 1952, the NAC has been in permanent session. The NAC can be held at the Permanent Representative Level (PermReps), or can be composed of member states' Ministers of State, Defense, or Heads of Government. The NAC has the same powers regardless of the formation it meets under. The NAC meets twice a week: every Tuesday, for an informal lunch discussion; and every Wednesday for a decision-taking session. Usually, meetings occur amongst the Permanent Representatives who are the senior permanent member of each delegation and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that <b>diplomatic</b> rank).

50|$|Karski's date {{of birth}} is {{sometimes}} given as 24 April 1914, based on his baptismal records in Russian and subsequently figuring on his official birth certificate. The Diploma for his master's degree (awarded in 1935) and the Certificate from the Artillery Reserve Officer Cadet School (awarded in 1936) both reflect his 24 April birthday. This is why some Karski tribute organizations also recognize the date as 24 April, as does the Google Cultural Institute's documentation, Museum of Polish History and the Museum of the City of Łódź, to which Karski left his papers, awards and artwork. The United States Senate withdrew 24 April as Jan Karski day from the final passed resolution in the Congressional Record, according to Polish Press Agency, citing Ms. Urbanska who lobbied for the day. Their colleagues at the Polish Senate did the same, according {{to the office of}} Bogdan Borusewicz. Some documents handwritten by Jan Karski before WWII list the 24 June date, most importantly his official handwritten resume. All US documents list 11 April, including passport and social security card. Polish PWN Encyclopedia recognizes the date as 22 April. Another variant is on his <b>diplomatic</b> passport which <b>lists</b> his birthday as 22 March 1912. The error reflected in his war-time documents probably served Karski well in his profession.|$|R
40|$|Very little {{critical}} {{work has}} been done on collections of charters surviving from medieval Scotland. Using cutting-edge methodologies, this study deconstructs the largest of these collections, namely the Kelso Abbey cartulary, and attempts to answer questions such as when, why and how was it produced, and is its content authentic? Ultimately, it concludes that the manuscript is not a straightforward, objective transcript of the monastery’s charters, and evidence to support this is presented in four chapters, a conclusion and two commentary sections. Chapter one demonstrates that the production of the cartulary was tied to a specific period in the abbey’s history and was certainly produced as part of a campaign to rebuild after the wars of the early fourteenth century and their ramifications. These ramifications included the destruction of the monks’ charters, the destruction of their home and property, and the upheaval of the native landholding establishment by King Edward I and King Robert I. Chapter two reinforces the above suggestions by dating the production of the manuscript between 1321 and 1326 - i. e. the precise years in which King Robert was working to help many of the religious houses in Scotland to reassert themselves after the war. Apart from contextual considerations, chapter two also establishes that the cartulary is not a completely accurate representation of the documentation in the monastery’s archive. Among other things, portions of the manuscript appear to be missing, and the scribes who produced it adopted selection criteria which led to the omission of charters or of diplomatic. Thereafter, chapters three and four evaluate the authenticity of the material in the manuscript. Chapter three demonstrates that there are severe problems with the information, <b>diplomatic,</b> witness <b>lists</b> and other features found in a number of its charters, and chapter four demonstrates that these items share a number of conspicuous features in common, including their locations, conditions and the circumstances which appear to have led to their production. In combination, chapters three and four build a strong case against the authenticity of a number of items in the manuscript, and both of these discussions are complemented by exhaustive commentaries which discuss each of the problematic charters in detail. Finally, this study concludes by demonstrating that certain features of the Kelso Abbey cartulary appear to call into question the veracity of several well-established paradigms, including the notion that cartularies were created for the sole use of the inhabitants of religious communities. It also suggests that the consequences of the Anglo-Scottish wars in the early fourteenth century may be comparable to the consequences of the Norman Conquest of 1066 in terms of inspiring religious houses, like Kelso, to forge charters, and it builds a strong case that this needs to be an area of future inquiry.

40|$|This text {{contains}} an annotated translation into German of Huang Xingzeng's Xiyang chaogong dianlu (Records of Audiences and Tributes from the Western Ocean), which was compiled in A. D. 1520; the edition used, was prepared and annoted by Xie Fang {{and published in}} Beijing, in 1982. It consists of three juan (books), in which the author treats twenty-three countries, that had a tributary status to the Ming empire, when Zheng He made his seven voyages to the Indian Ocean. The author used two earlier texts, Ma Huan's Yingya shenglan and Fei Xin's Xingcha shenglan, to write his version of events in a more elaborate style. In addition, he made extracts from a lost manual for navigators and took notes from official registers. Each chapter ends with a personal comment. The work starts with the author`s preface, the first juan comprises nine chapters with nine countries, including Champa, Cambodia, Java, Srivijaya, Malacca, Brunei, Sulu, Pahang, and Ryukyu, the second juan comprises seven chapters with seven countries, including Siam, Aru, Samudra, Lambri, Maldive islands, Sri Lanka, and Bengal, the third juan starts with three city-states on the south-western coast of India, namely Quilon, Cochin, and Calicut, it ends with four city-states {{in the region of}} the Arabian Peninsula, namely Dhofar, Hormuz, Aden and Mecca. Each chapter is divided in geography, <b>diplomatic</b> contacts, a <b>list</b> of tributary objects, and a commentary. The editor supplemented three earlier entries, relating to the text. The Chinese text with references to the characters taken from the monolingual dictionary Hanyu dacidian is reproduced. A translation of a recent article, published by Haraprasad Ray, in June 1989, on two recently found postscripts to the texts is appended; a translation of the editors preface is also included. Finally, there is a translation of five notices from reference works, concerning the author's biography. The final section {{contains an}} essay of gleanings, such as: China and the West, on the notion of tribute, Zhu Di interfered in political power relations in overseas, the unapproved first Portuguese embassy by Tome Pires, on the translation of Huang Xingzeng's Xiyang chaogong dianlu, including: on commerce, Western cultural items in the novel Hongloumeng, foreign materials formerly owned by Yan Song, an inventory of Latin American drugs, formerly collected in the palace drugstore. The reader is invited, to draw his own conclusions, from the material offered, together with the notes, for instance, why took the history of overseas trading in China a different path than in Europe? The final part supplements lists of abbreviations and references, a table of the sixty combinations of Chinese cyclical characters and the reign-names of Ming dynasty emperors...|$|R
