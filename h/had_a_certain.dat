5|$|When {{it came to}} {{building}} up a new newspaper, Kringen <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> personal drive, as he ran for parliament in 1909. When he lost the election, he also lost interest to a certain degree. He resigned in 1912 and Ole Holmen, {{a member of the}} Vang municipal council, took over as chief editor. However, he ran afoul of other people involved with the newspaper and was fired in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{shortly before}} the U.N. Headquarters {{underwent}} major renovations, Del Toro and Soderbergh shot the scenes of Guevara speaking to the U.N. General Assembly in 1964. The director wanted to shoot {{the first part of}} The Argentine in Cuba, but was prevented from travelling there by the U.S. government's embargo. Doubling Santa Clara proved to be difficult because it was a certain size and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> look. Soderbergh spent four to five months scouting for a suitable replacement, looking at towns in Veracruz/Yucatán before settling on Campeche, which had the elements they needed.|$|E

5|$|Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaigns of}} Attarsiya {{represent}} the earliest recorded Mycenaean Greek military {{activity on the}} Anatolian mainland, {{as well as the}} first conflict between Achaeans and Hittites. It appears that these military developments <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> impact on the local populations. In this context, a decorated shard of pottery from the Hittite capital, Hattusa, depicts a warrior with body armor and boar's tusk helmet, typical of Achaean warfare, while the Hittite king offers a Mycenaean type thrusting sword to the Storm God, Teshub.|$|E
5|$|The Jugendstil, {{a variant}} of Art Nouveau, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> {{influence}} on {{much of the new}} construction in Norway {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The city of Ålesund, after burning to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with Riga and Brussels. Trondheim also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the Historical Museum and the Government office building. In Bergen, the main theatre Den Nationale Scene is a monumental example.|$|E

Chautha Bharani and Bharani Panchami, the fourth and fifth lunar day respectively, are allocated for people deceased in the past year. Avidhava navami ("Unwidowed ninth"), the ninth lunar day, is for married women who died before their husband. Widowers invite Brahmin women as guests for their wife's shraddha. The twelfth lunar day is for children and ascetics who had renounced the worldly pleasures. The fourteenth day is known as Ghata chaturdashi or Ghayala chaturdashi, and is reserved for those people killed by arms, in war or suffered a violent death.|$|E
5|$|Worcestershire's {{boundaries}} {{were relatively}} stable before the Victorian era, although some parishes or Manors changed hands with neighbouring counties, usually as 'gifts' by the monarchy, church or through conquest. In 1844; {{the administration of}} Worcestershire {{was carried out by}} the Courts of Quarter Sessions, who were responsible for law and order, civil jurisdiction and certain administrative functions in the county. These roles included the licensing of alehouses, police, weights and measures, construction/maintenance of highways and bridges, poor law disputes and setting taxes. The county was then divided into five hundreds (a county subdivision), four separate boroughs for the larger towns (Bewdley, Kidderminster, Droitwich, and Evesham), and Worcester itself, which was a county corporate. Worcester was autonomous from Worcestershire and the boroughs <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> degree of autonomy within the hundreds.|$|E

25|$|A part of Latvia's Russians {{belonged to}} the ultra-left of the {{political}} spectrum. In the Fourth Saeima, one Russian represented the social democrats and one Russian was a communist representative. But the Russian left-wing parties did not achieve any big success though they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> influence among sections of the workers of Riga. In general, the Russian minority was less politically active than the Jewish and Baltic German minorities.|$|E
25|$|The theatre, {{which was}} built in 168 or 169 CE, {{is one of the}} best {{preserved}} examples in Roman Africa. It could seat 3500 spectators, even though Dougga only had 5000 inhabitants. It was one of a series of imperial buildings constructed over the course of two centuries at Dougga which deviate from the classic “blueprints” only inasmuch as they have been adapted to take account of the local terrain. Some minor adjustments have been made and the local architects <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> freedom with regard to the ornamentation of the buildings.|$|E

The captain of this team was Lyn-player Jørgen Juve, who is still the player with the most goals scored for the Norwegian national team. The club's most recent period of success was during the 1960s, when they won four trophies and reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

This council annexed the towns of Amozoc, Totimehuacán, and Cuautinchán to its territory in 1755. By 1786, Puebla’s lands reached from what is now Veracruz to Guerrero states. The city continued to grow and be more regulated during the 17th and 18th centuries. A new city hall was built in 1714 and the tianguis in the main plaza was replaced by wood stalls by the 1770s. The streets were paved with stone between 1786 and 1811.|$|E

Well-known directors such as Dan Piţa and Lucian Pintilie have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> degree of continued success, and younger directors such as Nae Caranfil and Cristi Puiu have become highly respected. Caranfil's film Filantropica and Puiu's The Death of Mr. Lăzărescu were extremely well received and gained awards at international festivals in Paris and Cannes. Beside domestic production, Romania became a favorite destination for international producers due to the low cost of filming there, and big investments have been made in large studios.|$|E
25|$|This {{atmosphere}} did {{not continue}} to the negotiations held between the IPC and revolutionary governments that followed {{the overthrow of the}} Hashemite monarchy in 1958.

Because of this, the IPC had a huge impact on the amount of revenue that the government generated and thus <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> amount of influence over the government. The second major factor was inability of the Iraqi government at that time to source the technical knowledge and skill necessary to take over oil operations in the country.|$|E
