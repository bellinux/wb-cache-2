5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E

The measurement results showed that current density distribution in a fuel cell with interdigitated <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> is much more uniform than those observed in a fuel cell with serpentine <b>flow</b> <b>fields,</b> especially at low reactant gas flows. The more uniform current distribution {{can be attributed to}} more uniform flow distribution over the <b>flow</b> <b>fields.</b> Measurement results also showed that interdigitated <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> have very good water removal capability and no flooding phenomena were observed at high humidification temperatures; while at low humidification temperatures, the effect of drying is more severe than that found in serpentine <b>flow</b> <b>fields...</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier–Stokes) {{is the presence of}} convective acceleration: the effect of acceleration of a flow with respect to space.

25|$|When {{analyzing}} {{shock waves}} in a <b>flow</b> <b>field,</b> {{which are still}} attached to the body, the shock wave which is deviating at some arbitrary angle from the flow direction is termed oblique shock.

25|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} {{is commonly used}} to obtain the <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> with shock waves. Though shock waves are sharp discontinuities, in numerical solutions of fluid flow with discontinuities (shock wave, contact discontinuity or slip line), the shock wave can be smoothed out by low-order numerical method (due to numerical dissipation) or there are spurious oscillations near shock surface by high-order numerical method (due to Gibbs phenomena).|$|E
25|$|Unlike liquids and solids, gases are {{composed}} of discrete molecules which occupy {{only a small fraction}} of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> is assumed to behave as a continuum. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.|$|E

25|$|When two {{vortices}} {{are equidistant}} from the ring, one being beyond {{and the other}} approaching, the net circulation around the ring is zero; the null point for the flow oscillation. Each vortex creates a circular (ring) <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> whose axis varies slightly from the vertical as it passes. The figure suggests that {{the main component of}} the force on the physical ring is {{in the direction of the}} jet flow. If the vortex is a true ring (all parts are in phase), a dipole sound field directed along the jet axis is created.|$|E
25|$|The Linear eddy {{model is}} a {{technique}} used to simulate the convective mixing {{that takes place in}} turbulent flow. Specifically, it provides a mathematical way to describe the interactions of a scalar variable within the vector <b>flow</b> <b>field.</b> It is primarily used in one-dimensional representations of turbulent flow, since it can be applied across a wide range of length scales and Reynolds numbers. This model is generally used as a building block for more complicated flow representations, as it provides high resolution predictions that hold across a large range of flow conditions.|$|E
25|$|Hydrodynamic {{feedback}} (Class I) {{influences the}} formation of new vortices and exerts a fluctuating force on the cylinder. The <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> {{is shown in the}} upper figure on the right (created by Gary Koopman). Theodor von Karman identified and analyzed the flow behind objects like a cylinder and since then this special flow has been called the Karman vortex street. Vincenz Strouhal was the first to scientifically investigate the sound emitted by flow around a rigid cylinder. At low Reynolds numbers the tone was pure and the frequency was proportional to the steady flow speed U and inversely proportional to the cylinder diameter d.|$|E
50|$|Macroscopic viscous <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> can direct {{self-assembly}} of {{a random}} solution of particles into ordered crystals. However, the assembled particles tend to disassemble when the flow is stopped or removed. Shear flows {{are useful for}} jammed suspensions or random close packing. As these systems begin in nonequilibrium, <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> are useful in that they help the system relax towards ordered equilibrium. <b>Flow</b> <b>fields</b> are also useful when dealing with complex matrices that themselves have rheological behavior. Flow can induce anisotropic viseoelastic stresses, which helps to overcome the matrix and cause self-assembly.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{analyses}} of basalts {{collected from the}} major historic eruptions of Mauna Loa volcano show {{that many of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> are remarkably homogeneous in composition. Despite their large size (lengths 9 - 85 km), large areal extents (13 - 114 sq km), and various durations of eruption (1 - 450 days), many of the <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> have compositional variability that is within, or close to, the analytical error for most elements. The <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> that are not homogeneous vary mainly in olivine content in an otherwise homogeneous melt. Some are composite <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> made up of several, apparently homogeneous subunits erupted at different elevations along the active volcanic rifts. Not all volcanoes produce lavas that are homogeneous like those of Mauna Loa. If studies such as this are to be used to evaluate compositional diversity in lavas where {{there is a lack of}} sampling control, such as on other planets, it is necessary to understand why some flow units and <b>flow</b> <b>fields</b> are compositionally homogeneous and others are not, and to develop criteria for distinguishing between them...|$|R

25|$|The marker {{technique}} for {{friction stir welding}} provides data on the initial and final positions of the marker in the welded material. The flow of material is then reconstructed from these positions. Detailed material <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> during friction stir welding can also be calculated from theoretical considerations based on fundamental scientific principles. Material flow calculations are routinely used in numerous engineering applications. Calculation of material flow fields in friction stir welding can be undertaken both using comprehensive numerical simulations or simple but insightful analytical equations. The comprehensive models for the calculation of material flow fields also provide important information such as geometry of the stir zone and the torque on the tool. The numerical simulations have shown the ability to correctly predict the results from marker experiments and the stir zone geometry observed in friction stir welding experiments.|$|E
500|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{boundary layer}} was first defined by Ludwig Prandtl {{in a paper}} presented on August 12, 1904 at the third International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg, Germany. It simplifies the equations of fluid flow by dividing the <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> into two areas: one inside the boundary layer, dominated by viscosity and creating the majority of drag experienced by the boundary body; and one outside the boundary layer, where viscosity can be neglected without significant effects on the solution. This allows a closed-form solution for the flow in both areas, a significant simplification of the full Navier–Stokes equations. The majority of the heat transfer to and from a body also takes place within the boundary layer, again allowing the equations to be simplified in the <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> outside the boundary layer. [...] The pressure distribution throughout the boundary layer in the direction normal to the surface (such as an airfoil) remains constant throughout the boundary layer, and {{is the same as}} on the surface itself.|$|E

Although generally dwarfed by explosion-dominated eruptions, the average flow rate at these compound flow fields is much greater than what is observed at similar contemporary lava flows on Earth.

500|$|Environmental {{steering}} is {{the dominant}} term. Conceptually, it represents {{the movement of the}} storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions, similar to [...] "leaves carried along by a stream". Physically, the winds, or <b>flow</b> <b>field,</b> in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself, and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place. In this way, tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as advection of the storm by the local environmental flow. This environmental flow is termed the [...] "steering flow".|$|E

The thickness of flow fields was not determined by Galileo, but the individual breakouts on their surface {{are likely to be}} [...] thick. In many cases, active lava breakouts flow out onto the surface at locations tens to hundreds of kilometres from the source vent, with low amounts of thermal emission observed between it and the breakout. This suggests that lava flows through lava tubes from the source vent to the breakout.|$|E

During that day the depression moved towards the northwest, intensified into a tropical storm and was named Nora later that day. During the next day, the storm gradually intensified further while temporarily moving towards the west, due to the <b>flow</b> <b>field</b> around a strengthening high pressure system located {{to the north of}} Nora.
