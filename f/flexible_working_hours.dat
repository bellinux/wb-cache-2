Instead he was attracted to the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL)—a right-wing group founded by Arthur Chesterton—after seeing coverage of one of their demonstrations on television. He visited their basement office in Westminster, where he was given some of their literature. He enjoyed Chesterton's writings and concurred with his conspiracy theory that Jewish people had been plotting to bring down the British Empire. Tyndall began associating with other young men who had joined the LEL. At a February 1957 by-election in Lewisham North, Tyndall aided the LEL campaign, during which he met fellow party member John Bean, an industrial chemist. Both Tyndall and Bean were frustrated by the LEL's attempts to exert pressure on the mainstream Conservative Party. They wanted to be involved in a more radical party, one that would combine [...] "nationalism" [...] with [...] "popular socialism" [...] and which would reach out to the white working class through appeals against immigration from the Caribbean.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proceeds from}} studies of introduction and realization of <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> models in municipal social care. It includes two empiric studies, the deep study that covers one <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> model that has been realized in one municipality's care administration. <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> model that has been realized in municipality's care administration. The target groups have been the elder and people with varying disabilities. In the overall study that {{has been carried out}} in eight different municipalities in Sweden, only the care of the elderly has been covered. The purpose of my dissertation is to describe from an employee perspective the processes that the introduction and realization of <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> models within the social care has contributed to, and to problemize these processes from theories about flexibility, participation, class and gender. The methods I have used are based upon the participation of all in equal democratic dialogues, an interactive approache. I have met the participants in various constellations, {{in the beginning of the}} process in homogeneous groups and finally in heterogeneous groups. The participants represented the hierarchical order in the organization, from employees and managers to politicians, and we were all there on equal terms. Reflected dialogue/research circles, participatory observations and interviews are the qualitative methods I have used in my ambitions to participate in the creation of new mutual knowledge. In relation with the deep and overall study four different forms of implementations has arisen. * Politicians and/or administration management has taken the initiative but superpose the responsibility of realization on the individuals in the organization - top/down (1) * Politicians and/or administration management has taken the initiative and has a introduction and realization structure for how the re-organization is to proceed - top/down (2) * The staff has themselves taken the initiative for the introduction or sought existing employment - bottom/up* Politicians has taken the initiative and created an organization with self-management - initiative from the top but democratically builtThe form of implementation has shown to have a big influence and consequence for the processes that arise with the introduction and realization of the different work hour models. The different kinds of democracy that belongs to the implementation forms are: no democracy, apparent-, representative- and direct democracy. Forms of flexibility that appears are the self centred, the tide up, the considerate and the solidarity flexibility. Most of the problems and dilemmas pointed out in this dissertation can be referred to the discussion about top-down or bottom-up organizational forms. Despite visions of more democratic organizational forms management and politicians still adopt a top-down approach. Out of the working groups in the survey study, there are only a few who in practice have come close to democratic organizational forms. Even fewer are the groups who have adopted a user democracy. Detta är en avhandling som på ett interaktivt sätt har följt och kommunicerat in- och genomförandeprocesserna av flexibla arbetstidesmodeller i åtta kommuners social omsorgsverksamheter, med ett personalperspektiv som fokus. Teorier om delaktighet, klass, kön och flexibilitet är de utgångspunkter som har fungerat som bollplank och som har försjupats. Fyra olika implementeringsformer har framträtt. Dessa påverkar in- och genomförandet i hög grad. Avhandlingen visar i flera delar på en tydlig diskrepans mellan uttalade visioner och konkreta handlingar. Trots visioner om mer demokratiska organisationsformer används i hög grad auktoritära strukturer som medför återkommande dilemman inom organisationen. Godkänd; 2007; 20070919 (biem...|$|R

30|$|Although {{extensive}} {{research has been}} conducted on the factors that influence the duration of family-related employment breaks, a key structural characteristic of the German labour market has been neglected so far: the occupation. Only few previous empirical studies have taken occupations into consideration (Krüger et al. 1989; Stuth and Hennig 2014; Stuth et al. 2009), but those that have done so have always identified it as an important influencing factor. For example, Krüger et al. (1989) analysed how occupational cultures and structures affecting work-family reconciliation influence the duration of women’s employment interruptions and their return to work in five occupations. They found that women in occupations with high part-time rates and/or <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> arrangements, in this case commercial and administrative employees, returned to work more frequently than women in manual, physical jobs such as hairdressers (Krüger et al. 1989). Looking at data for 2006 and including a much larger range of occupations (111 occupations), Stuth et al. (2009) come to similar conclusions: occupations requiring long weekly hours display longer employment breaks, whereas <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> models promote women’s return into gainful employment. Building on this, Stuth and Hennig (2014) conducted a study for the year 2007, in which they also established the importance of the signalling function of occupations (measured by the specificity of an occupation) and occupational closure (licensing, legal protection of the activity and credentialing educational heterogeneity) as well as whether the occupation was typically found in a structured or unstructured labour market (employee turnover, etc.) for the length of interruptions (Stuth and Hennig 2014). The two latter studies point to the importance of the occupation as a context that sets opportunities and constraints, within which the conditions for employment interruptions and possibilities for re-entry are structured.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flexible</b> {{forms of}} <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> Flexibility is hotly debated {{term in the}} recent years and not only in a {{relation}} to labour market. This diploma thesis deals with <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> which represents one of the means to achieve greater flexibility of labour law as well as flexible labour market. Increased options in adjusting <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> based on the needs of the subjects of labour-law relations contributes to more efficient use of employees work, provides new possibilities for some risk groups of employees on the labour market and helps employees in achieving work- life balance. These factors also have positive influence on unemployment rate. The thesis is divided into four chapters, which are further divided into subchapters. The first chapter introduces selected legal principles with the regards to the subject of the thesis. Main focus is on subsidiary relation between civil and labour law and "what is not forbidden, is allowed" principle, which is crucial for <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> followed by an overview of selected basic principles of labour-law relations and introduction of flexicurity concept. The second chapter builds a foundation and much needed context for subsequent chapters by defining <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and it's legal regulation on national as well as [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The resource-based {{perspective}} of entrepreneurship emphasises that highly-skilled employees are important resources in developing {{new products and}} in supporting high growth of technology-based firms. Therefore, human resources management issues, including reducing turnover and retaining employees are critical issues. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify factors that influence the turnover behaviour among employees in Malaysian’s MSC-status IT firms. Its data-gathering method was survey with the firms’ human resource and top managers selected as respondents. A total of 500 questionnaires were mailed to IT firms with MSC-status. Out of this figure, 106 questionnaires were completed and returned, generating a response rate of 21 %. The results indicate that five factors influence the employees’ turnover behavior, which are organisational, work-related, individual, employees-involvement and external factors. This study indicates that internal factors are the main effect in retaining employees in organizations, while to counter the influence of external factors on employees’ turnover, an organization could raise their salary, offer more attractive work-incentives, and provide more <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour...</b>|$|R

Fortunately, throughout the years, women are seen to be involved in construction industry. However, women involved in construction industry still face barriers and challenges. The objectives of this research are to examine the ideal characteristics and attributes of women involved in the construction industry, to identify the major barriers and challenges faced by women involved in the construction industry and to recommend company policies which can be adopt to enhance women involvement in construction industry. The methodology adopted to carry out this research was quantitative method via questionnaire survey. Convenience sampling was used, whereby respondents who have experienced in construction industry were randomly selected. The results concluded that the top three ideal characteristics and attributes of women involved in construction industry are to show self-confidence, while remaining the feminine characteristics, research and alliance. For barriers, the major barriers are private life demands, family commitment, work environment, sexual harassment and <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>hour.</b> Lastly, it can be concluded that major challenges come from women‟s support system and the women itself.
