The inclusion of such a device will provide an efficient compromise between the flexibility of software {{and the performance of}} hardware, {{while at the same time}} allowing for post-fabrication modification of circuits.

40|$|<b>Full</b> <b>custom</b> <b>circuits</b> such as dynamic logic {{are very}} popular in today’s {{microprocessor}} designs. However, special {{care must be taken}} to ensure that these circuits do not experience reliability problems, such as those due to charge sharing. The degree of charge sharing depends on the logical values of the inputs into the circuit, or channel-connected region (CCR). Traditional analysis techniques may try to find a worst-case input condition to check for functional failures due to excessive charge sharing. However, unless the analysis takes into account specific input constraints, or exclusivities, for the circuit, the results may be overly pessimistic. In this paper we approach this noise analysis problem symbolically using Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs), which allows us to efficiently analyze charge sharing within a CCR as a function of its inputs. Input constraints are naturally handled within the analysis. The effectiveness of our approach is verified on circuits used {{in the design of the}} Alpha 21264 and 21364 microprocessors. By considering the exclusivities, the results show large improvement in voltage drop estimates due to charge sharing. This improvement could potentially lead to significant savings in verification time. 1...|$|R

40|$|Conventional number {{systems is}} the {{weighted}} fixed positive radix number systems, where signed number uses the sign {{as a symbol}} followed by the number part either in magnitude or r’s complement form. Addition of conventional number systems requires carry propagation (serial signal propagation) from LSD to MSD and the addition time depends on word-length, which is the main limitation of the VLSI performance. But Redundant number systems (RNS) is to allow addition of two numbers in which no serial signal propagation is required along the adder; that is, the time duration of the operation is independent of length of the operands and is the time required for the addition of two digits. This is the advantage of RNS over conventional number systems. Because of this advantage, in this thesis it proposed to design an FIR filter based on RNS. In order to implement FIR filter, {{it is necessary to}} design adder, multiplier and D-FF.
