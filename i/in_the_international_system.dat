25|$|The {{dimension}} of stress {{is that of}} pressure, and therefore its coordinates are commonly measured in the same units as pressure: namely, pascals (Pa, that is, newtons per square metre) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System,</b> or {{pounds per square inch}} (psi) in the Imperial system. Because mechanical stresses easily exceed a million Pascals, MPa, which stands for megapascal, is a common unit of stress.|$|E
25|$|Capacitance {{is defined}} as the ratio of the {{electric}} charge on each conductor to the potential difference between them. The unit of capacitance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units (SI) is the farad (F), defined as one coulomb per volt (1 C/V). Capacitance values of typical capacitors for use in general electronics range from about 1picofarad (pF) (10−12F) to about 1millifarad (mF) (10−3F).|$|E

25|$|While Brazil participated {{actively}} {{in the international}} negotiations {{that led to the}} establishment of the NPT, it abstained from voting on the resolution that formally created the treaty.

25|$|China did not {{recognize}} Manchukuo but the two sides established official ties for trade, communications and transportation. In 1933, the League of Nations adopted the Lytton Report, declaring that Manchuria remained rightfully part of China, leading Japan to resign its membership. The Manchukuo case persuaded the United States to articulate the so-called Stimson Doctrine, under which international recognition was withheld from changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>system</b> created by force of arms.|$|E
25|$|Entropy is an {{extensive}} property. It has {{the dimension of}} energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (JK−1) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units (or kgm2s−2K−1 in terms of base units). But the entropy of a pure substance is usually given as an intensive property—either entropy per unit mass (SI unit: JK−1kg−1) or entropy per unit amount of substance (SI unit: JK−1mol−1).|$|E

The institution of a patent system in a developing country may confer significant social costs on that country; membership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> patent <b>system</b> may exacerbate those costs.

25|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} (k, also denoted as λ or κ) is {{a measure}} of a material's ability to conduct heat. Heat transfer across materials of high thermal conductivity occurs at a higher rate than across materials of low thermal conductivity. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units (SI), thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter Kelvin (W/(m•K)). In the Imperial System of Measurement (British Imperial, or Imperial units), thermal conductivity is measured in Btu/(hr•ft⋅F).|$|E

25|$|Temperature is a {{physical}} quantity expressing the subjective perceptions of hot and cold. Temperature is measured with a thermometer, historically calibrated in various temperature scales and units of measurement. The most commonly used scales are the Celsius scale, denoted in °C (informally, degrees centigrade), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale. The kelvin (K) is the unit of temperature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units (SI), in which temperature {{is one of the}} seven fundamental base units.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{functions}} of state, entropy cannot be directly observed {{but must be}} calculated. Entropy can be calculated for a substance as the standard molar entropy from absolute zero (also known as absolute entropy) or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state which is defined as zero entropy. Entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J/K) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units. While {{these are the same}} units as heat capacity, the two concepts are distinct. Entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. The second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy {{plays an important role in}} determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.|$|E
