25|$|According {{to these}} data, in 2011, Portugal didn't present any {{overspending}} neither on {{the coverage of}} social risks (social protection and health) and the slightly high spending on <b>education</b> <b>can</b> be related to a lag between the average qualifications of Portuguese and their European counterparts, resulting in an eventual attempt to overcome that lag.

Gender inequality in <b>education</b> <b>can</b> be measured in different ways.

Pakistan aims to achieve Millennium Development Goals and also aims to eliminate gender disparity at all levels of education by the year 2015. Elimination of gender disparity at all levels of education requires higher allocation of resources on women's education. Strong gender disparities exist in literacy and educational attainment between rural and urban areas of Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|In higher education, the {{analysis}} of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking.

The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.|$|E

25|$|During {{the mass}} high school {{education}} movement from 1910–40, {{there was an increase}} in skilled workers, which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work. In fact, it differs from the present {{high school education}}, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in <b>education</b> <b>can</b> result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap. It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries.|$|E
