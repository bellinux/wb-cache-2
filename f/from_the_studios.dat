Nevertheless, by January 1972, McGovern had only 3percent national support among Democrats in the Gallup Poll and had not attracted significant press coverage.|$|E

25|$|A Lady chapel was {{a common}} feature in medieval cathedrals {{and it was also}} {{inspired}} by the one present in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. The main feature of the chapel is the statue of Mary. Under it, is a baroque altar believed to come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> of Giovanni Bernini in Rome, where Fr. Sorin saw it during one of his trips. East of the Lady Chapel are the Chapel of Holy Angels, the Baptismal Chapel, and the Holy Cross Chapel, final resting place of Cardinal John O'Hara, University President from 1934 to 1940 and the first member of the Congregation of Holy Cross named a cardinal. The Holy Cross Chapel also holds the Return of the Prodigal Son statue by Ivan Mestrovic.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} half of 2009, the {{recession}} forced NBC to cut costs at KNTV. Several rounds of layoffs occurred, forcing KNTV to shed some well-known personalities, including chief weather anchor John Farley, who left the station in March 2009; after Farley's departure, weekend weather segments originated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> of Los Angeles sister station KNBC. The station also closed news bureaus in Sacramento and Oakland. KNTV's news helicopter (which was purchased in 2006) was also suspended from use on April 30, 2009. On May 22, 2009, former NBC Weather Plus meteorologist Jeff Ranieri was named KNTV's new chief meteorologist. On June 29, 2009, layoffs continued with the firings of reporters Noelle Walker, Ethan Harp, Christien Kafton and San Jose reporter Daniel Garza, along with several behind-the-scenes jobs.|$|E

25|$|The Gothic {{style of}} figure {{painting}} began {{to give way}} to a more naturalistic style in which the figures seem more three-dimensional and portrait-like. An important source at this time was German wood engravings and etchings. These were available in a number of forms. Bibles and Bible picture books were available with several different series of such engravings. The works of Albrecht Dürer were much admired. One of the advantages of using engravings as a source was that the essentially linear techniques that were employed by the engraver to define forms could be easily interpreted in lead and the fine linear treatment of shadows was likewise easy for the stained glass artist to achieve using the monochrome paint technique. There were also windows imported into England at this time <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> of Mayer of Munich which influenced English designers towards this style.|$|E
25|$|His {{body of work}} exerted {{a strong}} {{influence}} {{on some of the}} more adventurous British and American musicians and producers. The most notable are probably David Bowie and Brian Eno, who worked together on the late-70s 'Berlin Trilogy' of albums, Low, Heroes, and Lodger, all of which showed the strong influence of Plank's earlier German productions. Bowie's song 'Heroes' is a virtual paean to the Plank style, featuring radical sounds and dramatic alterations of sound in various elements, such as the lead vocal, to heighten the emotional or dramatic effect; this is placed against a swirling, droning electronic backing track that interweaves elements such as multitracked synthethisers and feedback guitar. In 1977, through Eno, Plank recruited Dave Hutchins from Island Studios, as house engineer. Hutchins undertook recording & mixing roles on many of the productions originating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> in the following ten years.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} music show from the station, though, derived its name <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> themselves. Produced for Channel 4, and first {{broadcast}} {{three days after}} the new station's launch in November 1982, The Tube acquired its name from the architecture of the public entrance to Studio 5, from where the show was broadcast, at the City Road complex. Under the direction of Gavin Taylor, The Tube filmed rock band Queen's 1986 Wembley concert for later broadcast and video and DVD release. Cameras bearing the Tyne Tees logo can be seen throughout the concert. The Tube was dropped in 1987 as a result of falling audience figures and an incident involving Jools Holland, who cursed during a live trailer. A couple of months later, Tyne Tees launched another music show, this time for the ITV network. Whereas The Tube featured rock and punk bands and emerging musicians, Tyne Tees' The Roxy, concentrated on the mainstream UK singles chart. The show suffered, however, from not having a regular slot on the ITV network. Also, unlike The Tube, which had gained a loyal fanbase and respect from artists, mainstream acts were reluctant to travel to Newcastle for a three-minute performance when they could appear on the BBC's more established Top of the Pops in the more accessible London.|$|E

500|$|In {{between his}} stage roles, Holloway had a {{successful}} film career. [...] He made his silent film debut in 1921 in The Rotters {{and went on to}} star in over 60 motion pictures, with his last being in 1976. His credits covered many genres including drama, romance and comedy and he shared successful collaborations with a number of studios, including Gaumont-British Picture Corporation, Gainsborough Studios and, most notably, Ealing Studios. He started his association with Ealing in 1934, appearing in the fifth Gracie Fields picture, Sing As We Go. After a ten-year absence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios,</b> Holloway returned to star in Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder and went on to star in Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Another Shore (1948). However, it was the next three Ealing Comedies, Passport to Pimlico (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953), which confirmed Holloway as a mainstay of British cinema. His final film with the studio was Meet Mr. Lucifer (1953).|$|E

2500|$|Tyne Tees's {{original}} studios {{were located}} on City Road, Newcastle upon Tyne and were converted from two furniture warehouses {{purchased by the}} company.

The location was deliberately chosen because of its proximity to the telephone exchange in Carliol Square.
