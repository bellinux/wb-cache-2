5|$|Border {{disputes}} with rival troops occur occasionally {{and it is}} the dominant female's responsibility to defend the troop's <b>home</b> <b>range.</b> Agonistic encounters include staring, lunging approaches and occasional physical aggression, and conclude with troop members retreating {{toward the center of the}} <b>home</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5|$|The pudú is {{a solitary}} animal whose {{behavior}} in the wild is largely unknown because of its secretive nature. Pudús are crepuscular, most active in the morning, late afternoon, and evening. Their <b>home</b> <b>range</b> generally extends about , much of which consists of crisscrossing pudú-trodden paths. Each pudú has its own <b>home</b> <b>range,</b> or territory. A single animal's territory is marked with sizable dung piles found on paths and near eating and resting areas. Large facial glands for scent communication allow correspondence with other pudú deer. Pudús do not interact socially, other than to mate. An easily frightened animal, the deer barks when in fear. Its fur bristles and the pudú shivers when angered.|$|E
5|$|Bobcat {{activities}} {{are confined to}} well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex {{and the distribution of}} prey. The <b>home</b> <b>range</b> is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Home</b> <b>ranges</b> of 7,060 to 9,630 {{square feet}} (656-895 sq m) have been {{reported}} for Great Basin pocket mice in British Columbia. Males may have larger <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> than females. Average <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> reported from south-central Washington are 23,030 square feet (2,140 sq m) and 33,640 square feet (3,125 sq m) for adult males and 15,564 square feet (1,446 sq m) for adult females. In big sagebrush habitat on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon, <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of adult males were significantly greater (p < 0.001) than <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of females. Reproductively active adult males had significantly (p < 0.05) larger <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> than adult males with unenlarged testes. In black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) habitat, however, {{there were no significant}} differences between male and female <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> or between <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of reproductive and nonreproductive adult males.|$|R
50|$|Spotted owl <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> are {{generally}} large but of variable size, with extents of 661 - 14169 acre, depending on subspecies, habitat, and prey availability. <b>Home</b> <b>ranges</b> are smaller in the breeding season {{than in the}} nonbreeding season, and females have larger <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> than males.|$|R
50|$|In the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve three {{elephant}} clans had overall <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of 562 km2, 670 km2 and 799 km2 in {{the beginning}} of the 1990s.

5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small <b>home</b> <b>range,</b> containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E
5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they {{do not seem to}} have any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much farther from their mothers and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his <b>home</b> <b>range.</b> Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E
5|$|Like most felines, the bobcat {{is largely}} solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more {{tolerant}} of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges. Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male's <b>home</b> <b>range.</b> When multiple territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the spatial relationships of terrestrial lizards, but arboreal species remain poorly studiedbecause they are difficult to observe. The conventional view of home-range size and overlap among territorial, polygynous species of lizards is that: (1) male <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> are larger than those of females; (2) male <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> usually encompass, or substantiallyoverlap, those of several females; and (3) male home-range overlap varies but often is minimal, but female <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> frequently overlap extensively. However, the paucity of pertinent studies {{makes it difficult to}} generalize these patterns to arboreal lizards. Weinvestigated home-range size and overlap in the arboreal Knight Anole, Anolis equestris, and compared our findings to published home-range data for 15 other species of Anolis. Using radiotelemetry and mark-recapture/resight techniques, we analyzed the home rangesof individuals from an introduced population of Knight Anoles in Miami, Florida. The <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of both sexes substantially overlapped those of the same- and different-sex individuals. In addition, male and female <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> did not differ significantly, an unusual observation among lizard species. If one compares both male and female <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> to those of other Anolis species, Knight Anoles have significantly larger <b>home</b> <b>ranges,</b> except for two species for which statistical comparisons were not possible. Our results suggest that <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> and sex-specific spatial arrangements of canopy lizards may differ from those of more terrestrial species...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of four {{male and}} five female feral house cats (Felis catus) were studied by radiotelemetry. In the narrow, steep-sided valley the <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of cats were linear, {{with an average}} length of 6. 34 km for males and 3. 83 km for females; only large males crossed the river. Females with kittens had small <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of 0. 84 to 2. 0 km. <b>Home</b> <b>ranges</b> of animals of the same sex, {{including}} breeding females, overlapped considerably. The social organisation of feral cats at low density differs little from that of higher-density freeranging domestic cats...|$|R
50|$|In Nepal's Bardia National Park, <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of male leopards {{comprised}} about 48 km2, and {{of females}} about 17 km2; female <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> decreased to 5 to 7 km2 {{when they had}} young cubs.|$|R
5|$|Although {{reproduction}} occurs {{around the}} year, {{there is a}} peak during the summer (November to April). Molting mostly occurs during autumn and winter (April to August). At one locality in Mendoza, Akodon spegazzinii occurs at an estimated density of 21 individuals per hectare (8.5 per acre) and has a <b>home</b> <b>range</b> size of about 300 m2 (3200sqft). A number of sigmodontines have been recorded as occurring with A.spegazzinii, including A.caenosus, A.simulator, Neotomys ebriosus, Abrothrix illuteus, Reithrodon auritus, Andinomys edax, and various species of Eligmodontia, Necromys, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Oxymycterus, and Phyllotis. The tick Ixodes sigelos has been recorded on A.spegazzinii in Tucumán. In addition, the mites Androlaelaps fahrenholzi, Androlaelaps rotundus, and Eulaelaps stabularis and the flea Cleopsylla townsendii are known from the species.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his <b>home</b> <b>range.</b> The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} {{in general are}} very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most common}} calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating calls, {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their <b>home</b> <b>range.</b> Lemur calls can also be very loud and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) <b>home</b> <b>range.</b> Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} less social than other pocket mice. In dry forest systems, <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of [...]20 ha overlap, but {{intolerance}} and aggression {{is shown to}} members of the same sex. This results in the clumping of female <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> around male <b>home</b> <b>ranges.</b> Larger individuals are dominant over smaller individuals, and adults are dominant over the young of the year. Aggression does not vary according to season.|$|R
40|$|Adult female orangutans {{have large}} but stable <b>home</b> <b>ranges,</b> varying from {{as little as}} 150 ha in some forests up to 850 or more in others. Spatial {{variation}} in availability of fruit of key tree species or spatial variation in habitat-wide fruiting peaks {{appears to be the}} driving force behind major movements within the <b>range.</b> Larger <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> are found in more frugivorous subspecies, and at the level of study sites, where habitat mosaics are coarse enough for individual orangutans to cover multiple habitats. In larger <b>home</b> <b>ranges,</b> overlap is also larger. The chapter confirms the presence of female clusters of relatives with highly overlapping <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> who show preferential association...|$|R
40|$|White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (N= 15) {{movements}} were determined {{with use of}} radio telemetry techniques to determine the utilization of corridor habitat on the Lake Ray Roberts Greenbelt Corridor (RRGC) in north central Texas. <b>Home</b> <b>ranges</b> were calculated using three estimation types. Male white-tailed deer tend to have <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> twice that of female <b>home</b> <b>ranges.</b> Seasonal <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> were largest during spring (Feb. - April) and fall (Aug. - Oct.) seasons. Males had greater seasonal variation in utilization than females. No statistically significant difference (p= 0. 24) between white-tailed deer locations when the RRGC experiences heavy human traffic compared to days when there is light human traffic. Linearity indices indicated <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> less linear than expected (LI = 3. 02). The RRGC should be maintained at its current status to provide a variety of vegetational types and protective cover for white-tailed deer and other wildlife of Denton County...|$|R
5|$|Males tend to {{move over}} longer {{distances}} than females. The average <b>home</b> <b>range</b> size in Fleming's study was 1.33hectares (3.3acres); males had larger home ranges on average. Specimens {{that were once}} captured tended to be captured more frequently than those {{that had never been}} captured. Fleming estimated that population densities reached peaks of up to 4.3 per ha (1.7 per acre) late in the rainy season (October–November), but dropped to near zero around June; however, these figures may well be underestimates. In central Venezuela, population densities vary from 5.5 to 9.6 per ha (2.2 to 3.8 per acre).|$|E
5|$|Nocturnally active, {{the prickly}} shark rests {{during the day}} in deeper {{offshore}} waters and performs a diel migration to shallower inshore waters at dusk. Individual sharks have a small <b>home</b> <b>range</b> and tend to remain within a given local area. This species consumes a variety of bony and cartilaginous fishes, and cephalopods. Since it moves slowly, it may use suction to capture prey. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing sizable litters. The prickly shark is not known to be dangerous to humans and has minimal economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial deepwater fisheries, which are expanding and may potentially threaten its population. Thus, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans live a more solitary {{lifestyle}} {{than the}} other great apes. Most social bonds occur between adult females and their dependent and weaned offspring. Adult males and independent adolescents of both sexes tend to live alone. Orangutan societies {{are made up of}} resident and transient individuals of both sexes. Resident females live with their offspring in defined home ranges that overlap with those of other adult females, which may be their immediate relatives. One to several resident female home ranges are encompassed within the <b>home</b> <b>range</b> of a resident male, who is their main mating partner.|$|E
2500|$|Bears on Kodiak are {{naturally}} active during the day, but {{when faced with}} competition for food or space, they adopt a more nocturnal (active at night) lifestyle.

50|$|Giant anteaters' <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> vary in size {{depending}} on the location. At Serra da Canastra National Park in Brazil, female anteaters have <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> around 3.67 km2, while males live in <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of 2.74 km2. In other parts of Brazil, anteaters may have 9 km2 ranges. Anteaters from Venezuela have been recorded living in <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> as large as 25 km2. Individuals mostly live alone, except for females that nurse their young and males courting females. Anteaters communicate their presence, status, and sexual condition with secretions from their anal glands. They also advertise their presence to other individuals though tree markings and urine. They appear {{to be able to}} recognize each other's saliva by scent.|$|R
40|$|Social carnivores, such as {{wolves and}} coyotes, have {{distinct}} and well-defined <b>home</b> <b>ranges.</b> During {{the formation of}} these <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> scent marks provide important cues {{regarding the use of}} space by familiar and foreign packs. Previous models for territorial pattern formation have required a den site as the organizational center around which the territory is formed. However, well-defined wolf <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> have been known to form {{in the absence of a}} den site, and even in the absence of surrounding packs. To date, the quantitative models have failed to describe a mechanism for such a process. In this paper we propose a mechanism. It involves interaction between scent marking and movement behavior in response to familiar scent marks. We show that the model yields distinct <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> by this new means, and that the spatial profile of these <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> is different from those arising from the territorial interactions with den sites. c ○ 2002 Society for Mathematical Biology 1...|$|R
5|$|Sea otters live {{in coastal}} waters 15 to 23meters (50 to 75ft) deep, and usually stay within a {{kilometer}} (⅔mi) of the shore. They are found {{most often in}} areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live {{in areas where the}} sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice. Individuals generally occupy a <b>home</b> <b>range</b> a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.|$|E
5|$|Some lemurs exhibit female philopatry, where females {{stay within}} their natal range and the males migrate upon {{reaching}} maturity, {{and in other}} species both sexes will migrate. In some cases, female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female-bonded multi-male groups, {{such as those of}} the ring-tailed lemur, Milne-Edwards' sifaka (Propithecus edwardsi), and the Verreaux's sifaka. Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide <b>home</b> <b>range.</b> If this is true, then multi-male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in catarrhine primates (Old World monkeys and apes).|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} is gregarious in nature. No {{distinct}} leader or any hierarchy is {{noted in the}} social structure; with no territorial behavior, fights are uncommon. While fighting, the lesser kudus interlock horns and try pushing one another. Mutual grooming is hardly observed. Unlike most tragelaphines, females can be closely associated for several years. One to three females, along with their offspring, may form a group. Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year-and-a-half, and may form pairs. However, {{at the age of}} four to five years, males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoiding one another, though four or five bulls may share the same <b>home</b> <b>range.</b> Lesser kudu do not usually associate with other animals, except when they feed in the same area.|$|E
500|$|Mostly nocturnal, tammar {{wallabies}} {{spend much}} of their time foraging.

50|$|Home-range {{sizes of}} the long-nosed potoroo vary considerably; the largest {{recorded}} was 34.4 ha. In Tasmania, large overlapping <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of 5 - 20 ha have been recorded, with males typically acquiring more land than females. <b>Home</b> <b>ranges</b> in Victoria, however, are much smaller.|$|R
500|$|According {{to studies}} of Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> {{of both sexes}} vary from [...] with {{frequent}} overlap, particularly {{on the periphery of}} their range. Individuals most heavily use and aggressively defend a smaller core area within their range. Individuals can have up to eight neighbors. <b>Home</b> <b>ranges</b> of males tend to overlap with those of both females and other males, and typically expand to four times the size during the mating season. Female <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> show no variability in size, and can remain stable for years. At Kirindy Forest, genetic studies showed that the <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> of related females tend to clump closely together, while unrelated males may overlap their range, suggesting male dispersal and migration is responsible for gene flow.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} social {{differences}} {{between males and}} females. Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females {{both within and outside}} their core areas, but do not affiliate with individuals outside the community range, except during mating season. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with only a couple of conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others outside their core group. Furthermore, field studies suggest that only females play a role in communal <b>home</b> <b>range</b> defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females may start {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a <b>home</b> <b>range</b> is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} fast-swimming, agile predators that feed {{primarily}} on free-swimming bony fishes and cephalopods. Their aggressive demeanor {{enables them to}} dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their moderate size. Many grey reef sharks have a <b>home</b> <b>range</b> on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return. However, they are social rather than territorial. During the day, these sharks often form groups of five to 20 individuals near coral reef drop-offs, splitting up in the evening as the sharks begin to hunt. Adult females also form groups in very shallow water, where the higher water temperature may accelerate their growth or that of their unborn young. Like other members of its family, the grey reef shark is viviparous, meaning the mother nourishes her embryos through a placental connection. Litters of one to six pups are born every other year.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the movements of}} 59 radio-collared female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) at the Gifford Point Wildlife Management Area (GP) and Fontenelle Forest Nature Area (FF) in eastern Nebraska from 1994 to 1997. Annual <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> averaged 276 ha (CI = 166 ha). Forty-four of the deer maintained relatively small <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> (0 = 129 ha) and resided in the GP lowlands (n= 14), FF lowlands (n=ll), and FF uplands-Bellevue residential area (BR) (n= 19). Deer in the latter area were frequently observed in backyards, at deer feeders, and on city streets. Seven of the deer were transients, maintaining seasonal <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> that varied in size and did not overlap in location. The centers of these seasonal <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> were on average 2, 430 m apart. No consistent patterns of dispersal or seasonal migration were detected. Deer response to hunter activity was highly variable. Most deer maintained relatively static <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> before, during, and after the hunting seasons, but three deer moved over 2, 000 m and established non-overlapping <b>home</b> <b>ranges</b> after the hunting seasons. Since no migration patterns were observed, we suggest that regulated hunting seasons continue in both the upland and lowland areas of GPFF, and in the open space areas of Bellevue where conditions are conducive to hunting...|$|R
