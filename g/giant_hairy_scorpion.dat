50|$|The {{scorpions}} of Nevada {{are well}} represented by four main families: Buthidae, Caraboctonidae, Vaejovidae and the intriguingly named Superstitioniidae. Nevada has 23 species of scorpion, including the extremely common striped bark scorpion. Other species of scorpion include the <b>giant</b> desert <b>hairy</b> <b>scorpion,</b> Baja California bark scorpion and Hadrurus spadix. Nevada's hot climate {{makes it an}} ideal state for certain spiders to live. Spiders include Carolina wolf spider, jumping spider, funnel-weaving spider, crab spider, black widow and tarantula.|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{known as}} the black-back scorpion, it can be {{differentiated}} from the <b>giant</b> desert <b>hairy</b> <b>scorpion</b> by its completely black prosoma or cephalothorax. This scorpion is quite nervous and can display aggressiveness towards its keeper. It should not be kept communally, as fights and cannibalism are frequent. The toxicity of its venom is usually deemed to be low, though its sting can be quite painful. This scorpion and its close relative Hadrurus arizonensis make good pets for a beginner, as they are quite large, very active and typically eat a lot.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Arachnida species, scorpions are viviparous. The young are born one by one, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one moult. The young generally resemble their parents, requiring between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Scorpions have quite variable lifespans and the lifespan of most species is not known. The age range appears to be approximately 4–25 years (25 years being the maximum reported life span in the <b>giant</b> desert <b>hairy</b> <b>scorpion,</b> Hadrurus arizonensis).

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The <b>giant</b> <b>hairy</b> desert <b>scorpion,</b> Hadrurus arizonensis, is a {{long-lived}} {{species of}} North American scorpion that is presented here {{as an important}} model for research in mating systems evolution and sexual selection. Many behaviors found in this species were undocumented and are described {{here for the first}} time. This thesis includes studies of the following aspects of H. arizonensis behavior: 1) a description of courtship and mating behavior, 2) an empirical study of variance in courtship success among males and females as an indicator of mate choice in both sexes, 3) a descriptive and empirical study of aggression and agonistic behaviors in non-reproductive inter- and intrasexual interactions, and 4) an observational study of intrasexual competition over mates in both males and females. Experiments were performed in the laboratory and behaviors observed were videotaped for data collection and analysis. All subjects used in this study were field-captured prior to use in behavioral experiments. This species exhibits both reproductive and aggressive behaviors that are stereotyped and can be quantified, either by ranking their intensity, or measuring in terms of time. H. arizonensis is a polygamous species with external sperm transfer (via a spermatophore). Both males and females appear to exhibit mate choice. Large females elicit more intense courtship behavior from males, and males may preferentially court larger females to increase their own reproductive success. Furthermore, both males and females interfere in the courtship of conspecific pairs, indicating that both sexes potentially compete intrasexually for mates. Such findings may be attributable to the substantial contributions each sex makes in reproduction. This species also exhibits complex aggressive behaviors during agonistic interactions that may function in both species recognition and competition...|$|R

40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} (MM) {{remains a}} pediatric rarity world-wide, but perhaps {{more so in}} black Africans. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the current report of MM in a two-and-a-half-year-old Nigerian who had a pre-existing congenital <b>giant</b> <b>hairy</b> nevus is probably the first (in an accessible literature) in a black African child. Primary neoplastic transformation and metastatic spread were suggested by the appearance of multiple swellings over the "garment" precursor nevus at the posterior trunk, multiple ipsilateral axillary nodal enlargement, and fresh occipital swellings postadmission. Smaller-sized hyperpigmented lesions with irregular, nonlobulated, and frequently hairy surfaces were also discernible over the upper and lower extremities, but the face, anterior trunk, and mucosal surfaces were relatively spared. A diagnosis of MM was confirmed by the subsequent histopathologic findings from the fine-needle aspirate and biopsy specimens. Chemotherapy was initiated but was truncated shortly after by parent-pressured discharge. Despite the rarity of MM in a tropical African setting where management options are few, the current case underscores the need for a high clinical index of diagnostic suspicion, an early pursuit of investigative confirmation, and prophylactic excision in children with the predisposing skin lesions, like congenital <b>giant</b> <b>hairy</b> nevus. An expounded discourse of the possible precursors and management options of MM is provided. We emphasize the need for institutional cost subsidy for anticancer care in tropical children...|$|R
