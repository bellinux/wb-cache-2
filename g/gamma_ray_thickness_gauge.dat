As a result, preventive measures are necessary to mitigate implant-related infection; one important strategy is to render the implant surface antibacterial. The objective {{of the present study}} was to develop a biomedical material for preventing and reduction the effect of Escherichia coli bacteria type on the prosthetic implants; this was done by investigating the effect of the radioisotope with CO 60 as the source of <b>Gamma</b> <b>ray</b> with <b>thickness</b> film of metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) of (Alumina and titanium) coated on Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy by using RF magnetron sputtering for growth-inhibitory effect on Escherichia colibacteria. The TiO 2 coated as mid layer between substrate Ti alloy and Al 2 O 3 to increase the adhesion between coated film and substrate, also to reduce thermal expansion mismatch between substrate and Al 2 O 3 layer. The nanoparticles size of Al 2 O 3 was 380 nm.
