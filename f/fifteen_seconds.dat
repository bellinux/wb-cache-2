In 2013, Martin won the event for a third consecutive time, again overcoming Wiggins and Cancellara. After two runner-up finishes, Wiggins prevented Martin's fourth successive win in the following season, taking the world title for the first time. Wiggins decided not {{to take part in}} 2015, focusing instead on breaking the hour record.

5|$|Game six was a Canadian 3–2 victory. There was no scoring {{during the}} first period. Lyapkin scored the first goal at 1:12 of the second period, but the Canadians' {{confidence}} did not waver. The Canadians caught the Soviets in a lapse and scored three goals in a one-and-a-half-minute span to take a 3–1 lead. Hull flipped a rebound over Tretiak to tie the score after Gilbert had capitalized on a Soviet giveaway. Cournoyer scored on a set-up from behind the net by Berenson. <b>Fifteen</b> <b>seconds</b> later, Henderson scored {{what turned out to}} be the winning third goal on a thirty-foot slap shot.

5|$|Hughes {{made his}} mixed martial arts debut on January 1, 1998 at Joe Gaytia's JKD Challenge. He slammed his {{opponent}} {{to the ground}} in just <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds,</b> winning via KO. The slam became his signature move. He won his next fight via submission due to strikes. Hughes fought three times at Extreme Challenge 21, on October 17, 1998 defeating Victor Hunsaker via TKO and future UFC Midleweight Champion Dave Menne via unanimous decision. In the third fight of that night he lost to then-undefeated Dennis Hallman by technical submission (guillotine choke) at 0:17 of the first round. The result was announced as a KO. In the process, Hallman handed Hughes his first professional defeat.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds</b> of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

Georgetown jumped {{out to an}} early 1210 lead after twelve minutes of play, with eight of North Carolina's points coming from goaltending infractions by Ewing. The Hoyas entered halftime ahead by a single point, 3231. The teams traded the lead multiple times closing minutes of the second half.

5|$|On 6 April 1914, the CCE (now {{a part of}} the Northern line) {{opened a}} one stop {{extension}} south from its terminus at Charing Cross. The extension was constructed to facilitate a better interchange between the BS and CCE Both lines were owned by the UERL which operated two separate and unconnected stations at the northern end of main line station – Trafalgar Square on the BS and Charing Cross on the CCE (both now part of a combined Charing Cross station). The CCE extension was constructed as a single track tunnel running south from Charing Cross as a loop under the River Thames and back. A single platform was constructed on the northbound return section of the loop, and escalators were installed between both sets of deep-level platforms and the sub-surface station. The interchange time was reduced from three minutes <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds</b> to one minute and forty-five seconds.|$|E
5|$|The Ole Miss lead only {{lasted for}} <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds,</b> as Christion Jones scored a {{touchdown}} on the kickoff that ensued with his 99-yard return {{that gave the}} Crimson Tide a 13–7 lead.

On their next drive, Ole Miss was intercepted by the Crimson Tide on two separate occasions. First Robert Lester intercepted a Bo Wallace pass that he subsequently fumbled and was recovered by Scott, and then two plays later Randall Mackey threw an interception to Deion Belue at the Alabama 32-yard line. The Crimson Tide then drove 68 yards and took a 27–7 halftime lead after McCarron threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Cooper.|$|E

5|$|Before December 1981, {{the show}} did not feature a bonus round. Under the bonus round's {{original}} rules, no letters were provided automatically. The contestant asked for five consonants and a vowel, {{and then had}} <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds</b> to attempt solving the puzzle. Also, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant {{at the start of}} the round. The current time limit and rules for letter selection were introduced on October 3, 1988. Starting on September 4, 1989, the first episode of the seventh syndicated season, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant choosing from one of five envelopes labeled W, H, E, E, and L. One prize was always $25,000 in cash, and the rest were changed weekly. Any prize that was won was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week. During seasons 16 through 18 (1998–2001), the $25,000 remained in-place the entire week of shows regardless if it was won. At the start of season 19 in 2001, there were three car envelopes and two $25,000 envelopes, which were available the entire week of shows. These envelopes were replaced with the bonus wheel on October 22, 2001.|$|E
5|$|On lap 34, both Hamilton and Vettel came in {{for their}} second and final planned stop, both {{equipping}} the medium tyre set. The undercut worked once more for the Ferrari, as Rosberg emerged behind Vettel one lap later. However, Vettel ran wide on the exit of the final corner on lap 36, letting Rosberg past and damaging his front wing, meaning {{he had to come}} into the pit lane for an unscheduled stop on the next lap, leaving him down in fifth position. His teammate Räikkönen made a second pit stop on lap 40, taking the softer and faster tyres, trying to catch the two Mercedes {{towards the end of the}} race. Fourteen laps before the finish, Räikkönen was <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds</b> down on second-placed Rosberg, but closing by more than a second per lap. With the Mercedes in front having to make their way through backmarkers, Räikkönen was able to cut down the gap even faster, reaching Rosberg with three laps of the race to go. Rosberg, suffering from brake overheating over the entire course of the race, outbraked himself at turn one on lap 56, which allowed Räikkönen to take second place from him. The other Mercedes of Hamilton had brake problems as well towards the end, but was able to control the gap to the Ferrari to take his third victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|Baugh invited some 100 {{players to}} the Titans' first {{training}} camp, which {{opened at the}} University of New Hampshire on July 9, 1960. As NFL teams cut players from their training camps, many were invited to the Titans' or other AFL training camps as the teams sought to fill their 35-man rosters. The franchise's first preseason game took place on August 6, 1960, against the Los Angeles Chargers at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Titans kicked off to begin the game, and Chargers running back Paul Lowe returned the kick 105yards for a touchdown. New York lost, 27–7. On September 11, 1960, the opening regular season game was played in a heavy downpour, the remains of Hurricane Diana. Water poured off Coogan's Bluff, situated above the Polo Grounds, swamping the field, which had poor drainage. The Titans' offense was less affected by the mud {{than that of the}} visiting Buffalo Bills. The Titans won the game 27–3 before a crowd of 9,607 (5,727paid attendance). The following week New York played another home game, against the Boston Patriots. On the first of many occasions when the team would lose a game after taking a big lead, the Titans were ahead 24–7 in the second half. With the lead reduced to 24–21, the Titans punted from deep in their own territory with seconds left. The punter, Rick Sapienza, fumbled the snap, and the Patriots recovered in the end zone for the victory. The following week, with the Titans playing at the Denver Broncos, New York blocked a punt on the final play to win the game. In their fourth game, New York had a two-point lead when it fumbled with <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds</b> left against the Dallas Texans. This set off a scramble for the ball, which the Titans recovered as time ran out. Viewers in New York were spared the harrowing ending; in a prelude to the Heidi Game eight years later, the local ABC station had switched to a Walt Disney Davey Crockett special at 6:30p.m. Many viewers called to complain.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the contributions and differential abilities of two types of self-monitoring interventions (academic and behavioral) in securing immediate and sustained (generalizable) increases in academic productivity. <b>Fifteen</b> <b>second</b> grade children participated in a study in which the experimental groups were required to either monitor on-task behavior or the component skills of a cursive writing task. While academic increases were demonstrated by both of the experimental groups during treatment, the study clearly demonstrated that academic self-monitoring was superior to behavioral self-monitoring in producing immediate and sustained academic results without the aid of reinforcement...|$|R
50|$|After the {{rezoning}} of {{the downtown}} area {{and development of the}} 400 ft <b>Fifteen</b> Twenty-One <b>Second</b> Avenue to the immediate north of the Eitel Building in 2006, Nimmer sought to build a 22-story tower on top of the existing building. The proposal drew the ire of condominium owners in <b>Fifteen</b> Twenty-One <b>Second</b> Avenue, who would lose their views if the tower was built, and preservationist groups that sought a landmark designation for the building. The landmark designation was granted by the Landmarks Preservation Board in 2006, but not approved by the Seattle City Council until the dispute between Nimmer and the condominium owners was settled in 2011.|$|R
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds.</b>|$|E
5|$|The teams traded baskets for the {{majority}} of the second half, with the largest advantage being four points by Georgetown with over twelve minutes to go in the game. After five more minutes of game play, North Carolina managed to cut the lead to two, 56–54. The Tar Heels then obtained a single point lead with 5:50 to play and set up in their four corners offense,\ to run out the game clock. The Tar Heels were quickly fouled and Jimmy Black converted two free throws, while Fred Brown made two his own on the other end to bring the score to 59–58 in favor of North Carolina. With three and a half minutes left in the contest, Michael Jordan drove to the basket and made a shot off of the backboard to increase the Tar Heels' lead to three, 61–58. On Georgetown's following possession, Ewing made a jump shot to bring his team within one. North Carolina again set up in the four corners. While making an attempt to steal the ball from Matt Doherty, the Hoyas' Eric Smith was called for a foul. This sent Doherty to the line for a one-and-one, which he missed and Ewing got the rebound. Smith then hit a twelve-foot jump shot with 57 seconds left to go to give Georgetown the lead, 62–61. Then, Jordan received a pass from Black and connected on a shot with <b>fifteen</b> <b>seconds</b> remaining in the game to give North Carolina a one-point lead. On the Hoyas' ensuing possession, Fred Brown passed the ball away to Worthy, who proceeded to run out some of the clock before being fouled. Because the Hoyas were in the double bonus, Worthy received two free throw attempts, both of which he missed. Floyd got the rebound and attempted a last second shot that also missed.|$|E
