500|$|Musically, [...] "What <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> <b>Done</b> for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song.

You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A.

Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> <b>Done</b> for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat.

500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "What <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> <b>Done</b> for Me Lately", which was {{originally}} penned {{for one of}} Jam and Lewis's own records, the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson's feelings about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. The song {{was chosen as the}} lead single for Control, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson's outlook on life. [...] "Nasty", which in Jackson's opinion was the most innovative song on the album, was inspired by her experience with street harassment in Minneapolis by a group of men outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control. She recalled, [...] "They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> <b>Done</b> for Me Lately' were born, {{out of a sense of}} self-defense." [...] Jimmy Jam wrote and played the keyboard arrangement, with Jackson playing the accompaniment. Background vocals were sung by Jackson, Jam and Lewis. The distinctive triplet swing beat of the song was developed by Jam on an Ensoniq Mirage keyboard. [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] was centered on safe sex and abstinence, a subject of significant social commentary at the time. Jam commented that it is common practice for songwriters to use current events as a means of inspiration for lyrics and that the AIDS pandemic had raised awareness about sexually transmitted diseases. He commented, [...] "The theme of the song ('Let's Wait Awhile') was Janet's idea. She's not a preachy person. She's not telling people how to live their lives. All she's doing is offering an opinion." ...|$|E
