The shadows are with <b>hard</b> <b>borders.</b> The proposed method begins with a segmentation of the color image. It is then decided if a segment is a shadow by examination of its neighboring segments. We use the method introduced in Finlayson et. al. [1] to remove the shadows by zeroing the shadow’s borders in an edge representation of the image, and then re-integrating the edge using the method introduced by Weiss [2]. This is done {{for all of the}} color channels thus leaving a shadow-free color image. Unlike previous methods, the present method requires neither a calibrated camera nor multiple images. This method is complementary of current illumination correction algorithms. Examination of a number of examples indicates that this method yields a significant improvement over previous methods.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for summarizing video {{in the form of}} a multiscale image that is continuous in both the spatial domain and across the scale dimension: There are no <b>hard</b> <b>borders</b> between discrete moments in time, and a user can zoom smoothly into the image to reveal additional temporal details. We call these artifacts tapestries because their continuous nature is akin to medieval tapestries and other narrative depictions predating the advent of motion pictures. We propose a set of criteria for such a summarization, and a series of optimizations motivated by these criteria. These can be performed as an entirely offline computation to produce high quality renderings, or by adjusting some optimization parameters the later stages can be solved in real time, enabling an interactive interface for video navigation. Our video tapestries combine the best aspects of two common visualizations, providing the visual clarity of DVD chapter menus with the information density and multiple scales of a video editing timeline representation. In addition, they provide continuous transitions between zoom levels. In a user study, participants preferred both the aesthetics and efficiency of tapestries over other interfaces for visual browsing...|$|R
5000|$|Brexit {{was also}} an issue. In the UK-wide {{referendum}} on EU membership on 23 June 2016, 56% of voters in Northern Ireland voted to [...] "Remain" [...] {{a member of the}} European Union while 44% voted to [...] "Leave". The DUP supported the UK leaving the EU, while nationalist parties and most others opposed, fearing among other things the possibility of a <b>hard</b> <b>border</b> resulting with the Republic of Ireland. It became known during the campaign that the DUP spent £282,000 on a pro-Brexit advert in a newspaper that did not appear in Northern Ireland. The money came from the Constitutional Research Council, a minor pro-union group chaired by the former vice-chair of the Scottish Conservative Party Richard Cook.|$|E

In Northern Ireland, the term [...] "nationalist" [...] is used to refer either to the Catholic population in general or the supporters of the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party. [...] "Nationalism" [...] in this restricted meaning refers to a political tradition that favours an independent, united Ireland achieved by non-violent means.

40|$|Contemporary African {{migration}} to the European Union (EU) is triggered by global interconnectedness, {{but at the same}} time it is opposed by the <b>hard</b> <b>borders</b> of the EU. As a consequence, sub- Saharan African migrants often undertake fragmented and dangerous journeys to the North. These journeys are mainly discussed with regard to the rather linear notion of transit migration (as if migrants depart, go through a transit phase and settle afterwards). In this paper I take a different perspective by approaching migrants’ journeys as open and dynamic phenomena that evolve ‘en route’. I present an analytical lens that takes different mobilities (of people, goods, information, etc.) as the starting point to investigate these migration journeys. With this mobilities lens I analyze in detail three trajectories of African migrants who are moving to the EU. In order to avoid a simple ‘everything is mobile’ argument, I subsequently explore the role of the geographical concept of ‘place’ in the facilitation of these migration journeys. I thereby take into account places as geographical localities as well as migrants’ places in their social networks. Finally, I illustrate how mobilities, in turn, bring their ‘sediments’. This means that they change and give meaning to places. This reciprocal way of relating mobilities to places helps us to go beyond both individualistic and structuralistic explanations of migration...|$|R
40|$|The {{sovereign}} debt crisis, which currently affects especially the European Union, challenges {{on the one}} side the actuality of <b>hard</b> <b>borders</b> and the reexamination of soft borders (Horga & Brie, 2008), {{and on the other side}} the need for the European Union to deal with an even more complex global competition, where only a strong actor with strategy and vocation and not reduced national entities can be viable. A major obstacle – the financial crisis – has made many of the researchers, who saw the EU as a vocational actor in the international system and who sustained institutional neoliberal conceptions and attitudes, start doubting such hypotheses by clinging to neorealist solutions. The disfunctionalities between the EU member states within the crisis have fueled a lot of positions, from euro -skepticism, federalism to interguvernamentalism, but also severe critics addressed to the supranationalists, the constructivists and to the people supporting the integration theories, such as governance and policy networks. Starting from this ambivalence, with which the EU has to deal, the volume which we are putting forward introduces the papers of young Romanian researchers who aim to analyze the actuality of the EU borders and the challenges for the beginning of the 21 st century on the one hand, and on the other, the pace of the EU in the global competition. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{predominant}} spatial {{conception of}} the EU contributes to an evident emergence of a sharpened territorial building of the European space. By all evidence the idea of both the territorial cohesion and territorial continuity shows how relevant the notion of territoriality in the ‘European discourse ’ is and consequently how accepted the instrument of hard and closed border and the sharp inside/outside dichotomy are. Due to this pragmatic notion of territoriality, {{the idea of the}} EU as a ‘non-Westphalian new empire ’ (according to the ‘neo-medieval paradigm’) became at least unrealistic. Its borders are getting more territorial, physical and visible. <b>Hard</b> <b>border</b> policies and practices on the Eastern and Western Balkan borders mirror the existence of a de facto barrier and of a deep ‘Westphalian memory ’ in the way of using the territory as support of political unity...|$|E
40|$|The {{softening}} of {{the traditionally}} <b>hard</b> <b>border</b> {{of the nation-state}} has {{had a significant impact}} on the study of law and legal systems. Until now, those who have studied the international level of law, with some notable exceptions, have sat rather isolated from those who study the domestic legal order. The discourses of public and public international law, with some notable exceptions, rarely come into contact with each other. Each has its own sphere of knowledge, its own principles and its own rules. Those who study and analyse these rules and the principles behind them may exchange pleasantries at conferences and even the odd conversation in the faculty common room but the two sub-species of the genus droiticus publicus do not normally interact. They are happy in their ignorance. The onset of 'globalisation' and the use of supranational institutions to create policy with a domestic element are forcing the barrier between domestic and international spheres of law to be gradually reassessed. For the public lawyer such changes require a greater knowledge of the institutions of the supra-national level that are playing an increasingly influential role in developing policy at the domestic sphere. For the international lawyer the change is, if anything, even more profound. Public international law has largely shied away from engaging with traditional public law concepts such as accountability and democracy. Now that international decisions are having such an impact on the domestic sphere good governance demands that the principles applied to domestic decision-making must be applied more generally. The 'internationalisation' of public law is a topic far too wide to tackle in any great depth here. This short work instead focuses on an aspect of this wider phenomenon that is likely to prove of increasing relevance as the globalisation trend continues. By using international obligations to create domestic regulations domestic institutions previously charged with such a role have been bypassed. The clear loser in such a development is the national legislature. The democratic deficit at the heart of the EU has become the classic example of this phenomenon. However, a second, less acknowledged democratic deficit applies to sub-national governments in relevant states...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, novel {{approaches}} {{for understanding the}} human subcortex using Ultra-High field MRI (UHF-MRI) were explored. The approaches were also applied to empirically validate the tripartite model of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). In Chapter 2, current state-of-the-art UHF-MRI methods and their relevance {{for the study of}} the human subcortex were reviewed. In Chapter 3, the iron distribution of the STN was visualized with quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in both living subjects, as well as post-mortem tissue. We showed that the spatial distribution of iron is heterogeneous throughout the STN, but that there are no <b>hard</b> <b>borders</b> or clear subdivisions in the spatial distribution of iron across the STN. In Chapter 4 we investigated post-mortem STN samples using multiple MRI sequences, as well as immunocytochemical stainings. The histochemical structure of the STN is complex, gradual, and shows no clear tripartite subdivision. In Chapter 5 we critically reviewed the methods used in the empirical neuroimaging literature on the STN. Conventional methods turn out to be inadequate for distinguishing between signals from adjacent nuclei. We promote a ROI-approach and cautioned against spatial smoothing. In Chapter 6, a set of 7 T fMRI protocols was compared, to assess which spatial resolution is feasible for functionally imaging iron-rich subcortical nuclei at UHF. We show that also at 7 T, some modesty in terms of resolution is necessary for functional imaging of subcortex and that 3 T fMRI shows inferior BOLD sensitivity. In Chapter 7 we reviewed different {{approaches for}} linking cognitive computational models to neural measurements. Such approaches might aid in the interpretation of BOLD measurements in subcortex. Finally, in Chapter 8, we tested the tripartite model of the STN with an empirical study on how BOLD activity in different parts of the STN is related to different aspects of perceptual decision-making. The STN is involved in implementing response biases, there was no evidence for functional differentiation across different parts of the STN...|$|R
40|$|Debate {{about the}} final {{destination}} of European integration is again in vogue {{and it is}} largely state-centric. The future EU is usually seen as {{a new type of}} Westphalian (federal) state with a central government in charge of a given territory with clear-cut borders. An overlap between its functional and geographic borders is also envisaged with few complicating opt-outs, and no variable geometry. However, this article shows that achieving an overlap between the functional and geographic borders of the EU is very unlikely given the huge degree of divergence that will result from the forthcoming enlargement. The article also questions the EU's ability to acquire one of the most fundamental attributes of a Westphalian type of state: a fixed and relatively <b>hard</b> external <b>border.</b> It offers evidence suggesting that an enlarged EU would more closely resemble a neo-medieval empire rather than a neo-Westphalian state with serious practical and conceptual implications...|$|R
