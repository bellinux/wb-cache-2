5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>more</b> than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E
25|$|The {{transformation}} from the youth {{team to the}} national side, however, took a bit of time, {{and it was not}} until the 1994–95 season that he got his chance in the national colours. This delay was partly because during the period 90–94 Bangladesh was mainly involved with One-Day Cricket while Jawed's batting technique <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>more</b> suitable for the longer version. Jawed was part of the team that won the ICC Trophy in 1997. However, he spent most of the tournament as a reserve player, as the coach Gordon Greenidge decided to push hard hitting middle-order bat Naimur Rahman to the opening position.|$|E
25|$|The {{somewhat}} {{thin and}} fragile shell is {{small compared to}} what is known from the other achatinids in southern Africa, its length/height is less than 45mm with about 7½ whorls. (This description is in contradiction to Connolly (1925), who probably attributes a wrongly identified shell 63.2mm long to this taxon – a statement not repeated in his 1939 monograph.) The length <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>more</b> than two times the maximum diameter, which is situated at {{about the level of}} the apex of the aperture. The length of the aperture is always less than half that of the shell; the length of the last whorl in front view is always under three quarters of the total length. The apex is comparatively blunt. The whorls are hardly convex, including the body whorl. The aperture is fairly narrow (greatest width just under the middle) with a thin outer lip; the columella is white, short and narrow, concave with a slight twist, obliquely truncate close to the base. The nepionic whorls are wrinkled and granulose, though always worn in the material studied. The sculpture consists of regular and close wrinkles resulting in a reticulate-granulate pattern, very prominent below the sutures but well visible on all whorls; in addition there are very faint growth striae. All specimens exhibit a close and fine zebra pattern with irregular, orange-brown flames on a yellowish-brown background; there is a very thin and deciduous periostracum. On the whole this seems to be a well-defined taxon because of the size, shape and sculpture of the shell.|$|E

2500|$|One apprehends reality {{only through}} {{representations}} of reality, through texts, discourses, images: {{there is no}} such thing as direct or unmediated access to reality.
