2500|$|The 1980s brought {{additional}} funding restraints led to additional reorganization for the ASD. [...] In addition to <b>equipment</b> <b>engineering</b> the ASD worked on process improvement as well by introducing Total Quality Management (TQM). [...] ASD also helped operationalize stealth technology {{which had been}} introduced in the 1970s. [...] Work also began on a system of very high speed integrated circuits that would allow advanced avionics architectures to integrate many aircraft subsystems such as weapons delivery, flight controls, and communications into smaller, more reliable subsystems. [...] The Avionics and Flight Dynamics Laboratories coordinated research on an [...] "all-glass" [...] cockpit of the future that would allow a pilot, through voice activation, to mix or [...] "enhance" [...] data presented in picture-like symbols on one large TV-like screen.|$|E
