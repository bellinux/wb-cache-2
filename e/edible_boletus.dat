5|$|A choice <b>edible</b> species, <b>Boletus</b> aereus {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} in Southern Europe for its culinary qualities, {{and is considered}} by many to be gastronomically superior to Boletus edulis. In the vicinity of Borgotaro in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species Boletus edulis, B.aereus, B.reticulatus (formerly known as B.aestivalis), and B.pinophilus have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed Fungo di Borgotaro. Here, these mushrooms have been collected and exported commercially for centuries. Throughout Spain, it is one of the wild edible fungi most commonly collected for the table, particularly in Aragon, where it is harvested for sale in markets.|$|R
40|$|Identification of commercially {{important}} fungi, such as {{the valuable}} <b>edible</b> fungus <b>Boletus</b> edulis can be difficult considering visual or metabolic approaches. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the rDNA ITS sequence, a pair of specific primers was designed for differentiating B. edulis from other mushrooms by PCR. PCR was performed with total DNA as a template at an annealing temperature between 56 - 60 ºC. Positive amplicons were obtained from B. edulis with all DNA templates from fruit bodies and cultured mycelium, but not from other fungal species at an annealing temperature of 60 ºC. The result indicated that B. edulis could be clearly distinguished from other fungi by PCR, {{and there were no}} misidentifications under the reaction conditions used.

40|$|Mushrooms {{and fungi}} not only present a {{fascinating}} world of shapes, both macro- and microscopic, {{but they are}} also an interesting source of flavours, fragrances and odours, e. g. garlic, coconut, flour-like, cucumber or fruit-like, as well as the most characteristic for this kingdom of living organisms mushroom-like flavour and aroma. Fungi can possess many different and interesting flavours and fragrances - starting from nice anise-like, fruit-like, cucumber, garlic, to cheese-garlic, and ending with potato or flour-like smells. Some mushrooms emit carbide or distinctly faecal-like odour. The taste of mushrooms is frequently correlated with their aroma. What components does the core of a mushroom flavour consist of? Chemical analysis of specimens reveals compounds responsible for characteristic flavour and odour. It was found that the most characteristic flavour compound is defined mainly by C 8 volatiles. Between all C 8 compounds the most important for mushroom flavour are oct- 1 -en- 3 -ol, octan- 3 -ol, octan- 3 -on and oct- 1 -en- 3 -on. Fungi and mushrooms can enable biotechnological production of some flavour components, for instance the Nidula niveotomentosa produces a characteristic raspberries compound - raspberry ketone in submerged cultures; the biotechnological production can also provide rare and tasty forest mushroom biomass e. g. <b>edible</b> <b>boletus.</b> Bogactwo aromatów w świecie grzybów pozwala na biotechnologiczne wykorzystanie ich do otrzymywania bądź to czystych związków, jak np. w przypadku ketonu malinowego pozyskiwanego z Nidula niveotomentosa, bądź np. aromatycznej grzybni mogącej zastąpić rzadkie i pożądane gatunki grzybów leśnych, np. borowików...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Trace element {{contents}} in genus Boletus from Croatia {{are very}} limited. The {{aim of this}} study is to give detailed trace element concentrations in ectomychorrhizal <b>edible</b> mushroom <b>Boletus</b> reticulatus from Zrin mountain. Material and Method: Fruiting bodies of the Boletus reticulatus were collected in a study area of Zrin mountain (Croatia). The contents of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn in fruiting bodies of ectomychorrhizal species were carried out by atomic adsorption spectrometry. Results and Conclusions: The results showed that concentrations of the studied elements decreased in order: Zn (91, 31 mg kg– 1) > Fe (57, 27 mg kg– 1) > Cu (13, 80 mg kg– 1) > Pb (4, 20 mg kg– 1) > Ni (2, 67 mg kg– 1) > Cr (2, 52 mg kg– 1) > Hg (2, 38 mg kg– 1) > Cd (1, 66 mg kg– 1).

40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the antioxidant, antihyperglycemic and antimicrobial effects of both ethanolic and hydromethanolic extracts of the fruiting bodies of wild <b>edible</b> mushrooms <b>Boletus</b> edulis (penny bun) and Cantharellus cibarius (golden chanterelle) sampled in Poiana Stampei (Suceava county, Romania). The total phenolic contents of extracts were also determined. Boletus edulis hydromethanolic extract showed the highest total phenolic content (72. 78 ± 0. 29 mg/g). This extract {{was also the}} most active as scavenger of DPPH and ABTS radicals (EC 50 = 151. 44 ± 0. 85 and 65. 4 ± 0. 4 µg/mL, respectively) and reducing agent (EC 50 = 46. 77 ± 0. 34 µg/mL). Cantharellus cibarius ethanolic extract showed high ferrous ion chelating (EC 50 = 82. 9 ± 0. 6 µg/mL), 15 -lipoxygenase (EC 50 = 236. 7 ± 1. 5 µg/mL) and α-glucosidase (EC 50 = 9. 77 ± 0. 06 μg/mL) inhibitory activities. For both mushrooms, the ethanolic extracts were more active against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 than the hydromethanolic ones.

40|$|Samples of the <b>edible</b> {{mushroom}} <b>Boletus</b> edulis Bull. {{were studied}} {{to assess the}} risk for human health related to their content of the artificial radionuclide 137 Cs. Fresh B. edulis carpophores were collected in four undeveloped microhabitats of Lucca province (Tuscany, North-Central Italy). Dried non-cultivated samples coming from this same district and 11 other Italian provinces or European countries were instead purchased fromcommercial sources. Contents of 137 Cs, reported as Bq kg‒ 1 dry weight (dw), were measured by γ-spectrometry. The radionuclide concentration varied depending on the gathering site in fresh samples, with 41. 8 ± 5. 2 Bq kg‒ 1 dw at site 1 (Tosco-Emiliani Apennine) and four-fold less, 12. 8 ± 1. 3 Bq kg‒ 1 dw, at site 2 (Apuan Alps). Moreover, fresh or dried carpophores from Lucca province displayed among the lowest 137 Cs contents in Europe. Average 137 Cs levels in all analysed samples were substantially below the legal threshold for edible mushrooms, 600 Bq kg‒ 1 dw. Conclusively, we report that 137 Cs amounts in B. edulis depend on both {{the distance from the}} Chernobyl accident and multifactorial features of collection sites. We also show that the consumption of European B. edulis does not represent a major health risk with respect to 137 Cs radio contamination...|$|R

The acute toxicity of this compound also precluded its use at higher doses for enhanced in vivo radioprotection.

40|$|The {{amount of}} the trace {{elements}} As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Li, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr, and Zn was measured in top soils and <b>edible</b> mushrooms, <b>Boletus</b> edulis, Macrolepiota procera, collected at five distinct green microhabitats inside the Lucca province, North-Central Italy (years 2008 - 2009). Results showed a top soil element content within the Italian statutory limits. Concerning the amount of mushroom elements, we observed significant species-differences obtaining higher levels of Ni, Rb, and Se in B. edulis or As, Pb, Cu in M. procera. Bioaccumulation factors (BCFs: element in mushroom/element in soil) resulted species-dependent and element-selective: in particular, B. edulis preferentially accumulated Se (BCFs varying from 14 to 153), while M. procera mainly concentrated Cu (BCFs varying from 5 to 15). As well, both species displayed between-site BCF differences. By a multivariate principal component approach, cluster analysis (CA), we could resolve two main clusters of soil element composition, corresponding to the most ecologically divergent sites. Besides, CA showed no cluster relating to element contents of B. edulis at the different collection sites, while a separation in groups was found for M. procera composition with respect to harvesting locations, suggesting uptake systems, in this saprotrophic species, sensitive to microhabitat. Regarding consumer safety, Cd, Hg, Pb levels resulted sometime relevant in present samples, never reaching values from current literature on mushrooms collected in urban-polluted areas.

Soil samples of the 0 - 10 cm topsoil layer from the widely distributed locations had mercury levels ranging between 0. 034 to 3. 4 mg kg- 1 dry matter. In Yunnan, both the soil parent rock and fruiting bodies of Boletus spp. were enriched in Hg, whereas the same species from Sichuan, located outside the mercuriferous belt, had low Hg concentrations, suggesting that the Hg in the Yunnan samples is mainly from geogenic sources rather than anthropogenic sources. However, the contribution of anthropogenically-derived Hg sequestered within soils of Yunnan has not been quantified, so more future research is required. Our results suggest that high rates of consumption of Boletus spp. from Yunnan can deliver relatively high doses of Hg to consumers, but that rates can differ widely because of large variability in mercury concentrations between species and locations...|$|R
