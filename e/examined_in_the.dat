5|$|Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, {{thought the}} {{proposed}} marriage ideal {{to build an}} alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens. He was adamant {{that she was not}} to know she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E

5|$|Levin {{published}} {{his first book}} in 1970. Called The Pendulum Years, its subtitle, Britain and the Sixties, summed up its subject. In 22 self-contained chapters, Levin considered various aspects of British life during the decade. Among his topics were prominent people including Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson – dubbed the Walrus and the Carpenter by Levin – and {{institutions such as the}} monarchy, the churches and the British Empire in its last days. Among the individual events <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book were the 1968 student riots and the prosecution for obscenity of the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships among}} stony corals were first <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th and early 20th centuries. The two most advanced 19th century classifications both used complex skeletal characters; The 1857 classification of the French zoologists Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime’s {{was based on}} macroscopic skeletal characters, while Francis Grant Ogilvie's 1897 scheme was developed using observations of skeletal microstructures, with {{particular attention to the}} structure and pattern of the septal trabeculae. In 1943, the American zoologists Thomas Wayland Vaughan and John West Wells, and Wells again in 1956, used the patterns of the septal trabeculae to divide the group into five suborders. In addition, they considered polypoid features such as the growth of the tentacles. They also distinguished families by wall type and type of budding.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag was}} <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century by A.J.B. Wace of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who {{concluded}} that the silk was woven in either Syria or Rhodes, and the darns {{were made in the}} Near East. It was his opinion that the flag, in its original state, would have been quite precious, possibly a relic like the shirt of a saint. The belief {{at the time of this}} examination was the MacLeods were descended from Harald Hardrada, who spent some time in Constantinople in the 11th century. In line with this belief, it was suggested that the flag may have passed from Harald Hardrada down to the eponymous ancestor of the clan—Leod. The MacLeod Estate Office (Dunvegan Castle) website claims that experts have dated the flag to the 4th and 7th centuries—hundreds of years before the Crusades. The flag is currently held in Dunvegan Castle, along with other notable heirlooms such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor's Horn.|$|E

5|$|The golden white-eye {{differs from}} the other {{white-eyes}} in having large eyes and an outermost primary wing feather that is not reduced (as {{it is in the}} other species). It is a large white-eye, 14cm (5.5in) long and weighing around 20g (0.7oz). The species has bright, unmistakable plumage, with: an orange-yellow head coupled with a pale eye-ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. The bill and legs are also orange. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males can be told from the females only when <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown-yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} tension between those musicians {{who went into}} exile, and were therefore able to perform for, and raise awareness among, much larger audiences, and anti-apartheid musicians who remained in South Africa.

The role of music in social change in South African is <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> documentary film , released in 2002.

5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and coniferous tree hosts that had been affected by the fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E
