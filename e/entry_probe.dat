5|$|The {{continued}} {{exploration of}} Saturn {{is still considered}} to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions.

5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric <b>entry</b> <b>probe</b> found {{that even in the}} upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, to a level of 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from the outer solar system, formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found in the Sun).|$|E

40|$|The 2003 Solar System Exploration Decadal Survey ('SSEDS') {{emphasizes}} the significant science available from Jupiter deep <b>entry</b> <b>probes.</b> Studies performed at JPL this year identified a mission design {{that would allow}} JIMO to deliver and support one or more <b>entry</b> <b>probes</b> that reach the 100 -bar level in Jupiter's atmosphere, with relatively minor modifications to JIMO s preliminary mission design. Notably, the icy moon tour mission design, beginning with Callisto approach, is unaffected. This proposed mission design would offer the option of adding a rich new set of high-priority SSEDS science objectives to the planned JIMO mission for a relatively small investment...|$|R
25|$|Huygens was an {{atmospheric}} <b>entry</b> <b>probe</b> {{that landed}} successfully on Saturn's moon Titan in 2005. Built {{and operated by}} the European Space Agency (ESA), {{it was part of}} the Cassini–Huygens mission and became the first spacecraft ever to land on Titan and the furthest landing from Earth a spacecraft has ever made. The probe was named after the Dutch 17th-century astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655.|$|E
25|$|Galileo was an American {{unmanned}} spacecraft that studied the planet Jupiter and its moons, {{as well as}} several other Solar System bodies. Named after the astronomer Galileo Galilei, it consisted of an orbiter and <b>entry</b> <b>probe.</b> It was launched on October 18, 1989, carried by , on the STS-34 mission. Galileo arrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, after gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth, and became the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter. It launched the first probe into Jupiter, directly measuring its atmosphere. Despite suffering major antenna problems, Galileo achieved the first asteroid flyby, of 951 Gaspra, and discovered the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, around 243 Ida. In 1994, Galileo observed Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9's collision with Jupiter.|$|E
25|$|One early {{estimate}} of the primordial ratio of 3He to 4He in the solar nebula has been the measurement of their ratio in the atmosphere of Jupiter, measured by the mass spectrometer of the Galileo atmospheric <b>entry</b> <b>probe.</b> This ratio is about 1:10,000, or 100 parts of 3He per million parts of 4He. This is roughly the same ratio of the isotopes in lunar regolith, when it contains 28ppm helium-4 and 2.8ppb helium-3 (which is {{at the lower end}} of actual sample measurements, which vary from about 1.4 to 15ppb). However, terrestrial ratios of the isotopes are lower by a factor of 100, mainly due to enrichment of helium-4 stocks in the mantle by billions of years of alpha decay from uranium and thorium.|$|E
30|$|The former Soviet Union sent many probes to Venus {{from the}} 1960 s to the 1980 s. Their Venera series used <b>entry</b> <b>probes</b> and orbiters {{to study the}} {{atmospheric}} composition and structure, surface composition, and topography (Moroz, 1983). Although the surface of Venus was too hot for the <b>entry</b> <b>probes</b> to survive {{for more than two}} hours, their observations gave us a rough idea about the Venusian environment. The Pioneer Venus orbiter and <b>entry</b> <b>probes</b> of U.S., which were launched in 1978, also provided plenty of new information on the atmosphere and the surface (Colin, 1980). The Vega balloons were dropped into the cloud layer of Venus by the Soviet Union and France in 1985 and observed meso-scale cloud processes and horizontal advection over 46 hours (Sagdeev et al, 1986). The U.S. probe Magellan, which took off for Venus in 1989, radar-mapped the Venusian surface precisely (Saunders et al, 1992). In 1990, the Galileo spacecraft encountered Venus for a gravity assist to obtain kinetic energy to go to Jupiter, and at that time, it observed the Venus atmosphere (Johnson et al, 1991).|$|R
40|$|The various <b>entry</b> <b>probes</b> for {{measuring}} outer planetary atmospheric compositions are discussed.

40|$|During {{hypersonic}} <b>entry</b> of a <b>probe</b> {{into the}} atmospheres of outer planets, the radiative energy transport in the shock-heated layer {{is of great}} significance in computing the heating to the heat shield. The so-called tangential slab approximation is frequently employed to evaluate the radiative flux {{to the surface of}} <b>entry</b> <b>probes.</b> A simple assessment of the accuracy of the tangential slab approximation at the stagnation point is given here for blunt axisymmetric bodies of various shock shapes which include spheres, paraboloids, hyperboloids and ellipsoids of different shock parameters...|$|R

30|$|The {{horizontal}} {{scale of the}} feature may provide a key. The scale of the 986 nm features tracked by Galileo was {{in the order of}} 300 km (this is read on figure 1 of Belton et al., 1991). By comparing the clouds data measured by a pair of <b>entry</b> <b>probes</b> worked nearly the same time (such as listed in table 4 a of James et al., 1997), it is found that the lower clouds appear to be most variable as far as the distance between the <b>entry</b> <b>probes</b> is in the order of several hundred km (such as the case of Venera 11 and 12), and that whole the layers are variable if the distance exceeds 1000 km (such as the case of Venera 9 and 10). This fact is suggestive that the representative height of the 0.90 εm dayside images is in the lower cloud region 48 – 50 km. However, the number of examples is so limited that a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn.|$|R
