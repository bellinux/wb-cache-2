40|$|In {{a moment}} when few {{students}} enrol in courses within the Faculty of Science, the problem of first year undergraduates’ difficulties in mathematics has become a social issue. The main consequences for students are a delay in graduating and, sometimes, {{the feeling that they}} made the wrong choice. Lately, a number of initiatives have been undertaken by both the Ministry and the Universities in order to stem this phenomenon. In this paper, we look at students’ difficulties in mathematics from a perspective that is opposed to that viewing the only origin of these difficulties in students’ lack of preparation. Our “alternative” interpretation guided us in the design and planning of preliminary courses that have been organised {{over the past five years}} by the University of Pisa’s Faculty of Science and set up by a working group including both the authors. We will try to account for the specific nature of these courses through a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectives,</b> part of the original materials produced and used during the sessions and methodology underlying the actual development of the session...|$|E

The role which mathematics can play in developing the Individual personality is then discussed. The second part of this book considers first the needs for behavioral objectives in teaching, illustrated by the Duluth Elementary Mathematics Content Guide and over 250 objectives and sample evaluation items. Some practical aspects are then discussed: student learning guides (student contracts), student achievement records, coding procedures, student planning schedules, student record forms, classrocm design, and problems of evaluation of student progress- The book concludes with a list of commercial hiaterials of use in an individualized mathematics program, brief descriptions of relevant developmental projects, and an extensive bibliography- (oi) Li rv ot I R im is ri ti...|$|E

The <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> and the model structure are followed by {{the discussion of the}} first model version (HAM- 1) and the actual results. HAM {{is going to be the}} first system simulation model to describe the Hungarian food and agriculture sector having the following characteristics; — the model is dynamic and has a descriptive character; — the food consumption sphere is incorporated; — the nonfood production sectors of the economy are represented by assuming that they produce only one aggregated commodity; — the economic, technical and biological aspects of food production are covered; — both the production of agricultural raw materials and food processing are modelled; — under 'other ' agricultural production and food processing all products not individually represented are aggregated; and — financial equilibrium is maintained. HAM is in fact a system of interconnected models. The government economic management and planning submodel describes the decision making and control of the socialist state following the idea of centrally planning the economy. The desired structure of food production, export, import and investment targets are calculated by a linear programming model. The revision of basic government policy instruments (e. g., domestic prices) is also endogeniz-ed in these submodels. The submodel of real sphere covers the whole national economy. The major blocks of the latter submodel are related to production (linear programming models for socialist agriculture and food processing sector, nonlinear optimization model for household and private agriculture) ...|$|E

40|$|Regulatory Fees at Children´s Department in Klatovy Hospital The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} effects and impacts after an introduction of regulatory fees {{in the health}} service. An aim of the thesis was to ascertain effects of the introduction of regulatory fees at Children´s Department in Klatovy Hospital. First I investigated how the fees influenced an exploitation of the hospital care, and then I investigated whether the fees influenced a possibility of parents to accompany their children during the hospitalization. In the theoretical part I deal with basic definitions of terms related {{to the issue of}} regulatory fees. These include concepts of a health, an illness, a health policy, health systems, a structure of the health system in the Czech Republic and a definition of the regulatory fees, their types, an importance of their introduction, a protection limit, effects of the introduction and a consumption of the health services after the introduction of the fees. In the practical part I attend to a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> and hypotheses, a research methodology and an interpretation of results. The research part was realized by using a quantitative form of the research, I used a method of interviewing, a questionnaire technique. As an auxiliary method I chose a document analysis { [...] } secondary data analysis. The research sample consisted of the parents accompanying their children for an examination at an outpatient clinic and parents accompanying hospitalized children. The research results showed that regulatory fees do not influence the possibility of parents to accompany their children during the hospitalization and although parents say that in case of repeated hospitalizations the fees could influence this possibility, they continue to accompany their children during their hospitalization and on the contrary, there is an increasing number of the accompanying. The research also showed that at Children´s Department a use of First Aid Medical Service (Baby Call) decreased after the introduction of the fees and thus it was not further misused. On the contrary there was no {{decline in the number of}} hospitalized patients. I suppose that this bachelor thesis can be used for a better orientation in this new area of the health care charges and for an outline of real impacts which were brought into the health care in the first two years. Just because of the relatively short period of the existence of the fees, I would recommend to continue monitoring the impact of the charging and to follow any further changes in legislation...|$|E
40|$|The current {{situation}} of market information systems on organic farming in Europe shows a substantial lack of information. Although previous EU-research {{projects such as}} OFCAP (FAIR 3 -CT 96 - 1794) and OMIaRD (QLK 5 - 2000 - 01124) have shown that regional or national data gathering takes place in many countries, the availability of detailed and current data on various levels, such as production, consumption, prices as well as trade, on the national {{as well as at}} the European level, is not satisfactory. The main problem areas identified in regard to market information systems for organic farming can be summarised as i) the lack of market information at the national level and ii) where data are available, the lack of data harmonisation at the European level. Within the EU-funded concerted action EISfOM (European Information System for Organic Markets, QLK 5 - 2002 - 02400), the aim is to build a framework for reporting valid and reliable production and market data for the European organic sector in order to meet the needs of policymakers, farmers, processors, wholesalers and other actors involved in organic markets. Based on the previous research done in Workpackages 2, 3 and 4, this report focuses on the evaluation of pilot case studies in eight European countries, showing proposals for new and/or enlarged data collection and processing systems for organic markets in Europe. This report is based mainly on the pilot application studies conducted in WP 5. Following the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> and the general approach of WP 5 in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 focuses on the national pilot case studies, including a description of the relevant institutions and DCPS as well as an assessment of data quality. Chapter 3 provides an analysis of the DCPS investigated with regard to the problems and barriers involved with their practical implementation. Chapter 4 then analyses the critical points identified with regard to potential solutions for harmonisation of various DCPS at the national and international level. Chapter 5 deals with the analysis of the recommendations made in WP 4, while Chapter 6 summarizing and concluding the results. As well as the national working papers on the results of the pilot application studies, this deliverable is also strongly linked to previous project deliverables, namely D 2 “WP 2 : Data collection and processing systems for conventional markets and WP 3 : Data collection and processing systems for organic markets” (Wolfert, S. et al., 2004), deliverable D 3 “Report on proposals for the development, harmonisation and quality assurance of organic data collection and processing systems. systems (Recke, G. et al., 2004) and the proceedings of the first European Seminar “Development of a European Information System for organic markets – improving the scope and quality of statistical data” (Recke, G. et al., 2004) ...|$|E
