40|$|While the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has admirably commandeered its {{stewardship}} of patent law—Congress bestowed the Federal Circuit with exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals since 1982 —the court has unabashedly extended its reach, unwelcomed, <b>into</b> commercial <b>law.</b> Camouflaged {{in the name}} of patent stewardship, the Federal Circuit’s foray <b>into</b> commercial <b>law</b> has yielded unexpected and unjustifiable results. This Article argues that, paradoxically, to maintain its {{stewardship of}} patent law, the Federal Circuit should not invoke patent law to rationalize its decisions concerning commercial law, which have dramatically altered established commercial <b>law.</b> This encroachment <b>into</b> commercial <b>law,</b> which is within the provenance of state law, destabilizes federalism causing uncertainty in state law. The Federal Circuit must refrain from encroaching <b>into</b> commercial <b>law</b> as it has no authority to inject itself <b>into</b> state <b>law</b> making...|$|R

While defeated, his actions were vindicated by a bill of 1820 introduced by Thomas Erskine, which was given the Royal Assent and came <b>into</b> <b>law.</b> Garrow eventually resigned as Attorney General and as a member of parliament in 1817, when he was appointed one of the Barons of the Exchequer.|$|E

No difference of this sort exists in the third case; since here the partial laws are, in fact, the very same law as the general one, and any exception to them would be an exception to it too.|$|R
