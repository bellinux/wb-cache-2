5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her boundless cruelty and depravity, frantically seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers {{from all the other}} witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in our world in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light. The game begins as Brad, dressed in medieval-style clothing, wakes up in a dungeon cell. But the boy soon manages to escape, and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers, meets a host of friendly and hostile characters, and rises to become a reluctant hero who <b>just</b> <b>might</b> break the titular curse and bring down the evil's reign.|$|E
25|$|Allied {{forces were}} {{fighting}} {{their way across}} France, and fresh units were badly needed in autumn 1944 to continue to press the offensive. The breakout from Saint-Lô, France was accomplished far more rapidly than Allied planners had dared hope, and American units plunged through the French countryside with undreamed of rapidity, far in advance of operational plans. American press reports from the European theater foretold the imminent fall of the Third Reich, and many men in Lt. Col. Butler's battalion thought that the war <b>just</b> <b>might</b> be over before they got there. This did not {{turn out to be}} true.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey dubbed the album [...] " [...] most thematically consistent, least self-contradicting work", and stated, [...] "it {{may not be}} his definitive album, but it <b>just</b> <b>might</b> be his best". Steve [...] "Flash" [...] Juon of RapReview seemed to feel differently, remarking that the album [...] "is not only the quintessential Shakur album, {{but one of the}} most important rap albums released in the 1990s as a whole".|$|E

500|$|The first {{review was}} {{published}} by UK newspaper The Guardian, which awarded the game a perfect score, and stated [...] "Ever since it first worked out how to assemble pixels so that they resembled something more recognisable than aliens, the games industry has dreamed of creating one thing above all else – a game that is indistinguishable from a film, except that you can control the lead character. With L.A. Noire, it <b>just</b> <b>might,</b> finally, have found the embodiment of that particular holy grail." ...|$|E
500|$|Heath, who had {{acquired}} the nickname [...] "Lord Jeff", {{was called a}} [...] "problem child" [...] by Indian player-manager Lou Boudreau. Peckinpaugh once said that Heath [...] "could {{have been one of}} the greatest players. He had the ability to do about anything. He could run, he could throw, and he could hit. But he just had no hustle, no nothing. If a ball went by him, he <b>just</b> <b>might</b> walk after it." [...] In December 1945 the Indians traded Heath to the Washington Senators where he started in right field.|$|E
500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that [...] "even by the crude standards of teenage horror, Final Destination is dramatically flat". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post commented that [...] "the film's premise quickly deteriorates into a silly, badly acted slasher movie—minus the slasher". Kevin Maynard of Mr. Showbiz described {{the film as}} [...] "crude and witless", while Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "your own final destination <b>just</b> <b>might</b> be the box office, to demand your money back".|$|E

He also praised what he expected to be a [...] "re-set" [...] of the series with Rita's death. Marcia White of The Express-Times declared Dexter [...] "one of the best cable dramas on TV", and called the final scene between Dexter and Arthur particularly touching.

500|$|Around this time, the Romulans {{attack the}} Enterprise, and the Vendorian—realizing that his actions have placed {{the ship in}} danger—decides to betray his Romulan masters for love. He {{takes the form of}} the Enterprises main {{deflector}} shield and the Romulans retreat. The Vendorian is arrested and would face trial but Kirk informs him that his actions to protect the Enterprise would be taken into consideration. Nored informs the Vendorian that it is very similar to Winston in personality and she offers to return to Earth with the alien.

A chance visit from a vendor gives her an idea to finagle a promotion to office administrator, hopefully for some added income. She informs Gabe of her promotion [...] "from a few months back" [...] and tells him {{she has not been}} paid accordingly, to which Gabe promises her he will get the missing wages if she can get all of the department heads to sign off on it. While she is busy convincing everyone that she has become the new administrator, Gabe catches on that she might be lying, and confronts her about it. Using a strategy she learned from watching poker, she stands her ground against Gabe and becomes de facto office administrator.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy Adventure was {{featured}} in Nintendo Power when it was re-released in the United States. The game holds an aggregated score of 79.07% approval rating on Game Rankings based on seven reviews. IGN praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music. They additionally praised the game's puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to , though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. RPGFan also praised the game stating it was [...] "possibly {{the best thing that}} ever happened to Gameboy." [...] RPGamer praised the game's plot stating,"The story is one where you can relate to the characters and also the world around them." [...] Ndojo also gave similar praise to the game however noting it being vastly different from Final Fantasy stating, [...] "If you’re expecting Final Fantasy in the traditional sense, you’re going to be disappointed. However, if you play the game for a while, you <b>just</b> <b>might</b> find that it’s equally entertaining in its own fashion." ...|$|E

500|$|Justice Samuel Alito wrote a {{separate}} concurrence supporting the majority decision, and {{was joined by}} Chief Justice John G. Roberts. Though Alito agreed with the constitutional application to the California law, believing that its [...] "threshold requirement" [...] that guides what material would {{be covered by the}} law was too broad, he questioned the potential double standard that existed between violence and sexual content in regards to this threshold. Alito wrote that he was unsure that there was no connection between violent video games and effects on children, stating that [...] "There are reasons to suspect that the experience of playing violent video games <b>just</b> <b>might</b> be very different from reading a book, listening to the radio, or watching a movie or a television show," [...] referencing the book [...] Infinite Reality [...] which highlights the psychological effects of virtual reality, and argued that the decision [...] "would not squelch legislative efforts to deal with what is perceived by some to be a significant and developing social problem." ...|$|E

[...] Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie used his Twitter account to write that everything about the show was [...] "great". Beyoncé's husband and rapper Jay-Z, also wrote on Twitter that Beyoncé was the [...] "best performer in the world". A writer of Complex magazine further discussed his statements, [...] "Sure, he's married to her... But upon further reflection, he <b>just</b> <b>might</b> have a point. What other artist out there gives the type of live performance she does on a nightly basis? Who can give you that incredible voice singing power ballads and up-tempo dance cuts—while dancing?...

500|$|... 11 overall {{received}} mixed, {{but mostly}} unflattering reviews from critics. Music reviewer Chris Jones from the BBC wrote generally positively about 11 in his review. He {{concluded that it}} was another strong album, even if Adams voice sounded dispassionate on some tracks. The Canadian website Jam! gave the album an average review. Reviewer Darryl Stedan found the lyrics clichéd, predictable and, while not criticising it, described it as an album [...] "that didn't really mean much." [...] Ryan Wasoba from the alternatively weekly magazine, Houston Press wrote favorably of the record in a backhanded way, commenting that 11's appeal laid in its [...] "inoffensiveness" [...] and [...] "digestibility". In another favorable review, Daily Mail writer Adrian Thrills said the album highlight was [...] "Oxygen", commenting on the similarities with the music of Bob Dylan. Amy O'Brian of The Vancouver Sun wrote favorably of the new album, {{while at the same}} time criticising it for its clichés, bad lyrics and for its too-familiar melodies, and concluded, [...] "It's cheesy and overdone, but the truth is that it <b>just</b> <b>might</b> give Adams his first hit in a decade." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} a somewhat positive reaction from reviewers. IGN Robert Canning was representative of this, {{and gave it}} a [...] "good" [...] rating of 7.5 out of 10: [...] "The episode as a whole was fine for what it was, touching on most of the hallmarks of a decent prom episode", though he [...] "was a bit let down by the final moments of the episode as [...] felt it too quickly tried to pin a happy ending on everything". He also called the drama around Rachel and Jesse and Quinn and Finn [...] "superficial stuff", a view shared by Meghan Brown of The Atlantic who said much of the drama [...] "felt shallow and forced", except for the first Kurt and Karofsky scene, which she described as [...] "painful and poignant". Brown's colleague, Kevin Fallon, stated that [...] "Like prom, this episode was Glee at its best and its worst", and MTV Aly Semigran thought that it [...] "wasn't as strong—or cohesive—as last week's 'Rumours, but said it [...] "certainly had its moments, especially some notably hilarious ones." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If the entirety of this show were like the last 10 minutes of this episode, it <b>just</b> <b>might</b> be the best show on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Billboard, West revealed that he had worked with Chris Martin, the lead singer of the British alternative rock band Coldplay, on a song entitled [...] "Homecoming", and that it <b>just</b> <b>might</b> possibly be released as the lead single for Graduation. The collaboration occurred the year before when Kanye West and Chris Martin met one another during an impromptu jam session at the Abbey Road Studios in London, England. West had just finished performing at a show that had been held at Abbey Road and the band just so happened to be recording their music in the recording studio {{at exactly the same}} time. The song in itself is actually a re-vamping for [...] "Home (Windy)", a track that originated from a demo tape dating back to the year 2001. It was made available two years later under the new title [...] "Home" [...] on West's 2003 mixtape Get Well Soon... and also on the advance copy of West's debut studio album The College Dropout, which due to a leak was never released. This original version possesses Kanye West's once trademark classic soul vocal sample production style, with singer John Legend on the chorus, which contains lyrics that are different than Martin's. This {{is due to the fact}} that Chris Martin asked Kanye West to change the song's lyrical content.|$|E
500|$|Many assertions {{about the}} year 2012 form part of Mayanism, a non-codified {{collection}} of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. The term is distinct from [...] "Mayanist," [...] {{used to refer to}} an academic scholar of the Maya. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of [...] "balancing the cosmos" [...] was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon did not draw from those traditions. Instead, it was bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places. Themes found in 2012 literature included [...] "suspicion towards mainstream Western culture", the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but [...] "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism." [...] Aveni, who has studied New Age and search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a [...] "disconnected" [...] society: [...] "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that <b>just</b> <b>might</b> be in possession of superior knowledge." ...|$|E
