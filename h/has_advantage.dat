Many people from Kathala Chenab and near by villages and from Gujrat city came there for enjoyment on weekends.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{its ability}} to {{maintain}} high proton conductivity in intermediate temperatures (~200℃), CsHSO4 {{is considered to be}} prime candidate for proton transferring agent in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Transfer of proton across the catalyst layer is the primary limiting step of the cell reaction and electrolysis, thus the high proton conductivity of CsHSO4 can contribute greatly to the cell’s performance. CsHSO4 <b>has</b> <b>advantage</b> over typical low-temperature PEMs, which require water-rich environment limiting them to temperatures below 100 °C. CsHSO4 combined with polymer has been shown to surpass even some other high-temperature PEMFC systems in performance.|$|E
50|$|Lubrication {{can also}} be done with an oil, which <b>has</b> <b>advantage</b> of higher maximum load, but needs some way to keep oil in bearing, as it {{normally}} tends {{to run out of}} it. For oil lubrication it is recommended that for applications where oil does not become warmer than 50 °C, oil should be replaced once a year, while for applications where oil does not become warmer than 100 °C, oil should be replaced 4 times per year. For car engines, oil becomes 100 °C but the engine has an oil filter to maintain oil quality; therefore, the oil is usually changed less frequently than the oil in bearings.|$|E

50|$|Depending {{on how the}} tag SNPs are selected, {{different}} prediction {{methods have}} been used during the cross-validation process. Machine learning method was employed to predict the left-out haplotype. Another approach predicted the alleles of a non-tagging SNP n from the tag SNPs that had the highestcorrelation coefficient with n. If a single highly correlated tag SNP t is found, the alleles are assigned so their frequencies agree with the allele frequencies of t. When multiple tagging SNPs have the same (high) correlation coefficient with n, the common allele of n <b>has</b> <b>advantage.</b> It {{is easy to see}} that in this case the prediction method agrees well with the selection method, which uses PCA on the matrix of correlation coefficients between SNPs.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is usually}} {{considered}} that navigation <b>has</b> <b>advantage</b> over search since recognizing {{what we are}} looking for is much easier than formulating and describing the information people need, which also refers to the [...] "vocabulary problem". Therefore, social tagging serves as a new social way of organizing a set of resources. This free-form annotation approached the [...] "vocabulary problem" [...] from a new social angle. Social tagging systems allow people to annotate a set of resources according to their own needs with freely chosen words—tags, and share them with other users of the social tagging system.The result of this human-based annotation of resources is called Folksonomy, which refers to a fold-generated taxonomy. Examples of such social tagging systems are BibSonomy, CiteULike, Flickr, or Delicious.|$|E
