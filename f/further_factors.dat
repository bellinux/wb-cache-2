25|$|When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, Polish {{forces were}} dealt a {{significant}} defeat at the Battle of the Border, {{just as the}} critics of the plan predicted. <b>Further</b> <b>factors,</b> such as underestimating German mobility and blitzkrieg strategy, and overestimating Polish mobility, the Soviet invasion of Poland and lack of promised aid from the Western Allies, contributed to the Polish forces' defeat by 6 October 1939.|$|E
25|$|As a result, Villa {{believed}} that if he managed to wrest control of the north from Carranza, the US would recognize him as president of Mexico. However, he was also running out of badly needed money with which to buy additional arms and pay his demoralized soldiers. As a result, in mid-1915 he turned to expropriating the haciendas and factories {{of people who had}} stayed out of politics so far, which meant that the revolutionaries had previously left them alone. Many of these were partly American owned. This contributed to political pressure in the US for Wilson to back Carranza. <b>Further</b> <b>factors</b> that contributed to the switch in American policy included support for Carranza from the American Federation of Labor, concern over German intelligence operations in Mexico related to World War I, Carranza's newfound commitment to protecting properties of foreigners in Mexico and the military successes of Carranza's generals. Unbeknownst to Villa, who was crossing the Sierra Madre Occidental, in October 1915 the US recognized Carranza as the president of Mexico.|$|E

25|$|In {{literature}} {{several factors}} are named for explaining why language competence is decreasing. Many researchers, however, regard {{the level of}} competence of the learner as essential for attrition. It is said that the higher the level of competence, the less attrition will occur. Thus, {{a reference to the}} theory of the critical threshold can be drawn. Similar to this theory it is claimed, that according to conducted studies, the higher the level of competence of the learner {{at the end of the}} incubation period, the fewer will be lost. Therefore duration, success and intensity of the language instruction or language input in general is vitally important. Weltens (1987) divides the factors influencing language attrition into three categories: characteristics of the acquisition process (method of instruction, length of exposure, proficiency before attrition, relationship between L1 and the FL), characteristics of the attrition period ('post exposure' and length of the attrition period), and learner characteristics. The second category are sociopsychological factors, as the attitude towards the target language and culture and aligned with the motivation for acquiring the language. <b>Further,</b> <b>factors,</b> which are settled in the language environment, should be considered as well, e.g. the status and prestige of the language are meaningful, too. Another frequent occurring factor is age. A variable that seems to be quite important, especially observing language attrition in children. Even though children are regarded as the better foreign language learner, their cognitive development is less progressed compared to adults. Further, usually they haven't learned to write or read in any language, and usually particularly not in the second language at all. Therefore their literacy skill in the L2 is very limited if not even there yet. Cohen (1989) conducted a study observing young children. He found out, that the attrition in an 8-year-old boy was stronger than the one in his 12-year-old sister. Tomiyama, suggested on the basis of her findings, that these children might not lose their knowledge of the L2 completely, moreover the access to such information is inaccessible and may vanish with time passing by. At the beginning of the 80s another, so far unnoticed factor, was introduced into the research field. Socioaffective factors as attitude, orientation and motivation are now accounted. On account of that, he established a socio-educational model of language acquisition. Thereby motivation and attitude influence the workload of the individual to keep their language competence. Further, individuals, who have positive attitudes towards the target language, seek possibilities and opportunities during the incubation period to retain their language competence (Gardner 1987: 521). However, the factor motivation is hardly considered examining language attrition. Especially during the last 10–15 years it became more and more acknowledged in the field of language acquisition rather than attrition. Only Gardner considered motivation as a possible factor influencing attrition. Even until today it is hardly recognised as an influencing factor and therefore exist only a few studies about motivation and its effects.|$|E

50|$|In Karg, for instance, the Appellate Division {{considered}} whether mere negligence {{as opposed}} to recklessness, or some high degree of recklessness, merited a considerable degree of retribution in the sentence. As was made clear in the same case, an offence which evoked indignation from the public would attract {{a greater share of}} the component of retribution than an offence which did not. <b>Further</b> <b>factors</b> {{to be taken into account}} in this respect were the seriousness of the offence and the disposition and attitude of the offender, particularly to his victim.|$|E
50|$|<b>Further</b> <b>factors</b> {{were that}} Newcastle was {{situated}} on main rail and road routes between Johannesburg and Durban, essential {{services such as}} water and electricity were already well catered for, and the town had a basic established infrastructure with a settled community. While ore {{would have to be}} transported 1 000 km from Sishen, coking coal was available from nearby and the overall economics were favourable. It was decided that both profile and flat products would be catered for in a plant with an ultimate capacity of 8 million tons per annum of liquid steel. Subsequent changes in steel markets has meant that extension to flat products has been delayed indefinitely and the current capacity is about 2,00 million tons of liquid steel.|$|E

50|$|The Pike's Peak Gold Rush of 1859 {{introduced}} a substantial white population into the Front Range of the Rockies {{supported by a}} trading lifeline that crossed the central Great Plains. Advancing settlement following {{the passage of the}} Homestead Act and the building of the transcontinental railways following the Civil War further destabilized the situation, placing white settlers into direct competition for the land and resources of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain West. <b>Further</b> <b>factors</b> included discovery of gold in the Black Hills, resulting in the gold rush of 1875-1878, and, earlier, in Montana during the Montana Gold Rush of 1862-1863 and the opening of the Bozeman Trail, which led to Red Cloud's War and later the Great Sioux War of 1876-77.|$|E
50|$|In the 2010, TI Pakistan {{reported}} that about 23.7% {{of those surveyed}} received admission in educational institutions through non-normal and alternate procedures. One {{of the biggest problems}} identified in the country is the presence of a non-uniform educational system. The private sector actively encourages western educational models such as the General Certificate of Secondary Education using this to justify unaffordable fees they charge ordinary citizens. Finding gain in such enterprises, the elite class amongst politicians, technocrats, bureaucrats and businessmen usually capitalise in this venture. These attitudes can also explain the deteriorating standards in the public sector educational institutes. On the other hand, state-owned public schools face several challenges including poor management and governance, and incompetence of consecutive governments in the education sector. <b>Further</b> <b>factors</b> for failing standards in state-run institutions include lack of funding, non-utilisation by elite classes, appointments of under-qualified faculty.|$|E
50|$|In the R300 drivers, {{released}} {{alongside the}} GTX 680, Nvidia {{introduced a new}} feature called Adaptive VSync. This feature is intended to combat the limitation of v-sync that, when the framerate drops below 60 FPS, there is stuttering as the v-sync rate is reduced to 30 FPS, then down to <b>further</b> <b>factors</b> of 60 if needed. However, when the framerate is below 60 FPS, {{there is no need}} for v-sync as the monitor will be able to display the frames as they are ready. To address this issue (while still maintaining the advantages of v-sync with respect to screen tearing), Adaptive VSync can be turned on in the driver control panel. It will enable VSync if the framerate is at or above 60 FPS, while disabling it if the framerate lowers. Nvidia claims that this will result in a smoother overall display.|$|E
50|$|One <b>further</b> <b>factor</b> {{that affects}} the {{population}} of the viper is its gestation and birthing procedure. The viper is viviparous.

50|$|Infection is {{a common}} {{complication}} that normally affects pediatric patients {{because they have not}} yet built up immunities to a number of different diseases. Normally, the incidence of infection decreases as the patient grows older and the body gains immunity to various infectious agents. Shunt infection {{is a common}} problem and can occur in up to 27% of patients with a shunt. Infection can lead to long term cognitive defects, neurological problems, and in some cases death. Common microbial agents for shunt infection include Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. <b>Further</b> <b>factors</b> leading to shunt infection include shunt insertion at a young age (<6 months old) and the type of hydrocephalus being treated. There is no strong correlation between infection and shunt type.The symptoms of a shunt infection are very similar to the symptoms seen in hydrocephalus but can also include fever and elevated white blood cell counts.|$|E
50|$|The Occupation of Alcatraz ended after {{a series}} of disorienting events on the island. The January 1970 death of Richard Oakes' 13-year-old {{stepdaughter}} due to falling from a building brought Richard and his wife Anne back to the mainland. Some of the student occupiers went back to school when the Oakes' left. A problem of drug and alcohol abuse also became prominent on the island, which affected the occupations reputation. The remaining leaders were John Trudell, LaNada Means, and Stella Leach, who could not end up agreeing on a way to further develop the occupation. Electricity and water being cut off to the island by May, and a suspicious fire that burned three buildings were <b>further</b> <b>factors</b> that led to the dismantling of the occupation. Protestors continued to depart from the island during the downward spiral. On June 11, 1971 a large amount of police officers used force to remove the remaining few protestors.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{selection}} of a relevant panel of experts who will carry out the assessment, these individuals are provided with as fully detailed a task description as possible {{with regards to the}} individual designated to perform each task and <b>further</b> <b>factors</b> which are likely to influence the success of each of these. An in depth description is a critical aspect of the procedure {{in order to ensure that}} all members of the assessing group share a common understanding of the given task. This may be further advanced through a group discussion prior to the commencement of the panel session to ascertain of consensus. Following this discussion, the tasks under consideration are then classified into a number of groupings depending upon the homogeneity of the PSF’s that have an effect on each. Subsets are thus defined by those tasks which have in common specific PSFs and also by their weighting within a certain sub-group; this weighting is only an approximation at this stage of the process.|$|E
50|$|Uranium is {{a highly}} soluble, {{as well as a}} radioactive, heavy metal.

50|$|A <b>further</b> <b>factor</b> {{contributing}} to an aging workforce {{is the fact}} that employment rates among older workers are increasing. The rate of people who continue working after they are 65 is relatively high in the US, if compared to other developed countries.
