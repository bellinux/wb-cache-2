5|$|R. r. sikkimensis (Meinertzhagen R. & Meinertzhagen A., 1926). Breeds in India and China. It is <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> R. r. himalayensis, and greener {{than the}} {{nominate}} subspecies.|$|E
5|$|S. t. jewetti {{is smaller}} and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the other subspecies. It occurs on the coastal {{slope of the}} Cascade Mountains from {{southern}} British Columbia to central California, overlapping with the range of C. t. pallidus.|$|E
5|$|A. r. boucardi was {{described}} by Philip Sclater in 1867, and it is found in eastern Mexico from southern Coahuila to San Luis Potosí, northern Puebla, and southern Oaxaca. This subspecies is <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> A. r. eremoeca and has dull brown, not rufous, streaking on the chest.|$|E

5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Cherry Candles', bred by Bill Molyneux {{from the}} 'Birthday Candles' cultivar, is a compact plant growing to 45cm tall {{and up to}} 100cm across with cherry red-styled gold flowers, <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> its parent, 15cm high by 6cm across. It was {{released}} commercially in spring 2004, and granted PBR status in February 2005, after an application by Molyneux.|$|E
5|$|M. c. cyaneus, the {{nominate}} subspecies {{described in}} 1782, is found throughout Tasmania. Birds are larger and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the mainland subspecies, with males having a deeper azure blue coloration. Schodde in his 1982 review reclassified elizabethae and samueli under cyaneus.|$|E
5|$|Melanism is {{the direct}} {{opposite}} of albinism. An unusually {{high level of}} melanin pigmentation (and sometimes absence {{of other types of}} pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.|$|E

5|$|P. c. sanfordi {{is found}} in Newfoundland. Harry C. Oberholser {{described}} it in 1914 from a specimen collected by a Dr. Sanford, whom he named it after. Oberholser reported that it was smaller and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the nominate race P. c. canadensis and more closely resembled P. c. nigricapillus.|$|E
5|$|Stevens never married, {{though there}} were rumors about his 20-year {{relationship}} (1848–1868) with his widowed housekeeper, Lydia Hamilton Smith (1813–1884). She was a light-skinned African-American; her husband Jacob {{and at least one}} of her sons were much <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> she was.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat was}} a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, {{which was not}} contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their front surface. The {{forehead}} was brown, <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the face, and the upper lip and patch {{in front of the}} eyes were lighter than the body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives.|$|E

50|$|The LP/CD {{release was}} {{accompanied}} by {{the release of the}} book More <b>Dark</b> <b>Than</b> Shark, by Russell Mills, which used the lyrics of Eno's songs as the inspiration for the set of lithographs contained within the book.|$|R
5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill {{shape of the}} young {{may not be as}} fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.|$|E
5|$|Abingdon Boys School {{has contributed}} to the soundtracks of {{numerous}} anime and video game series and several tribute albums. Their music has been used as opening or closing tracks for anime series, including <b>Darker</b> <b>than</b> Black, Soul Eater, and Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, and games, including Sengoku Basara. In addition, they have also contributed to tribute albums to the manga Nana and the rock bands Luna Sea and Buck-Tick. They also perform in a live DVD by Buck-Tick.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus japonensis, {{described}} by Gmelin in 1788, includes kleinschmidti, pleskei, and harterti, {{and seems to}} refer to intergrades with calidus. It is found from northeast Siberia to Kamchatka (though it is possibly replaced by pealei on the coast there) and Japan. Northern populations are migratory, while those of Japan are resident. It is similar to peregrinus, but the young are even <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> those of anatum.|$|E

5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of A.subrubescens are not much <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E
5|$|Join Hands {{took the}} topic of the First World War as its inspiration. Musically, it is <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the band's debut album The Scream: it sounds more claustrophobic and more haunting. It was the last album with the band's first {{recorded}} line-up, as guitarist John McKay and drummer Kenny Morris quit the group after a disagreement {{at the beginning of the}} British Join Hands tour, on the day of the album's release.|$|E
5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the common impala; melanism {{is responsible for}} the black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E
6000|$|The Countess in her agony {{thought it}} best to {{tell the whole story}} to the Earl. [...] "But what can I do?" [...] said the old man. [...] "Young men will form these acquaintances." [...] His fears were evidently as yet less <b>dark</b> <b>than</b> those of his wife.|$|R
60|$|Marguerite gazed upward {{with a more}} calm {{feeling that}} was akin to gratitude. That pale light, though so wan and feeble, was thrice welcome after that inky {{blackness}} wherein shadows were less <b>dark</b> <b>than</b> the lights. She watched eagerly the bank of clouds driven by the dying gale.|$|R
40|$|Subjects judged {{eye level}} in the light and in the dark by raising and {{lowering}} themselves in a dental chair until a stationary target appeared {{to be at the}} level of their eyes. This method reduced the possibility of subjects' using visible landmarks as reference points for setting eye level during lighted trials, which may have contributed to artificially low estimates of the variability of this judgment in previous studies. Chair settings were 2. 5 deg higher in the <b>dark</b> <b>than</b> in the light, and variability was approximately 66 percent greater in the <b>dark</b> <b>than</b> in the light. These results are discussed in terms of possible interactions of two separate systems, one sensitive to the orientations of visible surfaces and the other sensitive to bodily and gravitational information...|$|R
5|$|The plot of Days of Ruin is {{considerably}} <b>darker</b> <b>than,</b> and unrelated to, the plots of previous games. Almost 90% of humanity {{has been killed}} off following devastating meteor strikes which have destroyed much of civilization and caused a massive dust cloud to blot out the sun, preventing photosynthesis and thereby preventing the growing of crops. Scattered survivors pick through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent while the others prey upon them.|$|E
5|$|The {{reverse of}} countershading, with the belly {{pigmented}} <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> the back, enhances contrast and so makes animals more conspicuous. It {{is found in}} animals that can defend themselves, such as skunks. The pattern is used both in startle or deimatic displays and as a signal to warn off experienced predators. However, animals that habitually live upside-down but lack strong defences, like the Nile catfish and the luna moth caterpillar, have upside-down countershading for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Their fur is <b>darker</b> <b>than</b> other spaniels {{and they}} have no {{undercoat}} like most of the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sketches}} {{of the first}} series had a very odd and surreal mood to them. In the second series in 1984 the overall style changed slightly. A linking device in form of a [...] "Pretend Pub" [...] was created, and the sketches themselves were less <b>dark</b> <b>than</b> in the first series.|$|R
50|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies, L. g. glaucoides, is {{very pale}} in all plumages, {{with absolutely no}} melanin in {{the tips of the}} primaries in adult plumage. Adults are pale grey above, with a yellowish-green bill. Immatures are very pale grey; the bill is more extensively <b>dark</b> <b>than</b> with glaucous gull, and lacks pink.|$|R
