30|$|The {{increment}} of the <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> {{is larger}} {{than that of the}} uniform traffic. The reasons are as follows. Under uniform traffic, the transmission durations of links in a pairing are diverse in MPMH [1]. The diversities bring about the waste of time slots in a pairing. The differences among the transmission durations of links in a pairing under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> are worse, which result in further degradations in the throughput performance. However, the transmission durations of links in a pairing are the same under both traffic patterns in MPMH-SRSC. Thus, it outperforms the MPMH under uniform traffic and has greater performance increment under <b>random</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R

Taking the Second Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge as an example, the characteristics of traffic load are obtained by traffic investigation and the data from existing research results. In the paper the method and process for vehicle load spectrum simulation which includes data acquisition of <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> load, statistical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation is proposed. The simulation program of <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> flow is verified using the measured data. The proposed method can provide a reference for <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> load simulation. ...|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Section 6.2, MPMH-MRMC can better utilize MPMH than the MPMH-SRSC, {{which results in}} the decrease of delay. Compared with MPMH-SRSC, the average transmission delay of MPMH-MRMC decreases by about 74.20 % under uniform traffic and 70.91 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> with the traffic load ratio from 10 to 20. With the traffic load ratio from 10 to 20, MPMH-MRMC outperforms MPMH 2 by about 29.21 % under uniform traffic and 49.04 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> on average, respectively. The reason is identical with the one in network throughput. When the traffic load ratio is over 3, the number of discarded packets in TDMA exceeds MPMH and MPMH-SRSC, which leads to lower average delay in TDMA.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSignificant {{uncertain}} {{information is}} involved in environmental decision making due to complexities of natural systems, lack of sufficient data, and the interpretation of information that may be in numerical or linguistic forms. Uncertainties can be present in identification of criteria, interactions among criteria, evaluations of alternatives, eliciting weights from experts, and the choice of aggregation operators. Uncertainties arising from performance evaluations of criteria for each alternative and weights can be identified as <b>aleatory</b> (<b>random)</b> and epistemic (informal and lexical) uncertainty. These two types of uncertainty were best respectively represented as probability density function and possibility distribution. A methodology was {{presented in this paper}} to propagate these two kinds of uncertainty through aggregation operators. Random set theory is used as a uniform framework to integrate aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Evidence theory is utilized to approximate the probability measure when both probability density functions and possibility distributions are transformed into random sets. This methodology facilitates the incorporation of aleatory and epistemic information into the multicriteria environmental decision makings...|$|R

40|$|A new {{asynchronous}} interconnection {{network is}} introduced for globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS) chip multiprocessors. The network {{eliminates the need}} for global clock distribution, and can interface multiple synchronous timing domains operating at unrelated clock rates. In particular, two new highly-concurrent asynchronous components are introduced which provide simple routing and arbitration/merge functions. Post-layout simulations in identical commercial 90 nm technology indicate that comparable recent synchronous router nodes have 5. 6 - 10. 7 x more energy per packet and 2. 8 - 6. 4 x greater area than the new asynchronous nodes. Under <b>random</b> <b>traffic,</b> the network provides significantly lower latency and competitive throughput over the entire operating range of the 800 MHz network and through mid-range traffic rates for the 1. 36 GHz network, but with degradation at higher traffic rates.

Specifically, we show that the model can predict the optimal 3 -D topology for uniform and local traffic patterns. It can also predict the optimal placement of hot spots in the network.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} tornado wind hazard {{model for}} the continental United States (CONUS) is described. The model incorporates both <b>aleatory</b> (<b>random)</b> and epistemic uncertainties associated with quantifying the tornado wind hazard parameters. The temporal occurrences of tornadoes within the continental United States (CONUS) {{is assumed to be}} a Poisson process. A spatial distribution of tornado touchdown locations is developed empirically based on the observed historical events within the CONUS. The hazard model is an aerial probability model that takes into consideration the size and orientation of the facility, the length and width of the tornado damage area (idealized as a rectangle and dependent on the tornado intensity scale), wind speed variation within the damage area, tornado intensity classification errors (i. e.,errors in assigning a Fujita intensity scale based on surveyed damage), and the tornado path direction. Epistemic uncertainties in describing the distributions of the aleatory variables are accounted for by using more than one distribution model to describe aleatory variations. The epistemic uncertainties are based on inputs from a panel of experts. A computer program, TORNADO, has been developed incorporating this model; features of this program are also presented...|$|R

30|$|With the {{introduction}} of MRMC, MPMH-MRMC can better utilize MPMH than the MPMH-SRSC, and the throughput of MPMH-MRMC increases linearly even under heavy traffic load. With the traffic load ratio from 10 to 20, MPMH-MRMC surpasses MPMH-SRSC by about 82.34 % under uniform traffic and 108.29 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic,</b> respectively. Compared with MPMH 2, MPMH-MRMC increases the network throughput by about 14.09 % under uniform traffic and 25.8 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> on average with the traffic load ratio from 12 to 20. The reason is {{the same with the}} one in SRSC situation. When the traffic load ratio is over 3, the number of discarded packets in TDMA exceeds MPMH and MPMH-SRSC, which results in smaller network throughput in TDMA. Since the delay threshold is larger than the frame length, the packets that cannot be scheduled in current frame will be transmitted in the next frame. With the increase of the traffic load ratio, the number of packets successful transmitted in the system becomes stable and the network throughput curves become flat.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{need to support}} high performance and distributed cloud-based computing applications, data centers are employing commodity switches to build multi-rooted trees. An effective distributed, adaptive flow scheduling algorithm is needed to realize the full potential of the multiple parallel paths provided by such networks. The overall aim of this work is to design a load balancer that can maximize the aggregate network utilization. In this paper, the Distributed Flow-by-Flow Fair Routing (DFFR) algorithm is proposed for flow balancing in data center networks. It is a scalable, distributed, and adaptive algorithm designed for maximizing network resources. Our analysis shows that the algorithm has proven theoretical performance bounds, which gives a low variance for the aggregate bandwidth utilization. A simulation {{study was conducted to}} compare the performance of the DFFR algorithm with other load balancing algorithms. Simulation results reveal that the DFFR algorithm outperforms a static routing assignment protocol. It is also compared to Distributed Dynamic Flow Scheduling (DDFS), which is chosen because it is a distributed algorithm like DFFR. DFFR is shown to perform better for <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns than DDFS, but worse for patterns where hosts always send to the same receiver.
