40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the concepts of}} <b>information</b> politics <b>and</b> <b>information</b> culture <b>and</b> presents a case study that explores these concepts. The literature from the areas of IS theory and organization theory that provides a backdrop to these concepts is discussed. A case of an organization that has characteristics of both small business and voluntary organization is presented as initial validation of the concepts of <b>information</b> politics <b>and</b> <b>information</b> culture. The case draws on a longitudinal interpretivist study and tracks a trajectory of organizational design, information politics, <b>information</b> culture, management <b>and</b> organizational performance over 25 months. The primary finding is that the organization studied exhibited two distinct <b>information</b> politics <b>and</b> <b>information</b> cultures, each related to different development phases—the era of clan and the era of teams. The article also discusses particular aspects of <b>information</b> politics <b>and</b> <b>information</b> culture <b>and</b> how these relate to organizational performance. Derived are implications for further research on <b>information</b> politics <b>and</b> <b>information</b> culture {{as well as for}} a broader parent framework called Information View of Organization...|$|R
