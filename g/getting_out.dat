5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not <b>getting</b> <b>out...</b> What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E

5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called Inner City Posse, which was {{composed}} of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, {{and a number of}} other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit. Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989–1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating probation; this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life. Bruce began his professional wrestling career after <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of jail, and it was at his first show that he met Rob Van Dam and Sabu, two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends. During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.|$|E

The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene as the show was aired at 6pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it. The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off-screen scene with three shots.|$|E
5|$|They {{returned}} to Botany Bay {{on the evening}} of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to wait till the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having <b>getting</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{rejection}} of these conditions, there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent social conflict, almost rising {{to the point of}} insurrection. The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of control. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene, and Prime Minister Francesco Crispi {{declared a state of emergency}} in January 1894, dissolving the organizations, arresting its leaders and restoring order through the use of extreme force. Some reforms followed, including workmen's compensation and pension schemes. The suppression of the strikes also led to an increase in emigration.|$|E

5|$|Although Smith {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death {{and those of}} the other two women. Witnesses had seen him leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde, and he was the last person to see them both alive. CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation, and even captured Hyde <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> at one point to visit a chemist. Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde's body was later discovered. Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo's. CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove, a town close to Droitwich, after killing Corcoran, and later film showed him returning to Birmingham. At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him: a motorist who saw him buying petrol, and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw.

He was {{assigned}} to D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, which was on a daylight raid to capture a high-value target from the Taliban. Petry was to locate with the platoon headquarters in the target building once it was secured. Once there, he was {{to serve as the}} senior non-commissioned officer at the site {{for the remainder of the}} operation. The team of 70 Rangers encountered about 40 Taliban, 12 of them armed. Almost immediately after <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of the helicopters that delivered the unit to the attack site, the Rangers came under strong fire. Petry provided additional supervision to an assaulting squad during the clearance of a building, and afterward he took Private First Class Lucas Robinson to clear an outer courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Stanford's post-score kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense began {{from its}} 20-yard line. The Hokies gained their initial first {{down of the}} game when quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{completed}} a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Coale on the drive's third play, but Tech was unable to gain another. Tech punted from its 43-yard line, and the kick was downed at the Stanford 5-yard line, where the Cardinal offense started work. Two rushing plays were stopped for no gain, then Luck attempted a passing play on third down. Because {{the line of scrimmage}} was so close to the Stanford goal line, Luck had to move into his own end zone to attempt the pass. Under pressure from the Virginia Tech defense, he threw to Derek Hall, who caught the ball in the end zone and was tackled before <b>getting</b> <b>out.</b> The result of the play was a safety, a 2-point defensive score for Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Andy's {{toys are}} welcomed {{by the other}} toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear ("Lotso"), Big Baby, and Ken. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who {{attempts}} to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She brings Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play rough with Andy's toys. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have the toys moved to the older children's room, but Lotso declines. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she inadvertently left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz, whom Lotso switched to Demo Mode (which caused him to believe he is a real space ranger, therefore turning against the other toys). At Bonnie's house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, who explains to Woody that he, Lotso, and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When the toys were accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, {{they made their way}} back to her house, where Lotso found that he had been replaced. Lotso lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took it over, with Chuckles only <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> because Bonnie took him home, after he was broken, and fixed him.|$|E

Goethe was conscious but needed aid in <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of the Aston Martin requiring the intervention of a fourth safety car period. He was transported to a local hospital where he remained for several days and underwent surgery to two vertebra which had been fractured in the crash. Oliver Turvey had been the fastest driver in LMP2 at the time, bringing the Jota Gibson-Nissan into third place. The No. 64 Corvette came to the pit lane during the safety car period to change brakes, {{but was unable to}} get back out of pit lane in time before the exit was closed, forfeiting the class lead to the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari. When racing resumed Webber was able to attack the No. 9 Audi after driving through traffic and take second position. The No. 42 Strakka Dome pulled off the track on the front stretch with gearbox issues and fluids leaked from his car, requiring a local slow zone. The No. 7 Audi of Lotterer made contact with Tandy's leading Porsche while both cars were in the slow zone, earning Lotterer a drive-through penalty. Viktor Shaitar overran the Indianapolis corner and became stuck in the gravel, losing two laps as it was extracted by recovery vehicles and went into the pit lane but remaining in second place in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} was generally administered {{by a group}} of Whig congressmen in Washington, including Clay, who pooled their mailing lists; there were organizations in each county tasked with running the local campaign and <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> the vote. Much work was also done by the new political bosses, like Thurlow Weed of New York, who also took charge of much of the fundraising. Greeley, by then editor of the widely-circulated Harrison campaign journal, The Log Cabin, worried that the constant demands for money would drive the wealthy from politics; this did not occur. Much of the money came from those, such as land speculators, who would benefit by the internal improvements to transportation that were backed by the Whigs. Funding for local operations was expected to be raised locally, sometimes through arrangements like kickbacks from Pennsylvania canal contractors, something implemented by Thaddeus Stevens. Erie Canal workers were expected to pay a toll to Weed to finance Whig operations. Feeling that every hand was needed to defeat Van Buren, Whig leaders allowed women to help: although they could not vote, they could influence men. This {{was the first time that}} an American political party included women in campaign activities on a widespread scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
