50|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is {{probably}} twofold: Firstly, Froben Christopher wanted to prove the nobility of his family and to preserve that knowledge to posterity. Secondly, the chronicle was a means to educate future family members. The author does not only tell the stories of shining examples of nobility, but he also gives proof of bad examples. He clearly condemns some of his more spendthrift ancestors for selling <b>family</b> <b>goods</b> and hence giving away economic and political power.|$|E

While {{the presence of a}} female decision maker generally increases the share of the household budget allocated to child and <b>family</b> <b>goods,</b> female headed households (FHHs) also spend more on adult wear and less on health. Lower health expenditures are partially offset by the differential use of other health inputs in FHHs. These differences in resource allocation may explain why poorer FHHs do not necessarily have lower children's outcomes in developing countries. " [...] Author's AbstractISI; IFPRI 3 P...|$|E

Previous {{studies have shown that}} the policy has significantly increased the labour force participation and annual weeks worked of mothers with children exposed to the program.
