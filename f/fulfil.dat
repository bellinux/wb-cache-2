5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and <b>fulfil</b> the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{directly}} involved with Sheffield football, Charles Alcock {{had a major}} role in relations between the local and London associations. He acted as a go between encouraging the FA to accept rules from the Sheffield Rules. When the FA declined an inter-association match in Sheffield {{on the grounds that they}} could not play under Sheffield Rules it fell to Alcock to organise a team of London players to <b>fulfil</b> the fixture. The success of the match led to it becoming a regular event in the following years.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may <b>fulfil</b> ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them from}} the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|Following the U.S. {{financial}} crisis in 2008, {{fears of a}} sovereign debt crisis developed in 2009 among investors concerning some European states, with the situation becoming particularly tense in early 2010. Greece was most acutely affected, but fellow Eurozone members Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain were also significantly affected. To {{be included in the}} eurozone, countries had to <b>fulfil</b> certain convergence criteria, but the meaningfulness of such criteria was diminished by the fact it was not enforced with the same level of strictness among countries.|$|E
5|$|Garga Samhita (a work on {{the life}} of Krishna) and Brahma Vaivarta Purana further tell of the {{previous}} birth of Putana as Ratnamala, the daughter of demon king Bali.

She soon changed her mind and decided to kill Vamana, after he acquired all possessions of Bali. Krishna knew her desires and allowed her to <b>fulfil</b> both of them - to suckle him and to attempt to take his life.|$|E

5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer's {{early studies}} {{had been in}} Germany, but from 1816 to 1825 he worked in Italy. There he studied opera, then {{dominated}} by Gioachino Rossini, and wrote his own Italian operas, which were moderately successful and also had some performances in other European countries. The success of Il crociato in Egitto (1824) throughout Europe, including at Paris in 1825, persuaded Meyerbeer, who was already thirty-three years old, to <b>fulfil</b> at last his ambition to base himself in Paris, and to seek a suitable libretto for an opera to be launched there.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, {{a report}} was {{commissioned}} on water resources {{within a reasonable}} distance of Cardiff. The report concluded that the Taff Fawr scheme would <b>fulfil</b> the town's requirements at the least cost and {{it was decided to}} create Llanishen Reservoir. Construction of the reservoir started in 1882 by the engineer James Simpson for the Cardiff Waterworks Company and was completed in 1886.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, Allied {{aircraft}} construction saw the UK of necessity concentrating on heavy bombers, leaving {{the production of}} transport aircraft to the USA. This would have left the UK with little experience in transport construction {{at the end of}} the war, so in 1943, a committee under Lord Brabazon of Tara investigated the future of the British civilian airliner market. The Brabazon Committee called for several different aircraft to be developed to specifications composed by the committee for roles felt to <b>fulfil</b> Britain's civilian aviation needs.|$|E
