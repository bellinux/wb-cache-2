More in particular, the present invention {{is related to}} Received Signal Strength (RSS) based localization in wireless networks. Localization in wireless networks describes the process of obtaining a physical location in an automated manner using wireless communication. Radio Interferometric Localization relies on pairs of nodes simultaneously transmitting unmodulated carriers at slightly dierent frequencies that are highly correlated during the measurement time. Nodes that are within transmission range measure {{the energy of the}} envelope of the <b>frequency</b> <b>beat</b> signal. The relative phase offset of the measured envelope of the <b>frequency</b> <b>beat</b> signal at two receivers {{is a function of the}} distances between the involved nodes and the carrier frequency.

The f-to- 2 f CEO <b>frequency</b> <b>beat</b> signal is 49 dB above the noise floor (100 -kHz resolution bandwidth) and the free-running linewidth of 3. 6 kHz is significantly better than typically obtained by ultrafast fiber laser systems.

It is pumped by one standard telecom-grade 980 -nm diode consuming less than 1. 5 W of electrical power.

40|$|Human {{respiratory}} cilia densely {{line the}} airways and beat continually removing mucus and {{debris from the}} respiratory tract. Ciliary damage may be primary, from genetic causes, or secondary due {{to a variety of}} toxins, bacteria, or viruses. This may result in a reduction in ciliary beat frequency and abnormalities of ciliary beat pattern. Digital high-speed imaging has been presented as a technique to measure both ciliary beat frequency and beat pattern. This has been evaluated against existing methods and found to be a gold standard. Using this method the ciliary beat pattern has been evaluated in detail for the first time. Cilia were found to beat with a forward power stroke and a recovery stroke within the same plane. Using digital high speed imaging normal reference ranges have been evaluated for both a paediatric and young adult population. Data has been collected for ciliary beat <b>frequency,</b> <b>beat</b> pattern and ultrastructural parameters. Having established normal reference ranges it has been possible to evaluate ciliary beat <b>frequency,</b> <b>beat</b> pattern and ultrastructure inpatients with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Different beat patterns were found to be associated with different ultrastructural defects. Digital high-speed imaging is a gold standard for evaluation of ciliary beat frequency and beat pattern. With the availability of normal reference ranges it can be used confidently as a diagnostic and research method. ...|$|E

30|$|There {{are three}} {{possible}} {{approaches to the}} measurement-to-track association. It is possible to associate tracks with measurements in the range/range-rate space, in the target state space, or in the <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> measurement space[7]. The measurement-to-track association in the range/range-rate space requires to determine the range/range-rate of each possible target using <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> measurements from chirps of a radar. In {{the case of a}} single target with no clutter, one can easily determine the range and range rate of the target using two or more <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> measurements from it. In tracking multiple targets, however, it is nontrivial to determine the range/range-rate for each individual target. It requires to associate <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> measurements that originated from a common target among measurements from different targets and different chirps, taking into account nonunity probability of target detection. This approach is prone to incorrect association that causes ghost targets[7, 8]. The measurement-to-track association in the target state space additionally requires multilateration processing. In the <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> measurement space, we can associate <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> measurements directly to tracks and update each track with its associated measurement. This direct association and track updates eliminate range/range-rate calculations and multilateration processing. As a consequence, the association in the <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> measurement space is robust and dramatically reduces the probability of ghost targets under the circumstances where the probability of detection is low and different depending on radars in the network[7].|$|R
