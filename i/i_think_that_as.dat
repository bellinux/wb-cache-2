The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That is something he has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but I think he can become a central striker again. That is what we will try to develop together." ...|$|E

Everybody listens to music and knows about it. I think that the lyrics can {{have a lot to}} do with influencing whoever you're singing to. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> far as children are concerned, parents should have control over what they listen to. If they don't want them to listen to records that are very sexual or explicit or outrageous, they should have control over that situation. As for adults, they're going to buy whatever kind of music they want to hear, so if they buy music with explicit lyrics, they must like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{rumors that}} Dormer {{is related to}} {{historical}} lady-in-waiting Jane Dormer, who served Queen Mary I, they have no known familial connection. On this subject, Dormer stated, [...] "There was a woman, called Jane Dormer, in the Royal Court who happened {{to have the same}} family name <b>as</b> me, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>as</b> far as it goes." ...|$|R

Christian, maul down the victuals from corner-cupboard if canst reach, man, and I'll draw a drap o' sommat to wet it with." ...|$|R

"He {{will make}} a good master, lads. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> he says, he will be {{thoughtful}} as to our comforts, and be pleasant and cheerful with us; but mind you, he will expect the work to be done, {{and you will find}} that there is no trifling with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] ejaculated Carroll. [...] "I won't ask why she {{was willing}} to do so--it {{concerns}} you more than me--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> regards your interests in the Clermont a warning from her would be worth as much as one from Nairn; that is, if she could be depended on." ...|$|E

And I must say frankly, although I try to put it mildly, that they appear to contradict and controvert the doctrines of the Church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Pritchard is so very censorious," [...] she murmured. [...] "He takes such a {{very low}} view of human nature. After all, though, I suppose we must not blame him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> men and women we do not exist to him. We are simply the pegs by means of which he can climb a little higher in the esteem of his employers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes.

Beside, what would the garden do without water? My {{grandfather}} will be glad to see you, my lord; but he is rather more feeble than usual this morning.

Yes, <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>as</b> much red natur' as it's white. But I have no Hist, nor am I like to have; for I hold it wrong to mix colours, any way except in friendship and sarvices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] he said, {{addressing}} his wife, [...] "I {{have just}} been pointing out {{the view from the}} windows to Miss Affleck, and telling her what charming walks there are in the neighbourhood. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> we are so {{near the end of the}} week it would be just as well to postpone all serious studies until Monday morning and show our guest some of the beauties of Eyethorne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Mr Whittlestaff. [...] "But it may so {{probably}} {{be the case that}} you and I shall differ materially as to thinking what may be best for her. As far as I understand the matter, you wish that she should be your wife. I wish that she should be mine. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> my wife she would live a happier life than she could do as yours; and as she thinks also--" [...] Here Mr Whittlestaff paused.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are trying}} to make me vain. You forget that {{whatever}} I know, which is just enough to show me how much I have to learn, I have learnt from you. As for being your superior in mathematics, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> a clergyman, you should make such a statement. Here is your tea." [...] And the owner of the voice came forward into the ring of light.|$|R
6000|$|... "One year!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I only ask for one year. <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> {{the first}} victim, I {{have a right}} to expect that one year should be granted me.

6000|$|... "Well, Pertab, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> we have {{proceeded}} so far, {{we shall}} pull through, somehow. You have your bayonet, and I have my revolver, which I will wash and load {{before we get}} out of this. We shall be a match, then, for any three or four men we may come across. At any rate, I shall shoot myself if I see that {{there is no other way}} of escape. It would be a thousand times better to die, than be taken captive and tortured to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|Freda and Siegbert {{agreed to}} the plan, and the latter said, [...] "I too will tarry in Rome while you are away, Edmund. I could fight against Sweyn, for {{it was in a}} private quarrel, but I cannot war against my countrymen. I too will talk with your Saxon monks, and hear about this new {{religion}} of yours, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> I have no others to love or care for I shall return to England with you, and, if you will have me, take up my abode in your English home so as to be near you and my daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I trust, Mr. Powlett," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you will}} not be angry with your daughter. She was placed in a terrible position, having the option of either denouncing as a murderer a man she had loved, or {{permitting}} another to lie under the imputation of guilt. And you must remember that she was prepared to come forward at the trial and tell the truth about the matter had Captain Mervyn been found guilty. No doubt she acted wrongly; but she has suffered terribly, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> my daughter has forgiven her for allowing Captain Mervyn to suffer for her silence, you may also do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't wish to know. But {{it seems}} to me," [...] said Isabel, [...] "that one day when we talked of him you {{mentioned}} odd things in him." [...] Ralph smokingly considered. [...] "I hope that what I said then had no weight with you; for they were not faults, the things I spoke of: they were simply peculiarities of his position. If I had known he wished to marry you I'd never have alluded to them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> said <b>that</b> <b>as</b> regards <b>that</b> position he was rather a sceptic. It {{would have been in}} your power to make him a believer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so have I," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "Whether Edna has or not I don't know, for she {{has said}} nothing to me. Now, we {{are not related to}} you, and, of course, have no claim upon you in that way, but <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> we have all {{suffered}} together, and gone through dangers together, we all ought to share, in some degree at least, in good things as well as bad ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{you know}} that I've been wantin' {{to get away from}} the circus," [...] said Toby, a little {{impatient}} that his friend should be so wonderfully stupid, [...] "an' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'll have <b>as</b> good a chance now as ever I shall, so I'm goin' to try it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, ma'am, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> you say, {{it would}} be doing the right thing; and I don't deny that Martha and I have agreed to wait a year or two, till we could save up enough between us for me to start on my own account; {{for as long as}} I am a journeyman, and liable to lose my work any day, I would not ask her to come to me. But what with what we have laid by, and this money you offer, I think we might very well venture," [...] and his radiant face showed the {{happiness}} the prospect caused him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The vote we want," [...] he said, [...] "is {{the vote}} {{of those people who}} are losing their bread, and who see ruin and {{starvation}} coming in upon them. I mean the middle-class manufacturers and the operatives who are dependent upon them. I tell you where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a nation we are going wrong. We fixed once upon a great principle, and we nailed it to our mast--for all time. That is a mistake. Absolute Free Trade, such as is at present our national policy, was a magnificent principle in the days of Cobden--but the times have changed. We must change with them. That is where the typical Englishman fails. It is a matter of temperament. He is too slow to adapt himself to changing circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stephen, I've {{been wanting}} to do this for--for all the time. If there was thought-reading {{you would have had}} a {{thousand}} letters. But formerly I was content to submit, and latterly I've chafed more. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> what they call passion has faded, the immense friendliness has become more evident, and made the bar less and less justifiable. You and I have had so much between us beyond what somebody the other day--it was in a report in the Times, I think--was calling Materia Matrimoniala. And of course I hear about you from all sorts of people, and in all sorts of ways--whatever you have done about me I've had a woman's sense of honor about you and I've managed to learn a great deal without asking forbidden questions. I've pricked up my ears at the faintest echo of your name.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{was indeed}} providential," [...] Mark said, [...] "though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> feeble <b>as</b> he has been for some months, {{it might have been}} kept from him. Still, a word from a chance visitor, who did not {{associate}} Bastow the murderer with our dear old friend, might have enlightened him, and the blow would have been a terrible one indeed. It is true <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> it was, he died from the shock, but he did not know the hand that struck the blow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That has {{got nothing}} to do with it. Mr. Western won't care a straw whether Francis behaved well or ill. And for the matter of <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> yet we quite know the truth of it. Nor would he care if his wife had behaved ill to the other man, so long as she behaved well to him. But if he has heard nothing of it and now finds it out, he's not the man I take him to be if he don't let her hear of it." ...|$|R
500|$|Roger Greenspun of The New York Times {{wrote in}} his 1973 review [...] "People who felt that his earlier feature, Fritz the Cat, merely debased a {{cherished}} original, can now judge Bakshi's development of his own material. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> development is <b>as</b> brilliant as anything in recent movies—as brilliant and, in its own improbable way, as lovely and as sad." ...|$|R
