It was initially to supplement {{the work of the}} Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC), which later became the Council for Tobacco Research. The TIRC work had been limited to attacking scientific studies that put tobacco in a bad light, and the Tobacco Institute had a broader mission to put out <b>good</b> <b>news</b> <b>about</b> tobacco, especially economic news. It also attacked scientific studies, although more by casting doubt on them rather than by rebutting them directly. It also lobbied Congress, although initially at a low level. Robert Hockett (first scientific director of Sugar Research Foundation, a sugar-equivalent of TIRC) became TIRCs associate scientific director.|$|E

50|$|Other {{research}} has shown that psychological factors may result in exaggerated (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological {{research has}} demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just noise, e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of <b>good</b> <b>news</b> items <b>about</b> a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} issue of {{constitutional}} design, and supermajorities in particular, from a behavioral economics perspective. The relevant parameters are voting power, risk aversion, and pessimism. Voters who feel powerful prefer lower thresholds, while risk averters and those who feel pessimistic about the majority prefer higher thresholds. We also analyze the effects of loss aversion and overconfidence. The former leads voters to prefer more protective voting rules, a manifestation of their bias towards the status quo. The latter leads them to prefer overly low (high) protection when they receive <b>good</b> (bad) <b>news</b> <b>about</b> how others will vote. Finally, we study constitutional agreements on the voting rule. Members of the constituent assembly are heterogeneous in the parameters above. Weak and minority members anticipate high expropriation risk in future decisions. This gives them consistent leverage {{to push for a}} protective constitution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine whether}} arbitrageurs amplify {{fundamental}} shocks {{in the context}} of short arbitrage in equity markets. The ability of arbitrageurs to hold on to short positions depends on asset values: shorts are often reduced (increased) following <b>good</b> (bad) <b>news</b> <b>about</b> a stock. As a result, the prices of highly shorted stocks are excessively sensitive to economic shocks. Using monthly short interest data we find the following. (1) The price of a highly shorted stock is more sensitive to earnings news than a stock with little short interest. (2) The change in short interest around announcements (proxied by share turnover) is more sensitive to earnings surprises for highly shorted stocks. (3) For highly shorted stocks, returns to shorting are higher following better earnings news (after accounting for post earnings announcement drift). These results continue to hold when we exploit differences in short selling regulations across stock exchanges to instrument for the amount of shorting in a stock. These differential sensitivities tend to be driven by very <b>good</b> earnings <b>news</b> as opposed to very bad earnings news. Our findings point to the importance of limited arbitrage in affecting asset price dynamics and the potentially destabilizing role of speculators...|$|R
