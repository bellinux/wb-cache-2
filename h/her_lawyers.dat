5|$|The {{release of}} a video-game Starpower: Beyoncé was {{cancelled}} after Beyoncé pulled out of a $100million with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development. It was {{settled out of court}} by <b>her</b> <b>lawyers</b> in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers. Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express, Nintendo DS and L'Oréal since the age of 18.|$|E
5|$|As Heyer's {{popularity}} increased, {{other authors}} began to imitate her style. In May 1950, {{one of her}} readers notified her that Barbara Cartland had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer's, reusing names, character traits and plot points and paraphrased descriptions from her books, particularly A Hazard of Hearts, which borrowed characters from Friday's Child, and The Knave of Hearts which took off These Old Shades. Heyer completed {{a detailed analysis of}} the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, and while the case never came to court and no apology was received, the copying ceased. <b>Her</b> <b>lawyers</b> suggested that she leak the copying to the press. Heyer refused.|$|E
5|$|Judge Appleby also {{threatened}} Kunstler with dismissal {{and contempt}} of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976 speech at nearby Rutgers University that in part discussed the upcoming trial, but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur. Until obtaining a court order, Williams was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each visit with Shakur—during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles. Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office {{that resulted in the}} disappearance of trial documents, amounting to half of the legal papers related to her case. <b>Her</b> <b>lawyers</b> also claimed that their offices were bugged.|$|E

On the morning of July 8, 1954, Lebrón learned of her son's death minutes before the sentence was to be announced. She was quiet {{at the beginning of the}} hearing, but at one point, unable to contain herself, she became hysterical. Rover demanded the death penalty, but Holtzoff chose to sentence them to the longest terms of imprisonment possible. In Lebrón's case this was between sixteen and fifty years, depending on her behavior.|$|E

25|$|In December 2003, André told UK {{journalist}} Angus Batey that, {{following a}} Detroit concert {{in the midst}} of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case was less to do with Parks than with the lawyers. In April 2005, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and <b>her</b> <b>lawyers</b> were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest. Later that same year, the members of OutKast were dropped as co-defendants, and Parks' lawyers continued to seek action against LaFace and parent company BMG.|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{the case}} {{did not go}} to trial. Fletcher, a recluse living on {{disability}} payments, opted to accept a plea bargain. One of <b>her</b> <b>lawyers,</b> Lawrence Walters, stated that his client, who has agoraphobia, a fear of public places, is not capable of sitting through what likely would be a week-long trial. Under the proposed plea agreement, Fletcher would avoid prison and be sentenced to a term of home detention. In the view of some legal scholars, Fletcher's guilty plea will not set any precedent related to text-only obscenity prosecutions because she is entering the plea voluntarily.|$|E

In 1988 she sued Polanski. Among other things, the suit alleged sexual assault, false imprisonment, seduction of a minor, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

He also suggested to Penguin that they keep any terms confidential because {{he had no intention of}} settling with Lipstadt. Bays and Bateman made clear that the publisher rejected his terms. Three weeks later, Irving officially offered to settle with both parties, the terms being that the book be withdrawn from circulation, and both parties apologise and (each) make a £500 donation.
