5|$|On 27 May, Rear Admiral L.S. Parks {{relieved}} Rear Admiral Crommelin as Commander, BatDiv 2. Departing Norfolk on 19 June, the battleship, {{over the}} ensuing weeks, conducted a midshipman training cruise through the Panama Canal to South American waters, and reached Valparaiso on 3 July.

She arrived in Lahaina Roads on 27 September and reached Honolulu on the 30th. Except for a six-day cruise back to Lahaina in March 1898, the gunboat remained at Honolulu for just over nine months.|$|E

5|$|Four days later, while {{searching for}} a U-boat {{in the area of}} Conigbeg Rock, the {{destroyer}} received word that the Conigbeg Lightship had rescued survivors from a fishing vessel. Wainwright rendezvoused with the craft to interview the four seamen of the smack Our Bairns. They revealed that the U-boat—which turned out to be —was of the latest type Germany had in action. The destroyer relieved the lighthouse vessel of the four fishermen and continued the search until dusk, when she <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> to Queenstown to land the rescued men.|$|E

5|$|Low, Harris {{and their}} ships left the Azores for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they {{suffered}} a resounding defeat {{in a battle}} with , a heavily armed man of war. Greyhound had been dispatched {{under the command of}} Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the Fancy with a skeleton crew and £150,000 in gold on board and <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> to the Azores, leaving Harris and the Ranger behind.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1832, Black Hawk {{and about}} 200 warriors {{attacked}} at the hastily constructed Apple River Fort, near present-day Elizabeth, Illinois. Local settlers, warned of Black Hawk's approach, {{took refuge in}} the fort, which was defended by about 20 to 35 militiamen. The Battle of Apple River Fort lasted about forty-five minutes. The women and girls inside the fort, {{under the direction of}} Elizabeth Armstrong, loaded muskets and molded bullets. After losing several men, Black Hawk broke off the siege, looted the nearby homes, and <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> towards his camp.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently visiting Boston, and Rockland, Maine, Yancey {{participated in}} amphibious boat {{exercises}} at Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{before she got}} underway on 24 July for Davisville, Rhode Island. There, she loaded a Seabee unit and their equipment and headed eastward, bound for Rota, Spain. Offloading one Seabee unit and onloading another, Yancey then paused briefly at Gibraltar before touching at Lisbon on the return leg of her voyage to the United States. Disembarking the seabees and unloading their equipment at Davisville, Yancey <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> to Norfolk, reaching her homeport on 18 August 1962.|$|E

5|$|The {{wreck of}} Yangwu drifted as the French fired {{on her as}} she caught fire and sank. The victory of the French forces at Foochow was decisive, with losses {{estimated}} either at six or 12 personnel with 27 missing. The Chinese losses were far greater, at 521 killed, 150 wounded {{and a large number}} missing after the battle. The bombardment of the arsenal lasted for two days before the French ships <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> down the river, destroying any forts they encountered on the way.|$|E
5|$|At {{the road}} bridge, German {{forces of the}} 9th SS had quickly {{surrounded}} Frost's battalion, cutting them {{off from the rest}} of the division. At around 09:00, the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> toward Arnhem from south of the river, having concluded that it was not needed at Nijmegen. Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force. In the resultant two-hour battle, it was beaten back with heavy losses; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed in action during the assault. German attacks carried on around the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the rest of the day, but the British continued to hold.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, a {{dysentery}} epidemic swept communities {{along the}} Assiniboine River in Manitoba. On June 22 of that year, Belcourt left his mission at Baie-Saint-Paul {{to join a}} group of hunters on their journey south for the summer. The hunters carried the disease, infecting others, and 25 people died of dysentery by July 5. On the worst days, eight people had to be buried. Belcourt and six of the hunters travelled south to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in search of medicine, as the priest's supply had quickly run out. With his medicine supplies replenished, the missionary <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> to the encampment of hunters before returning to his mission.|$|E

5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast and <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> to their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by {{some time in the}} yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had {{run aground}} {{at which time}} Commander Jones {{came down from the}} spar deck only to find the gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Cavite on Luzon, the gunboat {{headed for}} Japan on 3 April and {{underwent}} repairs there from 9 April to 19 May before {{heading back to}} the Philippines. The warship arrived at Cavite on 27 May and resumed patrols on 3 June. She spent another seven months conducting patrols in the Philippines and supporting the Army’s operations in the island chain. On 3 January 1901, she departed Cavite and shaped a course for Hong Kong. The gunboat arrived in that British colony on the 6th and began over six months of repairs. At the completion of that work, she departed Hong Kong on 25 June. After a visit to Shanghai, the warship <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> to the United States in July and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 August. She was decommissioned there on 5 September 1901.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Scharnhorst arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had {{temporarily}} ceased. To give the ships {{an opportunity to}} work together, Admiral Karl Dönitz, who had replaced Raeder {{in the aftermath of}} the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942, ordered an attack on the island of Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base. Several settlements and outposts on Spitzbergen were defended by a garrison of 152 men from the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile. The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6 September; in a ruse de guerre, Tirpitz flew the white ensign on the approach to the island the following day. During the bombardment, Tirpitz fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15cm secondaries. This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target. An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners. By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> to their Norwegian ports.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Port Arthur on {{the second}} day of the war, Poltava was hit twice in the aft hull, Petropavlovsk was hit three times in the bow and Sevastopol was hit once. Between them, the three ships lost two men killed and seven wounded and none of them {{suffered}} any significant damage. Tsar Nicholas II relieved Stark and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov who assumed command on 7 March. On 31 March, Petropavlovsk and Poltava sortied to support Russian cruisers and destroyers engaging their Japanese counterparts, but they <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> to Port Arthur to join the rest of the Pacific Squadron when the main Japanese battlefleet appeared. They ran into a newly laid minefield en route and Petropavlovsk struck at least one of the mines. Observers saw three explosions, one of which appeared to be that of her magazines, and the ship sank in less than two minutes. Casualties included Admiral Makarov and his guest, Russian battle artist Vasily Vereshchagin, 26 officers and 652 enlisted men. Only seven officers and 73 crewmen were rescued.|$|E
5|$|Following {{participation}} in the 1893 International Naval Review at Hampton Roads, Bennington moved north for operations {{along the coast of}} New England before beginning preparations for foreign service. To this end, she entered the New York Navy Yard on 24 May and remained there until 6 August. The ship departed New York on the 6th and arrived in Lisbon on the 18th. She cruised the Mediterranean, visiting various ports along its shores, for the next six months. In February 1894, orders arrived sending her to the Pacific. On the 18th, the gunboat transited the Strait of Gibraltar and <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> across the Atlantic. After steaming around Cape Horn and stopping at several Latin American ports, the warship finally arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 30 April.|$|E
