25|$|Ovarian {{cancer has}} low prevalence, {{even in the}} <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> of women from the ages of 50 to 60 (about one in 2000), and {{screening}} of women with average risk {{is more likely to}} give ambiguous results than detect a problem which requires treatment. Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it {{is more likely to be}} treated successfully.|$|E

25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} rabies from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E
25|$|Most {{truck drivers}} are {{employed}} as over-the-road drivers, meaning they are hired to drive long distances {{from the place}} of pickup {{to the place of}} delivery. During the short times while they are in heavily polluted urban areas, being inside the cab of the truck contributes much to avoiding the inhalation of toxic emissions, and on the majority of the trip, while they are passing through vast rural areas where there is little air pollution, truck drivers in general enjoy less exposure to toxic emissions in the air than the inhabitants of large cities, where there is an increased exposure to emissions from engines, factories, etc., which may increase the risk of cancer and can aggravate certain lung diseases, such as asthma in the general public who inhabit these cities. However, the few drivers who are hired to drive only within urban areas do not have this advantage of spending more time away from toxic emissions that is enjoyed by over-the-road drivers. Other conditions affecting the health of truck drivers are for example vibration, noise, long periods of sitting, work stress and exhaustion. For drivers in developing countries there are additional risks because roads are in appalling conditions and accidents occur more frequently. Truck drivers are even a <b>high-risk</b> <b>group</b> for HIV-infection in those countries.|$|E

The FDA chose to uphold the blood ban. Female sexual partners of MSM (men {{who have sex with}} men) are deferred for one year since the last exposure. [...] This is the same policy used for any sexual partner of someone in a <b>high-risk</b> <b>group.</b> [...] The intent of these policies is to ensure that blood is collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded.

40|$|Background The {{delivery}} of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine to <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> remains an important preventive care responsibility for primary care. There {{is a lack}} of evidence about influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> in UK general practice and methods to improve this. Design Two-stage multipractice audit of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> before and after graphical anonymised feedback and written advice on improving vaccination rates. Setting 22 out of 105 Lincolnshire practices volunteered to participate. The study period for the baseline data collection was September to December 1998 and re-evaluation took place in January to February 2000 after the next annual influenza vaccination programme. Key measures for improvement Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups,</b> specifically in patients with coronary heart disease, diabetes and post-splenectomy. Methods A combination of strategies for change were used including dissemination of guidelines, advice on setting up disease and vaccine registers, organisational strategies for improving vaccination rates including call and recall systems and benchmarking of performance. Results For practices participating in both phases of the audit cycle, mean annual influenza vaccination uptake increased by 10. 8...|$|R

40|$|Background. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are {{important}} therapies supported by {{national and international}} guidelines for preventing morbidity and mortality from respiratory illnesses in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups.</b> The responsibility for delivering these vaccinations in the United Kingdom lies with primary care. Little is known about how rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination can be increased in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> in primary care. Aim. To research methods of improving rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> in primary care. Objectives. To investigate the impact of educational interventions for primary care teams on influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups.</b> Method. The research had the following components: a. 	Literature search examining current practice and policy in relation to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination and studies undertaken to improve performance, both in general and specifically in relation to improving adult vaccination rates. b. 	Pilot study of targeting influenza and pneumococcal vaccination to <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> in a single general practice. c. 	Effect of audit and feedback with an information pack to primary care teams on influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in primary care: before-and-after multipractice study. d. 	Effect of audit and feedback with an information pack to primary care teams, {{as part of a}} clinical governance programme, on influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in a primary care trust: before-and-after multipractice study. e. 	Randomised controlled study of an educational outreach intervention partly nested within primary care trust study with audit, feedback and information (passive dissemination of guidelines and recommendations) directed at primary health care teams compared with audit feedback and information alone using multifaceted interventions to increase influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> in primary care. Results. The studies demonstrated significant improvements in influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rate in <b>high-risk</b> <b>groups</b> in primary care, showed the levels of improvement that could be expected from these types of intervention and described how primary care teams responded to direct and indirect educational interventions supported by measurement of performance. Conclusions. Education to multiprofessional teams is an important method for diffusion of innovations in the highly professionalised organisations of primary care and general practice. Educators need to understand the complex nature of primary care organisations and teams, when and how education for teams is likely to be successful, the barriers to implementation of new ideas and how to address these. Education when applied appropriately can have important effects in improving health care. This is more likely to occur when careful assessments are made around the nature of the evidence, clear outcomes are sought and measured and the healthcare intervention is understood {{from the perspective of the}} patient, the healthcare team and other stakeholders...|$|R
