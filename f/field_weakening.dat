50|$|A brief {{complete}} reversal, {{known as}} the Laschamp event, occurred only 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period. That reversal lasted only about 440 years with the actual change of polarity lasting around 250 years. During this change {{the strength of the}} magnetic <b>field</b> <b>weakened</b> to 5% of its present strength. Brief disruptions that do not result in reversal are called geomagnetic excursions.|$|R
40|$|The vacuum {{dynamics}} of SU(2) lattice gauge theory is studied {{by means of}} a gauge-invariant effective action, both at zero and finite temperature.

50|$|The {{speed of}} a DC motor can be {{increased}} by <b>field</b> <b>weakening.</b> Reducing the field strength is done by inserting resistance in series with a shunt field, or inserting resistances around a series-connected field winding, to reduce current in the field winding. When the field is weakened, the back-emf reduces, so a larger current flows through the armature winding and this increases the speed. <b>Field</b> <b>weakening</b> is not used on its own but {{in combination with other}} methods, such as series-parallel control.|$|E
50|$|The 3rd series {{locomotives}} {{have four}} <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> shunts in parallel and super-parallel motor combinations (where the other series have three), and the 78-wire cable to remote control the locomotive from a control car (Carrozza semipilota) or another Delfina-fitted locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The 46 class {{featured}} six MV 272 {{traction motors}} fed current switched by electropneumatic power contactors. The MV 272 motor had six poles and was lap-wound. The driver's traction controls included the accelerating, reversing and regenerating handles. Nineteen starting and five <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> resistances were available with the traction motors connected in series, series-parallel and parallel (for {{a total of}} seventy five manually selected power settings, e.g. OFF, starting resistors 1-19, all resistors cut out in 20, <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> resistors cut in from 21 to 25). Series-parallel comprised two parallel circuits, each of three motors in series, whereas parallel is three parallel circuits of two motors in series. The removable reversing handle controlled the direction of travel and motor connection. Parallel was available only in the forward direction.|$|E
50|$|A {{negative}} Dst value {{means that}} Earth's magnetic <b>field</b> is <b>weakened.</b> This is particularly the case during solar storms.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a contact}} effect, the {{proximity}} effect {{is closely related}} to thermoelectric phenomena like the Peltier effect or the formation of pn junctions in semiconductors. The proximity effect enhancement of [...] is largest when the normal material is a metal with a large diffusivity rather than an insulator (I). Proximity-effect suppression of [...] in a spin-singlet superconductor is largest when the normal material is ferromagnetic, as the presence of the internal magnetic <b>field</b> <b>weakens</b> superconductivity (Cooper pairs breaking).|$|R
5000|$|United {{played out}} a 0-0 draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 9 May. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and Chelsea {{counterpart}} José Mourinho both <b>fielded</b> <b>weakened</b> sides, resting their senior players for the FA Cup Final (which Chelsea eventually won 1-0). Chelsea looked more likely winners {{in what was}} mostly a low-key encounter. United goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak was erratic, but made several saves and Kieran Lee also cleared off the line from Ben Sahar in the closing minutes.|$|R
50|$|There {{were five}} 140 kW Brown Boveri {{traction}} motors, connected in parallel. Innovations in the E el-5 included forced ventilation for the traction motors, <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> for high speed running and rheostatic braking. The rheostatic braking was {{excluded from the}} Russian built locomotives, to save weight, but they still weighed several tons more than the E el-5.|$|E
50|$|Current {{collection}} is by single-pan air operated pantographs, which feed the main power circuits by a high-speed circuit breaker. The main resistances {{were made by}} Metropolitan-Vickers' parent company, Associated Electrical Industries. The four traction motors are permanently connected in series pairs, with series-parallel combinations between pairs. Parallel and 12 <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> positions give a total of 55 running notches. The four traction motors have Alsthom quill drives.|$|E

40|$|In NOAA Active Region 2372 (April 1980), 4 x 10 to the 20 th maxwells of {{magnetic}} flux concentrated {{in an area}} 30 arcsec across disappeared overnight. Vector magnetograms show that all components of the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>weakened</b> together. If the <b>field</b> had <b>weakened</b> through diffusion or fluid flow, 90 percent of the original flux would still have been detected by the magnetograph within a suitably enlarged area. In fact there was a threefold decrease in detected flux. Evidently, magnetic field {{was removed from the}} photosphere. Since the disappearing flux was located in a region of low magnetic shear and low activity in H-alpha and Ly-alpha, {{it is unlikely that the}} field dissipated through reconnection. It is argued that the most likely possibility is that flux submerged. The observations suggest that even during the growth phase of active regions, submergence is a strong process comparable in magnitude to emergence...|$|R
50|$|As each bump in {{the wheel}} {{approaches}} the pickup, it temporarily concentrates the magnetic field near it, and thus strengthens the magnetic field that passes through the coil, inducing a current in the coil {{by the process of}} Electromagnetic induction. As the bump moves past, this concentrating effect is reduced again, the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>weakens</b> slightly, and an opposite current is induced in the coil. Thus, the frequency of the current in the coil depends on the speed of rotation of the disk and the number of bumps.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} equipment on the ER2 multiple units {{is similar to}} that of the late-model ER1s. Each power car has 4 traction motors connected in a series-parallel connection. The traction motor clamp voltage is controlled by means of starting resistances, as well as by changing the motors' connectivity and by <b>field</b> <b>weakening.</b> They are protected from electrical surges by various protective units: a fast-acting circuit breaker, an overload relay, a differential relay, etc. Early units also had a fuse in the traction motor circuit, but later units had more reliable protective equipment, which led to the fuse being removed as redundant.|$|E
5000|$|The driver {{gradually}} excludes the rheostat {{by rotating}} the lever counterclockwise, {{paying attention to}} not exceed the maximum allowed current (in this occurrence, the [...] "maximum current relay", and consequently the [...] "Main Breaker" [...] (IR, Interruttore Rapido) opens), until he reaches the end combination notches, meaning that the rheostat is fully excluded for that combination; at this point, he can pass to the following combination or insert the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> shunts to further increase current.There are 31, 11, 9 and 8 notches on the roncola, each representing a portion of rheostat in the respective combinations.|$|E
50|$|One useful {{property}} {{of having the}} field windings in series with the armature winding is that as the speed increases the counter EMF naturally reduces the voltage across, and current through the field windings, giving <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> at high speeds. This means that the motor has no theoretical maximum speed for any particular applied voltage. Universal motors can be and are generally run at high speeds, 4000-16000 rpm, and can go over 20,000 rpm. By way of contrast, AC synchronous and squirrel cage induction motors cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency. In countries with 60 Hz(cycle/Sec) AC supply, this speed is limited to 3600 RPM.|$|E
50|$|The {{team went}} on tour {{to raise funds}} for the Basque cause, and also played in Europe and Mexico. However, the Campeonato de Vicaya {{continued}} to be played. With their best players on tour with the Basque national team, Athletic Bilbao could only <b>field</b> <b>weakened</b> sides and, as a result, chose to enter under the name Bilbao Athletic. Despite this, they still won the championship; the club's name was derived from the two clubs that merged in 1903 to become Athletic Bilbao - Bilbao Football Club and Athletic Club.|$|R

50|$|Since the series-wound DC motor {{develops}} {{its highest}} torque at low speed, {{it is often}} used in traction applications such as electric locomotives, and trams. Another application is starter motors for petrol and small diesel engines. Series motors must never be used in applications where the drive can fail (such as belt drives). As the motor accelerates, the armature (and hence field) current reduces. The reduction in field causes the motor to speed up until it destroys itself. This {{can also be a}} problem with railway motors {{in the event of a}} loss of adhesion since, unless quickly brought under control, the motors can reach speeds far higher than they would do under normal circumstances. This can not only cause problems for the motors themselves and the gears, but due to the differential speed between the rails and the wheels it can also cause serious damage to the rails and wheel treads as they heat and cool rapidly. <b>Field</b> <b>weakening</b> is used in some electronic controls to increase the top speed of an electric vehicle. The simplest form uses a contactor and field-weakening resistor; the electronic control monitors the motor current and switches the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> resistor into circuit when the motor current reduces below a preset value (this will be when the motor is at its full design speed). Once the resistor is in circuit, the motor will increase speed above its normal speed at its rated voltage. When motor current increases, the control will disconnect the resistor and low speed torque is made available.|$|E
50|$|Of all the 30 notches, 1-21 are DC notches {{allowing}} {{series operation}} of traction motors. Rest of the 8 notches allow series-parallel combination under DC. Under AC, the combinations are 3S-2P and 2S-3P. These locomotives could {{run in parallel}} combination but it was discouraged due to power problems under DC. Under AC, the locomotives are run under parallel notches nearly always. Although these engines are not rebuilt to use only parallel combination under AC. <b>Field</b> <b>weakening</b> of traction motors is possible at 21st and 30th notches. Voltage control is by Tap changer operation under AC and Resistance notching under DC. Traction motors are charged by DC. Its prototypes were tested in the year 1971.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} computationally efficient approach for predicting iron loss within a field orientated controlled brushless AC permanent magnet machine which can cater for both rated flux and <b>field</b> <b>weakened</b> operation. The proposed method is readily incorporated {{as part of the}} design process and is based on two discrete time step 2 D magnetostatic finite element field solutions describing the open circuit and short circuit operation of the machine. Parameters obtained from these analyses are used alongside the standard d-q equivalent circuit to generate a map for the iron loss across the entire machine working envelope. Test results taken from a concentrated wound brushless AC traction motor are used to validate the technique...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{geophysical}} event which can affect [...] production: geomagnetic reversals and polarity excursions. In a geomagnetic reversal, the Earth's geomagnetic <b>field</b> <b>weakens</b> and stays weak for thousands of years during the transition to the opposite magnetic polarity and then regains strength as the reversal completes. A polarity excursion, which can be either global or local, is a shorter-lived version of a geomagnetic reversal. A local excursion would not significantly affect 14C production. During either a geomagnetic reversal or a global polarity excursion, [...] production increases during the period when the geomagnetic field is weak. It is fairly certain, though, that in the last 50,000 years there have been no geomagnetic reversals or global polarity excursions.|$|R
50|$|The {{latter half}} of the 1960s had seen the {{widespread}} introduction of solid state electronics and these locomotives incorporated a control system where speed was detected electronically rather than mechanically. A signal from a tachogenerator was used to close contactors in sequence at given speeds to activate the motor's <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> process, rather than through contacts and relays as in earlier types. The control system ensured the traction motors and main generator were all operated within the continuous rating of the machines except in full field conditions when the driver was able to judge how long to remain in the short-term rating condition.There were two variants of the Class 25/3 sub-class. Early 25/3 AV locomotives were fitted with vacuum brakes and in due course many of these were dual braked and redesignated 25/3 BX. By the time the last few locomotives were under construction dual braking had become the norm and ten of the last batch from Derby were built new as 25/3 BX locomotives for work out of Willesden on the recently upgraded West Coast Main Line.|$|E

40|$|The {{motor drive}} system {{represents}} a key technology {{for development of}} the electrical vehicles, and the permanent magnet synchronous motor becomes the mainstream of the new energy vehicle drive motor for the superior performances in power density, low-speed torque density, efficiency and reliability. The paper studies the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> control strategy for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) and provides a <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> control strategy for the IPMSM at the full-speed range. By studying the mathematical IPMSM model and the methods of conventional vector control and analyzing the operating conditions of the IPMSM at the full-speed range, the paper divides the operating conditions into constant torque operation region I, constant torque operation region II, constant power <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> operation region and high-speed <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> operation region to confirm the control strategy algorithm in each region and the transition conditions between regions and provide the current control strategy that the d-axis current and q-axis current are confirmed by the reference torque and the feedback speed. Modeling of the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> control strategies in each region is made through the Matlab/Simulink, and simulation of the operating conditions with a steady-state load and a dynamic load is done to verify that the <b>field</b> <b>weakening</b> control strategy in each region is feasible.
