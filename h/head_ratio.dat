40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the value of fetal lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> in the prediction of the postnatal outcome in left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia treated by fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion. STUDY DESIGN: The lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> was measured before fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion in 28 fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia at 25 to 29 weeks. Regression analysis was used to investigate the effect on survival of lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio,</b> gestation at fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion, gestation at delivery, preterm amniorrhexis following fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion, and prenatal removal of the balloon. RESULTS: The median lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> prior to fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion was 0. 7 (range 0. 5 to 0. 9). The median gestation at delivery was 34 (range 27 to 39) weeks, and there were 16 survivors (57 %). Only lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> provided significant prediction of survival, which increased from 17 % for lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> of 0. 4 to 0. 5 to 62 % for lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> of 0. 6 to 0. 7 and 78 % for lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> of 0. 8 to 0. 9. CONCLUSION: In congenital diaphragmatic hernia treated by fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion, postnatal survival can be predicted by the lung area to <b>head</b> circumference <b>ratio</b> measured prior to the procedure. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|A typical energy {{efficiency}} is 60%, but up to 80% is possible. This {{should not be}} confused with the volumetric efficiency, which relates the volume of water delivered to total water taken from the source. The portion of water available at the delivery pipe will be reduced by the ratio of the delivery head to the supply head. Thus if the source is 2 meters above the ram and the water is lifted to 10 meters above the ram, only 20% of the supplied water can be available, the other 80% being spilled via the waste valve. These ratios assume 100% {{energy efficiency}}. Actual water delivered will be further reduced by the energy efficiency factor. In the above example, if the energy efficiency is 70%, the water delivered will be 70% of 20%, i.e. 14%. Assuming a 2-to-1 supply head to delivery <b>head</b> <b>ratio</b> and 70% efficiency, the delivered water would be 70% of 50%, i.e. 35%. Very high ratios of delivery to supply head usually result in lowered energy efficiency. Suppliers of rams often provide tables giving expected volume ratios based on actual tests.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Water {{is central}} to survival, without water human, plant and animal life would be impossible. Therefore supply of water {{has become one of}} the {{fundamental}} requirements of any society and the need to transfer water has generated the design of various forms of mechanical devices, which can be categorized as pumps. Jet pump is a device that performs its pumping action by the transfer of energy from a high velocity supply jet to one of low velocity suction flow. These two flows mix in the mixing tube and the kinetic energy of the combined flow is converted partially into the pressure energy in the diffuser. The optimization of the design of multi hole nozzle jet pump with various pitch circle diameter (PCD) and five different diameter mixing tubes. The area ratios chosen have been modified and the final area ratios used were R = 0. 20, 0. 28, 0. 36, 0. 43 & 0. 50. From the graphs, <b>head</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero discharge ratios (No), discharge ratio at zero <b>head</b> <b>ratio</b> (Mo) and slope of M-N (m) curve were noted along with the extrapolated values of maximum efficiency (�bep), optimum discharge ratio (Mopt), and optimum <b>head</b> <b>ratio</b> (Nopt) and tabulated. In order to distinguish these nozzle plates from these charts one can conclude that efficiency is higher at lower pitch circle diameter, lower mixing tube diameter and higher area ratios. In the range of experiments conducted highest maximum efficiency was obtained for an area ratio of 0. 43 with 2 holes on 13 PCD with 25. 9 mm mixing tube...|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of submerged flow below vertical gate with sill upstream of horizontal diverging channel reach are analyzed based on experimental investigation. The experimental program is {{conducted in a}} laboratory flume with 10 cm wide, 31 cm deep and 3. 0 m long. A diverging channel reach with fixed length and constant divergence angle is used. Polygonal sills with constant height, constant upstream slope and variable downstream slope are used under the gate. These sills are tested under wide range of similar submerged flow conditions to investigate the effect of sill slope on the flow characteristics. Also, a particular sill is tested under different heights to address the effect of sill height on the flow characteristics. Both the effects of submergence and the under-gate Froude number on the flow below the gate are discussed. Different flow regimes are considered (Supercritical, critical and subcritical flow). It is found {{that the presence of}} sill under the gate upstream of diverging channel reach has a remarkable effect on the discharge coefficient of the gate. It is noticed that the submergence ratio and the upstream <b>head</b> <b>ratio</b> are not able to explain the observed variations (or scatter of data) in the discharge coefficients.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of the two heads of the myosin molecule with actin was studied by tryptic digestion of HMM {{in the presence of}} actin, followed by crosslinking the two nicked heavy chains with Nbs 2 at the S 2 region. In view of the protection by actin of the 5060 kDa junction against proteolysis, the percentage of the heads interacting with actin was estimated from the proportion of the 110 kDa to the 60 kDa digestion product. Under conditions such that about 50 % of HMM heads were protected by actin (at an actin to HMM <b>head</b> molar <b>ratio</b> of 1 : 1 in the absence of nucleotide, or 3 : 1 in the presence of 5 mM ADP), the crosslinking of the digestion products yielded a 230 kDa (110 + 110 kDa), 125 kDa (60 + 60 kDa) and 175 kDa (60 + 110 kDa) species. Since the latter should be the only crosslinking product when only one head of HMM molecule is protected by actin, it is concluded that there is no preferential binding of one of the two HMM heads to actin in the presence of ADP or at equimolar actin to myosin <b>heads</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|R

METHODS:: A cohort of 41 fetuses with CDH between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation and treated with FETO. Observed/expected lung to <b>head</b> <b>ratio</b> (O/E-LHR), pulmonary Doppler Pulsatility Index (PI), Peak Early Diastolic Reverse Flow (PEDRF) and Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV) were evaluated before FETO, and their isolated and combined value to predict survival using multiple logistic regression and decision tree analysis was assessed. RESULTS:: O/E-LHR, Doppler PI and PEDRF {{were significantly associated with}} the probability of survival (O/E-LHR >/= 26 % OR 14. 2, PI /= 26 %: 90 % survival; O/E-LHR< 26 %: 45 % survival). For cases with O/E-LHR< 26 %, Doppler parameters allowed to discriminate cases with moderate (66 - 71 % survival) and very poor (0 % survival) prognosis.
