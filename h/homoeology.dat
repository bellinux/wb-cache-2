The red fox has extensive chromosome arm <b>homoeology</b> {{with these two}} species, but has only two entire chromosomes in common. All three species share some chromosomes with the raccoon dog, as does the high diploid-numbered grey wolf (Canis lupus, 2 n = 78). Moreover, some chromosomes of the raccoon dog show partial or complete <b>homoeology</b> with metacentric feline chromosomes which suggests that these are primitive canid chromosomes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: On September 11, 2001, terrorists {{attacked}} the United States. By coincidence, a North Carolina highway patrol trooper {{was wearing an}} ambulatory ECG Holter monitor at this time {{as part of an}} air pollution study. METHODS: Heart rate variability parameters were analyzed: standard deviation of normal to normal beat intervals (SDNN) and percentage of interval differences > 50 ms (PNN 50). RESULTS: The trooper's heart rate variability changed immediately after learning about the terrorist attacks. Heart rate increased and PNN 50 decreased, while SDNN increased strongly. CONCLUSIONS: These changes suggest strong emotional sympathetic stress associated with parasympathetic withdrawal in response to the news about the terrorist attack.

Homologous genes resulting from allopolyploidy are commonly referred to as 'homoeologs', although this term has not always been used precisely or consistently in the literature. With several allopolyploid genome sequencing projects under way, there is a pressing need for computational methods for <b>homoeology</b> inference. Here we review the definition of <b>homoeology</b> in historical and modern contexts and propose a precise and testable definition highlighting the connection between homoeologs and orthologs. In the second part, we survey experimental and computational methods of homoeolog inference, considering the strengths and limitations of each approach. Establishing a precise and evolutionarily meaningful definition of <b>homoeology</b> is essential for understanding the evolutionary consequences of polyploidization...|$|E

All 31 markers were localized on homoeologous chromosomes and chromosome bands of the two species in agreement with previous localizations obtained both in cattle and river buffalo, definitively confirming chromosome <b>homoeologies</b> between Caprinae and Bovinae. In addition, we have extended physical maps of sheep and goat as 11 genes (HSD 3 B 1, INHBA, CSN 10, IGF 2 R, PIGR, MAP 1 B, DSC 1, ELN, TNFRSF 6, CGN 1, IGF 2) and 14 genes (SOD 1, HSD 3 B 1, CSN 10, IGF 2 R, RB 1, TG, PIGR, MAP 1 B, IGH@, LTF, DSC 1, TNFRSF 6, CGN 1, IGF 2) were assigned {{for the first time to}} goat and sheep chromosomes, respectively...|$|R

Ovine and caprine BAC clones containing both type I loci (known genes) and type II loci (simple sequence repeats (SRs), microsatellite marker, sequencetagged sites (STSs)), previously assigned to sheep chromosomes, have been localized on R-banded river buffalo chromosomes (BBU), which expands the cytogenetic map of this important domestic species and increases {{our knowledge of the}} physical organization of its genome. The loci mapped in the present study correspond to loci already localized on homoeologous cattle (and sheep) chromosomes and chromosome bands, further confirming the high degree of chromosome <b>homoeologies</b> among bovids. The comparison of the integrated cytogenetic maps of BBU 2 p/BBU 10 and BBU 5 p/BBU 16 with those of human chromosomes (HSA) 6 and 11, respectively, identified, at least, nine conserved chromosome segments in each case and complex rearrangements differentiating river buffalo (and cattle) and human chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|A GTG-banding {{comparison}} between the chromosomes of gaur (Bos gaurus hubbacki, BGA, 2 n = 56) and those of domestic cattle (Bos taurus, BTA, 2 n = 60) was performed to establish chromosome <b>homoeologies</b> or {{differences between the two}} species. The two biarmed chromosomes of gaur (BGA 1 and BGA 2) were originated by centric fusion translocations between homoeologous cattle chromosomes 1 / 29 (BGA 1) and 2 / 28 (BGA 2). High resolution GTG-banding {{comparison between}} BGA 1 and BTA 1 /BTA 29 revealed that BGA 1 q differentiated from BTA 1 by a paracentric inversion of a large and proximal chromosome region (BTA 1 q 13 -q 32). To our knowledge, this is the first case of a bovid biarmed chromosome originated by centric fusion and paracentric inversion during karyotype evolution. The CBG-banding pattern showed clear C-bands in all autosomes, although the two biarmed pairs showed smaller C-bands, especially in BGA 2.

Seven hundred and forty-six SNP markers derived from EST sequences of R. sativus were assigned to nine linkage groups with a total length of 806. 7 cM. By BLASTN, 726 markers {{were found to have}} homolo-gous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, and 72 syntenic regions, which have great potential for utilizing genomic information of the model species A. thaliana in basic and applied genetics of R. sativus, were identified. By construction and analysis of the genome structures of R. sativus based on the 24 genomic blocks within the Brassicaceae ancestral karyotype, 23 of the 24 genomic blocks were detected in the genome of R. sativus, and half of them were found to be triplicated. Comparison of the genome structure of R. sativus with those of the A, B, and C genomes of Brassica species and that of Sinapis alba L. revealed extensive chromosome <b>homoeology</b> among Brassiceae species, which would facilitate transfer of the genomic information from one Brassiceae species to another.

40|$|The {{allotetraploid}} species Aegilops variabilis Eig (2 n = 28, UUSvSv) {{belongs to}} the tribe Triticeae and {{is closely related to}} wheat. One accession, Ae. variabilis No. 1, was found to be resistant to the cereal cyst nematode (CCN) and the root-knot nematode (RKN). As the genetic variability for resistance to those two pests is limited within wheat, this accession was crossed to bread wheat. Previous work enabled the development of two addition lines and two translocation lines carrying resistance. Here, we demonstrate, using genomic in situ hybridization, that there is no U-Sv interchange in the parental accession of Ae. variabilis. However, there are multiple rearrangements in the Sv chromosomes. The Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying the CreX gene for resistance to CCN combined segments with <b>homoeology</b> to wheat groups 1, 2, 4, and 6. The CreX gene {{belongs to the}} group 1 part and it was likely to have been introduced into chromosome 1 BL at a similar location as the previously found QTL QCre. srd- 1 B for CCN resistance. The second Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying CreY and Rkn 2 combined segments with <b>homoeology</b> to wheat groups 2, 4, and 7 on its short arm and group 3 on its long arm. It was designated as 3 Sv. The two genes for resistance are carried by its long arm and have been transferred to wheat chromosome 3 BL through homoeologous and genetically balanced recombination.

40|$|We {{employ a}} {{detailed}} {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) map to investigate chromosome organization and evolution in cotton, a disomic polyploid. About 46. 2 % of nuclear DNA probes detect RFLPs distinguishing Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense; and 705 RFLP loci are assembled into 41 linkage groups and 4675 cM. The subgenomic origin (A vs. D) of most, and chromosomal identity of 14 (of 26), linkage groups is shown. The A and D subgenomes show similar recombinational length, suggesting that repetitive DNA in the physically larger A subgenome is recombinationally inert. RFLPs are somewhat more {{abundant in the}} D subgenome. Linkage among duplicated RFLPs reveals 11 pairs of homoeologous chromosomal regions-two appear homosequential, most differ by inversions, and at least one differs by a translocation. Most <b>homoeologies</b> involve chromosomes from different subgenomes, putatively reflecting the n = 13 to n = 26 polyploidization event of 1. 1 - 1. 9 million years ago. Several observations suggest that another, earlier, polyploidization event spawned n = 13 cottons, at least 25 million years ago. The cotton genome contains about 400 -kb DNA per cM, hence map-based gene cloning is feasible.

40|$|Fruit quality {{traits are}} major {{breeding}} {{targets in the}} Rosaceae. Several of the major Rosaceae species are current or ancient polyploids. To dissect the inheritance of fruit quality traits in polyploid fleshy fruit species, we used a cultivated strawberry segregating population comprising a 213 full-sibling F 1 progeny from a cross between the variety ‘Capitola’ and the genotype ‘CF 1116 ’. We previously developed the most comprehensive strawberry linkage map, which displays seven <b>homoeology</b> groups (HG), including each four <b>homoeology</b> linkage groups (Genetics 179 : 2045 – 2060, 2008). The map was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for 19 fruit traits related to fruit development, texture, colour, anthocyanin, sugar and organic acid contents. Analyses were carried out over two or three successive years on field-grown plants. QTL were detected for all the analysed traits. Because strawberry is an octopolyploid species, QTL controlling a given trait and located at orthologous positions on different homoeologous linkage groups within one HG are considered as homoeo-QTL. We found that, for various traits, about one-fourth of QTL were putative homoeo-QTL and were localised on two linkage groups. Several homoeo-QTL could be detected the same year, suggesting that several copies of the gene underlying the QTL are functional. The detection of some other homoeo-QTL was year-dependent. Therefore, changes in allelic expression could take place in response to environmental changes. We believe that, in strawberry as in other polyploid fruit species, the mechanisms unravelled {{in the present study}} may {{play a crucial role in}} the variations of fruit quality...|$|E
40|$|For {{molecular}} {{characterization of}} F 1 hybrid of 0. sativa x 0. officinalis and its backcross-I generation (BC 1) with 0. sativa through genomic {{in situ hybridization}} (GISH), biotin labelled total genomic DNA from 0. officinalis was used as probe. Cytological preparations were made by enzymatic maceration technique. Probe was hybridized onto chromosomal preparations at 37 °C and signals were detected by colorimetric method using 3 -amino- 9 -ethylcarbazole. Labelling efficiency of probe was determined by dot blot method prior to hybridization reaction. Based on the appearance of signal on chromosomes, it was inferred that there exists partial <b>homoeology</b> between the genomes of 0. sativa and 0. officinalis and there are higher chances of gene(s) transfer from 0. officinalis to 0. sativa.

40|$|Abstract Background Extensive mapping {{efforts are}} {{currently}} underway {{for the establishment}} of comparative genomics between the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana and various Brassica species. Most of these studies have deployed RFLP markers, the use of which is a laborious and time-consuming process. We therefore tested the efficacy of PCR-based Intron Polymorphism (IP) markers to analyze genome-wide synteny between the oilseed crop, Brassica juncea (AABB genome) and A. thaliana and analyzed the arrangement of 24 (previously described) genomic block segments in the A, B and C Brassica genomes to study the evolutionary events contributing to karyotype variations in the three diploid Brassica genomes. Results IP markers were highly efficient and generated easily discernable polymorphisms on agarose gels. Comparative analysis of the segmental organization of the A and B genomes of B. juncea (present study) with the A and B genomes of B. napus and B. nigra respectively (described earlier), revealed a high degree of colinearity suggesting minimal macro-level changes after polyploidization. The ancestral block arrangements that remained unaltered during evolution and the karyotype rearrangements that originated in the Oleracea lineage after its divergence from Rapa lineage were identified. Genomic rearrangements leading to the gain or loss of one chromosome each between the A-B and A-C lineages were deciphered. Complete <b>homoeology</b> in terms of block organization was found between three linkage groups (LG) each for the A-B and A-C genomes. Based on the <b>homoeology</b> shared between the A, B and C genomes, a new nomenclature for the B genome LGs was assigned to establish uniformity in the international Brassica LG nomenclature code. Conclusion IP markers were highly effective in generating comparative relationships between Arabidopsis and various Brassica species. Comparative genomics between the three Brassica lineages established the major rearrangements, translocations and fusions pivotal to karyotype diversification between the A, B and C genomes of Brassica species. The inter-relationships established between the Brassica lineages vis-à-vis Arabidopsis would facilitate the identification and isolation of candidate genes contributing to traits of agronomic value in crop Brassicas and the development of unified tools for Brassica genomics. </p...|$|E

40|$|Wide {{hybridization}} between crop brassicas {{and their}} wild relatives {{is an important}} approach towards increasing the genetic variability, which can be utilised for brassica breeding programs. A new intergeneric hybrid between Erucastrum cardaminoides and Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra was produced using embryo rescue techniques. The F 1 hybrid was intermediate between {{the male and female}} parent for most of the morphological characters. Cytological studies of pollen mother cells of the hybrid revealed a preponderance of univalents at metaphase I. The number of bivalents in the digenomic hybrid was lower than expected. However, the presence of trivalent and quadrivalent in cells indicated some <b>homoeology</b> between the two genomes and hence the possibility of introgression of genes into the cultivar. The first backcross progeny was obtained using B. oleracea var. alboglabra as the pollen parent. Further, it is being used for developing new alloplasmic lines. The intergeneric hybrid was also used as bridge species to transfer wild (E. cardaminoides) cytoplasm to B. napus and B. carinata.

40|$|In this work, we {{examined}} the genetic diversity and evolution of the WAG- 2 gene based on new WAG- 2 alleles isolated from wheat and its relatives. Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and no insertions and deletions (indels) were found in exon sequences of WAG- 2 from different species. More SNPs and indels occurred in introns than in exons. For exons, exons+introns and introns, the nucleotide polymorphism &# 928; decreased from diploid and tetraploid genotypes to hexaploid genotypes. This finding indicated that the diversity of WAG- 2 in diploids was greater than in hexaploids because of the strong selection pressure on the latter. All dn/ds ratios were < 1. 0, indicating that WAG- 2 belongs to a conserved gene affected by negative selection. Thirty-nine of the 57 particular SNPs and eight of the 10 indels were detected in diploid species. The degree of divergence in intron length among WAG- 2 clones and phylogenetic tree topology suggested the existence of three homoeologs in the A, B or D genome of common wheat. Wheat AG-like genes were divided into WAG- 1 and WAG- 2 clades. The latter clade contained WAG- 2, OsMADS 3 and ZMM 2 genes, indicating functional <b>homoeology</b> among them...|$|E
40|$|To {{transfer}} agronomically important {{genes from}} wild relatives to bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2 n = 6 x = 42, AABBDD) by induced homoeologous recombination, {{it is important}} to know the chromosomal relationships of the species involved. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used to study chromosome structure. The genomes of allohexaploid bread wheat and other species from the Triticeae tribe are colinear to some extent, i. e., composed of homoeoloci at similar positions along the chromosomes, and with genic regions being highly conserved. To develop cytogenetic markers specific for genic regions of wheat homoeologs, we selected more than 60 full-length wheat cDNAs using BLAST against mapped expressed sequence tags and used them as FISH probes. Most probes produced signals on all three homoeologous chromosomes at the expected positions. We developed a wheat physical map with several cDNA markers located on each of the 14 homoeologous chromosome arms. The FISH markers confirmed chromosome rearrangements within wheat genomes and were successfully used to study chromosome structure and <b>homoeology</b> in wild Triticeae species. FISH analysis detected 1 U- 6 U chromosome translocation in the genome of Aegilops umbellulata, showed colinearity between chromosome A of Ae. caudata and group- 1 wheat chromosomes, and between chromosome arm 7 S# 3 L of Thinopyrum intermedium and the long arm of the group- 7 wheat chromosomes...|$|E

Apparently, the closely related homoeologous chromosomes of the J 1 d and J 2 d genomes regularly formed bivalents during megasporogenesis, and egg cells mostly received a random, yet balanced set of seven Thinopyrum chromosomes. F 1 plants were tested for salt tolerance {{and a set}} of fifteen highly salt-tolerant F 1 plants were selected and maintained as clones for several years. These were C-banded and the Thinopyrum chromosomes contained in each were determined. By comparing segregation patterns it was now possible to group the Thinopyrum chromosomes into seven homoeologous pairs. For each of four homoeologous pairs, one of its members occurred at a higher than expected frequency, implying that these chromosomes are expressed under salt stress conditions. The results could be confirmed by backcrossing two of the most tolerant F 1 plants to diploid rye. While the critical chromosomes can be identified through C-banding, an attempt was made to also find a RFLP marker for each. RFLP probes, diagnostic for the group 2, 3, 4 and 5 homoeologues of wheat, detected polymorphisms on the respective critical Thinopyrum chromosomes.

40|$|Abstract: The wild {{relatives}} {{are an important}} source of new genes for the genetic improvement of wheat. Leaf and stripe rust resistance genes Lr 54 and Yr 37 occur on an Aegilops kotschyi-derived chromosomal translocation that had apparently replaced wheat chromosome arm 2 DL. The alien chromatin also includes the locus of a gene for reduced plant height (H), which appears to be different from Rht 8 on chromosome arm 2 DS. The introgressed genes were mapped relative to homoeologous wheat marker loci following the induction of chromosome pairing in translocation heterozygotes that lacked the Ph 1 locus. Ten recombined Lr 54 /Yr 37 translocation chromosomes were derived and characterized with micro-satellite, AFLP and SCAR markers. The data suggested that there was significant <b>homoeology</b> between the full-length translocated segment and the wheat 2 DL chromosome arm. The recombined translocations apparently resulted from single crossovers during which the distal end of the long arm of the translocation chromosome was replaced with wheat chroma-tin. Recombinant (Lr 54 /Yr 37 - 74) retained the least alien chromatin and both resistance genes, yet had lost the reduced plant height gene. A polymorphic AFLP fragment was converted into a dominant SCAR marker to detect rec. # 74. In addition three wheat microsatellite loci that map to the introgressed region provide a useful recessive marker system to detect Lr 54 /Yr 37. The shortened translocation could be useful in breeding and may be used for continued, closer mapping of the resistance genes...|$|E
40|$|Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) {{resistance}} in soft red winter wheat (SRWW) cultivars {{has been achieved}} by substituting a group 7 chromosome from Thinopyrum intermedium for chromosome 7 D. To localize BYDV resistance, a detailed molecular genetic analysis was done on the alien group 7 Th. intermedium chromosome to determine its structural organization. Triticeae group 7 RFLP markers and rye specific repetitive sequences used in the analysis showed that the alien chromosome in the P 29 substitution line has distinguishing features. The 350 – 480  bp rye telomeric sequence family was present on the long arm as determined by Southern and fluorescence in situ hybridization. However, further analysis using a rye dispersed repetitive sequence indicated that this alien chromosome does not contain introgressed segments from the rye genome. The alien chromosome is homoeologous to wheat chromosomes 7 A and 7 D as determined by RFLP analysis. Presence of the waxy gene on chromosomes 7 A, 7 B, and 7 D but its absence on the alien chromosome in P 29 suggests some internal structural differences on the short arm between Th. intermedium and wheat group 7 chromosomes.

40|$|Abstract Brassica napus (AACC) is {{a recent}} allotetra-ploid species evolved through {{hybridization}} between two diploids, B. rapa (AA) and B. oleracea (CC). Due to extensive genome duplication and <b>homoeology</b> within and between the A and C genomes of B. napus, most SSR markers display multiple fragments or loci, which limit their application in genetics and breeding studies of this economically important crop. In this study, we collected 3, 890 SSR markers from previous studies and also devel-oped 5, 968 SSR markers from genomic sequences of B. rapa, B. oleracea and B. napus. Of these, 2, 701 markers that produced single amplicons were putative single-locus markers in the B. napus genome. Finally, a set of 230 high-quality single-locus SSR markers were established and assigned to the 19 linkage groups of B. napus using a segregating population with 154 DH individuals. A subset of 78 selected single-locus SSR markers was proved to be highly stable and could successfully discriminate each of the 45 inbred lines and hybrids. In addition, most of the 230 SSR markers showed the single-locus nature {{in at least one}} of the Brassica species of the U’s triangle besides B. napus. These results indicated that this set of single-locus SSR markers has a wide range of coverage with excellent stability and would be useful for gene tagging, sequence scaffold assignment, comparative mapping, diversity analysis, variety identification and association mapping in Brassica species...|$|E

The variability of the five proteins has been investigated among 38 Hordeum vulgare cultivars and 17 H. spontaneum accessions. Proteins CMa- 1, CMc- 1 and CMd- 1 were invariant within the cultivated species; CMd was also invariant in the wild one. The inheritance of variants CMb- 1 /CMb- 2 and CMe- 1 /CMe- 2, 2 was studied in a cross H. spontaneum x H. vulgare. The first two proteins were inherited as codominantly expressed allelic variations of a single mendelian gene. Components CMe- 2, 2 were jointly inherited and codominantly expressed with respect to CMe- 1. Gene CMb and gene(s) CMe were found to be unlinked. The chromosomal locations of genes encoding CM-proteins were investigated using wheat-barley addition lines.

Changes in copy number of individual chromosomes were detected in the S 0 : 1 generation and increased in subsequent generations, {{despite the fact that the}} mean chromosome number among lines was approximately 38. The chromosome complement of individual plants (segregants) ranged from 36 to 42, with a bias toward the accumulation of extra chromosomes. Karyotype analysis of the S 10 : 11 generation detected aneuploidy and inter- and intragenomic rearrangements, chromosome breakage and fusion, rDNA changes, and loss of repeat sequences. Chromosome sets with extensive <b>homoeology</b> showed the greatest instability. Dosage balance requirements maintained chromosome numbers at or near the tetraploid level, and the loss and gain of chromosomes frequently involved homoeologous chromosome replacement and compensation. These data indicate that early generations of resynthesized B. napus involved aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangements, and that dosage balance mechanisms enforced chromosome number stability. Seed yield and pollen viability were inversely correlated with increasing aneuploidy, and the greatest fertility was observed in two lines that were additive for parental chromosomes. These data on resynthesized B. napus and the correlation of fertility with additive karyotypes cast light on the origins and establishment of natural B. napus...|$|E
40|$|Breeding for fruit quality {{traits in}} {{strawberry}} (Fragaria × ananassa, 2 n = 8 x = 56) is complex {{due to the}} polygenic nature of these traits and the octoploid constitution of this species. In order to improve the efficiency of genotype selection, the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and associated molecular markers will constitute a valuable tool for breeding programs. However, the implementation of these markers in breeding programs depends upon the complexity and stability of QTLs across different environments. In this work, the genetic control of 17 agronomical and fruit quality traits was investigated in strawberry using a F 1 population derived from an intraspecific cross between two contrasting selection lines, ‘ 232 ’ and ‘ 1392 ’. QTL analyses were performed over three successive years based on the separate parental linkage maps and a pseudo-testcross strategy. The integrated strawberry genetic map consists of 338 molecular markers covering 37 linkage groups, thus exceeding the 28 chromosomes. 33 QTLs were identified for 14 of the 17 studied traits and approximately 37 % of them were stable over time. For each trait, 1 – 5 QTLs were identified with individual effects ranging between 9. 2 and 30. 5 % of the phenotypic variation, indicating that all analysed traits are complex and quantitatively inherited. Many QTLs controlling correlated traits were co-located in <b>homoeology</b> group V, indicating linkage or pleiotropic effects of loci. Candidate genes for several QTLs controlling yield, anthocyanins, firmness and l-ascorbic acid are proposed based on both their co-localization and predicted function. We also report conserved QTLs among strawberry and other Rosaceae based on their syntenic location. status: publishe...|$|E

The addition of each chromosome of B. oleracea to the chromosome complement of B. rapa {{results in a}} series of monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs). Analysis of MAALs determines which B. oleracea chromosomes carry genes controlling specific phenotypic traits, such as seed colour. Yellow-seeded oilseed rape is a desirable breeding goal both for food and livestock feed end-uses that relate to oil, protein and fibre contents. The aims of this study included developing a missing MAAL to complement an available series, for studies on seed colour control, chromosome <b>homoeology</b> and assignment of linkage groups to B. oleracea chromosomes. MethodsA new batch of B. rapaB. oleracea aneuploids was produced to generate the missing MAAL. Seed colour and other plant morphological features relevant to differentiation of MAALs were recorded. For chromosome characterization, Snows carmine, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) were used. Key ResultsThe final MAAL was developed. Morphological traits that differentiated the MAALs comprised cotyledon number, leaf morphology, flower colour and seed colour. Seed colour was controlled by major genes on two B. oleracea chromosomes and minor genes on five other chromosomes of this species. Homoeologous pairing was largely between chromosomes with similar centromeric positions. FISH, GISH and a parallel microsatellite marker analysis defined the chromosomes in terms of their linkage groups. ConclusionsA complete set of MAALs is now available for genetic, genomic, evolutionary and breeding perspectives. Defining chromosomes that carry specific genes, physical localization of DNA markers and access to established genetic linkage maps contribute to the integration of these approaches, manifested in the confirmed correspondence of linkage groups with specific chromosomes.

40|$|Abstract only availableThere is {{a growing}} concern of the {{possible}} transgenic introgression from GM plants into agricultural weeds, which has stimulated research in the process of crop to weed gene flow. Crop to weed gene flow often involves the hybridization of a polyploidy crop to a diploid weed. An example is canola (Brassica napus with AACC genomes) which can hybridize with B. rapa (AA) to produce fertile triploid F 1 hybrids (ACC) in the wild. It is hypothesized that there are "safe sites" on the C genome because the C genome is likely to be lost from wild populations after a few generations of repeated backcrossing with B. rapa. However, there is <b>homoeology</b> between the A and C genomes of Brassica, which allows potential recombination between genomes and the movement of transgenes from the C to A genomes by chromosomal rearrangements. Recent advances in molecular markers and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) now allow us to observe the frequency of homoeologous exchanges following hybridization. Our research is focused on finding safe sites within the B. napus genome which are least likely to be transferred into B. napus and B. rapa hybrids and their progeny. To test this, we have crossed a transgenic B. napus with a natural B. rapa three times to make three different F 1 events. Then we backcrossed each of the three F 1 three times with B. rapa. We are measuring the germination rate of each generation and using transgene specific PCR primers to check {{the presence or absence of}} the transgene in hybrids. We will also use molecular cytogenetics (FISH) to count chromosome numbers. This study will help determine the possibilities of a "safe" site in B. napus and offer insight in the mechanisms of crop to weed transgene introgression in B. napus x B. rapa hybrids.

40|$|The Lr 62 /Yr 42 {{translocation}} comprises mostly allen chromatin and retains {{only the}} very distal end of wheat chromosome arm 6 AL, including the telomere. The {{large amount of}} foreign chromatin prohibits commercial use of the resistance and an attempt was therefore made to exchange some of the introgressed chromatin for wheat chromatin. Plants heterozygous for the translocation, but lacking the Ph 1 locus were testcrossed with Chinese Spring nullisomic 6 A tetrasomic 6 B or nullisomic 6 A tetrasomic 6 D plants. Resistant (Lr 62) testcross F 1 progeny were evaluated {{for the presence of}} three marker loci and the data used to do a three-point genetic mapping analysis. Forty one recombinants were identified and characterised with further markers. The data revealed that Lr 62 /Yr 42 occurs towards the distal end of 6 AS and that the 6 AS telomeres of the wheat and translocation chromosomes were homoeologous. While the wheat (Chinese Spring ph 1 b mutant) and translocated chromosomes 6 A shared sufficient <b>homoeology</b> to allow for regular allosyndetic recombination, there were also major structural differences between them, including a duplication (marked by Xgwm 334) and translocation (marked by XsopwT). The duplicated region occurred on chromosome 6 A of the CS ph 1 b mutant and probably resulted from its inherent genomic instability. The structural differences caused irregular meiotic pairing and complex segregation data that were difficult to interpret. It was, however, possible to explain the majority of recombination products in keeping with the expected low frequency of allosyndetic recombination, and to identify the most promising recombinants. These retained both Lr 62 and Yr 42 within a comparatively small region of foreign DNA at the 6 AS telomere. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Duplicated genes {{created during}} {{polyploid}} formation (2 ̆ 7 homoeologues 2 ̆ 7) may experience {{a variety of}} fates depending upon the evolutionary forces operating on these loci. Homoeologue divergence may be limited if selection operates to maintain duplicate gene function, or divergence may be permitted if selective pressure on a functionally redundant locus is relaxed. In an attempt to determine the fate of duplicate loci in a polyploid genome, I have isolated and described sequence evolution at 15 sets of homoeologous loci from allotetraploid cotton (Gossypium L.) and the corresponding orthologues from its progenitor diploid genomes. <b>Homoeology</b> and orthology relationships of these loci have been demonstrated by in-situ hybridization for the 5 S rDNA array, and by comparative linkage mapping for 12 low-copy anonymous loci and two known cellulose synthase genes, CelA 1 and CelA 2. In combination, these results demonstrate that relaxation of selective pressure (as indicated {{by an increase in}} the substitution rate) at duplicate loci subsequent to polyploidization may be minimal across the majority of loci in this duplicated genome. Ten of these loci (which correspond to mapped anonymous PstI-genomic probes) show rate equivalency between polyploid subgenomes and between subgenomes and their progenitor diploid genomes, indicating that selection continues to limit divergence at these loci. In contrast, the remaining five loci (5 SrDNA, A 1550, A 1713, CelA 1 and CelA 2) show significant rate differences among the genomes tested. Two of these loci (CelA 1 and CelA 2) are known to be preferentially expressed in developing cotton fiber, and they show significantly elevated substitution rates in the D- and A-subgenome lineages, respectively. In addition, CelA 2 from the A-subgenome of G. hirsutum has experienced a marked rate acceleration since polyploidization, and has accumulated a greater than expected number of non-synonymous substitutions without exhibiting the hallmarks of pseudogenization. These results indicate that cellulose synthase A 2 may be responding to directional or diversifying selection, perhaps as a consequence of human-mediated selection upon fiber quality attributes...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell, 2 n = 6 X = 42, AABBDD) {{breeding}} programs aim {{to reorganize}} genotypes to achieve better yields, environmental adaptation and food quality. The necessary interdisciplinarity for breeding purposes requires an accurate {{choice of the}} most appropriate cellular and/or molecular strategies available to be integrated with agronomic approaches in order to overcome the genetic limitation of each cultivated species, at each agroecosystem. Cytogenetics has given a great contribution to wheat genetic studies and breeding, due to viability of chromosomal variants because of <b>homoeology</b> among genomes in this allohexaploid species and the genus Triticum. The level of development of cytogenetic techniques achieved over the last 60 years has set wheat apart from other cereal crops in terms of possibilities to introduce genetic material from other species. Cytogenetic approaches have been extensively used in chromosomal mapping and/or resistance gene transference from tribe Triticeae-related species. Monosomic analysis, entire chromosomes engineered through single additions and/or substitutions, reciprocal translocation through radiation or manipulation of homoeologous pairing, as well as synthesis of new amphiploids to allow homologous recombination by chiasmata evolved considerably since the past decades. The association of tissue culture and molecular biology techniques provides bread wheat breeding programs with a powerful set of biotechnological tools. However, knowledge on genetic system components, cytotaxonomical relationships, cytogenetic structure and evolutionary history of wheat species cannot be neglected. This information indicates the appropriate strategy to avoid isolation mechanisms in interspecific or intergeneric crosses, according to the genome constitution of the species the desired gene is to be transferred from. The development of amphiploids as "bridge" species {{is one of the}} available procedures to facilitate gene flow between wheat and related species. Since the environment at the center of origin of wheat in Southern Asia is quite different from subtropical environments, Brazilian breeding programs overcome more challenges to adapt wheat crop to biotic and abiotic stresses than some other countries. The germplasm bank of Embrapa Trigo has about 1000 registered entries of Triticum relatives, Aegilops, Secale and Agropyron species supplied from several germplasm banks distributed over the world which were multiplied and/or selected for naturally occurring or artificially inoculated fungal diseases. Since Aegilops squarrosa L. entries showed very good performance, the genetic variability observed in this species was firstly exploited. It is reported here the strategy used for transferring useful genes from Ae. squarrosa (DD, 2 n = 14) : crossing with tetraploid species (AABB, 2 n = 28), rescue and in vitro culture of immature embryos for regeneration of the trihaploid (ABD, 2 n = 21) hybrid, and colchicine treatment for genome duplication resulting in the artificial synthesis of hexaploid wheat lines (AABBDD, 2 n = 42). Results of 10, 739 artificial pollinations involving 28 cross combinations amongst eight T. durum L., T. dicoccum and T. cartlicum tetraploid entries used as female parents and ten selected Ae. squarrosa sources of resistance as male parents are presented here. Immature embryos from 18 cross combinations were recovered and cultured in vitro. Green plantlets from 13 combinations were regenerated. Fertile amphiploids were recovered only from crosses among entries of tetraploid T. durum and diploid Ae. squarrosa. They originated 11 fertile synthetic amphiploid lines from seven different combinations. Useful stem and leaf rust as well as powdery mildew resistance for future use in breeding programs were obtained...|$|E
