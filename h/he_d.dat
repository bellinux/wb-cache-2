5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form {{based largely on}} natural law and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced by politics and based on positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao <b>He</b> (<b>d.</b> 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with criminality, while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles {{on the death penalty}} alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law.|$|E
5|$|General-in-Chief He Jin (d.189 AD), {{half-brother}} to Empress <b>He</b> (<b>d.</b> 189 AD), plotted with Yuan Shao (d.202 AD) {{to overthrow}} the eunuchs by having several generals march {{to the outskirts of}} the capital. There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded the eunuchs' execution. After a period of hesitation, Empress He consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother He Miao (何苗) rescind the order. The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22, 189 AD. Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu (d.199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed. Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao (r.189 AD) and his brother Liu Xie—the future Emperor Xian of Han (r. 189–220 AD). While being pursued by the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{system of}} {{imperial}} government borrowed {{many of its}} core features from the regime established by the Qin dynasty. For example, Gaozu's Chancellor Xiao <b>He</b> (<b>d.</b> 193 BC) integrated much of the statutes of the Qin law code into the newly compiled Han law code. Yet Gaozu's establishment of central control over {{only a third of}} the empire—the other two-thirds of territory was controlled by semi-autonomous kingdoms—strayed from Qin's imperial model which gave the emperor direct control over all of China. However, a series of reforms eventually stripped away any vestiges of the kingdoms' independence. Han emperors thereafter enjoyed full and direct control over China, as had the first Qin emperor. The Han court's gradual move towards reestablishing central control can also be seen in its monetary policy. While the Qin regime installed a nationwide standard currency, the early Western Han regime oscillated between abolishing and legalizing private mints, commandery-level mints, and kingdom-level mints issuing various coins. In 113 BC the Han court finally established the central government's monopoly control over the issuance of a standard, nationwide currency.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress <b>He</b> (<b>d.</b> 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E

Shortly after Empress He's son Liu Bian, known later as Emperor Shao of Han, {{was put on the}} throne, the eunuch Jian Shi plotted against He Jin, was discovered, and executed on May 27, 189 CE; He Jin thus took over Jian's Army of the Western Garden. Yuan Shao (d. 202 CE), then an officer in the Army of the Western Garden, plotted with He Jin to overthrow the eunuchs by secretly ordering several generals to march towards the capital and forcefully persuade the Empress Dowager He to hand over the eunuchs. Yuan had these generals send in petition after petition to the Empress Dowager calling for the eunuchs' dismissal; Mansvelt Beck states that this [...] "psychological war" [...] finally broke the Empress Dowager's will and she consented. However, the eunuchs discovered this and used Empress Dowager He's mother Lady Wuyang and her brother He Miao (何苗), both of whom were sympathetic to the eunuchs, to have the order rescinded. On September 22, the eunuchs learned that He Jin had a private conversation with the Empress Dowager about executing them. They sent message to He Jin that the Empress Dowager had more words to share with him; once he sat down in the hall to meet her, eunuchs rushed out of hiding and beheaded He Jin. When the eunuchs ordered the imperial secretaries to draft an edict dismissing Yuan Shao, the former asked for He Jin's permission, so the eunuchs showed them He Jin's severed head.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, I {{worked as}} {{the radio station}} {{engineer}} due to my new FCC Radio telephone First Class license having just graduated from the don martin audio and TV school, Hollywood on the GI bill. plus I was the only announcer. {{the rest of the}} staff, Radio Station Manager, Salesman, and other staff members were all let go. My duties were to change the tape reels and put new 45 rpm little top 40 records into an automated jute box wired to the console. As I recall it had lots of blue tubes lighting the rack of controls in a huge tall locker. This was my first job just out of the Army, as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio & TV. So {{it was a big deal}} to me. I enjoyed giving the call letters KDOT each morning and reading the news live on the air however all the music was on automated tape. Sadly we had very few sponsors and thus hardly any commercials. Sadly the Schafer radio station was,owned by the Schafer company,which was out of town in California not Reno Nevada. The job only lasted a few months station was going broke. Soon the station closed due to money problems. However Mr. Schafer phoned me to try and stay on the air as <b>he</b> <b>d</b> he would try to get the funds to keep the station going but it was already to late. The local Power company in Reno shut of the current to the transmitter (the antenna was some way out of town) [...] When I left the front door was locked (no rear exit) and I returned to LA by auto. Driving out of town the music was still on the car radio but slowly faded out as I drove along the highway. The good news is; I soon worked at another radio station in Santa Monica, Ca that used the same Schafer automation system but was owned by other private party's the call letters were KSRF FM. This was over 50 years ago.|$|E
