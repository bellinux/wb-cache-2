5|$|Born into an upper-middle-class <b>family,</b> <b>Van</b> Gogh drew as a {{child and}} was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became {{depressed}} after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-February 2010, WikiLeaks {{received}} a leaked diplomatic cable from the United States Embassy in Reykjavik {{relating to the}} Icesave scandal, which they published on 18 February. The cable, known as Reykjavik 13, {{was the first of}} the classified documents WikiLeaks published among those allegedly provided to them by United States Army Private Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley).
