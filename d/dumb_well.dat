There was also a display from the astronomical department of the Lick Observatory. The manufactures division featured many displays from the Columbian Exhibition in Chicago. The ethnology/archaeology division featured models, statues, inventions, and weapons from thirty-eight different locations on the globe. It was used as a store for commercial goods, with imports from across the globe. The building was the largest building in the fair, and considered the largest building in California at the time.|$|R

I said 'Yes,' to that; and asked him whether the fall had had {{anything}} to do with it. He said, taking me up very short, it had everything to do with it, because the fall had made her, what they call, stone deaf, which prevented her from hearing the sound of her own voice. So it was changed, he told me, because she had no ear now to guide herself by in speaking, and couldn't know in the least whether the few words she said were spoken soft or loud, or deep or clear.

5000|$|In 2002 an {{animated}} movie premiered entitled Tytus, Romek i A’tomek wśród złodziei marzeń (Tytus, Romek and A’Tomek Among the Thieves of Dreams). The film features {{one of the}} most acclaimed Polish actors Marek Kondrat as the voice of Tytus and was directed by Leszek Gałysz. The movie wasn’t based on any of the comic books and it had an original plot. Critical response was generally negative. Many fans criticized the movie for lacking the humour and the spirit of the original material, as <b>well</b> <b>dumbing</b> down the characters for the younger children and focusing too much on the main villain Prince Saligia (who wasn't character from the original stories) pushing Romek and A'tomek to the roles of secondary characters 1. Colonel Sanders makes a cameo in this movie as KFC was one of main sponsors of the production.|$|R

25|$|During {{operations}} in the Nahr el-Bared camp in North Lebanon, lacking any airworthy, fixed-wing strike aircraft, the Lebanese Army modified several UH-1H Huey helicopters to permit the carrying of 500pound Mark 82 and 1000pound Mark 83 bombs (all unguided iron bombs, also known as <b>dumb</b> bombs) as <b>well</b> as Matra SNEB 68mm rocket pods (taken from stored Hawker Hunters). Special mounting pads engineered by the Lebanese Army were attached to each Huey on the sides and belly to carry the bombs. The air force, {{in collaboration with the}} engineering regiment, developed and used two dumb bomb variants, the 250kg LAF-GS-ER2 and the 400kg LAF-GS-ER3. Usually, helicopters cannot bomb using this method, in comparison to ground attack aircraft, so this became one of the rare moments in history during which helicopters were used in such a way. The Lebanese Army also made extensive use of Aérospatiale Gazelles armed with Euromissile HOT anti-tank guided missiles and machine gun pods.|$|R

2500|$|There {{were also}} claims that certain cunning folk {{were known to}} {{occasionally}} perform bewitching or cursing for a fee, which under some definitions {{would enable them to}} be considered to be witches as well as cunning people. The folklorist Eric Maple, after examining several nineteenth-century cunning folk in Essex, noted that one of them, George Pickingill, also performed cursing for clients, but that the other whom he examined, James Murrell, considered it immoral and so did not. Indeed, other Essex cunning folk were associated with witchcraft, notable in the village of Sible Hedingham, where there lived an elderly French cunning man who had had his tongue cut out at some point in his past, and who was subsequently <b>dumb,</b> as <b>well</b> as being deaf. As a result he was known as [...] "Dummy" [...] in the local community, who generally disliked him, largely because of his 'otherness' in being both foreign and disabled, and rumours spread that he was a witch who would curse them. In 1863 a drunken mob attacked him, throwing him in a river to see if he would sink or float (a traditional method of identifying a witch, who it was believed would float, whereas an innocent would sink), but the resulting shock killed the elderly man, who was in his eighties. Another notable case of a cunning person performing cursing and malevolent witchcraft comes from nineteenth-century Norwich, where a wise woman who went by the pseudonym of [...] "Virtue" [...] used to demand gifts from her neighbours, threatening them with cursing if they refused.|$|R
60|$|After {{having written}} so far, Don Martin Decoud, the exotic dandy of the Parisian boulevard, {{got up and}} walked across the sanded floor of the cafe {{at one end of the}} Albergo of United Italy, kept by Giorgio Viola, the old {{companion}} of Garibaldi. The highly coloured lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly, in the light of one candle, at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations. Looking out of the window, Decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town, nor yet the buildings near the harbour; and there was not a sound, as if the tremendous obscurity of the Placid Gulf, spreading from the waters over the land, had made it <b>dumb</b> as <b>well</b> as blind. Presently Decoud felt a light tremor of the floor and a distant clank of iron. A bright white light appeared, deep in the darkness, growing bigger with a thundering noise. The rolling stock usually kept on the sidings in Rincon was being run back to the yards for safe keeping. Like a mysterious stirring of the darkness behind the headlight of the engine, the train passed in a gust of hollow uproar, by the end of the house, which seemed to vibrate all over in response. And nothing was clearly visible but, on the end of the last flat car, a negro, in white trousers and naked to the waist, swinging a blazing torch basket incessantly with a circular movement of his bare arm. Decoud did not stir.|$|R

'I've been a little too sudden in telling you the worst, haven't I?' says the old gentleman kindly; 'but you must be taught how to {{make up your mind}} to meet the full extent of this misfortune {{for the sake of the}} child, whose future comfort and happiness depend greatly on you.' And then he bid me keep up her reading and writing, and force her to use her voice as much as I could, by every means in my power. He told me I should find her grow more and more unwilling to speak every day, just for the shocking reason that she couldn't hear a single word she said, or a single tone of her own voice. He warned me that she was already losing the wish and the want to speak; and that it would very soon be little short of absolute pain to her to be made to say even a few words; but he begged and prayed me not to let my good nature get the better of my prudence on that account, and not to humor her, however I might feel tempted to do so--for if I did, she would be <b>dumb</b> as <b>well</b> as deaf most certainly. He told me my own common sense would show me the reason why; but I suppose I was too distressed or too stupid to understand things as I ought. He had to explain it to me in so many words, that if she wasn't constantly exercised in speaking, she would lose her power of speech altogether, for want of practice--just the same as if she'd been born dumb. 'So, once again,' says he, 'mind you make her use her voice. Don't give her her dinner, unless she asks for it. Treat her severely in that way, poor little soul, because it's for her own good.' ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel Speaker Verification (SV) architecture that minimises {{many of the}} challenging problems faced by SV implementors in the Card Security arena. The architecture is unusual in two respects. First, the verification engine is not fed with conventional frequency-domain descriptors. Instead the output of a Time-Encoded Signal Processing and Recognition (TESPAR) coder is used. The TESPAR coder is a low-complexity, vector quantiser capable of converting the speech waveform into a highly informative set of time-domain descriptors. A simple 29 -element matrix representation of TESPAR descriptors is described which, when {{used in conjunction with}} a Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN), provides a wide degree of cross-speaker separation and strong same-speaker consistency [1]. The paper focuses on a novel SV engine that secures a robust verification performance by encoding the classification power of 100 orthogonal artificial neural networks into a biometric of only 40 bytes, offering a high level of protection to low-tech <b>Dumb</b> Cards as <b>well</b> as to state-of-the-art Smart-Card embodiments. The architectural rationale that enables this is presented, together with indications that a final verification decision can be delivered in under 1 second.

60|$|Needless to {{say what}} {{distress}} was the unfortunate man's, when, engaged in conversation with company, he would suddenly perceive his Goneril bestowing her mysterious touches, especially in such cases where the strangeness of the thing seemed to strike upon the touched person, notwithstanding good-breeding forbade his proposing the mystery, on the spot, as a subject of discussion for the company. In these cases, too, the unfortunate man could never endure so much as to look upon the touched young gentleman afterwards, fearful of the mortification of meeting in his countenance some kind of more or less quizzingly-knowing expression. He would shudderingly shun the young gentleman. So that here, to the husband, Goneril's touch had the dread operation of the heathen taboo. Now Goneril brooked no chiding. So, at favorable times, he, in a wary manner, and not indelicately, would venture in private interviews gently to make distant allusions to this questionable propensity. She divined him. But, in her cold loveless way, said it was witless to be telling one's dreams, especially foolish ones; but if the unfortunate man liked connubially to rejoice his soul with such chimeras, much connubial joy might they give him. All this was sad--a touching case--but all might, perhaps, have been borne by the unfortunate man--conscientiously mindful of his vow--for better or for worse--to love and cherish his dear Goneril so long as kind heaven might spare her to him--but when, after all that had happened, the devil of jealousy entered her, a calm, clayey, cakey devil, for none other could possess her, and the object of that deranged jealousy, her own child, a little girl of seven, her father's consolation and pet; when he saw Goneril artfully torment the little innocent, and then play the maternal hypocrite with it, the unfortunate man's patient long-suffering gave way. Knowing that she would neither confess nor amend, and might, possibly, become even worse than she was, he thought it but duty as a father, to withdraw the child from her; but, loving it as he did, he could not do so without accompanying it into domestic exile himself. Which, hard though it was, he did. Whereupon the whole female neighborhood, who till now had little enough admired dame Goneril, broke out in indignation against a husband, who, without assigning a cause, could deliberately abandon the wife of his bosom, and sharpen the sting to her, too, by depriving her of the solace of retaining her offspring. To all this, self-respect, with Christian charity towards Goneril, long kept the unfortunate man <b>dumb.</b> And <b>well</b> had it been had he continued so; for when, driven to desperation, he hinted something of {{the truth of the}} case, not a soul would credit it; while for Goneril, she pronounced all he said to be a malicious invention. Ere long, at the suggestion of some woman's-rights women, the injured wife began a suit, and, thanks to able counsel and accommodating testimony, succeeded in such a way, as not only to recover custody of the child, but to get such a settlement awarded upon a separation, as to make penniless the unfortunate man (so he averred), besides, through the legal sympathy she enlisted, effecting a judicial blasting of his private reputation. What made it yet more lamentable was, that the unfortunate man, thinking that, before the court, his wisest plan, as well as the most Christian besides, being, as he deemed, not at variance with the truth of the matter, would be to put forth the plea of the mental derangement of Goneril, which done, he could, with less of mortification to himself, and odium to her, reveal in self-defense those eccentricities which had led to his retirement from the joys of wedlock, had much ado in the end to prevent this charge of derangement from fatally recoiling upon himself--especially, when, among other things, he alleged her mysterious teachings. In vain did his counsel, striving to make out the derangement to be where, in fact, if anywhere, it was, urge that, to hold otherwise, to hold that such a being as Goneril was sane, this was constructively a libel upon womankind. Libel be it. And all ended by the unfortunate man's subsequently getting wind of Goneril's intention to procure him to be permanently committed for a lunatic. Upon which he fled, and was now an innocent outcast, wandering forlorn in the great valley of the Mississippi, with a weed on his hat for the loss of his Goneril; for he had lately seen by the papers that she was dead, and thought it but proper to comply with the prescribed form of mourning in such cases. For some days past he had been trying to get money enough to return to his child, and was but now started with inadequate funds.|$|R
