2500|$|According to Strawson, if one <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{what one}} does {{in a given}} situation, then one must <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>is</b> in certain mental respects. But it is {{impossible}} <b>for</b> one to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>is</b> in any respect. This is because to <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> in some situation S, one must have <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>was</b> at S−1. To <b>be</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>was</b> at S−1, one must have <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> way one <b>was</b> at S−2, and so on. At {{some point in the}} chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ex nihilo. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view [...] "pessimism" [...] but it can be classified as hard incompatibilism.|$|R
