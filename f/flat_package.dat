60|$|A week or {{two after}} this, when I arrived at home one afternoon, my wife {{told me that there}} was a present for me in the dining-room. As such things were not common, I hurried in to see what it was. I found a very large <b>flat</b> <b>package,</b> tied up in brown paper, and on it a card with my name and a long inscription. The latter was to the effect that my {{associates}} of the Hook and Ladder Company, desirous of testifying their gratitude to the originator and promoter of the raffle scheme, took pleasure in presenting him with the accompanying work of art, which, when hung upon the walls of his house, would be a perpetual reminder to him of the great and good work he had done for the Association.|$|E

Of course I said yes, whereon he produced out of one of his cases a <b>flat</b> <b>package</b> about two feet six square. He undid the grass mats in which it was wrapped, striped, delicately woven mats such as they make in the neighbourhood of Zanzibar. Within these was the lid of a packing-case. Then came more mats and some copies of The Cape Journal spread out flat. Then sheets of blotting paper, and last of all between two pieces of cardboard, a flower and one leaf of the plant on which it grew.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{countries}} have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure {{products from the}} legislation. [...] However, {{this may be a}} moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as Quad <b>Flat</b> <b>Packages</b> (QFP), Small Outline Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and Small outline packages (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as Ball grid arrays (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{we develop}} {{analytical}} stress {{models for the}} evaluation of thermally induced bows in the following two types of plastic packages: thin elongated packages with large chips, known as thin small outline packages (TSOPs), and high lead count large square packages with relatively small chips, known as plastic quad <b>flat</b> <b>packages</b> (PQFPs). In the case of TSOP packages, we consider the package warpage caused by the thermal contraction mismatch of the constituent materials: silicon chip, metal leadframe, and molding compound. The temperature change is assumed to be the same throughout the package. In the case of PQFP packages, we evaluate the bow due to the temperature gradient (non-uniform distribution of temperature) in the through-thickness direction of the molded body The developed models enable one to evaluate the effect of the package geometry and materials properties on its bow, and more importantly, to design a plastic package with a sufficiently low residual warpage. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand on miniaturized and <b>flat</b> <b>packaging</b> technologies {{is driven by}} the trend towards small and portable electronic systems. Due to the requirements of modern Ball Grid Arrays, Smart Cards or Chip Size Packages thickness of integrated circuits has been reduced considerably compared with original wafer thickness. Driven by this evolution, the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration has advanced its wafer thinning technology down to a residual silicon thickness of 20 µm and below. Because of low height, low topography of assembled chips and mechanical flexibility, these chips are ideal for integration in thin and bendable systems or vertically stacked systems. The advantages of thin ICs open a large field of new and interesting applications in microelectronics. However wafer thinning has its impact on subsequent assembly process. Dicing, handling, mounting and interconnection processes of thin ICs has to fulfil particular requirements, but also offers new and innovative solutions. These are investigated and discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Eutectic tin {{lead was}} {{the most widely used}} solder {{interconnect}} in the electronics industry before the adoption of lead-free legislation. But eutectic tin lead solder has a low melting point (183 o C) and was not suited for some high temperature applications, such as oil and gas exploration, automotive, and defense. Hence, for these applications, the electronics industry had to rely on specialized solders. In this study, ball grid arrays (BGAs), quad <b>flat</b> <b>packages</b> (QFPs), and surface mount resistors assembled with SAC 305 and Sn 3. 5 Ag solder pastes were subjected to thermal cycling from - 40 o C to 185 o C.

A durability assessment was performed featuring thermal cycling ranges of - 40 to 185 °C and - 40 to 200 °C intermixed with 50 G vibration cycling to determine the most durable solder alloy. Failure analysis was performed to understand the durability results. Finally, shear testing was performed to determine a correlation between shear strength and durability.
