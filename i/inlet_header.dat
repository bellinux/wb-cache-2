The boiler transfers energy to the water by the chemical reaction of burning some type of fuel. The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum. Once the water enters the steam drum it goes down the downcomers to the lower <b>inlet</b> waterwall <b>headers.</b> From the <b>inlet</b> <b>headers</b> the water rises through the waterwalls and is eventually turned into steam due to the heat being generated by the burners located {{on the front and}} rear waterwalls (typically). As the water is turned into steam/vapor in the waterwalls, the steam/vapor once again enters the steam drum. The steam/vapor is passed through a series of steam and water separators and then dryers inside the steam drum.

A commercial computational fluid dynamics code, FLUENT 5. 4, was used to numerically simulate individual and pairs of passages as well as sections of an <b>inlet</b> <b>header</b> and heat-exchanger core. The one- and two passage models show that the four representative manufacturing defects do not have a large impact on overall effectiveness, even when the defects are quite large relative to the passage dimensions. The core and header sections showed that the basic header contour and the angle of the incoming flow as well as the pressure drop through the core {{have a significant impact on}} the flow distribution. Small variations in the header dimensions and the core/header aspect ratio have little effect on the effectiveness. Decreasing the angle the incoming flow turns through and increasing the pressure drop through the core both create a more even flow distribution through the heat exchanger, hence increasing its effectiveness. by Charles Booten.

In this work, 16 tubes are connected between the inlet and the exit headers forming the heat exchanger.

The structural integrity of such critical components is essential for operational safety, reliability and economic plant operation. Boiler headers and high energy pipings operating at high temperatures and pressure are subjected to different degradation mechanisms synergistically. A finite-element analysis based real-time monitoring system for four 210 MW units of a power station of NTPC Ltd. is evaluating creep and fatigue usage factors being accrued in the components. The candidate components under 24 x 7 assessments are super-heater-outlet-header, re-heater outlet and <b>inlet</b> <b>headers,</b> and the piping bends before the control valves of intermediate pressure turbine of each unit. The cyclic stresses with a mean stress at an elevated temperature lead to a damage mechanism due to creep, fatigue and creep fatigue interaction.

The system evaluates the material temperature, stress and usage factors due to creep, fatigue and creep-fatigue interaction and computes the remaining life fraction in all the components.

The paper presents the phenomenon of periodically reversing flow in a microchannel evaporators used in air conditioning systems which will be illustrated with high speed videos in the presentation. These evaporators have multiple parallel channels between 0. 5 and 1 mm and headers (manifolds) that have to accommodate tubes of typically 15 to 25 mm major (width). A simultaneous flow visualizations and pressure measurements confirmed the periodic flow reversal and associated fluctuations. The oscillatory behavior of the flow is linked and related with oscillations of the evaporator pressure in the <b>inlet</b> <b>header</b> and the pressure drop. Visualization of the flow in headers and tubes will be presented.

The magnitude and frequency of oscillations are directly proportional to heat flux. Three potential impacts of flow reversal on evaporator performance are discussed: 1) moderate liquid maldistribution; 2) reduced heat transfer; 3) increased refrigerant side pressure drop.

40|$|Computational fluid {{mechanics}} {{is still a}} developing art in the prediction of erosion/corrosion often {{due to lack of}} suitable mathematical models to represent physical processes. In the present work, new flow modelling strategies have been developed for flow simulation in the <b>inlet</b> <b>header</b> of side entry shell and tube heat exchangers used in alumina plants and minerals processing plants for heat recovery. The traditional approach of treating the tube bundle as a porous plug observing Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s friction law has been replaced by modelling of all tubes individually and application of an inertial model for flow resistance. This better reflects the much higher velocities for the approach into the tube bundle as only about one third of the tube sheet is open area. It also includes the effect of flow separation within the inlet to some tubes which is a flow feature not able to be simulated with the porous plug approach. The traditional use of symmetry for the inlet geometry has been found to suppress the inherent asymmetry found in this flow associated with the large flow expansion from the inlet nozzle to the <b>inlet</b> <b>header</b> space. The results indicate that tube inlet wear is spread across the tube sheet more extensively than indicated by porous plug modelling. The asymmetry of flow uncovered by the new modelling technique leads to less regular wear patterns which may help to explain the difficulty of recognizing clear cut patterns of wear in processing plants. Areas of high angle of flow into tubes, variations of mass flow distributions across tube sheets and a flow component across the geometrical symmetry plane are identified. High flow angles have been found to correlate well with flow separation inside tube entrances where previous studies have shown excessive tube wear to occur. Regions where flow separation within tubes occurs have also been found to correlate well with low static pressure within the tubes downstream of the tube entrances...|$|E

Alternatively, dead-ended anode (DEA) operation may be considered, however this mode causes severe voltage transients {{and loss of}} catalyst support in hydrogen-depleted regions of the active area. Here. ultra-low stoichiometric (ULS) flow conditions that deliver very high hydrogen utilization is considered, however uniform flow distribution is necessary in this case. In order to obtain the flow distribution in the channels and in the <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>headers</b> in the anode, a three-dimensional CFD model is developed based on the finite-element method to solve Stokes equations subject to no-slip boundary conditions on the walls, specified pressure at the inlet and specified flow rate at the exit, which is set to a very low value comparable to the typical rate of nitrogen accumulation in the anode side in order to simulate the ULS flow. Uniformity of the flow distribution between the channels is quantified by means of two performance metrics: (i) the root-mean-square (rms) of the channel average velocities; (ii) the ratio of maximum and minimum values of the channel averages. Effects of geometric parameters, such as the widths of the channels and ribs and the position and lengths of the baffles in the <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>headers</b> are studied.

This heat exchanger is used in automotive applications and uses smaller internal volumes than conventional heat exchangers to perform the same task. Since the cost of refrigerants continues to rise due to the phase out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), internal volume becomes a key design parameter. The model is a one-dimensional, two-fluid model which divides the condenser into several segments and modules. This model accurately predicts the rate of heat transfer and refrigerant pressure drop: the heat transfer was predicted within ?? 10 % of the experiment and the pressure drop was predicted within ?? 30 % {{for the majority of the}} data. More importantly, the model predicts refrigerant inventory within ?? 10 % of the experiments for ninety five percent of the data.

The effects of mass flow maldistribution on microchannel heat exchanger were quantified by using a single port simulation model.

Mass flow maldistribution was investigated by using well-known pressure drop and heat transfer correlations for two-phase flow, selected after comparing with the results obtained by using different correlations.

In this study, the distribution characteristics of C 02, a promising natural refrigerant, were experimentally investigated for a parallel flow evaporator with 10 flat aluminum tubes. The tubes have the length of 1000 mm and each tube has six micro-channels with a diameter of 0. 8 mm. To detect the flow distribution into the tubes, the wall temperatures were measured along the tubes which are heated by flexible electric resistance heating wires. If the mass flow rate in a tube is lower than others, the superheating of the refrigerant would occur earlier in that tube and the corresponding wall temperature become higher.

50|$|The {{design of}} <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>headers</b> used to {{distribute}} {{hot and cold}} fluids in the matrix is much simpler in counter flow regenerators than recuperators. The reason behind this is that both streams flow in different sections for a rotary regenerator and one fluid enters and leaves one matrix {{at a time in}} a fixed-matrix regenerator. Furthermore, flow sectors for hot and cold fluids in rotary regenerators can be designed to optimize pressure drop in the fluids. The matrix surfaces of regenerators also have self-cleaning characteristics, reducing fluid-side fouling and corrosion. Finally properties such as small surface density and counter-flow arrangement of regenerators make it ideal for gas-gas heat exchange applications requiring effectiveness exceeding 85%. The heat transfer coefficient is much lower for gases than for liquids, thus the enormous surface area in a regenerator greatly increases heat transfer.|$|R

40|$|The Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) is a {{pressure}} tube type light water cooled heavy water moderated Boding Water Reactor (BWR) with natural circulation at all power levels It has parallel inter connected loops with 452 boding channels in the Main Heat Transport (MHT) system configuration These multiple (four) interconnected loops influence the Steam Drum (SD) level control adversely Such a behavior {{has not been}} reported in the open literature The M HT configuration has been chosen based on comprehensive overall design requirements and certain Postulated Initiated Events (PIEs) This does not allow the partitioning of the Common Reactor <b>Inlet</b> <b>Header</b> (CRIH If partitioning of the CRIH into four segments is allowed then, it will make each loop independent Then the SD level control problems subside as the unaccounted interaction among the loops is eliminated It has also been observed that the open loop response is stable, non-oscillatory and non diverging for a step change in the feed flow rates A conventional individual 3 element SD level controller cannot account for the highly coupled and interacting behaviors, of the four loops and SD levels To overcome these interactions It is proposed to inter connect all the four steam drums in the liquid and vapor regions respectively The influence of the interconnect configuration and the level controller are studied in detail to find a robust solution The response obtained for unsymmetrical core power disturbances shows that the SD levels do not diverge and quickly settle to the set points assigned with SD interconnect The proposed scheme also works well for most of the PIEs considere...|$|E
40|$|Thermally-induced forces {{developed}} by large transient temperature differences between vertical tubes {{attached to the}} same <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>headers</b> have caused low cycle fatigue failures in tubes in proximity to the weld attaching tube to header in economizers and superheaters of several designs of horizontal gas path (HGP) HRSG, in some cases after {{of the order of}} 102 thermal cycles. Examples from tube temperature measurements recorded by thermocouples attached to many superheater, reheater and economizer tubes of HGP HRSGs of differing designs are provided to illustrate the large differences in temperature that can occur transiently during startups and shutdowns, {{and in the case of}} economizers also during normal operation. Generic root causes of large differences in temperature of tubes intended to remain at closely similar temperatures at all times are discussed, with suggestions how the resultant cyclic thermally-induced stresses at tube attachment to header can be mitigated on existing HRSG installations by minor modifications to equipment and by better-informed operating procedures during startups and shutdowns, and eliminated on new installations by more enlightened design of HRSG and also of balance of plant systems that influence the transient conditions imposed on the HRSG during startup and shutdowns...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate and optimize the performance of 1 kW integrated heat exchanger module for new generations of air cooled heat exchangers. The first objective is to minimize the ratio of the header frontal area to the entire heat exchanger frontal which will help to reduce the header size. The second objective is to minimize the pressure drop for the entire heat exchanger, i. e., inside the <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>headers</b> in addition to pressure drop inside the tubes. A three step approach is proposed. First step involves selecting the header design based on previous header optimization studies and then simulating the header using a new 3 D CFD simulation approach. Second step includes solving the heat exchanger using information from the header simulation that accounts for the variation in refrigerant mass flow rate inside the tubes and obtain the performance for the entire heat exchanger. Finally, a solver is used to evaluate the overall module performance. Three different headers are investigated with different header height and size ratio. Then parametric studies are conducted to explore the effect of header size ratio on the optimum designs. Lastly, design guidelines to optimize the integrated heat exchange module are provided based on the study results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{primary heat}} {{transport}} system {{of a typical}} CANDU®- 6 nuclear power reactor contains 760 feeder pipes. These feeders carry the coolant between the <b>inlet</b> or outlet <b>headers</b> and the individual fuel channels. Inspection requirements that developed in feeders in the 1990 ’s led to rapid development of NDE technology to evaluate feeder integrity. The NDE technology {{had to deal with}} the complex and variable geometry of feeders and access constraints inherent in feeder inspections. The first feeder inspection requirement was ability to detect Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC). This led to an evolution in wall thickness measurement techniques for feeders that is continuing. The leading edge technique for wall thickness measurement is the METAR Crawler that scans feeder bends with 14 wall thickness probes. This system uses motors to push the bracelet along the feeder bend. Second, cracking was detected in a feeder in 1997. This led to development of a specialized, manual inspection technique to deal with access problems. This technique has been extended to use a Hydro Quebec developed drive system to move the probes over a raster scan. The presentation will explain feeder degradation modes and the NDE developed to evaluate feeder integrity. Introduction: The primary heat transport system of a CANDU- 6 nuclear power reactor contains 760 feeder pipes. Feeders are made of A 106 B steel. These feeders carry the coolant, heavy water, betwee...|$|R
