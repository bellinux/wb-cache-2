50|$|Titanium in zircon <b>geothermometry</b> {{is a form}} of a <b>geothermometry</b> {{technique}} {{by which}} the crystallization temperature of a zircon crystal can be estimated by the amount of titanium atoms which can only be found in the crystal lattice. In zircon crystals, titanium is commonly incorporated, replacing similarly charged zirconium and silicon atoms. This process is relatively unaffected by pressure and highly temperature dependent, with the amount of titanium incorporated rising exponentially with temperature, making this an accurate <b>geothermometry</b> method. This measurement of titanium in zircons can be used to estimate the cooling temperatures of the crystal and infer conditions during which it crystallized. Compositional changes in the crystals growth rings can be used to estimate the thermodynamic history of the entire crystal. This method is useful as it can be combined with radiometric dating techniques that are commonly used with zircon crystals (see zircon geochronology), to correlate quantitative temperature measurements with specific absolute ages. This technique can be used to estimate early Earth conditions, determine metamorphic facies, or to determine the source of detrital zircons, among other uses.|$|E
50|$|Geothermobarometry is {{the science}} of {{measuring}} the previous pressure and temperature history of a metamorphic or intrusive igneous rocks.

50|$|Titanium in zircon <b>geothermometry</b> is {{considered}} to be a relatively reliable and accurate method of determining crystallization temperatures of zircons, with an error of only 10-16 degrees Celsius. However, there are several limitations and assumptions used in this technique that increase the margin of error.|$|E
5000|$|Metamorphic {{temperatures}} {{were determined}} {{based upon the}} measured oxygen fugacity, using the two-pyroxene and olivine-spinel <b>geothermometry</b> methods. The two-pyroxene approach yielded temperatures between 865 °C - 900 °C, whilst the olivine-spinel approach yielded a temperature of 705 °C. These results {{are very similar to}} the H6 Kernouvé implying both samples experienced similar metamorphic temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Titanium in zircon <b>geothermometry</b> {{can be used}} in zircons {{found in}} {{metamorphic}} rocks to estimate the pressure and temperatures conditions during metamorphism. This helps identify the metamorphic facies and thus the geologic setting of a rock formation. It can also be used in sedimentary rocks to help determine the source of detrital minerals. However, these crystals may sometimes be contaminated by external titanium seeping into fractures.|$|E
50|$|Using this technique, the {{crystallization}} {{temperatures of}} zircons {{can be estimated}} to estimate the cooling temperature of the crystal. <b>Geothermometry</b> techniques like this can provide evidence for changes in temperature in various environments, the thermodynamic evolution of rocks, the gradual change in the geothermal gradient over geologic time, and determine provenance of detrital sediments. Coupled with geochronology techniques that measure using radiometric decay to age date a rock, such as with U/Pb decay, these paleotemperature measurements can be paired with an absolute age {{in order to determine}} temperature changes over time.|$|E
50|$|Titanium in zircon <b>geothermometry</b> has so {{far been}} used in igneous rocks to {{estimate}} cooling temperatures of magma from zircon crystals dated to the Hadean age (>4.0 Ga). Low crystallization temperatures from zircons of this age suggests the Hadean Earth contained liquid water, which reduced the cooling temperature of crustal materials. Potentially, Ti-in-zircon thermometry of Earth's oldest zircons can show the progressive heat loss from a magmatic Hadean Earth to the onset of plate tectonics as the planet's crust began to cool and underwent plastic deformation. This will provide previously unknown evidence for the conditions in early Earth and allow testing of ideas of how the planet evolved through the Hadean and Archean eons.|$|E

30|$|The {{determination}} of reservoir temperatures represents a major task when exploring geothermal systems. Since {{the uncertainties of}} classical solute <b>geothermometry</b> are still preventing reliable reservoir temperature estimations, we assess the performance of classical geothermometers and multicomponent <b>geothermometry</b> by applying them to fluids composed from long-term batch-type equilibration experiments and to fluids from natural geothermal springs in the Villarrica area, Southern Chile. The experiments, weathering two reservoir rock analogues from the Villarrica area, highlight a strong impact of reservoir rock composition on the fluid chemistry and, consequently, on calculated in situ temperatures. Especially temperatures calculated from classical solute <b>geothermometry</b> are strongly affected. Multicomponent <b>geothermometry</b> is obviously more robust and independent from rock composition leading to significantly smaller temperature spreads. In a sensitivity analysis, the dilution of geothermal fluid with surficial water, the pH and the aluminum concentration are anticipated to be the factors causing underestimations of reservoir temperatures. We quantify these parameters and correct the results to obtain realistic in situ conditions. Thus, enabling {{the application of the}} method also on basis of standard fluid analysis, our approach represents an easy-to-use modification of the original multicomponent <b>geothermometry</b> leading to very plausible subsurface temperatures with significantly low scattering.|$|E
30|$|The {{determination}} of in situ temperatures by multicomponent <b>geothermometry,</b> {{is based on}} the calculation of the saturation indices (SI = log(Q/K)) for a suite of possible (reservoir) rock minerals in a conceivable temperature interval. Based on a complete fluid analysis, an equilibrium temperature (temperature for which SI =  0) for each considered mineral phase is obtained. In contrast to classical solute <b>geothermometry,</b> the results represent a temperature distribution in which the fluid has been equilibrated with the host rock minerals. This enables the calculation of a mean in situ temperature from the bandwidth of obtained equilibration temperatures and gives insight on the uncertainty of this estimation (maximum spread of temperatures). From that point of view, multicomponent <b>geothermometry</b> can be considered as a statistical approach to predict reservoir temperatures and therefore it might be more applicable for the evaluation of systems with unknown mineralogy, which is often the case especially in early stages of geothermal exploration campaigns.|$|E
40|$|AbstractReactive {{transport}} simulations {{were used}} to examine the chemical evolution of deep geothermal fluids as they ascend to the surface, and to assess constraints on the application of solute geothermometers. Al and Mg concentrations of deep fluids are sensitive to precipitation-dissolution processes, affecting reservoir temperatures estimated with multicomponent <b>geothermometry.</b> The concentrations of major elements such as Na, K, and SiO 2 are less sensitive to reequilibration, and thus geothermometers based on these elements are often reliable, but fail when dilution or mixing with saline waters occurs. For these cases, multicomponent <b>geothermometry</b> coupled with optimization provides a more reliable approach to reconstruct the fluid composition at depth and estimate reservoir temperatures...|$|E

Recent studies of clays in 60 drillcores from 6 wells at Wairakei, for example, show an inverse relationship between reservoir temperatures and crystallinities from 90 ° to 225 °C (195 to 435 °F) (Kübler Indices: 1. 40 to 0. 44 D ° 2 q).

30|$|In many cases, the {{application}} of different classical solute geothermometer equations leads {{to a wide range}} of calculated temperatures. An important factor interfering consistent calculation are differences in reservoir rock composition and their impact on fluid chemistry. Long-term batch equilibration experiments in this study clearly show that reservoir rock composition has a major impact on temperatures calculated by classical solute <b>geothermometry,</b> with variations of > 200 K. In order to overcome the strong dependence upon rock composition, we assess the statistical multicomponent geothermometer approach. Since the original method demands high quality fluid sampling and analysis, we suggest a modification, which can be used also on the basis of standard fluid analysis. Compared to classical solute <b>geothermometry,</b> the resulting calculated equilibration temperatures have a significantly smaller scattering for fluids of plutonic and volcanic origin in the investigated area. It is shown that the pH value and the aluminum concentration are extremely sensitive parameters for the calculation of equilibration temperatures on the basis of multicomponent geothermometers. Thus, as measured values for both parameters can differ significantly from in situ conditions, we suggest applying a correction for the pH and the aluminum concentration prior to temperature determination. In doing so, multicomponent <b>geothermometry</b> leads to more realistic mean temperature estimation with significantly low variances of mostly ≪ 30 K for the natural samples as well as for the experimental fluids. The well-fitting calculations of reaction temperatures for both experiments, reveal a higher independence from reservoir rock composition as compared to classical solute geothermometers. This could make multicomponent <b>geothermometry</b> an ideal complementary approach to classical solute geothermometer methods evaluating subsurface temperatures particularly in unknown lithologies. The general applicability {{to a wide range of}} reservoir rocks has to be proven in the next step. In terms of classical solute <b>geothermometry,</b> we conclude that the impact of reservoir rock composition is of outstanding importance and has to be taken into account in future applications.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{heat flow}} density (HFD) {{estimates}} in the Portuguese northern Hercynian Massif {{are difficult to}} obtain using the usual Fourier method. As a matter of fact, this zone is mostly composed by granitoid and metamorphic rocks, and most wells drilled there are too shallow for reliable HFD calculations; furthermore, HFD estimates are scarce and their geographical distribution is still very irregular. All these conditions imply that a HFD map for this region must be obtained using alternative methods, such as the silica <b>geothermometry</b> method. Under certain conditions, the use of silica geothermometers to estimate HFD in mineral waters {{has proved to be}} an effective way to understand and establish the thermal regime in areas with scarce conventional HFD determinations. Because temperatures obtained with silica <b>geothermometry</b> are related to deep thermal conditions in the crust and to water-rock equilibrium, a regional HFD analysis may be carried out using those temperatures. The silica geothermometer, developed by Truesdell in 1976 (Truesdell, 1976), give good results for low SiO 2 concentrations, which is the case for the Portuguese northern Hercynian Massif, and is applied to more than 30 samples of mineral water occurrences reported for the zone. This number of samples, even though small, is considerably higher and more evenly distributed than conventional HFD estimates for the same area. Application of silica <b>geothermometry</b> to northern Hercynian Massif waters shows a discrete reservoir temperature zoning, ranging from about 45 ºC, in its southwest limit, to more than 120 ºC, towards its northeast limit. Using temperatures obtained by silica <b>geothermometry</b> and heat flow density values calculated through the conventional method in an area of 1 º x 1 º in the study zone, an empirical linear relationship between HFD and temperatures obtained by silica <b>geothermometry</b> is obtained and used to construct a HFD map for the Portuguese northern Hercynian Massif.

An analogue to mineral chronometry is O isotope <b>geothermometry.</b> Because the rates of Sm-Nd, Sr and O diffusion in metamorphic minerals are comparable inmany cases, the state of O isotope quilibrium between metamorphic minerals can provide a test for the validity of mineral Sin-Nd and Rb-Sr chronometers.

30|$|Many factors interfering {{precise and}} {{consistent}} {{results have been}} identified and discussed in literature. For calculating reservoir conditions based on the solubility of only one mineral phase (e.g., SiO 2 geothermometers), the amount of solvent has to remain constant from reservoir to the discharge. Therefore, dilution with superficial water and boiling due to pressure relief are often considered to have greatest impact. For cation ratio geothermometers, which are not affected by changes {{of the amount of}} solvent, other processes like immaturity (not yet attained water–rock equilibrium) of fluids, fast re-equilibration kinetics and precipitation during ascent prevent from obtaining true in situ temperatures. The role of the reservoir lithology, as a major interfering factor becomes obvious, when for example comparing studies from, e.g., Giggenbach (1988), Arnórsson (2000), Fournier (1979) and Fournier und Truesdell (1973), indicating rather large discrepancies of the Na/K ratios of fluids from equilibrated geothermal systems of different lithologies for a given system. The same applies to other cation ratios (Na/K/Ca, K/Mg, Na/Li, etc.), commonly used for <b>geothermometry.</b> Also the authors of this study have previously found strong indications for the significant effect of different reservoir lithologies on the hydrochemical composition of the fluids affecting the calculation of reservoir temperatures (Meller et al. 2016; Nitschke et al. 2015; Nitschke et al. 2016).
