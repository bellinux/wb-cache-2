5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Martin runs an {{official}} website and administers a lively blog {{with the assistance}} of Ty Franck. He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years. Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, he tends to go to three or four science-fiction conventions a year simply {{to go back to his}} roots and meet friends. He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> intended.|$|E
5|$|Use and {{knowledge}} of the Maya script continued until the 16th century Spanish conquest at least. Bishop Diego de Landa Calderón of the Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán prohibited the use of the written language, effectively ending the Mesoamerican tradition of literacy in the native script. He worked with the Spanish colonizers to destroy the bulk of Mayan texts as part of his efforts to convert the locals to Christianity and away <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> perceived as pagan idolatry. Later he described the use of hieroglyphic writing in the religious practices of Yucatecan Maya in his Relación de las cosas de Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Sultan Iskandar {{was accused}} of causing {{the death of a}} golf caddy in Cameron Highlands by assault, {{following}} an incident in which the golf caddy laughed when the Sultan missed a hole. Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, pointed out that the Sultan (then the Agong) could not be prosecuted due to the immunity that was accorded to the rulers, yet he condemned Sultan Iskandar's actions at the same time. In the end the matter was let off without much public attention. The brother of the caddy – who also suffered injuries from the incident, being distressed <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw, subsequently ran amok in Kuala Lumpur and had to be quarantined in a mental hospital.|$|E

25|$|After Wahunsunacock's {{death in}} 1618, his younger brother, Opitchapam, briefly became chief. However, {{he was soon}} succeeded by his own younger brother, Opechancanough. Opechancanough was not {{interested}} in attempting peaceful coexistence with the English settlers. Instead, he was determined to eradicate the colonists <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered to be Indian lands.|$|E

25|$|There is no uniquely {{definitive}} {{statement of}} the Copenhagen interpretation. It consists of the views developed {{by a number of}} scientists and philosophers during the second quarter of the 20th Century. Bohr and Heisenberg never totally agreed on how to understand the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. Bohr once distanced himself <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered to be Heisenberg's more subjective interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Cold 187um {{felt that}} in order to sign with Psychopathic, he had to create {{material}} that would be different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> produced for his own label, West World Records. During the tour, Cold 187um and Violent J created the character of a hired killer, and developed the concept of the album as a long-form story. After the tour, it was officially announced that Cold 187um had signed with Psychopathic.|$|E

25|$|Rashi's {{teachers}} were students of Rabbeinu Gershom and Rabbi Eliezer Hagadol, leading Talmudists {{of the previous}} generation. From his teachers, Rashi imbibed the oral traditions pertaining to the Talmud {{as they had been}} passed down for centuries, as well as an understanding of the Talmud's unique logic and form of argument. Rashi took concise, copious notes <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> learned in yeshiva, incorporating this material in his commentaries.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the author}} is not {{identified}} in the transmitted Life of Cyprian, Jerome is clearly writing of this work. The only other information comes from the author's own statements: he writes in part <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> himself witnessed or heard from older people; he accompanied Cyprian into exile at Curubis, modern Korba. From the preface, it appears that Pontius {{was not aware of}} any other account of Cyprian's martyrdom at the time he wrote.|$|E
25|$|Cauchy {{makes some}} general remarks about {{functions}} in Chapter I, Section 1 of his Analyse algébrique (1821). <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says there, {{it is clear}} that he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that he is prepared to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.|$|E

[...] "Injury" [...] is then {{simply the}} refusal, or {{violation}} of, any man's right or claim upon his fellows: which claim, much talked of in modern times, under the term [...] "right," [...] is mainly resolvable into two branches: a man's claim {{not to be}} hindered <b>from</b> doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should; and his claim to be hindered <b>from</b> doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> should not; these two forms of hindrance being intensified by reward, help, and fortune, or Fors, on one side, and by punishment, impediment, and even final arrest, or Mors, on the other.|$|R

The Simons played no role in the bustling political activity of the governing Socialist Party in Milwaukee, instead taking an interest in the theater, musical recitals, and public lectures, often in the company of Victor Berger and his wife Meta.|$|E
25|$|When Hackworth {{returned}} to active duty, the expanding Cold War substantially changed {{the structure of}} the army <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had known. Initially posted to 77th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion in Manhattan Beach, California, Hackworth was eventually assigned to Germany, initially in staff roles but returning to infantry in the early-1960s as a company commander under Colonel Glover S. Johns. He was involved in a number of fire drills around the Berlin Crisis of 1961. He recounted his experiences with the Soviet guard and his views on military history in his book About Face.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} book Schleiermacher gave {{religion}} an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature, distinguished it <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> regarded as current caricatures of religion, and described the perennial forms of its manifestation. This established the programme of his subsequent theological system. In the Monologen he revealed his ethical manifesto, in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit, and {{on the relationship of}} the mind to the sensual world, and sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society.|$|E

25|$|No reporters {{attended}} the meeting. Power called on {{me when he}} returned to London to give an account of it. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said I realised that a new portent had arisen out of a leaden sky. He related that footmen in legions and horsemen in squadrons gathered round him to demand reductions of rent. The horsemen, he declared, were organised like cavalry regiments. The police were powerless, and Power foreshadowed that Ireland {{was on the verge of}} a movement which would end a dismal chapter. Yet his meeting was unnoted, save by a local weekly, the Castlebar Telegraph, owned by James Daly.|$|E
25|$|When Curtis was eight, he and {{his brother}} Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a {{neighborhood}} gang whose main crimes were playing hooky from school and minor pilfering at the local dime store. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> felt would have led to a life of delinquency by sending him to a Boy Scout camp, where he was able to work off his energy and settle down. He attended Seward Park High School. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Teitelbaum {{originally}} {{settled with}} his followers in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, a borough of New York City. By the 1970s, however, {{he decided to}} move the growing community to a location that was {{not far from the}} commercial center of New York but was also more secluded <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as the harmful influences and immorality of the outside world. Teitelbaum's choice was Monroe. The land for Kiryas Joel was purchased in the early 1970s, and fourteen Satmar families settled there in the summer of 1974. When he died in 1979, Teitelbaum {{was the first person to}} be buried in the town's cemetery. His funeral reportedly brought over 100,000 mourners to Kiryas Joel.|$|E
