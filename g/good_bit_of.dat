25|$|Balls {{of solid}} glass {{occasionally}} {{were used in}} a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects. The idea was that glass objects, being non-conductors, are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, {{there must be something}} about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning combined with observers' confirmation bias ensured that the method gained a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.|$|E
500|$|Some years later, after Phips {{death and}} {{following}} a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> political upheaval involving Phips and the Mathers, Cotton Mather anonymously wrote {{a biography of}} Phips and sent it away to London for publication despite having Boston printing presses at his beck and call. He implausibly cast this scenario as a spontaneous spiritual awakening, including heartfelt testimony, which Cotton Mather claims to faithfully transcribe [...] "without adding so much as one word unto it." [...] (Cotton Mather loved puns and inside jokes and this {{could be interpreted as}} his sly way of saying Phips wrote not a single word.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The NHS Alliance called polyclinics [...] "lost in translation", commenting {{that while}} they are good when {{implemented}} in the right way, this [...] "means general practices locally deciding to integrate their services" [...] with willingness from both doctors and local people. [...] "The BMA and patients are afraid {{that they might be}} losing the <b>good</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> general practice - and the way that polyclinics have been implemented in some places means they have got a point." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was never}} more {{surprised}} {{than when you}} came in yesterday, Bob; regular floored I was. It {{was only a few}} days ago I was thinking over that rig we were in together. We made a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> out <b>of</b> that.' ...|$|R

500|$|Following the {{dominion}} government, {{in which}} Andros oversaw {{all of the}} colonies, there was a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> jealousy, border disputes, and jockeying for position between the new governors of the various colonies, and Phips seems to have done as much to inflame these jealousies as to work past them. Phips expressed outrage at the execution of Leisler and harbored enemies of Fletcher and the New York government that replaced Leisler. Phips' ongoing struggles with Usher in New Hampshire continued as before. (In 1695, following Phips' death, Bellomont was placed over Fletcher, Usher, and Stoughton, suggesting Whitehall was unimpressed by the bickering of the three provinces, and unswayed by the particular merits of any of their arguments. Bellomont ordered a posthumous pardon of Leisler.) ...|$|E
500|$|Although Goldfaden, {{by his own}} account, was {{familiar}} at this time with [...] "practically all of Russian literature", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an African American tragedian, Ira Aldridge, performing Shakespeare, the performance at Grădina Pomul Verde was only {{a bit more of}} a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together with a bit of character and plot and a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either Di bobe mitn einikl (Grandmother and Granddaughter) or Dos bintl holts (The Bundle of sticks); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.) ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Beveridge from Mania.com {{praised the}} Cobra the Animation anime series and its visual design, {{comparing}} to The Psychogun ones, {{but said it}} is not for those who are unaware the original series. He said the anime has [...] "a healthy dose of action, the kind of sexuality that's a trademark of the series ... as well as a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> silly fun". In the second episode review, Beveridge said it [...] "seems to be following much the same kind of pace and structure" [...] as the OVAs. Its animation was compared with the Darkside Blues; [...] ANN's Erin Finnegan said it was a [...] "gritty" [...] animation, but that from episode five, the animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty. Beveridge said the anime's idea is simple, but added it is [...] "also not a show you see often since it doesn't center around teenagers, schools or the harem concept". He said it is not [...] "a great show", but that [...] "it gives us something different than the usual"the reason it is [...] "enjoyable".|$|E

Steve Forbes was on stage to present deserving Nigerians the awards. In a report titled Nigerian Woman Launches Entertainment TV Network, Mosunmola Abudu was referred to as Africa's Oprah Winfrey. With a catchphrase that says [...] "Everything you think you know about Africa is about to change forever," [...] Ebony Life TV seeks [...] "to start selling the <b>good</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> Africa. Not every African woman has a pile of wood on her head and a baby strapped to her back!" [...] Mo Abudu told the Associated Press during an interview session.|$|R

500|$|Potter {{borrowed}} a cat, {{and took a}} pet rabbit to Fawe Park as models. Her meticulous preparation before finalizing an illustration was noted {{in a letter to}} Warne: [...] "I think I have done every imaginable rabbit background and miscellaneous sketches as well – about seventy! [...] I hope you will like them, though rather scribbled." [...] Scribbled or not, the work is of the highest quality with the sketches of onions and red carnations (which were dropped as the frontispiece) being chief examples. The illustrations communicate her obvious appreciation and love for the humble pots, onions, and flowers of the garden. [...] Many of the objects in the illustrations [...] the gate, the potting shed, the wall [...] have changed little over the years and are recognizable today from her illustrations. Aware the type of story she was writing was set primarily in colours of fawn, brown, and soft green, Potter wrote that, [...] "the (red) handkerchief will make a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> colour all through the book." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "C–" [...] grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was a}} very enjoyable and balanced episode. It gave us the scares, the humor, and the layered commentary that we had come to expect from the series. With only five episodes to go, it’s the perfect time for 1013 to be giving the series a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> resolution, even if it’s more metaphorical than actual." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two enjoyed Schnauz's script, calling it [...] "better than most" [...] of season nine's episodes, and noted that he wrote it with [...] "pace and wit". They noted, however, that the entry's self-references [...] "feel like carping [...] at the audience who are still left to complain." [...] Despite this, Shearman and Pearson also positively critiqued several of the episode's juxtapositions, such as the scene featuring Scully performing an autopsy on a cat while wearing a kitchen apron that says [...] "something smells goooood", calling them [...] "the funniest of the season". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode a [...] "solid little entry", saying that it was a [...] "nice spin on the isolation stories that the series has always done so effectively".|$|E
2500|$|Joseph W. McPherson, {{an officer}} in the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps was invited by two Royal Engineer messmates to {{accompany}} them on a reconnaissance during the afternoon of Good Friday, 6 April 1917. He subsequently wrote, [...] "we saw parties of Turks and mapped down new trenches they had made, got sniped at incidentally, and had to travel a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the way on our bellies." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{call this}} as <b>good</b> a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> {{portrait}} as I ever did," [...] he said, {{looking at it}} as he advanced. [...] "Yours is a face that expresses fear well, because it's naturally a bright one. I noticed {{it the first time}} I saw you. The rest of the picture is hardly sketched; but I've painted you in thoroughly." ...|$|R
2500|$|Chomsky's {{complicated}} {{attitude to}} MIT's military role was expressed in two letters {{published in the}} New York Review Books in 1967. In the first, he wrote that he had [...] "given a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> thought to ... resigning from MIT, which is, {{more than any other}} university associated with the activities of the Department of 'Defense'." [...] He also stated that MIT's [...] "involvement in the [...] war effort is tragic and indefensible." [...] Then, in the second letter written to clarify the first, Chomsky said that [...] "MIT as an institution has no involvement in the war effort. Individuals at MIT, as elsewhere, have direct involvement and that is what I had in mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Harry's second year, Flitwick helps Professor Sinistra carry a petrified Justin Finch-Fletchley to the {{hospital}} wing. He teaches the front doors to recognise a picture of Sirius after his second break-in in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and to instantly lock down if he tries to break in. He helps patrol {{the perimeter of the}} maze for the third task of the Triwizard Tournament held in Harry's fourth year. He eventually removes most of the swamp that is created within the school by Fred and George in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, though he previously leaves the swamp untouched to annoy Umbridge. He does however, choose to leave a small patch of it behind, because he thinks it is [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> magic" [...] and a tribute to the Weasley twins. Near the end of Half-Blood Prince, Flitwick is sent by Professor McGonagall to ask Professor Snape to {{come to the aid of}} the Order of the Phoenix against the intruding Death Eaters. He collapses after requesting Snape's help at the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Potter {{followed}} up {{the success of}} Gamesmanship, extending the basic idea to many other aspects of life, in Some Notes on Lifemanship (1950), which was another big seller. In [...] "Lifemanship" [...] Potter extended the principles of gamesmanship to courtship ("Woomanship"), literature ("Writermanship") and pastimes ("Conversationship"). Thus for example the reader is enjoined, [...] "never forget the uses of Lowbrowmanship in conversation... LOWBROWMAN: Oh, I don't know, I rather like a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> old-fashioned vulgarity. And I'm awfully sorry but I like leg shows. If the Lowbrowman {{happens to be a}} Professor of Aesthetics... his remark is all the more irritating". A related gambit for the journalist was ' Daily Mirrorship... an unaffected love of tremendously ordinary and homely things like Danny Kaye, mild and bitter, the Daily Mirror, the Bertram Mills circus and Rita Hayworth" [...] Potter mentions in passing how [...] "in the last of my Bude lectures I spoke of Gamesmanship and Shakespeare, where most of my remarks referred to Footnote Play", His notes on Donmanship refer to the [...] "art of Criticising without Actually Listening" ...|$|E
60|$|And then Lady Malvern came back, a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> ahead <b>of</b> schedule. I hadn't {{been expecting}} her for days. I'd {{forgotten}} how {{time had been}} slipping along.

I draped a few garments round me and went in.|$|R

6000|$|... "They {{are running}} {{down in a}} body toward the wreck, though one of their boats {{does seem to be}} {{sheering}} out of the line, as if getting into our wake. It is hard to say, sir, for they are still a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> to windward <b>of</b> the wreck." ...|$|R

60|$|On quitting Liddes, the road, {{or rather}} path, for it had dwindled to that, led through a valley that had some low meadows; {{after which the}} ascents became more decided, though the course had always been upward. The {{vegetation}} gradually grew less and less, the tree diminishing to the bush, and finally disappearing altogether, while the grasses became coarse and wiry, or were entirely superseded by moss. We went through a hamlet or two, composed of stones stained apparently with iron ore, and, as the huts were covered with the same material, instead of lending the landscape a more humanized air, they rather added to its appearance of sterile dreariness. There were a few tolerably <b>good</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> savage mountain scenes, especially in a wooded glen or two by the wayside; but, on the whole, I thought this the least striking of the Swiss mountains I had ascended.|$|R
50|$|In the end, Cork fell a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> short <b>of</b> Dundalk, {{finishing}} second. Therefore, they secured Europa League qualification rounds for {{the next}} season. Meanwhile, for Limerick, they miraculously left the bottom spot {{for the first time}} in the season on the last day of the season after a long string of wins. They finished 11th, and played in a relegation playoff against Finn Harps losing 2-1 on aggregate and were relegated on the last hurdle.|$|R
5000|$|The Exhibitors Herald was {{positive}} in their review, complimenting the photography as [...] "exceptional" [...] and the settings as [...] "excellent". They {{went on to}} praise Bennett's performance as [...] "all that could be desired in the leading role. Her pretty mannerisms cannot fail to captivate. There are a number <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> humor in the piece which get across well". A reviewer for Photoplay Magazine said that Bennett [...] "plays the wife with much speed and prettiness, though her method of handling a gun would hardly do in France", and noted that Holt [...] "is a handsome hero for a change, and takes kindly to the work. It is a lively production, slightly tinged with suggestiveness at the outset". Edward Weitzel praised Bennett's performance in The Moving Picture World, saying her [...] "part was much stronger than any she has yet played" [...] and also singled out camerman Edwin Willat's work, saying [...] "scenically the production has many moments of beauty".|$|R

Always {{hurry and}} scurry, looking for copy and {{sometimes}} not finding it: and then, always {{to have something}} new in your stuff. Damn proofs and printers, I say, for a few days. I'm deuced glad, I can tell you, {{to get back to}} the old country. Does a fellow <b>good,</b> a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a holiday. I feel a ton better since I landed again in dear dirty Dublin....

60|$|They visited many {{dwellings}} {{of men in}} {{many parts}} of the world, watching farmers toil in the fields, warriors dash into cruel fray, and merchants exchange their <b>goods</b> for <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> white and yellow metal.

5000|$|... "I am a <b>good</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a poet," [...] Béranger said of himself, [...] "clever in the craft, and a {{conscientious}} worker to whom old airs and a modest choice of subjects (le coin que me suis confine) have brought some success." [...] His modest self-appraisal belies his importance in literary history. When he {{first began to}} cultivate the chanson, it was a minor and little-regarded form, restricted to slight subjects and a humorous guise of treatment. Béranger raised the standing of the art and imbued it with greater sentiment.|$|R
