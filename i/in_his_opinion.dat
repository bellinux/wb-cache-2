5|$|Goldilocks's fate {{varies in}} the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows {{to be a good}} child, and in some she returns home. Whatever her fate, Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{deserved}} a stint in the House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E

5000|$|The work {{appears to}} be a genuine and earnest debate of <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> about human nature, rather than satirical. Twain held views {{similar to that of the}} Old Man prior to writing [...] "What is Man?". However, he seems to have varied <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> of human freedom.|$|R
5000|$|In {{matters of}} {{regulation}} over economic activity, he supported broad national authority, stating <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> that federal commerce powers must “keep {{pace with the}} progress of the country.” In the same vein, a primary theme <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> was the balance of federal and state authority. [...] These opinions influenced Supreme Court jurisprudence well into the 20th century.|$|R
5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> {{it was already}} a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Taft {{wrote for}} a 6–3 {{majority}} in Myers v. United States that Congress could {{not require the}} president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee. Taft noted {{that there is no}} restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution. Although Myers involved the removal of a postmaster, Taft <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> found invalid the repealed Tenure of Office Act, for violation of which his presidential predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached, though acquitted by the Senate. Taft valued Myers as his most important opinion.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Horner {{admitted}} that specimen TMP2002.76.1 {{seemed to indicate}} that Achelousaurus was not descended from Einiosaurus, as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But he stressed {{that even if the}} lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.|$|E

5000|$|Schwelb {{was noted}} for his {{distinctive}} writing style as a judge. He enjoyed flowery turns of phrase and {{was known to}} quote Shakespeare or Gilbert and Sullivan <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinions.</b> <b>In</b> 1980, he {{was the victim of}} a robbery and was shot when he refused to turn over <b>his</b> wallet. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> first <b>opinion</b> back on the bench after a two-month recovery, he wrote about the incident and his assailants, who “unsuccessfully attempted a redistribution of the wealth by demanding the Court’s wallet” and “left a lead bullet in the Court’s abdomen.” ...|$|R
5|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with the Jakarta Globe {{after the release of}} his controversial film ?, Bramantyo said that he had intended Sang Pencerah to use Dahlan's life to examine different aspects of Islam. He meant for the film to show Islam as being a peaceful and truthful religion. Pramono, writing for Tempo, notes that the film presents a different side of Dahlan, who is usually portrayed as an old, bearded man who, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> seems neither modernist nor progressive.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> {{all human}} beings have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him {{it is obvious that}} the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E

5|$|Shaw Jeffrey was {{particularly}} {{at home with}} modern languages, having become fluent in both French and German in the 1890s, and lectured on the topic and {{how it should be}} taught–phonetically, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion.</b> Later on, he authored more works relating to education, including the Work and Progress Record Book (Arnold) and The Schools of England (Ed. J. Burrow). He was also a contributor to the Argosy and other London periodicals, including the English Illustrated Magazine, Longmans and the Boy's Own Paper.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and not obligatory, so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries {{and by their}} disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included an icon of Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> look unintentionally funny.|$|E

[...] He often has viewpoints that might be considered divergent from those of many other music critics.|$|R

5|$|According to {{an article}} on The Conversation written by Robert Merkel, Heartbleed {{revealed}} a massive failure of risk analysis. Merkel thinks OpenSSL gives more importance to performance than to security, which no longer makes sense <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion.</b> But Merkel considers that OpenSSL should not be blamed as much as OpenSSL users, who chose to use OpenSSL, without funding better auditing and testing. Merkel explains that two aspects determine the risk that more similar bugs will cause vulnerabilities. One, the library's source code influences the risk of writing bugs with such an impact. Secondly, OpenSSL's processes affect the chances of catching bugs quickly. On the first aspect, Merkel mentions {{the use of the}} C programming language as one risk factor which favored Heartbleed's appearance, echoing Wheeler's analysis.|$|E
5|$|After {{removing}} her corpse {{from the}} canvas sack and beginning the post mortem examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson {{he was certain}} that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E

In earlier life tutor to Sir Philip Sidney, and {{interested}} {{in the manner of}} Sidney's circle in literature and Ramist logic, he became more sternly religious <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinions.</b> He is now remembered for his 1606 poem Ourania, though not for its poetic merit.|$|R

5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
5|$|Biko and SASO were openly {{critical}} of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought {{to influence the}} white electorate; <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be ineffective for the ultimate aim of dismantling the apartheid state. SASO regarded student marches, pickets, and strikes to be ineffective and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a point when it had a sufficiently large institutional structure. Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures {{in response to the}} expulsion of SASO member Abram Onkgopotse Tiro from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced the government that SASO was a threat.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs v. United States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck v. United States, in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.|$|E
