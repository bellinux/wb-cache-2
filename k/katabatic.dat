5|$|At {{the edge}} of the continent, strong <b>katabatic</b> winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are {{typically}} moderate. During clear days in summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the equator because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.|$|E
5|$|Polar deserts such as McMurdo Dry Valleys remain {{ice-free}} {{because of}} the dry <b>katabatic</b> winds that flow downhill from the surrounding mountains. Former desert areas presently in non-arid environments, such as the Sandhills in Nebraska, are known as paleodeserts. In the Köppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as BWh (hot desert) or BWk (temperate desert). In the Thornthwaite climate classification system, deserts would be classified as arid megathermal climates.|$|E
5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid <b>katabatic</b> winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see <b>katabatic</b> wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east {{along the coast}} {{as far as the}} Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful <b>katabatic</b> winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian <b>katabatic</b> winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{distinct}} subregions in Planum Australe - Australe Lingula and Promethei Lingula. It is dissected by canyons Promethei Chasma, Ultimum Chasma, Chasma Australe and Australe Sulci. It is theorised that these canyons {{were created by}} <b>katabatic</b> wind. The largest crater in Planum Australe is McMurdo Crater.|$|E
25|$|Very fine glacial sediments or {{rock flour}} is often {{picked up by}} wind blowing over the bare surface and may be {{deposited}} great distances from the original fluvial deposition site. These eolian loess deposits may be very deep, even hundreds of meters, as in areas of China and the Midwestern United States of America. <b>Katabatic</b> winds can be important in this process.|$|E
25|$|Being an {{equatorial}} mountain the {{day light}} hours are constant with twelve hour days. Sunrise is about 0530 {{with the sun}} setting at 1730. Over {{the course of the}} year there is a one-minute difference between the shortest and longest days. At night, the sky is usually clear with <b>katabatic</b> winds blowing down the valleys. Above the lower alpine zone there is usually frost every night.|$|E
25|$|The spiral troughs {{in the ice}} cap {{are formed}} by <b>katabatic</b> winds that entrain surface ice eroded from the equator-facing sides of the troughs, likely aided by solar {{ablation}} (sublimation), which is then redeposited on the colder pole-facing slopes. The troughs are roughly perpendicular to the wind direction, which is shifted by the Coriolis effect, leading to the spiral pattern. The troughs gradually migrate towards the pole over time; the central troughs have moved about 65km in the last 2 million years. Chasma Boreale is a canyon-like feature older than the troughs, and in contrast is aligned parallel to the wind direction.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{variations}} {{are closely}} correlated with direct sunlight. The sun quickly warms {{the ground by}} a few degrees, which in turn warms the air close to the ground. This air cools to reach equilibrium with the mean air temperature very quickly when the sky becomes overcast. The layer of air within half a metre of {{the ground in the}} valleys also exhibit different temperatures at night to the air layer above it. During the clear nights of the dry season, the ground cools quickly cooling the air next to it. This leads to <b>katabatic</b> winds from the ridges into the valleys resulting in the valley bottoms being colder than the higher ridges flanking them. Baker found that the Teleki valley was regularly 2°C colder at night than the surrounding ridges. This has forced plants such as the senecios and lobellias to be tall to avoid key parts freezing, as freezing is lethal for plants.|$|E
500|$|Daytime {{heating and}} {{nighttime}} cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night {{variations in the}} airflow, similar {{to the relationship between}} sea breeze and land breeze. [...] At night, the sides of the hills cool through radiation of the heat. [...] The air along the hills becomes cooler and denser, blowing down into the valley, drawn by gravity. [...] This is known a <b>katabatic</b> wind or mountain breeze. [...] If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the <b>katabatic</b> wind will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys. [...] The slopes of hills not covered by snow will be warmed during the day. The air that comes in contact with the warmed slopes becomes warmer and less dense and flows uphill. This is known as an anabatic wind or valley breeze.|$|E

Though they experience hot summers, temperatures during the coldest months may fall as low as [...] Due to ample monsoon rains, India has only one subtype of this climate under the [...] In most of this region, {{there is very little}} precipitation during the winter, owing to powerful anticyclonic and <b>katabatic</b> (downward-flowing) winds from Central Asia.|$|E
500|$|Bottomlands may be salt-covered flats. Eolian {{processes}} are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Polar deserts (also seen as [...] "cold deserts") have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain. Antarctica is the world's largest cold desert (composed of about 98% thick {{continental ice sheet}} and 2% barren rock). Some of the barren rock {{is to be found}} in the so-called Dry Valleys of Antarctica that almost never get snow, which can have ice-encrusted saline lakes that suggest evaporation far greater than the rare snowfall due to the strong <b>katabatic</b> winds that even evaporate ice.|$|E

500|$|India {{is home to}} an {{extraordinary}} variety of climatic regions, ranging from tropical {{in the south to}} temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. The nation's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert. The Himalayas, along with the Hindu Kush mountains in Pakistan, prevent cold Central Asian <b>katabatic</b> winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at the similar latitudes. Simultaneously, the Thar Desert plays a role in attracting moisture-laden southwest summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate, into which fall seven climatic zones that, as designated by experts, are defined on the basis of such traits as temperature and precipitation. Groupings are assigned codes (see chart) according to the Köppen climate classification system.|$|E
500|$|The caps at both poles consist {{primarily}} (70%) {{of water}} ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick {{on the north}} cap in the northern winter only, whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick. This permanent dry ice cover {{at the south pole}} is peppered by flat floored, shallow, roughly circular pits, which repeat imaging shows are expanding by meters per year; this suggests that the permanent CO2 cover over the south pole water ice is degrading over time. The northern polar cap has a diameter of about [...] during the northern Mars summer, and contains about [...] of ice, which, if spread evenly on the cap, would be [...] thick. (This compares to a volume of [...] for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of [...] and a thickness of [...] The total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has been estimated at 1.6 million cubic km. Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which recent analysis of SHARAD ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of <b>katabatic</b> winds that spiral due to the Coriolis Effect.|$|E
2500|$|While the Santa Anas are <b>katabatic,</b> {{they are}} not Föhn winds. [...] These result from {{precipitation}} on the windward {{side of a mountain}} range which releases latent heat into the atmosphere which is then warmer on the leeward side (e.g., the Chinook or the original Föhn).|$|E
2500|$|The weather {{during the}} {{beginning}} of the autumn hunting season is often pleasant, relatively warm, and mild, but it can change very quickly. Hunters may encounter fog, rain, wind, and winter conditions. Occasionally the situation can quickly approach a [...] with events such as <b>katabatic</b> winds, storms, snow, hail, sleet, freezing rain, blizzards, and polar cyclones, even in the late summer. Lack of preparation can have fatal consequences.|$|E
2500|$|There are harsh deserts in the Southeast of California. These deserts {{are caused}} by a {{combination}} of the cold offshore current, which limits evaporation, and the rain shadow of the mountains. The prevailing winds blow from the ocean inland. [...] When the air passes over the mountains, adiabatic cooling causes most water in the air to rain on the mountains. [...] When the air returns to sea level {{on the other side of}} the mountains, it recompresses, warms and dries, parching the deserts. [...] When the wind blows from inland, the resulting hot dry <b>katabatic</b> winds are called the Santa Ana Winds.|$|E
2500|$|Winds {{blowing off}} the {{elevated}} glaciated plateaus of Greenland and Antarctica experience {{the most extreme}} form of <b>katabatic</b> wind, of which the Santa Ana is a type, for the most part. [...] The winds start at a high elevation and flow outward and downslope, attaining hurricane gusts in valleys, along the shore, and even out to sea. [...] Like the Santa Ana, these winds also heat up by compression and lose humidity, but because they start out so extraordinarily cold and dry and blow over snow and ice {{all the way to}} the sea, the perceived similarity is negligible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{temperatures}} on Mount Kenya fluctuate greatly. This fluctuation is largest on {{the lower}} slopes of the moorland zone. At an altitude of [...] there is an 11.5°C mean range in daily temperature, this goes down to 7.5°C at [...] and 4°C at [...] The diurnal temperature fluctuation reduces with altitude, and so the lapse rate decreases {{during the course of}} the day. This effect means the lapse rate during the day on Mount Kenya is lower than average for dry air. At night the lapse rate is again lower than average for dry air due to the <b>katabatic</b> winds from the glaciers. The temperature fluctuation is less in the wet season as the constant clouds act as a dampener.|$|E
2500|$|The Himalayan {{range is}} the world's highest {{mountain}} range, with its tallest peak Mt. Everest (...) on the Nepal–China border. They form India's northeastern border, separating it from northeastern Asia. They {{are one of}} the world's youngest mountain ranges and extend almost uninterrupted for , covering an area of [...] The Himalayas extend from Jammu and Kashmir in the north to Arunachal Pradesh in the east. These states along with Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim lie mostly in the Himalayan region. Numerous Himalayan peaks rise over [...] and the snow line ranges between [...] in Sikkim to around [...] in Kashmir. Kanchenjunga—on the Sikkim–Nepal border—is the highest point in the area administered by India. Most peaks in the Himalayas remain snowbound throughout the year. The Himalayas act as a barrier to the frigid <b>katabatic</b> winds flowing down from Central Asia. Thus, North India is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot.|$|E
2500|$|The Santa Anas are <b>katabatic</b> winds—Greek for [...] "flowing downhill", arising {{in higher}} altitudes and blowing down towards sea level. Santa Ana winds {{originate}} from high-pressure airmasses over the Great Basin and upper Mojave Desert. Any low-pressure area over the Pacific Ocean, {{off the coast}} of California, can change the stability of the Great Basin High, causing a pressure gradient that turns the synoptic scale winds southward down {{the eastern side of the}} Sierra Nevada and into the Southern California region. Cool, dry air flows outward in a clockwise spiral from the high pressure center. This cool, dry airmass sweeps across the deserts of eastern California toward the coast, and encounters the towering Transverse Ranges, which separate coastal Southern California from the deserts. The airmass, flowing from high pressure in the Great Basin to a low pressure center off the coast, takes the path of least resistance by channeling through the mountain passes to the lower coastal elevations, as the low pressure area off the coast pulls the airmass offshore.|$|E

2500|$|... and {{contains}} about 1.6million cubic kilometres of ice, which if spread evenly on the cap would be 2km thick. (This compares to {{a volume of}} 2.85million cubic kilometres for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350km and a maximum thickness of 3km. Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which were formerly believed to form {{as a result of}} differential solar heating, coupled with the sublimation of ice and condensation of water vapor. Recent analysis of ice penetrating radar data from SHARAD has demonstrated that the spiral troughs are formed from a unique situation in which high density <b>katabatic</b> winds descend from the polar high to transport ice and create large wavelength bedforms. [...] The spiral shape comes from Coriolis effect forcing of the winds, much like winds on earth spiral to form a hurricane. [...] The troughs did not form with either ice cap, instead they began to form between 2.4 million and 500,000 years ago, after three fourths of the ice cap was in place. [...] This suggests that a climatic shift allowed for their onset. [...] Both polar caps shrink and regrow following the temperature fluctuation of the Martian seasons; there are also [...] longer-term trends that are better understood in the modern era.|$|E
