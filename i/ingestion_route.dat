40|$|Inadvertent {{ingestion}} {{exposure is}} the ingestion (uptake) of substances through processes {{of which the}} individual is oblivious and in which the point of intake is the oral cavity.   The limited understanding about the processes involved in inadvertent ingestion exposure in the workplace compromises {{the integrity of the}} risk assessment process in cases where the <b>ingestion</b> <b>route</b> of exposure may contribute significantly to total exposure.   This research study was conceived to provide greater insight into the relative importance of ingestion exposure, elucidate the mechanisms involved in this exposure route and provide suitable exposure metrics to enable quantitative measurements that are relevant to inadvertent ingestion. Based on a literature review, it was estimated that 4. 5 million workers (i. e. 15 % of the UK working population), were potentially exposed to non-trivial amounts of hazardous workplace substances via the <b>ingestion</b> <b>route.</b>   A conceptual analysis of inadvertent ingestion exposure highlighted the role of hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth events as the primary exposure processes.   Two exposure “compartments” are defined: the peri- oral area (i. e. the area of skin around the outside of the mouth) and the oral cavity.   Behavioural factors were also found to have a key role in determining inadvertent ingestion exposure.   Validation of the model using measured data revealed that peri-oral rather than oral exposure is probably the better indicator of inadvertent ingestion exposure.   The resulting model provides a good starting point for the development of screening and exposure assessment tools for risk assessment, health screening and epidemiological studies.

40|$|Soil {{contamination}} is {{an important}} issue for European environmental policy, since it represents potential hazards for human health and the ecosystem. This paper presents a case study from Greece. A historic metallurgy complex will be re-used for establishing the Lavrion Technology and Cultural Park (LTCP). Intensive mining and metallurgical activities {{that took place in the}} broader area for the last 3000 years have caused soil pollution, particularly with metals and metalloids. Because remediation is presently prohibitively expensive, a risk assessment methodology based on U. S. EPA guidance [1 - 5] was used to quantify human health hazards, implement immediate cost-effective countermeasures to ensure protection of human health, and provide time and data needed for the final remediation scheme to commence.

Mud crabs were collected from the crab fattening unit of Pichavaram mangroves area, southeast coast of India. The infectivity test was conducted on Penaeus monodon, P. indicus, Litopenaeus vannamei under three different shrimp densities and two different routes of infection.

Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) {{is an essential}} additive in plastic manufacturing and is used as plasticizer for many products including plastic food packaging. DEHP is a teratogenic compound and can cause potent reproductive toxicity. DEHP can also cause liver damage, peroxisome proliferation, and carcinogenesis. DEHP is also strongly associated with peptic ulcers and gastric cancer; however, the underlying effect and mechanism of DEHP on the gastrointestinal tract are not entirely clear. The oral infection route of H. pylori parallels the major <b>ingestion</b> <b>route</b> of DEHP into the human body. Therefore, we wanted to study the effect of DEHP and H. pylori exposure on the human gastric epithelial cell line, AGS (gastric adenocarcinoma). The viability of the AGS cell line was significantly lower in 80 [*]μM-DEHP and H. pylori (MOI = 100 [*]:[*] 1) coexposure than DEHP or H. pylori alone. DEHP and H. pylori coexposure also induced caspase- 3 activation, and increased Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio and DNA fragmentation in AGS cells. These results indicate that DEHP can enhance H. pylori cytotoxicity and induce gastric epithelial cell apoptosis.

Intravenously administered NAC was started after initial stabilization was complete. His vital signs were normal. Admission laboratory values revealed normal serum electrolytes, AST, ALT, PT, BUN, creatinine, and bilirubin. Serum ethanol level was 15  mg/dL, and aspirin and acetaminophen were undetectable. The patient was extubated but developed liver function abnormalities with a peak AST of 224  IU/L, ALT of 583  IU/L, and bilirubin level reaching 16. 3  mg/dL. NAC was continued through hospital day 6. Serum chloroform level obtained on admission was 91  μg/mL. The patient was discharged to psychiatry without known sequelae and normal liver function tests.

Adult earthworms {{were exposed to}} natural sandy soil contaminated artificially by bismuth citrate. Average total concentrations of bismuth in soil recovered by HNO 3 digestion ranged from 75 to 289 mg/kg. Results indicate that bismuth decreased significantly all reproduction parameters of Eisenia andrei at concentrations 2 ̆ 265 116 mg/kg. However, number of hatched cocoons and number of juveniles {{seem to be more}} sensitive than total number of cocoons, as determined by IC 50; i. e., 182, 123 and > 289 mg/kg, respectively. Bismuth did not affect Eisenia andrei growth and survival, and had little effect on phagocytic efficiency of coelomocytes. The low immunotoxicity effect might be explained by the involvement of other mechanisms i. e. bismuth sequestered by metal-binding compounds. After 28 days of exposure bismuth concentrations in earthworms tissue increased with increasing bismuth concentrations in soil reaching a stationary state of 21. 37 mg/kg dry tissue for 243 mg Bi/kg dry soil total content. Data indicate also that after 56 days of incubation the average fractions of bismuth available extracted by KNO 3 aqueous solution in soil without earthworms varied from 0. 0051 to 0. 0229 mg/kg, while in soil with earthworms bismuth concentration ranged between 0. 3102 ̆ 0131. 347 mg/kg dry soil.

The physical properties of metals need to be take into account when measuring exposure and assessing risks (Flint, 1998). A method was therefore developed to measure dermal exposure to metal particles, and workplace surveys were carried out for antimony, lead, zinc and nickel. Inhalation exposure data were also collected for comparison with the dermal exposure measurements. The dermal exposures for nickel workers were used to assess the risk of induction or elicitation of nickel sensitivity. A mathematical model was constructed to describe the total systemic absorption from inhalation, dermal and <b>ingestion</b> <b>routes</b> of exposure for all four of the substances. The summary data for each of the exposure categories were used as inputs to the model and estimates of absorbed dose were derived. The soluble nickel exposures for nickel production workers were in some cases well in excess of the NOEL value of 0. 3 ug/crn" (DEPA, 2008) for elicitation of nickel dermatitis in nickel sensitive individuals, indicating that individuals with pre-existing nickel sensitivity should not be employed in this industry. Only the stainless steel production worker exposures were below the NOEL value. The absorption model showed that absorption by the dermal route could equal that of the inhaled dose for antimony workers. The dermal absorption of lead for lead workers was found to be insignificant compared to inhalation exposures. In the zinc industry, the estimated dermal absorption was significant in the zinc chemical production processes, but not in zinc refining or in galvanising. In the case of nickel industry, the dermal absorption was significant for electro winning, nickel compounds and nickel powder production.

Methods In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, all children younger than 13 years old, admitted to the Qods teaching hospital in Qazvin (Iran), were assessed during September 2009 to September 2012. Demographic and clinical symptoms and signs of poisoned cases, poisonous agents and outcome of patients were studied. Results Four hundreds and thirty-four (2. 59 % of total hospital admission) patients with APC were admitted to the emergency department during the study period; 63. 36 % were male. Overall, 345 (79. 5 %) cases were under 6 years old. Drugs (265 cases) were common agents for APC. The <b>ingestion</b> <b>route</b> was responsible in 391 of APC. Methadone, benzodiazepines and kerosene were the most frequent poisonous agents. Neurologic symptoms and signs (256 cases) were the most common presentation of APC.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the important routes of metal uptake in earthworms to enable {{a better understanding of the}} primary source of metal uptake in the environment. Earthworms can take up chemicals from pore water and soil both by ingestion and through contact with their skin. However, it is unclear which pathway is the most important for metal uptake. An experiment was designed in which both soil chemistry and foods were artificially manipulated, producing different pools of soil lead (Pb) with different isotope compositions at a range of Pb concentrations. Earthworms (Eiseniafetida) were exposed to different lead concentrations through the addition of 500 mg/kg lead oxide (Pb 3 O 4) to soil and 500 mg/kg lead nitrate to food (manure), with distinctly different isotopic compositions. Earthworms were also exposed to combinations of soil only and soil plus food in order to quantify the proportions of Pb taken up from each component. After acid digestion of the earthworm tissues, the Pb isotope composition of the accumulated lead in the earthworms was measured using a Thermo-fisher, iCAPQ, ICP-MS for 208 Pb/ 206 Pb and 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ratios measured relative to NIST SRM 981, allowing us to determine the pathway of lead uptake. Mixing calculations have been used to deconvolute the lead isotope signatures and identify the amount of lead taken up by the earthworms from the different soil pools. Differences in bioaccumulation factors and the relative amounts of lead accumulated from different pools changes as a function of concentration in the different pools. Earthworms were shown to uptake lead from bothsoil and food sources through <b>ingestion</b> <b>route.</b> Our findings suggest that a major pathway of lead uptake in earthworm species is heavily influenced by their ecology...|$|E

In the UK, soil PHE such as arsenic (As), chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) occur at elevated concentrations in soils derived from ironstone parent materials. Exposure to soil PHE via oral ingestion, inhalation or dermal uptake poses a potential risk to human health. However, PHE mobility in soils is governed by its solid phase distribution within the soil matrix and therefore the presence of PHE may not indicate a risk to human health. This study examines the geochemical forms of As, Cr Ni, found in ironstone derived topsoils from north Oxfordshire in the UK, where total concentrations were in the range 14. 0 – 417 mg kg- 1 As, 51. 0 – 447 mg kg- 1 Cr and 17. 0 – 218 mg kg- 1 Ni.

Seven distinct physico-chemical components, including iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and aluminium (Al) oxides, calcium (Ca) carbonates, organic and fertilizer sources were identified in the Oxfordshire soils, all of which were identified as being hosts to {{one or more of the}} PHE of interest. Estimates of PHE intake via the oral <b>ingestion</b> <b>route</b> were determined using an in vitro physiologically based gastro-intestinal simulation bioacessibility test. Bioaccessible PHE concentrations ranged from 1. 60 – 12. 8 mg kg- 1 As, 0. 55 – 2. 02 mg kg- 1 Cr and 1. 18 – 4. 52 mg kg- 1 Ni. The combination of bioaccessobility data with mobility/solid phase distribution information provided by the sequentional extraction methodology indicates that: Fe oxides are the predominant host of immobile As and Cr; mobile As is associated with carbonates and organic phases; relatively mobile Cr with Mn/Al oxides; mobile/relatively mobile Ni is predominant in Al/Mn oxide components and carbonate soil components. The coupling of sequential extraction and bioaccessibility techniques provides a robust approach to understanding the relationship between PHE mobility and the potential human health risks from soil exposure via ingestion. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Melioidosis is {{a serious}} {{infectious}} disease caused by the Category B select agent and environmental saprophyte, Burkholderia pseudomallei. Most cases of naturally acquired infection are assumed to result from skin inoculation after exposure to soil or water. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide evidence for inoculation, inhalation and <b>ingestion</b> as <b>routes</b> of infection, and develop preventive guidelines based on this evidence. Methods/Principal Findings: A prospective hospital-based 1 : 2 matched case-control study was conducted in Northeast Thailand. Cases were patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis, and controls were patients admitted with non-infectious conditions during the same period, matched for gender, age, and diabetes mellitus. Activities of daily living were recorded for the 30 -day period before onset of symptoms, and home visits were performed to obtain drinking water and culture this for B. pseudomallei. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis based on 286 cases and 512 controls showed that activities associated with a risk of melioidosis included working in a rice field (conditional odds ratio [cOR] = 2. 1; 95...|$|R

40|$|Occupational {{inadvertent}} ingestion {{exposure is}} ingestion exposure due to {{contact between the}} mouth and contaminated hands or objects. Although individuals are typically oblivious to their exposure by this route, it is a potentially significant source of occupational exposure for some substances. Due to the continual flux of saliva through the oral cavity and the non-specificity of biological monitoring to routes of exposure, direct measurement of exposure by the inadvertent <b>ingestion</b> <b>route</b> is challenging; predictive models {{may be required to}} assess exposure. The work described in this manuscript has been carried out as part of a project to develop a predictive model for estimating inadvertent ingestion exposure in the workplace. As inadvertent ingestion exposure mainly arises from hand-to-mouth contact, it is closely linked to dermal exposure. We present a new integrated conceptual model for dermal and inadvertent ingestion exposure that should help to increase our understanding of ingestion exposure and our ability to simultaneously estimate exposure by the dermal and ingestion routes. The conceptual model consists of eight compartments (source, air, surface contaminant layer, outer clothing contaminant layer, inner clothing contaminant layer, hands and arms layer, perioral layer, and oral cavity) and nine mass transport processes (emission, deposition, resuspension or evaporation, transfer, removal, redistribution, decontamination, penetration and/or permeation, and swallowing) that describe event-based movement of substances between compartments (e. g. emission, deposition, etc.). This conceptual model is intended to guide the development of predictive exposure models that estimate exposure from both the dermal and the inadvertent ingestion pathways. For exposure by these pathways the efficiency of transfer of materials between compartments (for example from surfaces to hands, or from hands to the mouth) are important determinants of exposure. A database of transfer efficiency data relevant for dermal and inadvertent ingestion exposure was developed, containing 534 empirically measured transfer efficiencies measured between 1980 and 2010 and reported in the peer-reviewed and grey literature. The majority of the reported transfer efficiencies (84 %) relate to transfer between surfaces and hands, but the database also includes efficiencies for other transfer scenarios, including surface-to-glove, hand-to-mouth, and skin-to-skin. While the conceptual model can provide a framework for a predictive exposure assessment model, the database provides detailed information on transfer efficiencies between the various compartments. Together, the conceptual model and the database provide a basis {{for the development of a}} quantitative tool to estimate inadvertent ingestion exposure in the workplace. © 2012 The Author 2012...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{hypotheses}} are: (1) {{the more}} closely the synthetic, in vitro, extractant mimics the extraction {{properties of the}} human digestive bio-fluids, the more accurate will be the estimate of an internal dose; (2) performance can be evaluated by in vivo studies with a rat model and quantitative examination of a mass balance, calculation and dose estimates from model simulations for the in vitro and in vivo system; and (3) the concentration of the elements Pb, Cd, Cr and selected Radionuclides present in the bioavailable fraction obtained with a synthetic extraction system {{will be a better}} indicator of contaminant ingestion from a contaminated soil because it represents the portion of the mass which can yield exposure, uptake and then the internal dose to an individual. As of April 15, 1998, they have made significant progress {{in the development of a}} unified approach to the examination of bioavailability and bioaccessibility of elemental contamination of soils for the <b>ingestion</b> <b>route</b> of exposure. This includes the initial characterization of the soil, in vitro measurements of bioaccessibility, and in vivo measurements of bioavailability. They have identified the basic chemical and microbiological characteristics of waste laden soils. These have been used to prioritize the soils for potential mobility of the trace elements present in the soil. Subsequently they have employed a mass balance technique, which for the first time tracked the movement and distribution of elements through an in vitro or in vivo experimental protocol to define the bioaccessible and the bioavailable fractions of digested soil. The basic mass balance equation for the in vitro system is: MT = MSGJ + MIJ + MR. where MT is the total mass extractable by a specific method, MSGJ, is the mass extracted by the saliva and the gastric juices, MIJ is the mass extracted by the intestinal fluid, and MR is the unextractable portion of the initial mass. The above is based upon the use of a synthetic digestive bio-fluids model that includes the saliva, gastric juices, and intestinal fluids. The system has been devised to sequentially extract elements from soil by starting with an extraction by the saliva and carrying the entire mixture to the subsequent bio-fluids for further extraction. The residence time of the soil in each extractant and the liquid to mass ratio in the gastric juices are based upon typical values known for the human digestive system. Experiments were conducted to examine the sensitivity of the extractions to changes in these major variables. The results indicated the lack of significant extraction after 2 h of residence in gastric fluid. The range of variation of the liquid to mass ratio was element dependent over the interval 100 : 1 and 5, 000 : 1. The final values used for the extraction protocol were: 2 h residence time, and a ratio of 1, 000 : 1. Details of the chemical composition of the extraction protocol are found in Hamel, 1998. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwenty-one {{samples of}} urban dust were {{collected}} from Estarreja city (Portugal). The main objective of this work {{was to assess the}} potential availability of Pb and Zn present dust samples from Estarreja city via the oral <b>ingestion</b> exposure <b>route</b> using a combination of geochemical tests: (a) using sequential extraction to identify the fractionation of the Pb and Zn within the geochemical components that make up the dust and (b) in vitro bioaccessibility (BA) measurements to identify which components are the source(s) of the bioaccessible fraction (Bf). These samples were analysed for their quasi-total contents of Pb and Zn by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, for their element solid-phase distribution using selective sequential extraction method and for the Bfs of these elements using a physiologically based extraction test. The study showed that the concentrations of Zn were higher than Pb, but both are site-specific. The sequential extraction test shows that the exchangeable and acid-soluble phases are important bearing phases for Pb and Zn. The BA test showed that a high proportion of the total concentration is available for absorption into the human body (ranges from 22. 5 to 84. 1 % for Pb and 28. 7 to 86. 3 % for Zn) ...|$|R
50|$|White {{spirit is}} mainly classed as an irritant. It has a fairly low acute {{toxicity}} by inhalation of the vapour, dermal (touching the skin) and oral <b>routes</b> (<b>ingestion).</b> However, acute exposure {{can lead to}} central nervous system depression resulting in lack of coordination and slowed reactions. Exposure to very high concentrations in enclosed spaces can lead to general narcotic effects (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea etc...) and can eventually lead to unconsciousness. Oral ingestion presents a high aspiration hazard. Prolonged or repeated skin exposure {{over a long period}} of time can result in severe irritant dermatitis, also called contact dermatitis. Exposure to white spirit in direct contact with the skin for several hours can cause severe chemical burns.It is recommended that skin exposure be kept to a minimum by use of gloves, and that hands be washed after contact. Occasional exposure to skin is highly unlikely to cause any problems.|$|R
