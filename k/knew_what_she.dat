5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing sleeping with an older man, {{and yet there is}} something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E

Greg Baker of The Miami News wrote in the album's review that [...] "the song should put he Bangles on the 'pop 'n' roll' map". A writer in Toledo Blade noted that [...] "Manic Monday" [...] was [...] "infectious" [...] and, along with [...] "If She <b>Knew</b> <b>What</b> <b>She</b> Wants", both were [...] "refreshingly melodic". Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "The first single 'Manic Monday' represents slumming songwriter Prince's attempt mostly successful save for the inevitable getting down interlude to concoct a modern day Mamas and the Papas hit." ...|$|E

500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The minute I got off that train, I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was trying to say. She was trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E
500|$|Laura A. Bischoff of the Dayton Daily News {{commented that}} the book was the [...] "ultimate insider's guide to The Simpsons." [...] However, several critics {{commented that the}} book was {{straightforward}} and presented few interesting stories. Susan Shapiro of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Although the paradoxes of being 'a celebrity nobody knows' are interesting, the photographs, diary entries and overly cute commentaries make this book feel like a personal scrapbook." [...] Rosellen Brewer of the Library Journal commented that [...] "Cartwright's own life notwithstanding, there is nothing really new or exciting here. She <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to do and}} was able to do it; end of story." [...] Lee Bacchus of The Province wrote that [...] "This little book by the voice of Bart Simpson reads as if it were written by a 10-year-old boy. Not that that's all bad. Cartwright, who voices Bart along with Ralph Wiggum and a few others on The Simpsons, gives a very unchallenging tour behind the scenes of the phenomenally successful series. It's kind of fun to discover how the show is put together and how an adult woman snagged one of the coolest jobs in the world [...] If only it wasn't all so relentlessly perky." ...|$|E

A private, grave-side service had been held earlier with a crypt entombment at Nashville's Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery. Her death solicited commentary {{such as that of}} songwriter Bill Mack, quoted in the Dallas Morning News that she was a [...] "class act" [...] and [...] "irreplaceable" [...] and that [...] "She never knew a flat note." [...] Lee Ann Womack was quoted also; she said of Wynette, whose songs often evoked strength and controlled passion, [...] "You knew she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was singing about.

2500|$|During {{a trip to}} Europe in 1956 {{with her}} {{children}} Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli. [...] The adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. She gave one to her daughter and took the others back to Mattel. The Lilli doll {{was based on a}} popular character appearing in a comic strip drawn by Reinhard Beuthin for the newspaper Bild. Lilli was a blonde bombshell, a working girl who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted and was not above using men to get it. The Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1955, and although it was initially sold to adults, it became popular with children who enjoyed dressing her up in outfits that were available separately.|$|E
2500|$|Asher {{turned out}} to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any {{producer}} she had worked with previously. Ronstadt's professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio. Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a [...] "woman of strong opinions (who) <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to do (with her career)", he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer, and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship. [...] "It must be a lot harder to have objective conversations about someone's career when it's someone you sleep with", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Winthrop {{questioned}} Hutchinson {{heavily on}} her association {{with those who}} had caused trouble in the colony, and on the meetings that she held at her house, but Hutchinson effectively stonewalled this prosecutorial thrust by answering questions with questions and matching scripture with scripture. [...] Dudley then stepped in and confronted her concerning having men at her home meetings and [...] "traducing [...] the ministers" [...] by saying that they [...] "preached a covenant of works, and only Mr. Cotton a covenant of grace." [...] To the latter charge Dudley added, [...] "you {{said they were not}} able ministers of the new testament, but Mr. Cotton only!" [...] This last assertion brought pause to Hutchinson, who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had said and to whom she had said it. According to the modern interpretations of Emery Battis, she had assumed that her statements would be confidential and private when she made them during the meetings with the ministers in October 1636.|$|E

2500|$|Wuornos was incarcerated at the Florida Department of Corrections Broward Correctional Institution (BCI) {{death row}} for women, then {{transferred}} to the Florida State Prison for execution. Her appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in 1996. In a 2001 petition to the Florida Supreme Court, she stated her intention to dismiss her legal counsel and terminate all pending appeals. [...] "I killed those men," [...] she wrote, [...] "robbed them as cold as ice. And I'd do it again, too. There's no chance in keeping me alive or anything, because I'd kill again. I have hate crawling through my system...I am so sick of hearing this 'she's crazy' stuff. I've been evaluated so many times. I'm competent, sane, and I'm trying to tell the truth. I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again." [...] While her attorneys argued {{that she was not}} mentally competent to make such a request, Wuornos insisted that she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing, and a court-appointed panel of psychiatrists agreed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Olivia {{has been described}} as [...] "an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be peel back over time." [...] She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to do for a career [...] "pretty much since [...] was nine", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.|$|E
2500|$|Adele later {{collaborated with}} famed {{musician}} and producer Dan Wilson to write [...] "Someone like You" [...] {{which was one}} of the final songs composed for the album. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar. The two sat around the piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: [...] "We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school." [...] During an interview with Billboard, Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible. He added [...] "We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, but she always <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to say. She definitely had a master plan." [...] The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West Hollywood, California with Wilson playing piano. Philip Allen engineered in the studio. The mixing was done by Tom Elmhirst and Dan Parry while the mastering was finished by Tom Coyne.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{it was not}} planned, Zsa Zsa {{was given}} a {{personality}} {{similar to that of}} her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in EastEnders. During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: [...] "The words were there and I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was like but when I saw Linda [...] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror." [...] When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with Soaplife magazine: [...] "Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone." [...] She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is [...] "a real bitch" [...] and [...] "very mean and cold", while a profile for the character on the official EastEnders website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and [...] "desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
