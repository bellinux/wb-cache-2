40|$|The {{ability of}} Ordovician strophomenates Sowerbyella and Rafinesquina to move {{sediment}} and create moat-like depressions {{has led to}} questions about mechanisms. Anatomical studies suggest a gape of more than 45 °, likely critical to trace-making abilities. Strophomenates are extinct, but thecidellinids are reasonably good analogues; they also gape widely and have a similar lophophore structure. They differ in their small size, 3 - 5 mm, lack of concavo-convex form, and by pedicle valve cementation. Nevertheless, their physiology could illuminate biomechanical constraints on strophomenate-sediment interactions. For this study, we analyzed 1 hour of video showing 30 + specimens collected with the fragment of <b>dead</b> <b>plate</b> coral, Agaricia, {{to which they were}} cemented from the fore reef slope at ~ 15 meters depth near Slangenbaai, Curaçao. Video was recorded after brachiopods were transferred to a tank where they rapidly recovered, resumed normal feeding behaviors, and maintained a 90 ° gape. They are sensitive to vibrations and touch, and respond by valve snapping, but are insensitive to light or sodium fluorescein dye. Valve snapping also occurs during feeding without perceptible stimulus. The dye was used to mark water movement during feeding and valve snapping. It shows feeding currents by entering the lophophore and moving diffusely within the filament ring toward the hinge at ~ 2 mm/s, then crossing to the outer surface of the ring, where it is conveyed forward along the filament ring and exits at ~ 12 mm/s in a stream at the anterior midline. These brachiopods consistently snap shut within about 0. 13 seconds, expelling water at 6 cm/s, but they take 20 seconds or more to fully open. They normally stay shut for 3 s to 15 min, and remain open 2 to 3 min. When repeatedly stimulated, some individuals would only open to 60 ° and close in rapid succession, managing 3 cycles in 1. 5 min. By analogy, feeding currents of strophomenates were likely too weak to disturb sediments, allowing them to feed close to the sea-floor. The powerful snapping currents might have formed moats or helped the brachiopods to excavate, especially when employed in rapid succession. Further studies of thecidellinids are focused on hinge and muscle configuration, and may be extended to experiments on strength and fatigue limits of muscle, and ability to clear sediment...|$|E

5000|$|Textual {{evidence}} also {{exists for}} covering {{portions of the}} deceased’s body with gold foil.

This practice {{may or may not be}} distinct from the funerary use of gold leaf inscribed with figures and placed on the eyes, mouths, and chests of warriors in Macedonian burials during the late Archaic period (580-460 BC); in September 2008, archaeologists working near Pella in northern Greece publicized the discovery of twenty warrior graves in which the deceased wore bronze helmets and were supplied with iron swords and knives along with these gold-leaf coverings.|$|R

40|$|We {{interpret}} large-scale subsidence (5 ^ 6 km depth) {{with little}} attendant brittle deformation {{in the southern}} Dead Sea basin, a large pull-apart basin along the <b>Dead</b> Sea transform <b>plate</b> boundary, to indicate lower crustal thinning due to lower crustal flow. Along-axis flow within the lower crust could be induced by the reduction of overburden pressure in the central Dead Sea basin, where brittle extensional deformation is observed.

Groundwater levels along the coastal areas are very shallow. The groundwater levels increase {{to the north and}} north-east to depths greater than 17 m about 5 km from the shore. The liquefaction potential of the city of Aqaba soils was analyzed using the Simplified Procedure of Youd and Idriss and the modified Chinese criteria of Wang. Maps of the liquefaction susceptibility of areas in the city of Aqaba were displayed using the Geographic Information System (GIS). Application of the modified Chinese criteria indicates that the cohesive subsurface layers are predominantly non-liquefiable. The types of sediments most susceptible to liquefaction are saturated silt and sand deposits. Two classification schemes were developed in this lique-faction analysis. Our results indicate that the coastal areas of Aqaba have a high potential to liquefy, whereas the eastern parts of the city lie predomi-nantly within a nonliquefaction zone. The critical facilities were overlaid with the liquefaction hazard map of the city and show that only the hotel and the commercial districts lie within a zone of high susceptibility to liquefaction.

30|$|The {{virulence}} {{test was}} conducted at the Laboratory of Molecular Entomology and Bee Pathology (L-MEB), Ghent University following the protocol described by de Graaf et al. (2013) using Apis mellifera carnica larvae. Briefly, plates each consisting of 24 -wells were incubated at 34  °C for 24  h. A group of 30 larvae (in 3 wells) was treated with the Ugandan P. larvae isolate, another group of 30 larvae was treated with the P. larvae strain BRL 230010. Six (6) wells were left empty and filled with 1  ml of distilled water to avoid desiccation. Three hundred (300) µl of the spore-contaminated larval diet (20 spores of P. larvae/µl feed) was pipetted into each well of the treatment group. Three wells for the negative control group were left and fed on non-spore contaminated larval diet during the entire experiment. After 24  h of infection, larvae were transferred to a pre-warmed, fresh normal larval diet plate. The grafting tool was decontaminated between each group to avoid reinfection. Every treatment group received fresh larval diet every 24  h and the plates were analyzed each day under a stereo microscope to determine the health status of the larvae. Old feed was removed daily and replaced with pre-warmed fresh larval diet. After defecation (day 8), the larvae were transferred to pupation plates. Larvae were classified as dead when they stopped breathing (movement of tracheal openings stops) and lost body elasticity. The number of dead larvae was recorded every day. To determine whether P. larvae infection caused {{the death of a}} larva, <b>dead</b> larvae were <b>plated</b> out on MYPGP plates.

40|$|Publisher's version {{archived}} {{with permission}} from publisher. Using extensive surface and subsurface data, we have synthesized the Phanerozoic tectonic and geologic evolution of Syria that {{has important implications for}} eastern Mediterranean tectonic studies and the strategies for hydrocarbon exploration. Syrian tectonic deformation is focused in four major zones that have been repeatedly reactivated throughout the Phanerozoic in response to movement on nearby plate boundaries. They are the Palmyride Mountains, the Euphrates Fault System, the Abd el Aziz-Sinjar uplifts, and the Dead Sea Fault System. The Palmyrides include the SW Palmyride fold and thrust belt and two inverted sub-basins that are now the Bilas and Bishri blocks. The Euphrates Fault System and Abd el Aziz-Sinjar grabens in eastern Syria are large extensional features with a more recent history of Neogene compression and partial inversion. The <b>Dead</b> Sea transform <b>plate</b> boundary cuts through western Syria and has associated pull-apart basins. The geological history of Syria has been reconstructed by combining the interpreted geologic history of these zones with tectonic and lithostratigraphic analyses from the remainder of the country. Specific deformation episodes were penecontemporaneous with regional-scale plate-tectonic events. Following a relatively quiescent early Paleozoic shelf environment, the NE-trending Palmyride/Sinjar Trough formed across central Syria in response to regional compression followed by Permian-Triassic opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean and the eastern Mediterranean. This continued with carbonate deposition in the Mesozoic. Late Cretaceous tectonism was dominated by extension in the Euphrates Fault System and Abd el Aziz-Sinjar Graben in eastern Syria associated with the closing of the Neo-Tethys. Repeated collisions along the northern Arabian margin from the Late Cretaceous to the Late Miocene caused platform-wide compression. This led to the structural inversion and horizontal shortening of the Palmyride Trough and Abd el Aziz-Sinjar Graben...|$|R
40|$|Analyses and {{modeling}} of gravity {{data in the}} Dead Sea pull-apart basin reveal the geometry of the basin and constrain models for its evolution. The basin is located within a valley which defines the <b>Dead</b> Sea transform <b>plate</b> boundary between Africa and Arabia. Three hundred kilometers of continuous marine gravity data, collected in a lake occupying {{the northern part of}} the basin, were integrated with land gravity data from Israel and Jordan to provide coverage to 30 km either side of the basin. Free-air and variable-density Bouguer anomaly maps, a horizontal first derivative map of the Bouguer anomaly, and gravity models of profiles across and along the basin were used with existing geological and geophysical information to infer the structure of the basin. The basin is a long (132 km), narrow (7 - 10 km), and deep (≤ 10 km) full graben which is bounded by subvertical faults along its long sides. The Bouguer anomaly along the axis of the basin decreases gradually from both the northern and southern ends, suggesting that the basin sags toward the center and is not bounded by faults at its narrow ends. The surface expression of the basin is wider at its center (≤ 16 km) and covers the entire width of the transform valley due to the presence of shallower blocks that dip toward the basin. These blocks are interpreted to represent the widening of the basin by a passive collapse of the valley floor as the full graben deepened. The collapse was probably facilitated by movement along the normal faults that bound the transform valley. We present a model in which the geometry of the Dead Sea basin (i. e., full graben with relative along-axis symmetry) may be controlled by stretching of the entire (brittle and ductile) crust along its long axis. There is no evidence for the participation of the upper mantle in the deformation of the basin, and the Moho is not significantly elevated. The basin is probably close to being isostatically uncompensated, and thermal effects related to stretching are expected to be minimal. The amount of crustal stretching calculated from this model is 21 km and the stretching factor is 1. 19. If the rate of crustal stretching is similar to the rate of relative plate motion (6 mm/yr), the basin should be ~ 3. 5 m. y. old, in accord with geological evidence...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 181 - 192. Twenty-seven {{species of}} known or {{suspected}} coral skeletal borers were identified from shallow Hawaiian reefs. In comnarison to inventories of the borer communities collected from other tropical areas Hawaiian corals had {{an abundance of}} polychaetous annelids, fewer species of sipunculans,and acrothoracican barnacles, and far fewer boring sponges. Polychaetes {{were responsible for the}} majority of the bioerosion of dead coral in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. Comparisons of living and dead sections of coral colonies indicated that the borer community was more diverse and abundant in areas of the skeletons lacking living tissue. Skeletal densities of three common coral species with branching growth form were found to influence the abundance of coral borers. The least dense skeletons had greater population densities of borers. It is suggested that these three species of corals can coexist in close proximity due, in part, to the development of varying abilities to withstand invasion by skeletal borers. In order to determine rates, si te preference and seasona. li. ty of settlement a series of settlement plates were cut from coral and placed in the field at ten sites in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. Extrapolating from the surface area of the settlement plates, mean recruitment rates of coral borers were found to be 10, 000 - 50, 000 individuals m- 2 month- 1. The recruitment rates and species composition of epibiotic and borer faunas settling; on the <b>dead</b> coral <b>plates</b> differed dramatically between areas in Kaneohe Bay due to the effects of differences in physical and biological factors caused by sewage and slltation. The larvae of coral borers generally lacked clear seasonal settlement periods, suggesting that one or more mechanisms (e. g. continuous reproduction, long pelagic phase, etc.) functioned to assure the presence of larvae throughout the year. The ultimate cause for the development of such a strategy may be that the time and location of the production of suitable settlement sites on the reef surface is. unpredictable. Some of the larvae of both epibiotic and borer species exhibited settlement selectivity with respect to the position of the settlement surface. This finding indicates that the distribution of borers in coral skeletons might be due, in part, to active selection by the laryae for particular conditions. Development of the epibiotic and borer communities of dead coral was monitored using sequentially collected blocks cut from the coral Porites lobata. The abundance and species composition of these communities were found to differ between sites in Kaneohe Bay because of several biological and physical factors. In the south bay increased food supplies (in the form of plankton and plankton-derived detrital material). due to sewage enrichment, support extensive populations of filter and deposit-feeding invertebrates including coral borers. Sewage diversion did not appear to have had any dramatic effect on these communities by the end of the study period. In the north bay, where food availability is lower, fewer borers and epibiotic organisms were collected. The effects of fish grazing are considered to be another important factor determining the species composition and abundance of the coral borer community. Grazing fish were rare in south Kaneohe Bay during the study period, which may help to explain the abundance of sessile epifaunal species. In the north bay fish grazing is extensive and contributes to the growth of encrusting coralline algae on the test blocks and the benthos. Based on the results of the long term block study it was found that in Hawaii sessile filter-feeding invertebrates do not exclude coral borers from the substratum or inhibit their growth. In south Kaneohe Bay, where conditions caused increased abundances and growth rates of filter and depositfeeding invertebrates, bioerosion rates were accelerated. Encrusting coralline algae, which flourish on reefs exposed to fish grazing (eg. north Kaneohe Bay), inhibit settlement of borers and grow over burrow apertures, thus reducing the population of borers within the dead coral. Bioerosion rates of exposed, coralline algal covered, dead coral substrata are very low on pristine shallow Hawaiian reefs...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, HILIC and RPLC columns were {{evaluated}} and compared {{to assess the}} true performance potential of the different supports. This comparison was first carried out for six commercially available columns in Chapter 3. The higher external porosity and larger minimum separation impedance (Emin) of the HILIC columns indicated that HILIC columns have a lower packing quality than their RPLC counterparts. It was also demonstrated that the column dead volume (t 0) can be severely under- or overestimated depending on the mobile phase conditions used and {{this can lead to}} biased permeability (Kv 0) values. Therefore, to omit errors that might arise from an inaccurate assessment of the column <b>dead</b> volume, all <b>plate</b> height and kinetic plot data were expressed {{as a function of the}} interstitial velocity (ui). Comparing the van Deemter curves obtained for HILIC and RPLC columns, it was found that HILIC columns have lower column efficiencies. However, for the kinetic performance comparison, both stationary phase types performed similar. A slightly larger reduction in analysis time was obtained when switching from HPLC columns to UHPLC formats in HILIC. This theoretical finding was also demonstrated for the practical separation of tetracycline and its main impurities and was attributed to the much lower viscosity of the mobile phase used under HILIC conditions. Although the selected RPLC and HILIC columns were obtained from the same manufacturer, using the same native silica for their HILIC and RPLC columns, differences in packing quality were unavoidable. Since these packing differences can have a large influence on the observed kinetic performance, a novel protocol was developed in Chapter 4 to compare HILIC and RPLC columns under conditions of identical packing structure. This was done by developing a stripping procedure for the adequate removal of the stationary phase of RPLC columns. In this way, the same column could first be studied under RPLC conditions and subsequently under HILIC conditions. The complete removal of the stationary phase was confirmed by retention studies and thermogravimetric analyses. Moreover, an unchanged external porosity and pressure drop confirmed that the stripping protocol left the column structure unaffected. An accurate plate height analysis under both retention mechanisms demonstrated that the reduced c-term is significantly larger under HILIC conditions, while the b-term is significantly lower. Band broadening originating from eddy diffusion, which is normally ascribed to phenomena occurring outside the particles, was also demonstrated to be higher under HILIC conditions. Since the comparison under HILIC and RPLC conditions was performed under conditions of identical packing quality, it was concluded that both the retention mechanism and the internal structure of the particle have a strong influence on the observed eddy dispersion. This makes the comparison of the packing quality of different particle types almost impossible without appropriate means to correct for the intra-particle effect on the observed eddy diffusion. Accurate molecular diffusion coefficient (Dm) values in different mobile phases are crucial in fundamental studies of column performance. In Chapter 5, the Taylor-Aris method was employed to measure the Dm-values of 45 polar and apolar compounds in a wide range of mobile phase compositions typically used in RPLC and HILIC studies. These values were fitted relatively well to second-order polynomials, enabling to deduce Dm-values for these compounds in any desired composition of the mobile phase. It was also demonstrated that the buffer concentration has an influence on the molecular diffusion of charged molecules. To conclude, some future prospects were made in Chapter 6. A potentially new approach to estimate longitudinal diffusion efficiently was discussed. Further application of the stripping protocol to a set of compounds showing a broader range of zone retention factors (k"= 0 to 10) to study the mechanisms of intra-particle diffusivity and different contributions to eddy dispersion under HILIC and RP conditions was discussed as well. status: publishe...|$|R
