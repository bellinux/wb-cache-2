2500|$|In Xenoblade Chronicles X, she voices Lin Lee Koo, one of {{the main}} {{characters}} in the story.

Morris sought to preserve Lin's characteristics as strong female figure in her portrayal, describing her as [...] "super smart and very self-reliant... She can cook dinner and also <b>kick</b> <b>your</b> ass." [...] Morris's take on the character did however include using a deeper, older-sounding voice for Lin, partially to accommodate for the age change, and partially because it was believed that Western audiences would find the high-pitched Japanese version [...] "grating". She voiced between 1,600 and 1,800 lines of dialogue for Lin – above average for a video game. In response to a controversy over Lin's bikini costumes being more covered up in the North American and European versions, Morris said that it bothered her that Lin was only 13 years old, but sees the censorship more as localization and that it would make the game open up to a wider audience.|$|E

[...] But we're finding {{it hard to believe}} that she has five (five!) blokes thinking she's sex-on-legs and lusting after her Tango'd torso. Perhaps Michael, Ray, Jack, Max and Derek all have a thing about too-tight Lycra pencil skirts and make-up that looks like it's been applied by a five year old on acid." [...] Sarah Dempster from The Guardian dubbed the storyline [...] "Who Banged Kat?", [...] "a question to which the only sane response is 'Pass us the remote, love. [...] is on Five.'"
