5|$|The Chicxulub Crater lends {{support to}} the theory {{postulated}} by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, may have resulted from a bolide impact (the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley, postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could {{have been caused by}} just such a large impact. The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the Cretaceous period, and the start of the Paleogene period. It coincides with the K–Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K–Pg boundary. In 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record; the study concluded that the impact <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error. The theory is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Some critics, including paleontologist Robert Bakker, argue that such an impact would have killed frogs as well as dinosaurs, yet the frogs survived the extinction event. Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction, and thus could not have been the causal factor. However, this conclusion is unsupported by radioactive dating and sedimentology.|$|E

2500|$|Drinking glasses have {{colorful}} {{names and}} can reflect a customer's ability to drink pulque. Large two-liter <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> called macetas (flower pots), one-liter <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> called cañones (cannons), half–liters are called [...] chivitos (little goats), quarter-liter <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> catrinas (dandies), and eighth-liter <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> tornillos (screws). Traditionally, these <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> {{made from a}} greenish, hand blown <b>glass.</b> Pulque can <b>be</b> drunk straight from the barrel or can {{have a number of}} additives, such as fruit or nuts, added. Pulque prepared this way is called curado or cured.|$|R
25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the eclipse, many {{counterfeit}} <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> put up for sale. Effective eclipse glasses must not only block most visible light, but most UV and infrared light as well. For visible light, the user should only be able to see the Sun, sunglint reflected off shiny metal, halogen bulbs, the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs, and similarly intense sources. Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer, which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 1950, McGuirk’s career {{came to an}} end. In Little Rock, Arkansas, McGuirk {{was being}} driven to a {{restaurant}} by his wrestling pupil, Robert “Bob” Clay. In an attempt to prevent a collision, Clay locked the car’s brakes, and McGuirk was thrown against the front windshield. McGuirk’s tinted <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> shattered and {{the side of the}} glasses covering his good eye were fractured, blinding McGuirk permanently. It was another Oklahoman, Danny Hodge, who rose to prominence in the Junior Heavyweight field. By 1960, Hodge became the principal headliner for McGuirk.|$|E
25|$|Leonard's primary health {{concern is}} his lactose intolerance: his {{consuming}} melon or any dairy products (and {{according to the}} pilot episode, even corn) results in flatulence. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of astigmatism, and cannot see without them. On one occasion, when his <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> broken at the movie theater, he had to surreptitiously return to his apartment and retrieve his backup glasses. In order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate {{through the living room}} by using a helmet camera. Leonard states in one episode that he suffers from sleep apnea. During his relationship with Leslie Winkle, he tells her that many members of his family have died from heart disease and thus he has a genetic disposition to the condition.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{my thesis}} is to apprasial {{of quality of}} flat glass. Firstly the <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> introduced, next glass-making, {{characteristics}} and kinds of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> mentioned. Next implementing legislation and disagreements of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> desribed. The most frequent disagreemets are explored. In this part quality control tools are applied, Pareto a Ishikawa diagram. Finally the quality of flat <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> evaluated...|$|R
50|$|Smoked <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> held in {{the smoke}} of a candle flame (or other inefficiently burning hydrocarbon) such that one surface of the sheet of <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> covered in a layer of smoke residue. The <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> then used as a medium for {{recording}} pen traces in scientific instruments.|$|R
25|$|Glassware {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered glassware to replace broken and stolen glassware for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne glasses, claret glasses, burgundy glasses, madeira glasses, sherry glasses, hock glasses, and cordial glasses. The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), except for the madeira glasses—which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The hock <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira glasses may also have been red colored. She ordered another four decanters on March 25.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{protection}} such as {{welding goggles}} should be worn at all times, including {{to protect the}} eyes against glare and flying sparks. Special safety eyewear must be used—both to protect the welder {{and to provide a}} clear view through the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe eyestrain and eye damage. Didymium eyewear, developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very good eye protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens.|$|E
25|$|Later {{attempts}} at discovering whether Lucas had actually killed anyone apart from Powell and Rich were complicated by Lucas's {{ability to make}} an accurate deduction that seemed to substantiate a confession. In one instance, he explained how he had correctly identified a victim in a group photograph through her wearing spectacles; a pair of <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> {{on a table in}} a crime scene photo shown to him earlier. There were also suggestions that the interview tapes showed that, despite Lucas's supposedly low IQ, he had adroitly read the reactions of those interviewing him and altered what he was saying, thereby making his confessions more consistent with facts known to law enforcement. The most serious allegation against investigators, that they had let Lucas read case files on unsolved crimes and thus enabled him to come up with convincingly detailed confessions, made it virtually impossible to determine if, as some continue to suspect, he had been telling the truth to the Lucas Task Force about a relatively large number of the murders.|$|E
50|$|Architectural <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> that <b>is</b> {{used as a}} {{building}} material. It is most typically used as transparent glazing material in the building envelope, including windows in the external walls. <b>Glass</b> <b>is</b> also used for internal partitions and as an architectural feature. When used in buildings, <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> often of a safety type, which include reinforced, toughened and laminated glasses.|$|R
50|$|Annealed <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> without {{internal}} stresses caused by heat treatment, i.e., rapid cooling, or by toughening or heat strengthening. Glass becomes annealed {{if it is}} heated above a transition point then allowed to cool slowly, without being quenched. Float <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> annealed {{during the process of}} manufacture. However, most toughened <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> made from float <b>glass</b> that has <b>been</b> specially heat-treated.|$|R

500|$|U2 3D was {{slated to}} be {{screened}} only in IMAX theaters, but the large {{increase in the number}} of digital 3D theaters following post-production prompted the filmmakers to expand the release to include those cinemas. Two different types of polarized 3D <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> used for the IMAX 3D and digital 3D showings. The IMAX 3D version of the film used glasses with one lens polarized horizontally and one polarized vertically, while the digital 3D version used glasses with two circularly polarized lenses. John Modell described the IMAX version as a [...] "more immersive experience", and stated that the digital 3D version features more vivid colors.|$|E
50|$|As a {{material}} stained <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> that has <b>been</b> coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. The coloured <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> crafted into {{stained glass windows}} in which small pieces of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design. The term stained <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.|$|R

500|$|The Bates {{method is}} an {{alternative}} therapy aimed at improving eyesight. Eye-care physician William Horatio Bates, M.D. (1860–1931) attributed nearly all sight problems to habitual strain of the eyes, and felt that <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> harmful and never necessary. Bates self-published a book, , {{as well as a}} magazine, , (and earlier collaborated with Bernarr MacFadden on a correspondence course) detailing his approach to helping people relax such [...] "strain", and thus, he claimed, improve their sight. His techniques centered on visualization and movement. He placed particular emphasis on imagining black letters and marks, and the movement of such. He also felt that exposing the eyes to sunlight would help alleviate the [...] "strain".|$|E
500|$|The Stonewall Inn, {{located at}} 51 and 53 Christopher Street, {{along with several}} other establishments in the city, was owned by the Genovese crime family. In 1966, {{three members of the}} Mafia {{invested}} $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals. Once a week a police officer would collect envelopes of cash as a payoff; the Stonewall Inn had no liquor license. It had no running water behind the bar—used <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> run through tubs of water and immediately reused. There were no fire exits, and the toilets overran consistently. Though the bar was not used for prostitution, drug sales and other [...] "cash transactions" [...] took place. It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed; dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay club.|$|E
500|$|In Pittsfield, Virginia, Tony Reed and {{two other}} {{teenagers}} meet in the woods late at night, but they are interrupted by a sheriff's deputy. Moments later the deputy is murdered, killed with his own flashlight. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later examine the deputy's body: the blow that killed the man was so ferocious that his <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> pushed {{through the back of}} his skull. They question the suspect, teenager Tony Reed, whose fingerprints were found on the flash light, but he denies any part in the murder. Mulder and Scully agree that Tony is innocent, although Mulder's theory of spirit involvement is not shared by Scully. Scully, on the other hand, suggests they question Tony's friends. Mulder and Scully visit Tony's school and speak with the two teenagers who were with Tony in the woods: the sheriff's son, Max Harden, and his girlfriend Chastity. Chastity seems concerned about Tony when Mulder and Scully tell her he may go to jail. However, Tony is later released when the murder weapon mysteriously goes missing from the evidence room. Mulder and Scully review video footage from the evidence room that shows the flashlight simply disappear. However, a blur on the video footage attracts Mulder's attention and later analysis by an expert reveals the blurred object is solid and matches the local high school's colors.|$|E
5000|$|Low-dispersion <b>glass</b> (LD <b>glass)</b> <b>is</b> a type {{of glass}} with low dispersion. Crown <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{an example of a}} {{relatively}} inexpensive low-dispersion glass.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glass</b> floors <b>are</b> {{made with}} {{transparent}} <b>glass</b> when it <b>is</b> useful to view something from above or below; whereas translucent <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> used {{when there is}} no need to view through.

50|$|Chemically {{strengthened}} <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> a type {{of glass}} that has increased strength. When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (annealed) glass. For this reason, it is not considered a safety <b>glass</b> and must <b>be</b> laminated if a safety <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> required. Chemically strengthened <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> typically six to eight times the strength of annealed glass.|$|R
500|$|Stratton tried {{variations}} of the experiment {{over the next few}} years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> taken out, though the world looked straight side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around. Then he tried the experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where his touch and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever {{you have to do to}} get me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E
2500|$|Although many bars served absinthe in {{standard}} glassware, {{a number of}} <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> specifically designed for the French absinthe preparation ritual. Absinthe <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> typically fashioned with a dose line, bulge, or bubble in the lower portion denoting how much absinthe should be poured.

30|$|The {{translucent}} glass vessels {{of this study}} are consistent with and typical of 1 st millennium BCE Hellenistic production in the eastern Mediterranean region. Vessel form, style, manufacture method and colour are independent of reduced <b>glass</b> composition. <b>Glasses</b> <b>are</b> decoloured with manganese, which also produced one purple <b>glass.</b> Blue <b>is</b> produced in one sample by cobalt with a little copper, and one green and one blue <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> coloured by copper.
