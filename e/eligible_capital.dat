This decision can explain why banks finance growth with debt and raise hybrid capital instead of common equity if they are close to the regulatory minimum or have low levels of provisions or earnings that compute as <b>eligible</b> <b>capital.</b> We find little support for the trade-off theory because banks do not seem to target an optimal level of capital structure during the sample period because liquidity and capital needs are covered with debt and hybrid instruments.

30|$|Besides {{the effect}} on the pure {{decision}} of issuing versus not issuing, we analyze which instruments banks choose to respond to liquidity needs. If the decision on the instrument follows the pecking order, banks would only issue debt instruments to minimize the cost of asymmetric information and, therefore, the liquidity and growth variables would only be significant for debt issuances. If the decision on the instruments follows the trade-off theory, we should observe significant coefficients in all financial instruments because the banks have to combine the issuances of all types of financial instruments to maintain the same proportion of each component. This result could be consistent with the fulfillment of capital regulation, if banks issue both hybrid and capital instruments to keep their regulatory capital levels constant. Nonetheless, if the issuances of <b>eligible</b> <b>capital</b> instruments are meant to fulfill capital regulation at the lowest possible cost, we could observe issuances of debt and hybrid instruments only, but not capital instruments.|$|E

40|$|We study {{whether and}} how capital {{regulation}} affects banks’ loan loss provisions. Using handpicked data on 46 Nordic banks, we find that banks use discretion to reduce loan loss provisions for regulatory capital management purposes. Exercising discretion to reduce provisions shifts capital from the expected loss buffer to the unexpected loss buffer {{at the expense of}} banks’ overall ability to absorb loan losses. Controlling for non-discretionary determinants of loan loss provisions, we find that banks reduce provisions when an increase in capital requirements puts pressure on <b>eligible</b> <b>capital</b> for regulatory purposes. Additionally, we find that banks’ regulatory capital position influences provisioning behavior. We show that a stronger regulatory capital position coming into the year yields higher levels of loan loss provisions, while an improvement in regulatory capital position during the year constitutes a reduction in loan loss provisions. When studying SIFI-banks and IRB-banks, we find no evidence indicating that newly enacted regulations are effective in limiting discretionary provisions for regulatory purposes. Our analyses indicate that banks exercise discretionary provisioning behavior when circumventing regulatory capital requirements...|$|E

We estimate that the adoption of a law making child murders specifically <b>eligible</b> for <b>capital</b> punishment is associated with an approximately 19 % reduction in the rate of homicides of youth victims. We estimate deterrence findings of similar magnitude when we turn to the estimation of an empirical specification that draws on variations in the full set of eligibility criteria and that parameterizes general eligibility statutes using a simulated measure of the propensity of each state to extend capital eligibility to a given murder.

To empirically test the effects of these variables on excess loan demand, a statistical model is developed which modifies the theoretical model by employing agricultural banks 2 ̆ 7 responses to a survey undertaken by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago concerning lending limits. The question posed to the banks asked: 2 ̆ 2 Compared to five years ago (end of 1974 compared to end of 1979), is the number of actual or potential farm customers in your area whose credit needs exceed your bank 2 ̆ 7 s individual legal lending limit higher, lower, or unchanged? 2 ̆ 2;Bank survey response is then used as a 0, 1 dependent variable (0 if the response is less, or no change in the number of farm customers, and 1 if the response is more farm customers) and is regressed on a bank 2 ̆ 7 s <b>eligible</b> <b>capital</b> account, average farm size in the area serviced by a rural bank, market value of agricultural products sold in the area serviced by a rural bank, agricultural production expenses in the area serviced by a rural bank, utilization of capacity of farmland in the area serviced by a rural bank, and a dummy variable for bank type to see if differences exist between unit and branch banks;The results show that <b>eligible</b> <b>capital</b> account and the dummy variable for bank type are highly significant in explaining bank survey response.

30|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to a variety of}} fields. First, it explores the driving forces in the deterioration of bank capital during the pre-crisis period. Mehran et al. (2011) and Acharya et al. (2011) provide evidence of this phenomenon, but there has not been any empirical analysis that explains the determinants of such deterioration. Second, it is the first analysis to our knowledge that analyzes the determinants of banks’ financing choices by accounting for the corporate finance theories and the role of capital regulation. There are a handful of studies that study issuances of financial instruments, but they focus only on a subset, such as long-term debt in European banks (Rixtel et al. 2016), subordinated debt in the United States (Covitz and Harrison 2004), or bonds and securitization in European countries (Carbó-Valverde et al. 2017; Almazán et al. 2015). Third, it provides policy arguments to justify a tougher definition of regulatory capital in Basel III, since banks have incentives to comply with capital regulation through the financing alternative of lowest cost that is recognized as <b>eligible</b> <b>capital.</b> This incentive indicates that the problem of credit expansions or recessions in capital are not only due to procyclicality (Repullo and Suárez 2012; Repullo et al. 2010; Ayuso et al. 2004), but also because of the composition of the capital.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of global solvency supervisory principles and the European Solvency II regulatory framework to Takaful schemes, given their growth potential in both Western and Islamic countries. Due to their particular nature, concerns have been raised as to the suitability of international standards for sound and proper supervision. On the one hand, growing numbers of potential customers are already present in many Western countries, but only in {{a few of these}} countries are these products available, and even then in limited numbers, due at least in part to regulatory and supervisory constraints. In many emerging countries, on the other hand, these schemes represent a significant portion of insurance business, despite low levels of insurance penetration and a limited diffusion of specific regulation and supervision, driving attention to risks for customers arising from extreme events. This contribution focuses on major supervisory complexities surrounding the introduction of Takaful in European countries, with regard to the forthcoming Solvency II framework. Its three-pillared approach encompasses financial, governance and risk management requirements, as well as transparency and enhanced disclosure: in all these areas, several issues arise when considering Takaful schemes (e. g. size of market risks, definition of <b>eligible</b> <b>capital,</b> potential conflicts of interest, segregation of funds and accountability).

30|$|How {{does the}} {{development}} of financial markets affect the financing choices of banks that are subject to capital regulation? Prior to the crisis, financial innovation and {{the development of}} markets allowed banks to decouple the evolution of credit from their capacity to collect deposits. The development of financial instruments, such as securitization, also granted small and medium banks access to financial markets (Almazán et al. 2015). Furthermore, innovation has enabled banks to expand their balance sheets and increase their reliance on financial sources other than deposits. However, banks must comply with capital regulation imposed by the Basel Accords. 1 Thus, the banks’ choice of the financial instruments to fund their activity has to be consistent with the fulfillment of the capital ratios set by regulation. Therefore, banks cannot base their growth only on debt securities but must issue instruments that are <b>eligible</b> as regulatory <b>capital</b> if internally generated funds cannot guarantee the bank’s target level of regulatory capital. Given that not all the financial instruments that are <b>eligible</b> as regulatory <b>capital</b> have the same capacity to absorb losses, banks’ choices on the type of issuances could affect not only the level but also the quality of their capital holdings.|$|R
40|$|In the 2000 budgets, {{both the}} federal and Ontario governments {{introduced}} changes to the tax treatment of employee stock options for the explicit purpose of making their tax treatment in Canada similar to or more favourable than that in the United States. The federal budget added a deferral, similar to that currently applicable to options granted by Canadian-controlled private corporations, for up to $ 100, 000 per year of public company stock options. The Ontario budget introduced an exemption from tax for employees involved {{in research and development}} on the first $ 100, 000 per year of employee benefits arising on the exercise of qualified stock options or on <b>eligible</b> <b>capital</b> gains arising from the sale of shares acquired by the exercise of eligible stock options. These proposals reflect the apparent acceptance by the two governments that there is a “brain drain” from Canada to the United States of knowledge workers in the “new” economy and that reductions in Canadian taxes should stem this drain. In the author’s view, the tax treatment of employee stock options, even without these changes, is overly generous. Both {{the federal and}} provincial proposals ignore the fact that most employee stock options are taxed more favourably in Canada than in the United States in any event. In particular, most employee stock option benefits in Canada are taxed at capital gains tax rates, whereas in the United States most are taxed at full rates. While the US Internal Revenue Code does provide capital gains tax treatment for certain employee stock option benefits, a number of preconditions must be met. Most important, the shares acquired pursuant to the options must be held for a minimum of one year after the option is exercised. In addition, there are monetary limits on the amount of options that qualify for capital gains treatment. In Canada, there are generally no holding period requirements or monetary limits that apply in order for the option holder to benefit from capital gains tax rates. Empirical evidence indicates {{that the vast majority of}} employees in the United States exercise their options and immediately sell the shares acquired. These “cashless exercises” do not benefit from capital gains treatment in the United States, whereas similar cashless exercises in Canada generally do. This empirical evidence suggests not only that the 2000 budget proposals are unwarranted, but also that the existing treatment of employee stock options in Canada is already more generous than that in the United States. This article begins with a theoretical “benchmark” for the taxation of employee stock options. The author suggests that employee stock options should be treated in the same manner as other income from employment. In theory, the value of the benefit should be included in income when the option is granted or vests. However, owing to the practical difficulty of valuing employee stock options, the theoretical benchmark proposed is that the value of the benefit (the difference between the fair market value of the shares acquired and the strike price under the option) be taxed when the shares are acquired, and the employer be entitled to a corresponding deduction. The employee stock option rules in Canada and the United States are then compared and contrasted with each other and the benchmark treatment. The article then examines the arguments that have been made for favourable treatment of employee stock options. Included in this critique is a review of the recent empirical work on the Canadian brain drain. Empirical studies suggest that the brain drain—if it exists at all—is small and that, despite what many newspapers and right-wing think-tanks would have us believe, lower taxes in the United States are not the cause. One study, concluding that taxes do have an effect on migration, suggests that even if Canada adopted a tax system identical to that in the United States, the brain drain would be reduced by a mere 10 percent. Indeed, even if Canada eliminated income tax altogether, it would not stop the brain drain. If governments here want to spend money in order to stem the brain drain, they should focus on other areas. For example, Canada produces fewer university graduates in the fields of mathematics, sciences, and engineering than any other G 7 country except Italy. The short supply of university graduates in these fields, the apparent loss of top-calibre academics to US universities, and the consequent lower levels of university research in these areas (an important spawning ground for new ideas in the “new” knowledge-based economy) suggest that Canada may be better served by devoting more resources to its university institutions, particularly in post-graduate programs, rather than continuing the current trend of budget cuts that universities have endured and may further endure if taxes are reduced. As far as employee stock options are concerned, if Canada does want to look to the United States for guidance on tax reform (which it seems to do with increasing frequency of late), it should adopt the US rules applicable to nonstatutory options, which are close to the proposed benchmark treatment. In the absence of preferential tax treatment, employee stock options would still be included in compensation packages provided that there were sound business reasons for their use. No persuasive evidence has been put forward that the use of stock options, in the absence of tax incentives, is suboptimal. Indeed, the US experience suggests quite the opposite. </p...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to add to the growing debate about the impact of the Basel II Capital Accord (see Base II, June 2004) on the functioning of internationally active banks. A technical contribution is made to this discussion by constructing a stochastic continuous-time model for the dynamics of the total risk-weighted assets (RWAs) of such a bank. RWAs exhibit random behaviour because they partly depend on the uncertain rates of return of bank investments. Also, such assets are weighted by considering the main risks that banks have to bare, viz., credit, operational and market risk. Here the credit risk capital requirement is viewed from the perspective of the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, operational risk capital is considered within the framework of the standardized approach and a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model describes the capital charge for market risk. Total RWAs (TRWAs) are used to calculate the capital adequacy ratio that is regarded as the most important component of bank supervision and risk management. In particular, according to Basel II, the capital adequacy of banks is determined by the ratio of <b>eligible</b> regulatory <b>capital</b> to TRWAs. ...|$|R

One such group is individuals who are intellectually disabled (the term which replaced the long-used mental retardation). But in exempting such individuals from {{capital punishment}} in its decision in Atkins v. Virginia, the Court left it to the states to establish metrics for determining which defendants are in fact intellectually disabled so as to warrant exemption. This resulted in significantly diverging standards between states in adopted evaluative mechanisms. Specifically, many states relied exclusively on IQ testing without taking into account the inherent error present in such testing. These states also refused to consider additional evidence of a defendant’s intellectual ability if a defendant fell above a bright-line score on IQ testing. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the exclusion of intellectually disabled defendants from capital punishment in Hall v. Florida but again declined to establish metrics for states to adopt in evaluating potentially intellectually disabled capital defendants. This note proposes the adoption of a uniform, multipronged system by which to evaluate capital defendants who allege their intellectual disability exempts them from capital punishment. This system, acting in accordance with psychological standards for evaluating intellectual disability, would look not only at IQ testing, but would also consider evidence of factors within the realms of practical and social intelligence, to conduct a holistic evaluation of a defendant’s intellectual ability. By adopting such a standard, this would ensure that the Court’s intention in both Atkins and Hall—to prevent the cruel and unusual execution of the intellectually disabled—is actually achieved in all jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|In Gregg v. Georgia, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the death penalty was {{constitutional}} so long as it provided a non-arbitrary statutory mechanism for determining who are the worst of the worst, and therefore, deserving of the death penalty. As a general matter, this process of narrowing the class of death eligible offenders is done through the codification of aggravating factors. If the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more aggravating factors exists, then a defendant convicted of murder is eligible for the ultimate sentence. There is, however, a critical, unanswered, and under-theorized issue raised by the use of aggravating factors to serve this constitutionally mandated filtering function. Can death eligibility be predicated on vicarious aggravating factor liability—is there vicarious death penalty liability? A pair of cases, collectively known as the Supreme Court’s Enmund/Tison doctrine, recognize that there is no per se bar on the imposition of the death penalty for non-killing accomplices. But these cases considered only felony murder liability and did not address the question of whether a non-killer can be rendered death eligible on the basis of vicariously imposed aggravating factors. Presently, many state statutes allow aggravating factors to be proven vicariously (or are silent on the question); under such a rule, the existence or absence of one or more aggravating factors will often bear little relation to the defendant’s individual culpability. Because a defendant can be made <b>eligible</b> for <b>capital</b> murder through his participation in the crime with others—he is liable for murder as an accomplice, under a theory of co-conspirator or Pinkerton liability, or felony murder—in many cases we can have little confidence that a statute’s aggravating factors are serving their constitutional function of rationally determining who will live and who will die. This article is the first to identify this constitutional problem and to provide a framework for resolving it. After parsing a variety of capital sentencing statutes we propose a framework for determining the legislative intent behind an aggravating factor and for ensuring a sufficient level of culpability before a non-killing defendant may be sentenced to death...|$|R

If the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, then the jury is to recommend death; if the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, then the jury is to recommend life.

Results indicated that death-qualified venirepersons, when compared to excludables, were more likely to endorse aggravating circumstances. Excludable participants, when compared to death-qualified venirepersons, were more likely to endorse nonstatutory mitigators. There was no significant difference between death-qualified and excludable venirepersons with respect to their endorsement of 6 out of 7 statutory mitigators. It would appear that the Furman v.
