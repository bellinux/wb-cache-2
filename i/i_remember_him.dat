500|$|In his {{biography}} of Simpson, Put Me Back on My Bike, William Fotheringham quoted Alan Ramsbottom as saying, [...] "Tom {{went on the}} [...] Tour de France with one suitcase for his kit and another with his stuff, drugs and recovery things", which Fotheringham said was confirmed by Simpson's roommate Colin Lewis. Ramsbottom added, [...] "Tom {{took a lot of}} chances. He took a lot of it [...] <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event. He showed me the box, and had to take one every few days." [...] although he implied that other competitors were involved. Lewis recalled Simpson acquiring a small box at their hotel. Simpson explained to him: [...] "That's my year's supply of Micky Finns'. That lot cost me £800." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Norman Whitfield {{had always}} wanted to work with Paul Buckmaster, the British {{arranger}} and composer. One day he called Buckmaster and invited him to work on some recordings he had finished. After meeting, they decided to contact songwriter Miles Gregory to use one of his songs for Whitfield's record group Rose Royce. Buckmaster found that Gregory was under medication from overuse of drugs and [...] "was in considerable discomfort, if not in outright pain. He didn't write a song and dance about his pain, but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> sitting at the piano and wincing. So before jumping on the thing that Miles was merely indulging himself and writing, one has to remember that the guy was in a lot of pain." [...] Nevertheless, Whitfield and Buckmaster encouraged Gregory to write the song and the result was [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore", inspired by Gregory's own situation and his deteriorating physical health.|$|E
500|$|The {{two sides}} to Poulenc's musical nature caused {{misunderstanding}} during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, [...] "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested {{in the works of}} younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, [...] "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today." [...] Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, [...] "There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [...] It was not progress." [...] Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: [...] "You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music".|$|E

6000|$|Our host was, as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him,</b> a tall {{thin man}} of quiet dignity and notable power of expression. His words were well chosen and his manner urbane. [...] "I want you people to settle right down {{here with me}} for the winter," [...] he said. [...] "In fact I shall try to persuade Richard to buy a place here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andy {{was pleased}} to hear that <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him.</b> He was a good street man; and {{he was more than}} that--he {{respected}} his profession, and he was satisfied with 300 per cent. profit. He had plenty of offers to go into the illegitimate drug and garden seed business; but he was never to be tempted off of the straight path.|$|R
500|$|Sellers, in his memoirs, {{described}} Eckfeldt as [...] "a man of staunch integrity, a cautious, careful, {{orderly and}} painstaking man; {{he was not}} one of the dashing, pushing, inventive mechanics, though under his care many apparently slight improvements were gradually adopted that in the aggregate amounted to a great deal in the economy of working. He was by no means deficient in inventive ability." [...] Nevertheless, as Eckfeldt aged {{in the service of the}} Mint in the late 1820s and into the 1830s, he was reluctant to adopt the innovations being proposed by his fellow Mint officer, Melter and Refiner Franklin Peale. [...] Peale, like Eckfeldt of a mechanical bent, had many suggestions for improvements to the coinage machinery, some of which Eckfeldt adopted. Eckfeldt stated to Sellers, [...] "If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down". According to Sellers, [...] "the giving up of almost life-long pets that had been Mr. Eckfeldt's constant care would naturally go hard, and still harder coming from another department, but as improvements gradually crept in and proved their efficiency Mr. Eckfeldt gave full credit where it belonged, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> becoming quite enthusiastic over the labor saving [...] in duplicating working dies".|$|E
2500|$|The aura {{of celebrity}} around Leavitt was such, wrote Henry McFarland in his Sixty Years in Concord and Elsewhere, that [...] "stage-drivers pointed out {{his house to}} {{passengers}} {{as that of a}} person of great renown.... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> as a courtly man with gentle manners." [...] John F. Brown, a local printer for whom McFarland worked, published Leavitt's almanacs, paying the unheard-of sum, said McFarland, of [...] "$100 for the copy." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} in 1987 that Orbison began collaborating with Electric Light Orchestra lead vocalist and bandleader Jeff Lynne on a new album. Concurrently, Lynne was {{completing}} production work on George Harrison's Cloud Nine album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on a song of Harrison's. They subsequently contacted Bob Dylan, who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to Tom Petty's residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour. By that evening, the group had written [...] "Handle with Care", {{which led to the}} concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys, representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself [...] "Lefty Wilbury" [...] after Lefty Frizzell. Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: [...] "Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> as a Baptist minister." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{that small}} room he seemed even bigger than <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him.</b> He wore an old Norfolk jacket, {{and he had}} not shaved for several days. When last I saw him he was spruce enough, but he looked ill at ease: now, untidy and ill-kempt, he looked {{perfectly}} at home. I {{did not know how}} he would take the remark I had prepared.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> {{perfectly}} now. <b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> even, {{the occasion}} of my last visit to the cafe. Louis, with upraised hat, seemed as though he would have passed on, but, curiously enough, I felt a desire to continue the conversation. I had not as yet admitted the fact even to myself; but I was bored, weary of my search, weary to death of my own company and the company of my own acquaintances. I was reluctant to let this little man go.|$|R
6000|$|Louis was half-way {{home when}} he exclaimed, 'There! I have missed Tom Madison a second time. When shall <b>I</b> ever <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> at the right time?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Asher {{explains}} that he and Wilson had many lengthy, intimate discussions centered around their [...] "experiences and feelings about women and the various stages of relationships and so forth". He maintains that his contribution to the music itself was minimal, serving mainly {{as a source of}} second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. On his role as co-lyricist, Asher clarified, [...] "The general tenor of the lyrics was always his... and the actual choice of words was usually mine. I was really just his interpreter." [...] While speaking about [...] "God Only Knows", Wilson reflected: [...] "I think Tony had a musical influence on me somehow. After about ten years, I started thinking about it deeper... because I had never written that kind of song. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> talking about 'Stella by Starlight' and he had a certain love for classic songs." [...] A typical writing session would either start with Wilson playing melody or chord patterns that he'd been working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. Asher called his interactions with Wilson and the Beach Boys an [...] "embarrassing" [...] experience, and that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste. His choice of movies, say, was invariably terrible. ... every four hours we'd spend writing songs, there'd be about 48 hours of these dopey conversations about some dumb book [...] he'd just read. Or else he'd just go on and on about girls." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> well. He was {{president}} of the Broad Church Union and wore side-whiskers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] murmured Lady Valleys {{from the}} window, [...] "he was always uncomfortable, like that. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> as a baby. Bertie never was." ...|$|E
60|$|As I entered he rose {{to greet}} me, his old-time cordial smile of welcome {{lighting}} his handsome face. Apparently he had not aged a minute, but was still the straight, clean-limbed fighting-man of thirty. His keen grey eyes were undimmed, and the only lines upon his face were the lines of iron character and determination that always had been there since first <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him,</b> nearly thirty-five years before.|$|R
50|$|Jaroslav: I do {{not know}} what to say at the moment. He was a good man, {{we had a lot of}} fun together. <b>I</b> will <b>remember</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} for me to adjust myself to his sorrowful decline into old age. I thought of him as he {{appeared}} to me when riding his threshing machine up the coulee road. I recalled the long rifle with which he used to carry off the prizes at the turkey shoots, and especially <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> as he looked while playing the violin on that far off Thanksgiving night in Lewis Valley.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was Jack Berdmore, Philip's brother. Oh yes, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him.</b> He's dead now. He drank {{himself to}} death at last, out in India." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sandringham. Where we live. I got {{the name}} from your father. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> telling {{me there was}} a place called that in England." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "seemed {{to think}} she must. He was such a loveable person. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> [...] <b>him</b> (said she) sitting there with that light upon him, looking so [...] beautiful!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Never {{would you}} have seen your king again, if a young lute player had not {{delivered}} <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> with love and gratitude as long as I live.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so. Do {{you know}} that <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him</b> the first moment that I saw him. But what could I do? When you {{mentioned}} to me my old name, my real name, how could I be honest? I have been driven to do that which has made honesty to me impossible. My life has been a lie; and yet how could I help it? I must live somewhere,--and how could I live anywhere without deceit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{not that}} <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him,</b> or, indeed, ever knew of his coming then, {{if he did}} come. But Jones says that she thinks she remembers him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him,</b> your honour; and he {{has given}} you a safe conduct? It is in luck you are, to {{be going back to}} Ireland again." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> {{as if it}} were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his {{sea-chest}} following {{behind him}} in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have nothing}} valuable," [...] Agatha objected, with a laugh. [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>I</b> made <b>him</b> empty {{his pockets and}} he left two half-dollars! It wasn't a very big fine, and I can send the dollar to some charity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{they tell}} me. And the archdeacon is a wealthy man. So Henry Grantly has got an only daughter? I hope {{she is a}} nice child, for <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> liking <b>him</b> well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} that means," [...] and Merry read over the lines again, while a soft color {{came into her}} cheeks and a little smile of girlish {{pleasure}} began to dimple round her lips; for she was so romantic, this touch of sentiment showed her that her friendship was more valued than she dreamed. But she only said, [...] "How glad <b>I</b> am <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>him,</b> and how surprised he will be to see mayflowers {{in return for the}} lily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> perfectly," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "He was in Number Three Ward {{for some}} time. Surely {{he was a}} clerk {{at one of the}} drygoods stores down-town?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Officer-of-the-deck, {{what does}} this mean? Who is this strange man? I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him.</b> Who is he? And what is {{signified}} by his being led about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Body of me--the old Worcester man?" [...] {{said the}} King. [...] "Oddsfish, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>him</b> well--some harm has {{happened}} to him, I think--Is he not dead, or very sick at least?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{very good}} thing, too. He {{would never have}} been {{anything}} but a torment to Louis. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> telling <b>him</b> he was setting the stones so as to break the neck of some one!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah, to be sure. <b>I</b> <b>remember.</b> Bring <b>him</b> in, {{and tell}} the officer [...] to wait outside. [Servant goes out.] Trotter, will you leave us [...] for a few minutes? But be within hail.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Nay," [...] said Hugh. [...] "I am no child. Where I take a gift, there I render service"; {{and he put}} {{his hands}} between De Aquila's, and swore to be faithful, and, as <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>I</b> kissed <b>him,</b> and De Aquila kissed us both.|$|R
