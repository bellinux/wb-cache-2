5000|$|A wet-transfer <b>film</b> <b>gate,</b> or wet gate for short, is a <b>film</b> <b>gate</b> that is {{submerged}} in liquid, used for film restoration and archival scanning. Submerging {{the film in}} the gate in a liquid with a suitably matched refractive index reduces the effects of scratches on the film, by reducing the refractive effects which divert light that passes through the scratched part of the film. The liquid also acts to lift other forms of defect from the film. [...] Perchloroethylene, a hazardous substance with multiple health and safety risks, is commonly used as the liquid medium in wet gate systems, requiring substantial {{precautions to be taken}} {{to ensure the safety of}} operators and to prevent pollution.|$|E
50|$|The D-20 uses {{a single}} CMOS sensor {{the width of}} a Super 35 <b>film</b> <b>gate</b> aperture. Effectively the D-20, when used with current 35 mm PL mount motion picture lenses, yields the same field of view and depth of field as Super 35 mm film motion picture cameras.|$|E

50|$|For {{production}} {{of his first}} two films, Runaway and Corridor, Lawder built his own contact printer using a incandescent light bulb housed within a coffee can.

50|$|The first Japanese film {{in color}} was Carmen Comes Home {{directed}} by Keisuke Kinoshita and released in 1951. There {{was also a}} black-and-white version of this film available. Tokyo File 212 (1951) was the first American feature film to be shot entirely in Japan. The lead roles were played by Florence Marly and Robert Peyton. It featured the geisha Ichimaru in a short cameo. Suzuki Ikuzos Tonichi Enterprises Company co-produced the <b>film.</b> <b>Gate</b> of Hell, a 1953 film by Teinosuke Kinugasa, was the first movie that filmed using Eastmancolor <b>film,</b> <b>Gate</b> of Hell was both Daieis first color film and the first Japanese color movie to be released outside Japan, receiving an Oscar in 1954 for Best Costume Design by Sanzo Wada and an Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

40|$|Polycrystalline <b>gate</b> <b>films</b> of GexSi 1 ?x were {{deposited}} using {{low pressure}} chemical vapor deposition. To study {{the effects of}} different Ge contents on the noise properties, a value x= 0, 0. 3, and 0. 6 was selected. Samples of 300 and 500 nm thickness were prepared for comparing the thickness effects {{on the quality of the}} <b>gate</b> <b>films.</b> The <b>gate</b> <b>films</b> were implanted with different concentrations of boron. The morphology and electrical properties have been characterized using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Hall-effect measurements. Conductance fluctuations were measured at room temperature. We present here how low-frequency noise depends on the Ge contents, the doping concentration, and on the thickness of the <b>gate</b> <b>film.</b> The 1 /f noise in polycrystalline GexSi 1 ?x can be analyzed in terms of mobility fluctuations caused by lattice scattering...|$|R

50|$|The final {{configuration}} of the camera could run 1-30 frames per second. The Origin II camera featured an optical reflex viewing system with rotating mirror similar to 35 mm film cameras and uses standard PL mount 35 mm <b>film</b> <b>gate</b> lenses. The camera was approximately {{the same size and}} weight as an average 35 mm film cameras with a 400' magazine.|$|E
50|$|This {{effect is}} {{particularly}} pronounced in motion picture cameras. These cameras {{are subject to}} the constant motion of film being dragged through the <b>film</b> <b>gate,</b> so most motion picture cameras have film movements made or plated with wear-resistant alloys such as hard chrome. Given such a relatively reflective pressure plate behind the film, many motion picture films use an anti-halation (and anti-static) backing.|$|E
50|$|Video cameras do {{not have}} this problem, as any {{malfunction}} to the sensor will render the entire system useless. The Arri D-20 and D-21 system, however, does have removable lenses and a rotating optical shutter, {{which means that the}} CMOS sensor can be exposed {{in much the same way}} as a <b>film</b> <b>gate</b> and thus needs to be kept assiduously clean.|$|E

5000|$|Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe {{is a short}} {{documentary}} film directed by Les Blank in 1980 which depicts director Werner Herzog living up to his promise that he would eat his shoe if Errol Morris ever completed the <b>film</b> <b>Gates</b> of Heaven.

50|$|As the {{traditional}} vertical-run Contax shutter required considerable space both {{above and below}} the <b>film</b> <b>gate</b> for the drum rollers, the upper roller takes up the critical space required for the reflex housing mechanism, making it dimensionally impossible to use it for a satisfactory SLR camera. Winzenberg solved the problem by the use of a completely new horizontal-run focal-plane shutter, thus allowing space for the reflex housing.|$|E
50|$|Some {{models of}} film scanner are {{intermittent}} pull-down film scanners which scan each frame individually, locked {{down in a}} pin-registered <b>film</b> <b>gate,</b> taking roughly a second per frame. Continuous-scan film scanners, where the film frames are scanned as the film is continuously moved past the imaging pick up device, are typically evolved from earlier telecine mechanisms, and can act as such at lower resolutions.|$|E
50|$|Some {{people had}} their H-16 camera {{converted}} to Super 16. This format is highly suited to telecine conversion, as Super 16 {{is close to}} the 16:9 electronic image format. Some conversions were more successful than others. Bolex (latterly) did offer a factory Super 16mm camera. This has the appropriate markings in the viewfinder and the <b>film</b> <b>gate</b> is machined and polished to professional standards.|$|E

50|$|DFT has {{demonstrated}} and delivered a full immersion wet-transfer <b>film</b> <b>gate</b> for Scanity. The film is {{run through a}} tank of fluid. This both hides surface scratches in the film and helps clean the film. Full immersion also eliminates the risk of bubbles appearing in the film optic path. The gate uses rollers, so the film is not at risk of scratches. At the gate exit, the film is dried.|$|E
50|$|As this happened, the {{likelihood}} of auto-ignition increased even further. Projection booth fires were not uncommon {{in the early decades}} of cinema if a film managed to be exposed to too much heat while passing through the projector's <b>film</b> <b>gate,</b> and several incidents of this type resulted in audience deaths by flames, smoke, or the resulting stampede.
