The Schmidt law, Sigma_SFR ~ Sigma_gas^n, is constructed using radial profiles of the HI 21 cm, CO, and far infrared emission. A strong correlation is identified between the star formation rate and molecular gas surface density. This suggests that the condensation of giant molecular clouds is the limiting step to star formation within the M 33 disk. The corresponding molecular Schmidt index, n_{mol}, is 1. 36 +/- 0. 08.

40|$|A {{model for}} the chain melting phase {{transition}} in dilute aqueous phospholipid bilayer dispersions is presented. This model includes interactions between head groups, between hydrocarbon chains, and within the chains. The head groups are modeled as hard disks which are constrained to lie on a two-dimensional surface separating the aqueous and hydrocarbon regions.

In this approach the whole system interacts with any given chain through an average lateral pressure which {{is proportional to the}} hard <b>disk</b> <b>pressure.</b> Following Nagle, we assume that the steric repulsions between chains and between head groups and the trans-gauche rotation energies are the dominant interactions in determining the transition and we describe the effect of the other interactions with a mean field approximation.

40|$|A resin slurry venting {{analysis}} was conducted to address safety issues associated with overpressurization of ion exchange columns used in the Purex process at the Savannah River Site (SRS). If flow to these columns were inadvertently interrupted, an exothermic runaway reaction could occur between the ion exchange resin and the nitric acid used in the feed stream. The nitric acid-resin reaction generates significant quantities of noncondensable gases, which would pressurize the column. To prevent the column from rupturing during such events, rupture disks are installed on the column vent lines. The venting analysis models accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) tests and data from tests that were performed in a vented test vessel with a rupture disk. The tests showed that the pressure inside the test vessel continued to increase after the rupture disk opened, though at a slower rate than prior to the rupture. Calculated maximum discharge rates for the resin venting tests exceeded the measured rates of gas generation, so the vent size was sufficient to relieve the pressure in the test vessel if the vent flow rate was constant. The increase in the vessel pressure is modeled as a transient phenomenon associated with expansion of the resin slurry/gas mixture upon rupture of the disk. It is postulated that the maximum pressure {{at the end of}} this expansion is limited by energy minimization to approximately 1. 5 times the rupture <b>disk</b> burst <b>pressure.</b> The magnitude of this pressure increase is consistent with the measured pressure transients.
