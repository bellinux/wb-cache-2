50|$|The great Roman {{development}} in building materials {{was the use}} of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> called Roman cement. Previous cultures had used lime mortars but by adding volcanic ash called a pozzolana the mortar would harden under water. This provided them with a strong material for bulk walling. They used brick or stone to build the outer skins of the wall and then filled the cavity with massive amounts of concrete, effectively using the brickwork as permanent shuttering (formwork). Later they used wooden shuttering that was removed for the concrete to cure.|$|E
40|$|Ancient <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> {{preserves}} {{chemical and}} isotopic signatures that provide important information about historical processing and its durability. The distribution and isotopic composition of calcite in a mortar of a well-preserved Punic–Roman cistern at Pantelleria Island (Italy) {{was used to}} trace the formation conditions, durability, and individual processing periods of the cistern mortar. The analyses of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of calcite revealed four individual horizons, D, E, B- 1 and B- 2, of mortar from the top {{to the bottom of}} the cistern floor. Volcanic and ceramic aggregates were used for the production of the mortar of horizons E/D and B- 1 /B- 2, respectively. All horizons comprise <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> characterized by a mean cementation index of 1. 5 [*]±[*] 1, and a constant binder to aggregate ratio of 0. 31 [*]±[*] 0. 01. This suggests standardized and highly effective processing of the cistern. The high durability of calcite formed during carbonation of slaked lime within the matrix of the ancient mortar, and thus the excellent resistance of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> against water, was documented by (i) a distinct positive correlation of δ 18 Ocalcite and δ 13 Ccalcite; typical for carbonation through a mortar horizon, (ii) a characteristic evolution of δ 18 Ocalcite and δ 13 Ccalcite through each of the four mortar horizons; lighter follow heavier isotopic values from upper to lower part of the cistern floor, and (iii) δ 18 Ocalcite varying from − 10 to − 5  ‰ Vienna Pee Dee belemnite (VPDB). The range of δ 18 Ocalcite values rule out recrystallization and/or neoformation of calcite through chemical attack of water stored in cistern. The combined studies of the chemical composition of the binder and the isotopic composition of the calcite in an ancient mortar provide powerful tools for elucidating the ancient techniques and processing periods. This approach helps to evaluate the durability of primary calcite and demonstrates the importance of calcite as a proxy for chemical attack and quality of the ancient inorganic binder...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact {{moisture}} control {{has on the}} aftercare of freshly manufactured <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> by wet and dry cycling. Mechanical properties were monitored by periodic compressive testing {{and the extent of}} carbonation by phenolphthalein staining of cross sections. Hydration products after 28 days of cycling were identified by microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy. The cycling procedure caused a dramatic increase in compressive strength development. This was attributed to an increased rate of carbonation and hydration in three different mix designs containing aggregates with different particle size distributions. The cycling process also increased the depth of carbonation significantly. It was found that finer aggregates had greater depths of carbonation, in all exposure conditions. The strength development, as a result of 28 days of cycling, was similar in the fine and mixed-particle aggregate mix designs since they were both fully carbonated, whereas the equivalent strength increase was lower for the coarse aggregate mix as the specimens weren't fully carbonated. This illustrates the importance of carbonation on strength development within <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars,</b> with a finer aggregate causing a faster strength increase...|$|R
40|$|Lime based mortal's are {{now widely}} {{acknowledged}} to be generally superior to cement based mortars in the repair of appropriate historic infrastructure. Increasingly {{the benefits of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> are also being realised in new masonry construction. In order to standardise the expected performance of mortars, designers will specify the type of lime, the type of filler (aggregate), the proportions of each and quantity of water or the required workability. Limes can be non-hydraulic (calcium or dolomitic) or hydraulic (natural or artificial). It {{is well known that}} the water/binder ratio has a marked effect on the structural performance of cement-based mortars. This is relationship is known as Abrams' rule, which states that when a cement mortar is fully compacted, its strength is inversely proportional to the water/cement ratio. Abrams' rule has also been demonstrated to apply to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars.</b> The {{reason for this is that}} both cement and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>limes</b> require a minimum quantity of water to produce the chemical set resulting from the hydration of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates. Surplus water eventually dries out, leaving micropores in the matrix which weaken the resulting set mortar. It has generally been assumed that the same relationship applies to non-hydraulic <b>lime</b> (air <b>lime)</b> <b>mortars.</b> This paper reports on results of tests conducted on air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> at early stages of curing. It is known that the form of air lime and the physical and chemical characteristics of the aggregate have a strong impact on the structural performance of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars.</b> Results to date show that the water/lime ratio has a minimal impact on the structural performance of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> compared with the impact of lime and aggregate type. 91 day compressive strengths for air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> with a water/lime ratio of 0. 56 (a stiff mix) are identical to those with a water/lime ratio of 0. 875 (a loose slurry). Whereas Abrams' rule is a key consideration for designers of cement and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars,</b> it has been demonstrated that it requires modification in the case of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars.</b> A relationship between form of lime, type of aggregate, water/lime ratio, and age of mortar is proposed. The resultant equation allows the compressive strength of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> to be predicted taking into account these factors.

40|$|This study {{considers}} the compressive strength development of {{broad range of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> prepared {{with a range of}} commercially available alumino-silicate by-products and modern pozzolanic additions. Specifically this paper {{considers the}} effect of mineral addition selection, binary and ternary combinations, pozzolan content and the effect of curing conditions on the compressive strength development of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> based <b>mortars.</b> The study was undertaken as the initial phase of a broader investigation considering the feasibility of producing modern, sustainable hydraulic lime–pozzolan concretes with comparable strengths to Portland cement based concretes. The aim of the initial phase was to identify a small number of additions, and combinations thereof, which would result in a structural strength lime–concrete when scaled up from mortars to concretes. In the absence of a definitive source of information on the mechanical properties of hydraulic-lime mortars prepared with binary and ternary combinations of alumino-silicate by-products, 22 combinations consisting of Natural <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lime</b> (NHL 5) and a range of possible additions, identified from historical and current practice, were prepared. The results have shown that combining an eminently- hydraulic NHL 5 with silica fume and ground granulated blastfurnace slag can produce mortars with a 28 -day compressive cube strength of around 28 N/mm 2, at a water-to-binder (w/b) ratio of 0. 5. This is eight times the strength of an equivalent mortar prepared with NHL 5 alone and broadly speaking com- parable with that of low-heat cementitious mortars.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} in its entirety, i. e. {{this publication}} {{prepared for a}} doctorate and now presented together with the licentiate thesis from 2004, deals with the production and utilisation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar,</b> including natural cement and pozzolana mortar, in historic buildings in the Nordic countries, especially in Sweden, from the Middle Ages until present time. The disseratation covers a field of knowledge where the collected knowledge still is meagre. There was a historic stage in a general endeavour to produce mortar with hydraulic characteristics, which also {{led to the development}} of Portland cement. The author is of the opinion that such an endeavour has existed for a long period; in Sweden at least since the 18 th century. This is investigated with and supported by a survey of the production and utilisation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> and also natural cement and pozzolana mortar through the course of time. Two investigations are included in the licentiate thesis. The first deals with the situation concerning knowledge and research with regard to the production and utilisation of hydraulic lime, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar,</b> natural cement and pozzolana mortar from a historical perspective. The second deals with the occurrence and deposits of limestone that has been possible to utilise for the production of natural hydraulic lime; and similarly the raw materials for production of natural cement and pozzolana mortar, for instance brick for brickdust lime mortar and burned alum shale for alum shale lime mortar. The production of lime and other materials is linked in this dissertation to still existing buildings and constructions. This study includes a detailed presentation of composition, material properties and also production. This is achieved by four sub-surveys covering four types of mortar: (1) natural hydraulic and sub-hydraulic lime mortar, (2) natural cement, (3) brickdust lime mortar and (4) alum shale lime mortar. The intention is to characterise and illustrate by the four sub-studies investigations for what purposes these materials have been used, i. e. in what objects, with application as mortar, grout and finishing mortar, or in the manufacturing of façade ornaments for example. Natural hydraulic and sub-hydraulic lime mortar was in use already during the Middle Ages. However, the conditions dealt with in this dissertation refer mainly to the latter part of the 17 th century and the 18 th, 19 th and 20 th centuries. In contrast natural cement was in use during the 19 th century only. The investigations included in this doctoral dissertation are based on own and other available building-archaeological investigations and observations and also mortar studies. The building investigations were made in connection with restoration projects and façade restoration. The mortar investigations consist of quantitative and qualitative microscopic analyses of thin section as well as chemical analyses and to some extent also SEM/EDS and XRD analyses. The large number of thin section analyses and chemical analyses, and the large number of analysed components, is unique for the investigations of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> in Sweden. The analyses thus provide completely new information regarding these kinds of mortars. This study demonstrates that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> is a traditional building material that has had an essential role in buildings in Sweden from the Middle Ages to present time. A lot of lime mortars from before the 17 th century are sub-hydraulic according to this investigations. During second half of the 17 th century the knowledge about hydraulic mortar was developed. At that time could the hydraulic effect rise and 1770 the swedish cement, the alum shale mortar, was devised.

The simulation made in the school show that ordinary cement or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars,</b> leads to much higher global warming potential, where CO 2 emissions are more than 3 tonnes per building intervention.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to produce an {{artificial}} hydraulic lime for the repair and conservation of historic masonry. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> is preferred to cement mortar and pure lime mortar for conservation work because it can set and harden in wet condition as well as allowing the old wall to breathe. These characteristics create a repaired mortar which is compatible with natural stone and ancient brickwork, {{as well as being}} a more sustainable material. The study focused on the properties of an artificial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> obtained by burning a binary mixture of limestone and siliceous waste material. Five raw meals were prepared from five siliceous waste materials obtained as by products from other industrial processes (fly ash, glass cullet powder, silica sand, crushed rock dust, and spent oil shale) with the amount of silica varying between 3 and 16 per cent. The raw meals were burned in an electric furnace at 974 oC for 7 hours. The mortar was prepared by mixing hot slaked lime putty (water/lime ratio about 1. 6) and ‘Gowrie’ sand at a lime/sand ratio of 1 : 3 by weight. The limes and lime mortar was prepared and tested according to BS EN 459 - 2 : 2001. The investigations carried out on the products are free lime analysis, strength test and microstructure examination. The results show that the most promising hydraulic lime is glass cullet lime, followed by crushed rock lime. The glass cullet lime can be classified as feebly hydraulic. The optimum combination of silica with lime in the glass cullet lime is occurred at 10 % silica raw meal. The hydration of silicates in the glass cullet lime mortar of 5 % silica raw meal is completed in 28 days of curing. High strength but low lime oxide depletion in the crushed rock lime mortar shows the mortar hardens due to the hydration of silicates and the chemical reaction between silica and slaked lime. The results show that the silica in fly ash, spent oil shale and silica sand requires temperatures higher than 974 degree Celsius to achieve significant reaction with lime. The results suggest that hydraulic lime of appropriate performance can be produced using traditional kiln at low cost.

To this end, highly porous bricks with low stiffness and cut and broken limestone, as well as sandstone units were selected. Cement-lime (M 6), calcium lime (CL 90 -S) and natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) <b>mortars</b> were manufactured to two flows (165 and 170 mm). The impact of the mortar?s compressive and flexural strengths, and elastic modulus on the compressive and bond strengths of the respective masonry was investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the dynamic response of sandstone masonry units bound with fibre-reinforced mortars comparing a Portland cement-lime system with hydraulic lime. A drop-weight impact machine {{was used to}} generate stress rates up to 10 7 kPa/s. The dynamic impact factor and stress rate sensitivity were evaluated for the flexural strength of the sandstone and mortar, and for the bond strength of the unit, and further, the pattern of failure was noted in the units for each mortar mix and loading rate. Polypropylene microfibres were incorporated at 0 %, 0. 25 % and 0. 5 % volume fraction into the mortar. Results show that the flexural bond strength was more sensitive to stress rate than the flexural strength of the mortar, at similar rates of loading. Further, the stress rate sensitivity of the bond strength decreased {{with an increase in}} the fibre content. Also, whereas the flexural toughness factors for the stone-mortar bond fell with fibre reinforcement in the stronger Portland cement-lime system, the bond improved with fibre addition when employing <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar...</b>|$|E
40|$|Water content affects mortar {{properties}} {{and the quality}} of the resultant masonry, however, it is often subjectively determined by the mason by assessing workability. This lack of explicit methodology and data, can lead to lack of mortar consistency and field performance, adversely affecting full uptake of lime mortars into mainstream technology. The aim of this research is to assist develop consistent lime mortars of high quality, that would improve the strength and durability of masonry. To this aim, the paper investigates the compressive, flexural and bond strength of clay brick masonry bound with natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortar</b> (NHL 2), at variable water contents delivering different workabilities. The results evidenced that increasing the water content by 1 % yields a 5 mm increase in initial flow (from 165 to 170 mm). It was found that this water increment significantly increases the mortar?s compressive strength simultaneously reducing its flexural strength, but it does not increase stiffness under compression. It was also evidenced that the 1 % water increment significantly enhances the masonry?s compressive, bond and flexural strengths. From these, it was concluded that mixing NHL 2 mortars to produce a 170 mm initial flow will result in a consistently adequate strength and mechanical behaviour for mortar and masonry...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} proposes {{the combined}} {{use of a}} Glass Fiber Reinforced Cement Matrix (GFRCM) composite with an integrated fiber optic sensing system for innovative seismic retrofitting of masonry vaults. The need of eco-compatibility of bonding material with masonry support implies the use of <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Lime</b> <b>Mortar</b> (HLM) as bonding matrix that, in contrast, is characterized by lower adhesion capacity respect to polymeric resins and not well-known carrying-load properties. Hence, monitoring of the operating features of the GFRCM reinforcement has been pursued with an advanced fiber optic sensing system realized through Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. The use of FBG sensors is justified by {{a large number of}} advantages such as small sensor dimensions, low weight as well as high static and dynamic resolution of measured values, distributed sensing feature allowing to detect anomalies in load transfer between reinforcement and substrate. Specifically, the proposed retrofitting and monitoring technique is designed and applied to an old masonry pavilion vault. A nonlinear finite element model of the reinforced structure is developed in order to quantify the effectiveness of the GFRCM strengthening layer and to derive the convenient position of the optic fibers for a correct monitoring of the reinforced vault. An experimental campaign is carried out in order to verify the proper behavior of the proposed strengthening and sensing strategy...|$|E

Non-hydraulic lime sets by carbonatation and so needs {{exposure to}} {{carbon dioxide in the}} air and cannot set under water or inside a thick wall. For natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> (NHL) <b>mortars,</b> the <b>lime</b> is obtained from limestone naturally containing a sufficient percentage of silica and/or alumina. Artificial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> is produced by introducing specific types and quantities of additives to the source of lime during the burning process, or adding a pozzolan to non-hydraulic lime. Non-hydraulic lime is produced from a high purity source of calcium carbonate such as chalk, limestone or oyster shells.|$|R

For this purpose, physical, mineralogical and chemical compositions of the mortars were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, TGA and chemical analysis. The results indicated that the mortars were hydraulic and were produced by the use of pozzolanic aggregates. The use of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> can be related to the structural requirements of these buildings. The binder aggregate ratio of mortar samples were in the range of 1 : 2 - 1 : 4. Aggregate particle sizes that are grater than the 1180 µm composed the largest sizes of the total aggregates and aggregates were composed of quartz, albite and anorthite. Lime aggregate ratios (L/Ag) of the produced intervention mortars were in the range of 1 : 6 - 1 : 1. Standard sand was used as aggregate. The pozzolanic additive was commercia...|$|R
40|$|Lime {{has been}} used in {{construction}} for millennia, and its value, especially in the field of conservation architecture, has only recently been rediscovered. <b>Lime</b> <b>mortars</b> harden through carbonation, and this thesis is a study of that process. The research conducted has resulted in the development of two novel techniques for the measurement and detection of carbonation. The first technique is a method of thermogravimetric analysis which allows the carbonation profile to be measured within an acceptable time-frame. The second technique is the use of drilling resistance measurement to visualise the carbonation profile. The potential of elemental analysis to measure the carbonation profile has also been identified. It has been demonstrated that the lime/water ratio has less impact on the compressive strength of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> than had previously been supposed. The change in the pore size distribution of air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> caused by carbonation has been studied, and a theory has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Five different forms of air lime binder were studied. The impact of these on the structural performance of the resultant mortars has been assessed. It was concluded that <b>mortars</b> made with <b>lime</b> putties perform better than mortars made with dry <b>lime</b> hydrate. <b>Mortars</b> made with dispersed hydrated lime appear to perform as well as <b>mortars</b> made with <b>lime</b> putties, but at a slower rate of strength growth. The use of extra mature lime putty does not appear to confer structural performance benefits when compared with ordinary lime putty. It has been shown that the use of calcitic aggregates can produce air <b>lime</b> <b>mortars</b> which perform as well as moderately <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lime</b> <b>mortars.</b> It is theorised that this phenomenon is not directly related to carbonation, but rather to a complex interaction of the granulometry, mineralogy, chemistry and porosity of the aggregate with the binder.
