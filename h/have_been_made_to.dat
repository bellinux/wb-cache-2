5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> explain {{the link between}} altered brain function and schizophrenia.

5|$|At {{all times}} of day, but {{particularly}} at peak hours, {{it is common}} for vehicles to have to queue beyond the next ferry departure.

5|$|Attempts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> {{introduce}} H.gammarus to New Zealand, alongside other European {{species such}} as the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. Between 1904 and 1914, one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin, but the species did not become established there.|$|E

5|$|Because the Leslie {{is a sound}} {{modification}} {{device in}} its own right, various attempts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> simulate the effect using electronics effect units. These include the Uni-Vibe, the Neo Ventilator, or Hammond-Suzuki's own simulator in a box.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{potentially}} harmful effects on ecosystems, various efforts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> control introduced populations of C.maenas around the world. In Edgartown, Massachusetts, a bounty was levied in 1995 for catching C.maenas, to protect local shellfish, and 10tons were caught.|$|E
5|$|From various {{symbolic}} motifs the tapestries seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> {{celebrate a}} marriage, probably that of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515).

5|$|In 1974, a {{paved road}} was built from MS 2 to the Alcorn–Tishomingo county line. It was later {{extended}} to MS 25 in 1981, and was designated as MS 350 {{in the same}} year. No significant changes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the route since.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{alterations}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> {{the underlying}} road {{network in the}} area. Some roads have been downgraded, others are now expected to handle more traffic, and several new routes have been built. New pedestrian links and cycle paths have also been created.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestic}} {{guinea pig}} {{plays an important}} role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.

5|$|Attempts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> date recessions in America {{beginning}} in 1790. These periods of recession were not identified until the 1920s.

The earliest recessions {{for which there is}} the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises.|$|E
5|$|Draw by agreement: Draws {{are most}} {{commonly}} reached {{by mutual agreement}} between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players {{have been allowed to}} agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae s.l., many attempts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (Liliaceae s.s.). The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.|$|E

5|$|Fossil records {{indicate}} that in pre-Polynesian times, the kakapo was New Zealand's third most common bird {{and it was}} widespread on all three main islands. However, the kakapo population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country. Since 1891, conservation efforts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1989 and continues.|$|E
5|$|In Ethiopia, {{there are}} several {{varieties}} of sheep landrace. Attempts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> classify the sheep based on factors such as tail shape and wool type, and H. Epstein made an attempt at classifying them this way by dividing the breeds into 14 types based on those two factors. However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed {{that there are only}} four distinct varieties of Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|E
