500|$|A {{writer for}} Buzz {{magazine}} became bored of the repetitive {{nature of the}} storyline surrounding Mark trying to ask Kate out again. They said [...] "honestly, how many times <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> through this with these two?" [...] They later branded him [...] "one angry man" [...] during the police corruption storyline. They said he slept with Jade because [...] "too much stewing over work and not enough play makes Brennan a dull boy". TV Week described Mark's departure episode as [...] "edge-of-your-seat." [...] While {{a reporter for the}} Daily Record said [...] "Goodbye Brennan - we enjoyed having you and your hunky good looks around, but all good things must come to an end." [...] Nicky Branagh from Studentbeans.com included Mark in her list of the [...] "Top ten hottest Aussie soap guys" [...] and she stated [...] "As Ramsay Street's resident hottie back in 2010, Scott McGregor graced Neighbours as the coolest kind of police investigator (he rode a motorbike). Unfortunately for us, Scott fled his neighbourly friends to flaunt his devilishly handsome face to the world as a model." ...|$|E
2500|$|In about 150, Justin Martyr, {{referring}} to the Eucharist, wrote: [...] "Not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{swear by}} yon swan-travelled lake, By yon calm hill above, I swear <b>had</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> drowned that day <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> drowned in love.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mrs Lammle, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> both <b>been</b> deceiving, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> both <b>been</b> deceived. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> both <b>been</b> biting, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> both <b>been</b> bitten. In a nut-shell, there's {{the state}} of the case.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only {{remember}} what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> since that bright morning when we turned our backs upon {{it for the}} last time,' said Nell, 'only {{remember what}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> since <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> free of all those miseries--what peaceful days and quiet nights <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had--what pleasant times <b>we</b> <b>have</b> known--what happiness <b>we</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed. If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tired or hungry, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> soon refreshed, and slept the sounder for it. Think what beautiful things <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen, and how contented <b>we</b> <b>have</b> felt. And why was this blessed change?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How long <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> here?' 'I, eleven weeks, to-morrow {{night at}} midnight. You, nine weeks and three days, at five this afternoon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your last venture! <b>Have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> unkind {{to you or}} does it imply that, as {{you once}} insinuated, an {{exemplary}} life becomes monotonous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dost thou {{think it}} is so, Pepe? <b>Have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> thus deceived, and has so much evil been said of the admiral and his motives, wrongfully?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> what <b>we</b> do on this lake," [...] {{modestly}} replied Jasper, [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> hard pressed. I daresay {{we might}} do better, <b>had</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> better taught." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carrie smiled rather curiously. [...] "We didn't choose our characters; {{they were}} given us. I wonder what would <b>have</b> {{happened}} <b>had</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> different----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, mamma? Wherever <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> always <b>been</b> together. Mrs. Bluestone {{was quite}} unhappy {{because you would}} not come. They are so good-natured! I wish you would go there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, Metem; there {{runs the}} path {{by which we}} {{travelled}} from the coast, {{and there is the}} tomb of Baaltis. Why <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> brought here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, you know. What else <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> talking about? It costs {{you so much}} to be liked. That's why I {{hesitated to}} tell you of my letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have kept}} your good news till the last, Marie," [...] Victor said. [...] "Here <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> saying good-bye, {{and it seems}} {{that we are going to}} meet again very shortly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Fisker,' said Paul mysteriously, <b>'as</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> partners, I think I {{ought to}} let you know that many people speak very badly of Mr Melmotte's honesty.' ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{pause and}} I saw the {{slackening}} of her reins. No doubt, <b>had</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> afoot she would have halted, the better to confront me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! <b>ha!</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> {{in for a}} race, Betty. if {{you beat}} him, start or no start, you will have {{accomplished}} something never done before," [...] said Col. Zane.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is your opinion, Peter?" [...] {{continued}} le Bourdon. [...] "You {{understand the}} wilderness, and its ways. To {{what is this}} extr'or'nary call owing? Why <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> brought here, at this hour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aha!' he began, {{rubbing his}} hands. 'Cras ingens iterabimus aequor. Our portion to-day is the Fifth Ode of the Third Book, I believe--concerning one Regulus, a gentleman. And how often <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> through it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a sleep," [...] he said on waking. [...] "I have slept longer to-night than I have done for the past fortnight. Now I will take the helm. How fast <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> moving?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] {{the countess}} said. [...] "I shudder when I think what would <b>have</b> {{happened}} <b>had</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> {{there in the}} city. What a terrible sight it is!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Going to? Why, {{you have}} not forgot our engagement! Did not we agree {{together}} to take a drive this morning? What a head you <b>have!</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> going up Claverton Down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not. It {{was a long}} journey, but it <b>was</b> {{fortunate}} that <b>we</b> pushed on as <b>we</b> did; for <b>had</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> twelve hours later, <b>we</b> should not <b>have</b> found the queen at Nerac." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Melville, at a {{loss for}} once, and {{suddenly}} rising from his chair to face her, and then to the Sea Lady with an artificially easy smile, [...] "What <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> talking about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ordonio (in {{retiring}} stops suddenly at {{the edge}} of the scene, and [...] then turning round to ISIDORE). Ha! Who lurks there! <b>Have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> [...] overheard? [...] There where the smooth high wall of slate-rock glitters---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> {{talking of}} all this time, my dear Sidney? Clear your head of all doubt, and, if possible, of all regrets; we must deal with the facts, and we must deal with them to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{give the}} letter to Mr. Thackeray, {{not because it is}} one of very great interest, but because, being the only one <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> glad to <b>have</b> the two names {{associated}} together in this work.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Have <b>we</b> <b>been</b> worse off,' resumed the child, 'since {{you forgot}} these cares, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{travelling}} on together? <b>Have</b> <b>we</b> not <b>been</b> much better and happier without {{a home to}} shelter us, than ever <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in that unhappy house, when they were on your mind?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the only}} {{reasonable}} thing to do. Our present mode of life <b>is</b> a farce. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> drifting farther apart every day. Perhaps I have changed. I know you <b>have.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> two strangers chained together. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> made a muddle of it, and the best thing <b>we</b> can do <b>is</b> to admit it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas! you are right; here <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> {{lost on the}} hills, and {{wandering}} all night; and glad am I to {{find your}} fire burning, for my poor daughter is very cold and much exhausted. May we sit down beside you?" ...|$|E
60|$|He came up, sat down, {{and blew}} out his cheeks, looking inexpressibly fatuous. But I didn't want to laugh any more. And what on earth, I asked myself, <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> {{laughing}} at in this uncontrollable fashion. I felt suddenly depressed.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear friend," [...] demanded my visitor, who had risen, {{and whom}} I was {{gradually}} edging to the door, [...] "do {{you mean to}} say there is any individuality in such things now? What <b>have</b> <b>we</b> <b>been</b> saying about character?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. It is {{odd that}} I {{should not have}} known it, as I now hear that she was at my sister's house; but all others have not been as silent as you <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> quits, Harry; that is all that I <b>have</b> to say. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> quits now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The usual {{interpretation}} of a friendship {{between a man and}} a woman! I have never thought of such a thing; and I am sure she never <b>has.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not half so intimate as you and Sir Charles." ...|$|R
6000|$|I said: [...] "It is {{very kind}} of you to <b>have</b> come out. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not lunatics. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> not <b>been</b> {{standing}} under that tree for the last half-hour knowing all the time there was a restaurant, hidden by the trees, within twenty yards of us. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> no idea <b>we</b> <b>were</b> anywhere near a restaurant." ...|$|R
