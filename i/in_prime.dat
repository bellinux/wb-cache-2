5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> time, Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. He thought that it gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became a star in her own right, hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years.|$|E
5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E

5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E

5|$|The game's story follows {{bounty hunter}} Samus Aran, who is {{sent by the}} Galactic Federation to {{investigate}} the Biologic Space Laboratories space station, where it is swarming with organisms infected with virions known as the X Parasites. Like in previous Metroid games, Fusion is played from the side-scrolling perspective. It introduces mission-based gameplay that aids the player to explore areas. The game consists of objectives, which are flexible in {{how they can be}} accomplished. Fusion was released simultaneously with the GameCube game Metroid Prime in North America. The bonus features <b>in</b> <b>Prime</b> can be unlocked by linking between the game and Fusion via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.|$|E
5|$|The huia {{was found}} {{throughout}} the North Island before humans arrived in New Zealand. The Māori are estimated to have arrived around 800 years ago, and {{by the arrival of}} European settlers in the 1840s, habitat destruction and hunting had reduced the bird's range to the southern North Island. However, Māori hunting pressures on the huia were limited to some extent by traditional protocols. The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> condition, while a rāhui (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer. It was not until European settlement that the huia's numbers began to decline severely, due mainly to two well-documented factors: widespread deforestation and over hunting.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the game}} {{involved}} two Canadian teams, the NHL {{hoped that the}} event would prove a successful draw in the U.S. To that end, the league scheduled the Heritage Classic as the only game <b>in</b> <b>prime</b> time, while NBC debuted its Hockey Day in America {{with a pair of}} regional doubleheaders that led into the telecast; throughout NBC's telecast, commercials advised viewers to change to Versus for the Heritage Classic once the American games finished. University of Alberta sports economist Brad Humphreys questioned the league's ambitions, arguing that a game without an American team would not appeal. He stated that the game was being held to placate the Canadian audience, but noted that it was important for the NHL to keep the league's Canadian audience happy.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{the award}} system from Corruption was {{incorporated}} into the first two games. Players earn credits by accomplishing certain tasks, allowing them to unlock in-game items such as artwork, music, a screenshot feature, decorative items for Samus' ship in Corruption and the Fusion Suit <b>in</b> <b>Prime,</b> in which the latter was previously unlocked by connecting the Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion to the game. Credits could also be shared with registered Wii friends, who also {{have a copy of}} Trilogy, via WiiConnect24 which used the Wii's own 16-digit number as opposed to a separate Friend Code. Save files from the original version of Corruption cannot be transferred to the Trilogy version due to changes made to the source code. Trilogy also features the multiplayer mode from Echoes, but is limited to a local four-player game and does not feature online play, which is faithful to the original. In response to complaints from players and critics about Echoess high difficulty during some of the boss battles, the difficulty of the encounters was lowered.|$|E

40|$|The prior {{presentation}} of a word enhances {{the probability that the}} word will be identified from a degraded cue. This enhancement, or priming, may occur without recollection of the prior presentation. In investigations of the effect of delay on nonrecollective memory, priming of word completion may occur at long delays after the initial word presentation (e. g., HORIZON) when the degraded cue contains scattered letters (e. g., R Z) but not when the degraded cue contains the initial letters (e. g., HOR). These particular cues are known as fragments and stems respectively. Priming of fragment completion may occur weeks after the study presentation whereas priming of stem completion may disappear within hours. The present research investigated this apparent discrepancy between the duration of priming effect for the two types of cues by examining completion of both within the same experiment. Particularly, it tested the hypothesis that the decline <b>in</b> <b>priming</b> of completion is greater when cues have many possible completions. Subjects completed fragments that have 1 completion or fragments and stems that have more than 7 completions. Priming was measured over a 48 -hour delay interval in each of 4 experiments. Priming of stem completion declined at a greater rate than priming of fragment completion over the 48 -hour interval, thus replicating within a single experiment the previous between-experiment findings. The number-of-completions hypothesis was not rejected in Experiments 1 and 3 because the decline <b>in</b> <b>priming</b> of multiple fragment completion did not differ from the decline <b>in</b> <b>priming</b> of stem or unique fragment completion. However, in Experiment 2 the decline <b>in</b> <b>priming</b> of multiple fragment completion differed from the decline <b>in</b> <b>priming</b> of stem completion but not from the decline <b>in</b> <b>priming</b> of unique fragment completion. Thus, the number-of-completions hypothesis may not be a viable explanation of the differential effect of delay on priming of fragment and stem completion. When the same words served in both the unique fragment and stem conditions, the effect of delay on priming of completion was similar for both conditions (Experiment 4) ...|$|R
