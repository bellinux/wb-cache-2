5|$|The British 3rd Infantry Division, of I Corps, came ashore on Sword {{beach on}} 6 June 1944, with Caen— inland—as their <b>final</b> <b>objective.</b> The {{vicinity}} of Caen was attractive to Allied planners because it contained airfields and was open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations, {{for which the}} Allies {{had the advantage of}} numerical superiority in tanks and mobile units. The attempt to capture Caen on D-Day was ambitious and traffic jams on the beaches delayed the 27th Armoured Brigade. The advance of the 3rd Infantry Division diminished as it fought past German fortifications and was stopped short of Caen before dark, by elements of the 21st Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} 16 August was {{relatively}} quiet, {{with only a}} few attempts made by small German parties to approach the Canadian lines. After having failed to capture all their objectives the previous day and having postponed additional attacks a number of times, the 2nd Canadian Brigade attacked and captured the remainder of its <b>final</b> <b>objective</b> line on the afternoon of 16 August. The assault lasted a little over an hour but the troops were then forced to defend against a dozen German counter-attacks during the day.|$|E
30|$|With {{this picture}} in mind, the {{government}} first set the <b>final</b> <b>objectives</b> of the reform, which {{were identified as}} promoting inclusiveness and dynamism in the labor market. The task was thus to design an institutional framework capable of guiding {{the evolution of the}} market along these lines.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the frustrations}} of 21-22 November, {{and the failure to}} capture the <b>final</b> <b>objectives,</b> the purpose of the {{operation}} had, in fact, now been achieved. The Geilenkirchen salient had been substantially removed and the U.S. XIII Corps now had room to manoeuvre. The 84th Infantry Division reverted to U.S. command and further attacks were abandoned on the 23rd.|$|R
50|$|On 27 February 1991 the British 1st Armoured Division {{secured the}} <b>final</b> <b>objectives</b> on the Basra Highway north of Multa Ridge. The British 1st Armoured Division had {{traveled}} 217 miles in 97 hours. The 1st Armored Division had captured or destroyed about 200 tanks {{and a very}} large number of armoured personnel carriers, trucks, reconnaissance vehicles, etc.|$|R
5|$|The {{objective}} of the Canadian Corps was {{to take control of}} the German-held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive. This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire. Supported by a creeping barrage, the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack. The village of Thélus fell during the second day of the attack, as did the crest of the ridge, once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance. The <b>final</b> <b>objective,</b> a fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy-en-Gohelle, fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April. The German forces then retreated to the Oppy–Méricourt line.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the third}} phase of the Passchendaele offensive, the 10th Australian Brigade—of which McGee's 40th Battalion was part—was {{detailed}} to execute an attack on Broodseinde Ridge. The brigade was allocated four primary objectives to seize during the assault, one for each battalion, with the 40th Battalion to take the final target located on the ridge itself. The advance commenced at the predetermined time of 06:00 on 4 October 1917, {{under the cover of}} an artillery barrage. The first three battalions were able to seize their objectives, though the fighting intensified with each stage. As the 40th Battalion set to advance towards the <b>final</b> <b>objective,</b> its progress became hampered by increasingly heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, as well as by barbed wire entanglements and sectors of impassable swamp.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, it was {{apparent}} that the failure of the New Zealanders to advance their section of the front exposed the left flank of the neighbouring 3rd Australian Division, which had secured its first objective and was pushing on to its second. Likewise, on the New Zealand Division's left, the 9th (Scottish) Division had managed to reach its <b>final</b> <b>objective.</b> Godley issued new instructions to the New Zealand Division; abandoning any hope of getting to the Green Line, it was to push on to the Blue Line in an attack timed for 3:00pm. However, by the early afternoon the flanking Scots had been pushed back while the Australians had failed to make further gains and were withdrawing due to enfilade gunfire on the flanks. Braithwaite, warned by his battalion commanders that capturing the Blue Line was impossible, twice pushed Russell for a cancellation of the attack. Russell's initial response was to instruct the Rifle Brigade to continue, but shortly before the attack was to begin, it was abandoned.|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of Workpackage BASIN R 3 Meuse, the Hydrology Group of the University of Liège (Belgium) is developing a hydrological model of the Geer sub-catchment, {{in order to assess}} climate change impacts on groundwater reserves. This report describes the calculation code used, the general hypotheses chosen to develop the model, the conceptual model, the climate change scenarios and the <b>final</b> <b>objectives</b> of the study...|$|R
40|$|Turkey {{was one of}} the {{developing}} countries which adopted economic policies similar to Washington Consensus and tried to elevate the integration of Turkish Economy to the world Economy in 1980 s. The aim {{of this study is to}} provide a detailed overview of the economic reform process since the beginning of 1980 and an assessment of whether these reforms were successful in terms of attaining their <b>final</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a modest proposal for introducing final outcome indicators in the IDA aid allocation formula. It {{starts with a}} review of the current formula and the rationale for it. It is argued that this formula, and in particular the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) part of it, implicitly relies too heavily on a uniform model of what works in development policy. Even if this model were valid "on average", the variations around the average make it an unreliable sole guide to the country-specific productivity of aid in achieving the <b>final</b> <b>objectives</b> of development. Rather, it is argued that changes in the actual outcomes on these <b>final</b> <b>objectives</b> could also be used as part of the allocation formula. A number of conceptual and operational objections to this position are considered and debated. The paper concludes that there is much to be gained by taking small steps in the direction of introducing outcome variables in the IDA formula, and assessing the experience of doing so in a few years? time. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the third}} phase, Impetigo, the 43rd Division would move forward to relieve all Scottish {{infantry}} {{north of the}} Odon. The 15th Division would then assemble across the river and expand the bridgehead by capturing several important villages. In the final phase, codenamed Goitre, elements of the 43rd Division would cross the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would continue to expand their bridgehead. The 11th Armoured Division would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their <b>final</b> <b>objective</b> of Bretteville-sur-Laize. The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th Armoured Division, was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne to protect the Corps flank and {{to be in a}} position to attack westwards or towards Caen, as necessary.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} day of the Second Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led his brigade, which had spent much of the {{previous}} weeks in defensive lines, in an attack on Miteirya Ridge during which it achieved all of its objectives. In contrast to three months earlier at Ruweisat Ridge, he took care to establish his headquarters as far forward as possible prior to the commencement of the battle to minimise communication difficulties with the units of the brigade. Despite this, he still lost contact with the leading 23rd Battalion which quickly overwhelmed its opposition. In fact, the battalion had advanced so quickly that it arrived at its <b>final</b> <b>objective</b> so far ahead of schedule that it believed it had only reached its first objective and so advanced even further. The battalion's commander blamed his unit's eagerness for a rapid advance on Kippenberger's inspirational pre-battle speech which particularly enthused his men.|$|E
5|$|The British moved three fresh brigades {{up to the}} Red Line by 9:30am on 10 April {{to support}} the advance of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to {{leapfrog}} existing units occupying the Red line and advance to the Blue Line. Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the advance of the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00am, the Blue Line, including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, the advance recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their <b>final</b> <b>objective.</b> The tank-supported advance via Farbus and directed {{at the rear of}} the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2:00pm.|$|E
2500|$|British {{operations}} concluded on 30 September, {{with the}} capture of {{a large portion of}} the [...] Redoubt, north of Thiepval, another first day objective which had been attacked by the 36th (Ulster) Division. In the Battle of the Ancre Heights, which began on 1 October, the <b>final</b> <b>objectives</b> of the Battle of Thiepval were reached; on 14 October the rest of [...] Redoubt was captured and the Canadian Corps completed {{the capture of}} Regina Trench on 11 November.|$|R
30|$|One of the <b>final</b> <b>objectives</b> of a {{pediatric}} cochlear implant {{program is to}} provide access for those with severe and profound deafness to an education {{similar to that of}} their normal-hearing peers through mainstream education. Many studies report that while there is a trend toward mainstream education for students with cochlear implants, the majority of these students are rated poorly in the area of communication by their teachers and perform below average overall (Nevins and Chute 1995; Mukari et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} programme Networks in Animal Husbandry began in 2004 without any concrete <b>final</b> <b>objectives.</b> The programme {{did have to}} contribute {{in all sorts of}} ways: by making “knowledge from the shelf” applicable, to making animal farming more robust, stimulating new knowledge arrangements and even to system innovations. It did all that – and more – in its facilitating role in the networks of animal farmers and other stakeholders in the sector. The programme began in effect as a big experiment...|$|R
5|$|Efforts {{were made}} to {{consolidate}} the newly captured positions. The 41st Division, on the right flank, had reached its portion of the Blue Line and captured Flers but the 47th Division lagged behind. The New Zealanders remained exposed to enfilade fire along their left flank and German artillery fire also hampered attempts to shore up their positions. The 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade began {{an attack on the}} <b>final</b> <b>objective,</b> Red Line, at 10:50am and secured a portion of the Grove Alley trenches by midday despite heavy casualties. However, the 47th Division had still not been able to secure its first objective while the 41st Division had to withdraw from Flers village. This left the New Zealanders in a salient exposed to heavy machine gun fire on both flanks. At 2:00pm Germans were spotted advancing from the northeast. Captain Lindsay Inglis, the senior surviving officer in this area of Grove Alley, gave orders to strengthen the corresponding section of the line. When a platoon began moving to effect the order, this was misinterpreted as a withdrawal and the remaining elements of the battalion began to pull out to Flers village. Inglis was able to check the withdrawal, but with only 120 men, he opted to dig in where they were rather than try to reoccupy Grove Alley.|$|E
25|$|By 27 December {{the limited}} {{offensive}} was over. In the morning, the German assault troops entered Pian di Coreglia, their <b>final</b> <b>objective</b> and Italian patrols went forward {{as far as}} the village of Calavorno, reporting that the enemy still was in full retreat. The other columns had also reached their objective points, and an entire Allied division had been routed.|$|E
25|$|The right brigade of the 7th Division {{advanced}} against {{light resistance}} to the first objective (red line) but came under fire from machine-guns in the 21st Division area. As the neighbouring division came up the 91st Brigade was able to resume its advance towards In Der Ster Cabaret until fire from Joiner's Rest held them up. Reinforcements allowed the <b>final</b> <b>objective</b> (blue line) to be taken. A defensive flank was formed along Jolting Houses road and Jetty Trench, meeting the 21st Division {{to the west of}} Reutel. The left brigade had an easy advance to the first objective. As the attack continued some troops crossed into the area of the 1st Australian Division, causing a gap but the German defenders were not able to exploit this and the <b>final</b> <b>objective</b> was reached. Occupation of the In Der Ster plateau gave the two divisions observation over {{the lower part of the}} valley, enfilading ground on which any counter-attack from the south against the 1st Australian Division must move.|$|E
25|$|Wind, {{rain and}} low cloud stopped {{long-range}} air operations and severely restricted the British air effort over the battlefield. British air observers sent 49 zone calls and observed artillery fire on 26 targets. Five battlefield reconnaissance flights, ten contact patrols and two counter-attack patrols of those attempted succeeded, {{particularly those of}} 4 Squadron and 21 Squadron, which observed the flares of the attacking troops at the first and <b>final</b> <b>objectives,</b> on much of the front attacked and provided the infantry {{with a measure of}} air support despite the weather.|$|R
25|$|The 59th Division {{took part}} in {{following}} the German Army's retreat to the Hindenburg Line in March and April, {{but it was not}} until September that it was engaged in its first full-scale action, the phase of the 3rd Ypres Offensive known as the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge. This was a carefully prepared assault with massive artillery preparation, and most of the objectives were taken easily. The next phase, the Battle of Polygon Wood (26 September), was equally successful, with 176th Brigade advancing steadily behind its barrage onto the <b>final</b> <b>objectives.</b>|$|R
30|$|Surgical {{extraction}} {{used to be}} {{the first}} choice in treating the severely dilacerated teeth [1]. In addition, many reports have been described to move dilacerated teeth into alignment. The therapeutic approach to the dilacerated maxillary central incisors has to be carefully planned and needs the cooperation of several specialities to attain the <b>final</b> <b>objectives.</b> The chances of failure could be due to ankylosis, external root resorption and root exposure after orthodontic traction [4, 5]. Even the successful cases probably have an unesthetic gingiva of the exposed incisor and need to have periodontal surgery [6].|$|R
25|$|Mist and cloud made air {{observation}} difficult {{on the morning}} of 16 August, until a wind began later in the day, although this blew the smoke of battle over the German lines, obscuring German troop movements. Corps squadrons were expected to provide artillery co-operation, contact and counter-attack patrols but low cloud, mist and smoke that morning resulted in most German counter-attack formations moving unnoticed. Flash-spotting of German artillery was much more successful and many more flares were lit by the infantry, when called for by the crews of contact aeroplanes. Army squadrons, Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and French aircraft flew over the lines and attacked German aerodromes, troops and transport as far as the weather allowed. V Brigade tried to co-ordinate air operations over the battlefield with the infantry attack. Two De Havilland D.H.5 aircraft per division were provided, to engage any German strongpoints interfering with the infantry attack on the <b>final</b> <b>objective.</b> Two small formations of fighters were to fly low patrols, {{on the far side of}} the <b>final</b> <b>objective</b> of the Fifth Army, from the beginning of the attack for six hours, to break up German attempts to counter-attack and to stop equivalent German contact-patrols.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Loos the 1/19th formed part of {{the second}} wave attacking the {{southern}} side of Loos village itself. Its CO, Lt-Col Collison-Morley, was killed {{at the head of}} the battalion soon after leaving the trenches, and the 1/19th encountered stiff opposition in Loos cemetery before pushing on to clear houses and cellars in the village. It ended the day at its <b>final</b> <b>objective,</b> the coal-mine winding gear known as 'Tower Bridge'. 1/19th suffered the heaviest casualties in 47th Division that day (14 officers and 372 other ranks).|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 25/26 October 1942 during the , Egypt, the platoon to which Gratwick belonged {{suffered}} considerable casualties, including the platoon commander and sergeant. Gratwick, realising {{the seriousness of the}} situation, charged a German machine-gun position by himself, and killed the crew with hand grenades. He also killed a mortar crew. Under heavy machine-gun fire Gratwick then charged a second post, using his rifle and bayonet. In inflicting further casualties he was killed by machine-gun fire, but his brave and determined action, for which he would be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, enabled his company to capture the <b>final</b> <b>objective.</b>|$|E
40|$|Applying the {{electronic}} nose to monitor environmental odours is not straightforward.

50|$|In September the {{division}} {{moved to the}} Ypres Salient {{to take part in}} its first full-scale action, the 3rd Ypres Offensive. The 59th relieved the 55th (West Lancashire) Division after its successful attack at the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, and then took the lead in the next phase, the Battle of Polygon Wood (26 September). This was equally successful, with 178th Bde advancing steadily behind its creeping barrage onto the <b>final</b> <b>objectives,</b> after which 2/6th Bn held off a determined counter-attack with the assistance of a further artillery barrage.|$|R
25|$|In the centre, the 169th Brigade {{advanced}} {{quickly at}} the start but veered {{to the right to}} go round boggy ground, then entered Glencorse Wood. The defenders were overrun after a mutually costly engagement, the intermediate objective at a line of pillboxes in the sunken road inside the wood was captured. After a pause, the support battalions leapfrogged the leading battalions and pressed on against greater opposition and delays caused by machine-guns sited in old artillery positions and boggy ground. The troops lost the barrage but a few parties reached the <b>final</b> <b>objective,</b> the Wilhelmstellung pillboxes in Polygon Wood and northwards along Anzac Farm spur to the vicinity of Iron Cross Redoubt.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the next}} day, the Australians held the summit against heavy Chinese fire and several {{attempts}} to infiltrate the position. Early on 7 October, B Company captured the <b>final</b> <b>objective,</b> 'the Hinge', after heavy fighting. Subject to severe and continuous artillery bombardment throughout the following day, the Chinese attempted {{a number of}} counter-attacks in the evening; {{all of which were}} repulsed before the Chinese finally withdrew and the Australians' hold on Maryang San was secured. For his leadership and planning during the battle, Hassett received an immediate award of the Distinguished Service Order, before returning to Australia in July 1952, where he was posted as the director of military art at the Royal Military College, Duntroon.|$|E
25|$|Small parties {{from the}} Guards Division {{advanced}} on Lesbœufs and eventually took cover {{in a trench}} for several hours, before falling back during a German counter-attack. For several hours the village had been unoccupied but no British reserves were left, after the great number of casualties inflicted on the 56th, 6th and Guards divisions earlier in the day, many caused by a decision to leave tank lanes in the British barrage, which left several German machine-gun nests undamaged. Few lanes were used by the tanks, most of which broke down early or were knocked out. The Guards Division eventually dug in short of the <b>final</b> <b>objective,</b> west of the Gird Trenches in front of Lesbœufs.|$|E
