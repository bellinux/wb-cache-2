50|$|The {{building}} was state-of-the-art for its time. For performances and assemblies, the arena had a concert stage {{that would be}} assembled {{at one end of}} the rink, facing the length of the rink. The shape of the ice was not quite orthogonal, it is described as being somewhat 'egg-shaped' with semi-circular <b>end</b> <b>boards,</b> rather than the straight <b>end</b> <b>boards</b> with rounded corners of today's ice rinks. This design matched the shape of the rink at The Arena.|$|R

50|$|The top of {{the case}} is removed by opening 4 quick release fasteners, {{revealing}} a number of user adjustable trimmers and pots. The modular design of the FT-221, where removable circuit boards allowed radio hams to modify their FT-221 either by replacing specific components or even replacing the whole board. One such replacement is the mutek replacement front <b>end</b> <b>board</b> which improved the front-end sensitivity. The open format of the internal construction also allowed the transmit and receive cables to be brought outside the case to use a low-noise coaxial relay.|$|E
50|$|A large {{new video}} board {{measuring}} approximately 98' x 38' {{will be added}} to {{the north end of the}} stadium above Touchdown Terrace and the north endzone suites in the summer of 2017. It will provide an additional viewing experience for fans to compliment the existing board in the south end of the complex, while upping the viewable square footage by almost 86% in comparison. The south <b>end</b> <b>board</b> will be replaced and a new surround sound system will be installed throughout the seating areas at a later date TBA. Another new field-width LED ribbon board will also be installed above Touchdown Terrace along with the new video board in 2017.|$|E

The middle example is created by an extension of a simple supported beam (such as the way a diving board is anchored and extends over the edge of a swimming pool). The bottom example is created by adding a Robin boundary condition to the beam element, which essentially adds an elastic spring to the <b>end</b> <b>board.</b> The middle and bottom example may be considered structurally equivalent, depending on the effective stiffness of the spring and beam element ...|$|E
25|$|Education {{was a high}} {{priority}} for Collier, who focused on <b>ending</b> <b>boarding</b> schools and transitioning to community day schools and public schools. He wanted BIA schools to stress the importance of preserving Indian culture. He emphasized the need to develop vocational training that would lead to good jobs.|$|R
50|$|The GHL would {{eliminate}} the red line, move the goals three feet further from the <b>end</b> <b>boards,</b> play two thirty-minute periods (instead of three twenty-minute periods) and decide tie games with penalty shots. The GHL would have a salary cap between $2.1 and $2.5 million per team per season.|$|R
50|$|On January 28, 1989, at the Boston Garden, when a fan came {{onto the}} ice during a game, Asselstine charged him from behind near the goal line, sending the fan sailing into the <b>end</b> <b>boards</b> (a {{distance}} of some 12 feet). The fan was then taken into custody.|$|R
50|$|For example, in the {{diagrams}} to the right, Black {{has decided}} to capture White's bishop on 2b with their bishop on the seventh file (Bx2b). White responds by capturing Black's bishop with White's silver (Sx2b). In comparing the start and <b>end</b> <b>board</b> positions of this bishop exchange, one can {{see that this is}} as if Black and White both removed each of their bishops from the board and put them each in hand and then Black skipped their turn allowing White to advance their silver to 2b. For this reason, equal piece exchanges must weigh {{the pros and cons of}} losing tempo and gaining a piece in hand (all else being equal).|$|E
50|$|Tom's {{relaxation}} at {{the beach}} is interrupted by Jerry who inadvertently walks over the sunbathing Tom going fishing. Jerry {{goes out to the}} pier and casts his favorite bait: cheese. Tom pulls on the line and makes Jerry reel him in. Jerry lets go of the line and Tom struggles to stay afloat, losing the string. Tom barely catches the pier, but Jerry swings the pole at him. After a few misses, Jerry whistles and then lands a direct hit. He runs {{to the end of the}} pier and pulls off the <b>end</b> <b>board.</b> Tom can't brake, and walks the plank until Jerry pulls it out, causing Tom to fall into the sea. Unable to swim, Tom struggles futilely for a few seconds to reach the surface before passing out from lack of air.|$|E
5000|$|The {{look was}} changed {{once again in}} March 1999 with the new titles {{featuring}} a vibrant purple background being changed into yellows and reds to form the Meridian logo. The music remained the same, but was enhanced to be more dramatic with a voiceover at the beginning declaring [...] "This is Meridian Tonight". The programme name now featured the Meridian logo above, or {{to the side of}} the programme name and appearing as a DOG in the bottom left corner of the screen throughout the programme. The last Meridian individual look was introduced c.2002 and featured two translucent halves of Meridian's logo merging and moving together against a purple backdrop. The <b>end</b> <b>board</b> of the sequence saw to two-halves move closer against a stripe of red and yellow colour against the Meridian Tonight name.|$|E
5000|$|As of November 2014, {{there have}} been no {{sightings}} of the 'Windows on the World' idents, insinuating that the [...] "Windows" [...] idents themselves may have been retired, although other pieces of presentation and continuity (e.g. trail <b>end</b> <b>boards)</b> remain.

25|$|All the idents were {{replaced}} on 8 November 1999 when Granada Television took the generic hearts idents. Granada Television kept the pointed G logo, made slightly thinner {{and placed in}} a box {{at the top of the}} screen. The dual branding of Granada Television and ITV lasted until 28 October 2002, when regional identities were dropped in favour of the new ITV1 channel brand. The celebrities ident package featured plain ITV1 idents for all national programmes, and Granada Television placed under the ITV1 logo for regional programmes. This practice continued until 16 January 2006, when no name was used, and Granada Productions was replaced with ITV Productions on programme <b>end</b> <b>boards.</b> The Granada Television logo continued on <b>end</b> <b>boards</b> until this date. The Granada name was used on announcements before local programming over a generic ITV1 ident until all non-news regional programming was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|On 6 September 1999, Carlton's boldest rebrand yet occurred, and it {{was also}} to be its last. While other regions were about to adopt the 'Hearts' generic look, Carlton refused the look and instead adopted a package that related back to the Hearts, but put their own {{distinct}} take on it. Lambie-Nairn was once again commissioned, and a dozen idents were produced and were used depending on the programme to go before it. The idents featured opening films featuring a heart shape, before a star shaped light is emitted from the heart shape, before the screen changes to the Carlton logo, now with added star in top right corner, against a spinning stars background of different colours, with ITV logo beneath. This look has received criticism, not concerning the idents themselves, but because these idents replaced the brands used by both Central and Westcountry. It later reached Wales, with the intro retained, but the <b>end</b> <b>board</b> was of the spinning ITV Hearts with the HTV logo.|$|E
50|$|The Penguins lost Game 1 of {{the series}} 5-4. The Penguins took an early 1-0 lead when Evgeni Malkin scored at 3:03 into the first period on the power play, but {{finished}} the first period trailing the Senators 2-1 after Peter Regin and Chris Neil both scored on rebounds. The Senators extended their lead to 3-1 {{early in the second}} period on the power play when Marc-Andre Fleury was caught out of the net on an odd bounce off of the <b>end</b> <b>board</b> in which Chris Kelly put into the open net. Malkin managed to decrease the deficit to 3-2 with his second power play goal of the night near the midway point of the second period. The Senators' lead was then re-extended the lead 3 minutes later when Erik Karlsson scored on the power play. Five minutes into the third period, Craig Adams scored on a backhand shot to decrease the Senators' lead back to one goal, but almost five minutes later, ex-Penguin Jarkko Ruutu scored what would be the game-winning goal. Alex Goligoski scored to make the score 5-4 with about {{a minute and a half}} off of a no-look feed from Sidney Crosby behind the net.|$|E

25|$|From 28 October 2002, all network {{programmes}} {{were introduced}} with a generic ITV1 ident. Regional programming used a generic ident {{with the name}} Tyne Tees below the ITV1 logo until November 2006, after which no regional idents existed. The Tyne Tees logo was last seen on production <b>end</b> <b>boards</b> until 2004, when they were replaced with, first an ITV logo, and then with an ITV Studios caption.|$|R
