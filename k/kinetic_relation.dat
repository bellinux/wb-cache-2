The canonical equations for energy and pseudomomentum cannot be separated by means of the scale separation because these equations should concern all fields together and, therefore, all scales together. However, the intrinsic interaction force requires a <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> for internal vari-ables. This <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> depends on representation of the internal variable as ”internal variable of state ” or ”internal degree of freedom”.

40|$|<b>Kinetic</b> <b>relations</b> are {{required}} {{in order to}} characterize nonclassical undercompressive shock waves and formulate a well-posed initial value problem for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Such nonclassical waves arise in weak solutions of a large variety of physical models: phase transitions, thin liquid films, magnetohydrodynamics, Camassa-Holm model, martensite-austenite materials, semi-conductors, combustion theory, etc. This review presents the research done in the last fifteen years which led the development of the theory of <b>kinetic</b> <b>relations</b> for undercompressive shocks and has now covered many physical, mathematical, and numerical issues. The main difficulty overcome here in our analysis of nonclassical entropy solutions comes from their lack of monotonicity with respect to initial data. Undercompressive shocks of hyperbolic conservation laws turn out to exhibit features that are very similar to shocks of nonconservative hyperbolic systems, who were investigated earlier by the author.

To enable analytical calculations, we assume antiplane shear deformation and consider a phase transforming material with a stress-strain law that is piecewise linear with respect to one component of shear strain and linear with respect to another. Under these assumptions we derive a semi-analytical solution describing a steady sequential motion of the steps under an external loading. Our analysis yields <b>kinetic</b> <b>relations</b> between the driving force, the velocity of the steps and other characteristic parameters of the motion.

40|$|Abstract. This paper reviews {{our recent}} {{studies on the}} {{nucleation}} and kinetics of propagating phase boundaries in an elastic bar and relates them to various admissibility criteria. First, we discuss how the �eld equations and jump conditions of the quasi-static theory of such a bar must be supplemented with additional constitutive information pertaining to the initiation and evolution of phase boundaries. The <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> relates the driving traction f at a phase boundary to the phase boundary velocity _s;thus f = '�_s�, where ' is a materially-determined function. The nucleation criterion speci�es a critical value of f at an incipient phase boundary.

40|$|International audiencePhase {{transition}} {{problems in}} compressible media can be modelled by mixed hyperbolicelliptic systems of conservation laws. Within this approach phase boundaries are understood as shock waves that satisfy additional constraints, sometimes called kinetic relations. In recent years several tracking-type algorithms {{have been suggested}} for numerical approximation. Typically a core piece of these algorithms is the usage of exact Riemann solvers incorporating the <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> {{at the location of}} phase boundaries. However, exact Riemann solvers are computationally expensive or even not available. In this paper we present a class of approximate Riemann solvers for hyperbolic-elliptic models that relies on a generalized relaxation procedure. It preserves in particular the <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> for phase boundaries exactly and gives for isolated phase transitions the correct solutions. In combination with a novel sub-iteration procedure the approximate Riemann solvers are used in the tracking algorithms. The efficiency of the approach is validated on a barotropic system with linear <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> where exact Riemann solvers are available. For a nonlinear <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> and a thermoelastic system we use the new method to gain information on the Riemann problem. Up to our knowledge an exact solution for arbitrary Riemann data is currently not available in these cases...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theory for dynamical martensitic phase transitions in strings and beams. Shape memory alloys {{that rely on}} such phase transitions for their unique properties are often used in slender configurations like beams and rods. Yet most studies of phase transformations are in one dimension and consider only extension. The theory presented in this thesis to model these slender structures {{is based on the}} general continuum mechanical framework of thermoelasticity with a non-convex Helmholtz free energy. This non-convexity allows for the simultaneous existence of several metastable phases in a material; in particular, it leads to the formation of phase boundaries. The study of the laws governing the propagation of phase boundaries is the object of this thesis. Phase boundaries in strings are studied first. It is demonstrated that the motion of phase boundaries is not fully described by the usual balance laws of mass, momentum and energy. Additional constitutive information must be furnished from outside, and this additional information {{is referred to as the}} <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation.</b> While this notion is well-accepted in continuum theory, there is no definitive experiment or theoretical framework to determine the <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation.</b> This study of strings proposes a simple experiment to determine the <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation.</b> It also proposes a numerical method that accurately describes the complex behaviour of strings with phase boundaries. The <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> can also be viewed from the atomic scale. Phase transformations involve a complex rearrangement of the atoms the explicit details of which are averaged in a continuum theory. The <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> may be viewed as an aggregate of those aspects of the atomistic rearrangement that have a bearing on macroscopic phenomena. This view is explored using a simple one dimensional model of an atomic chain with non-convex interaction potentials. A <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation</b> is obtained from dynamic simulations of impact experiments on the chain. The latter part of this thesis studies beams made of materials capable of phase transitions. It develops a conceptual framework that accounts for extension, shear and flexure in such beams using a non-convex stored energy function. Specific constitutive assumptions that relate to the underlying crystallography are developed. The theory is applied to design a simple experiment on single crystals of martensitic materials with the objective of measuring the <b>kinetic</b> <b>relation.</b> Finally, propulsion at small scales is discussed as an application of beams made of phase transforming material. The goal is to mimic the flagellum of a micro-organism by propagating phase boundaries through a shearbale rod...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{prove the}} {{existence}} and uniqueness of the Riemann solutions to the Euler equations closed byN independent constitutive pressure laws. This model stands as a natural asymptotic system for the multi-pressure Navier–Stokes equations in the regime of infinite Reynolds number. Due to the inherent lack of conservation form in the viscous regularization, the limit system exhibits measure-valued source terms concentrated on shock discontinuities. These non-positive bounded measures, called <b>kinetic</b> <b>relations,</b> are known to provide a suitable tool to encode the small-scale sensitivity in the singular limit. Considering N independent polytropic pressure laws, we show that these <b>kinetic</b> <b>relations</b> can be derived by solving a simple algebraic problem which governs the endpoints of the underlying viscous shock profiles, for any given but prescribed ratio of viscosity coefficient in the viscous perturbation.
