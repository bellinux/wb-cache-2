50|$|A <b>fan</b> <b>filter</b> unit (FFU) {{is a type}} of {{motorized}} {{air filtering}} equipment. It is used to supply purified air to cleanrooms, laboratories, medical facilities or microenvironments by removing harmful airborne particles from recirculating air. The units are installed within the system's ceiling or floor grid. Large cleanrooms require a proportionally large number of FFUs, which in some cases may range from several hundred to several thousand. Units often contain their own pre-filter, HEPA filter and internally controllable fan air distribution.|$|E
50|$|There exist {{different}} types of PAPR units for different working environments. Regardless of type, a PAPR consists of (1) some kind of headgear (mask or hood), (2) a powered (motor-driven) fan which forces incoming air through (3) a filter (or multiple filters) for delivery to the user for breathing, and (4) a battery or other power source. The mask may be hard and tight-fitting or flexible and loose-fitting. (The former affords {{a higher level of}} protection, but is less comfortable.) The <b>fan,</b> <b>filter,</b> and power-pack may be carried around freely by the user, often secured by a belt around the waist. Alternatively, with certain units, the air is fed to the user via lengthy tubing while the fans and filters are remotely mounted.|$|E

This paper will describe the design, development and testing of a software tool that can be effectively used to translate three dimensional building data sets of geometry, materials and HVAC components into an input file for the airflow and contaminant concentration simulation program CONTAM. The objective of the exercise is to allow for shorter turnaround time in evaluating IAQ strategies and building security related issues. The software tool, ‘fsIFCCTM’, has been successfully tested to translate 3 -D building elements like spaces, walls, doors, windows, and HVAC components like ducts, duct junctions, terminals, <b>fans,</b> <b>filters</b> etc. With additional work, the software can be further extended to translate elements like sensors and controls.

[...] Ceiling grids with standard size bays that match FFU dimensions are used to construct cleanrooms. Depending on the cleanliness requirements of the controlled space, more <b>fan</b> <b>filter</b> units can be added to the grid in order to meet ISO standards for airflow velocity and air changes per hour. [...] FFUs can be used in place of a more conventional recirculating air unit such as a ducted or plenum air system. As FFUs require space above the ceiling grid (13" [...] for the FFU module plus another 1-2 feet of [...] "empty" [...] air-filled space), plenums are commonly used for clean rooms with height restrictions; they are the only air systems that work in layouts with smaller internal floor dimensions. Additionally, when less than 20 filters are installed in a room, a fan- powered HEPA, FFU is generally considered to be less expensive than a more conventional ducted supply system. When a microenvironment of clean air is required, FFUs can be used to construct enclosed work spaces, or laminar flow cabinets. Applying the same principle as the larger cleanroom grid, FFUs can be placed directly in a free- standing grid above the space that requires clean air. In fact, this approach is also used for silicon wafer etching in the semiconductor industry.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new and {{powerful}} technique to determine the optimal values of coefficients of McClellan transformation used to map very effectively 1 -D filter prototypes in 2 -D FIR filters. The new algorithm permits the mapping of 1 -D prototype in an arbitrary chosen 2 -D contour. The algorithm minimizes all along the given contour, in a least squares sense, the total error between the ideal contour of the imposed boundary of the 2 -D filter bandpass and an isopotential curve described by the McClellan transform. Additional initial designing conditions can be expressed as constraints for this minimization problem, which is solved as a constrained least squares minimization problem. Numerical examples, which include circularly symmetric and diamond-shaped filters, elliptically symmetric and 2 -D <b>fan</b> <b>filters</b> demonstrate by lower error values attained by comparison with previous works the effectiveness and the usefulness of this method...|$|R
30|$|Installation of {{production}} equipment may be preceded by additional evaluation steps, namely Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) and Site Acceptance Testing (SAT). FAT/SAT are particularly useful {{in case of}} complex and/or bulky equipment, or when the intended instrument has been specifically designed, based on URS. A good example is represented by hot cells, {{whether or not they}} include automated systems. Hot cells are indeed bulky, and sometimes require some degree of customization, especially in case they have to be used for non-standard processes. During FAT, functionality of major components (buttons, <b>fan,</b> <b>filters,</b> etc.) may be tested, as well as parameters typically verified during OQ such as air velocity, leak tightness or particle contamination. The above tests might help to reveal possible malfunctions or deviations, that may be fixed directly at the Factory, before the shipment. FAT are usually repeated on Site (SAT), and they can be considered as part of the whole qualification.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A light {{field is}} a four-dimensional (4 -D) representa-tion {{of the light}} permeating a scene—it parameterizes light rays as a {{function}} of position and direction. Such a structure can be mea-sured using a specialized camera and can be used to render novel views of the scene it represents. It has previously been shown that the light field model of a scene may be filtered for a single depth by employing frequency-planar filters. Here, we show how a light field may be selectively filtered for a range of depths by forming a 4 -D frequency passband that surrounds the intersection of two 4 -D fans. A newly proposed cascaded filter bank is shown to ap-proximate this passband, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on two scenes, both of which contain occlusions. Results are compared with those previously obtained using 4 -D frequency-planar filters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: HVAC {{maintain}} both {{comfort and}} safety of indoor air quality. The challenge of maintaining high product quality while simultaneously reducing production costs can often be met through investments in energy efficient technologies and energy efficiency practices. The greatest opportunities for energy efficiency exist {{at the design stage}} for HVAC systems in new industrial facilities. By sizing components of HVAC systems generally include dampers, supply and exhaust <b>fans,</b> <b>filters,</b> humidifiers, dehumidifiers, heating and cooling coils, ducts, and various sensors properly and designing energy efficiency into a new facility, an industry can minimize the energy consumption and operational costs of its plant HVAC systems from the outset. Optimizing system design and operations, such as minimizing laboratory ventilation, can also lead to significant reductions in energy use. Energy efficiency improvement is an important way to reduce these costs and to increase predictable earnings, especially in times of high energy price volatility. There are a variety of opportunities available at individual plants in the industry to reduce energy consumption in a cost-effective manner...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As medical {{ultrasound}} imaging moves to larger apertures and higher frequencies, tissue sound-speed variations continue to limit resolution. In geophysical imaging, a standard approach for estimating near-surface aberrating delays is {{to analyze the}} time shifts between common-midpoint signals. This requires complete data—echoes from every source/receiver pair in the array. Unfocused common-midpoint signals remain highly correlated {{in the presence of}} delay aberrations; there is also tremendous redundancy in the data. In medical ultrasound, this technique has been impaired by the wide-angle, random-scattering nature of tissue. This has made it difficult to estimate azimuth-dependent aberration profiles or to harness the full redundancy in the complete data. Prefiltering the data with two-dimensional <b>fan</b> <b>filters</b> mitigates these problems, permitting highly overdetermined, least-squares solutions for the aberration profiles at many steering angles. In experiments with a tissue-mimicking phantom target and silicone rubber aberrators at nonzero stand-off distances from a 1 -D phased array, this overdetermined, fan-filtering algorithm (OFF) significantly outperformed other phase-screen algorithms based on nearest-neighbor cross-correlation, speckle brightness maximization, and common-midpoint signal analysis. Our results imply that there is still progress to be made in imaging with single-valued focusing operators. It also appears that the SNR penalty for using complete data sets is partially compensated by the overdetermined nature of the problem.
