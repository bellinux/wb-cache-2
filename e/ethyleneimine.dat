Similarly, chicks of groups A 3, B 3, C 3 and D 3 were vaccinated with non adjuvanted vaccines (NA-HPSV) with two virus concentrations and two inactivants. Group E was kept as unvaccinated control. All the vaccinated birds were found sero-positive 7 days post vaccination (PV). IHA GMT results indicated no difference for different virus concentrations and different virus inactivants with same adjuvant (P> 0. 05).

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of and conformation {{adopted by}} a branched-linear polymer conjugate to the hydrophilic silica aqueous solution interface have been studied by in situ null ellipsornetry and Monte Carlo simulations. The conjugate is a highly branched polyethyleneimine structure with ethyleneoxide chains grafted to its primary and secondary amino groups. In situ null ellipsometry demonstrated that the polymer conjugate adsorbs to the silica surface from water and aqueous solution of 1 mM asymmetric divalent salt (calcium and magnesium chloride to emulate hard water) over a large pH range. The adsorbed amount is hardly affected by pH and large charge reversal on the negatively charged silica surface occurred at pH = 4. 0, due to the adsorption of the cationic polyelectrolyte. The Monte Carlo simulations using an appropriate coarse-grained model of the polymer in solution predicted a core shell structure with no sharp boundary between the <b>ethyleneimine</b> and ethyleneoxide moieties. The structure at the interface {{is similar to that}} in solution when the polymer degree of protonation is low or moderate while at high degree of protonation the strong electrostatic attraction between the <b>ethyleneimine</b> core and oppositely charged silica surface distorts the ethyleneoxide shell so that an "anemone"-like configuration is adopted. The adsorption of alkyl benzene sulfonic acid (LAS) to a preadsorbed polymer layer was also investigated by null ellipsometry.

The transfected cells, expressing high levels of the bacterial protein, are more resistant to the toxic and mutagenic effects of aziridine than the control population.

Exogenous thiols protect against inactivation, but oxidized thiols accelerate inactivation. Human lung fibroblast galaptin is almost completely inactivated within 1 h in tissue culture medium at 37 degrees C. Alkylation of native rat lung galaptin with iodoacetate or <b>ethyleneimine</b> causes substantial loss of activity. The dimeric galaptin structure is maintained.

The three sorbents were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) : the sorption occurs in the whole mass of the sorbents.

A special {{attention was paid to}} the effect of drying (air-drying vs. freeze-drying) on the mass transfer properties. For alginate, freeze drying is required for maintaining the porosity of the hydrogel, while for algal-based sorbents the swelling of the material minimizes the impact of the drying procedure. The maximum sorption capacities observed from experiments were 415, 296 and 218 mg Pb g− 1 and 112, 77 and 67 mg Cu g− 1 for alginate, algal and algal/PEI beads respectively. Though the sorption capacities of algal-beads decreased slightly (compared to alginate beads), the greener and cheaper one-pot synthesis of algal beads makes this sorbent more competitive for environmental applications.
