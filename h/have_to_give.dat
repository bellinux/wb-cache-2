5|$|October 5, 1841—No {{work was}} done today, as all the people have it to gather their own crop—It is a rule which we <b>have,</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> all the negroes {{one day in the}} spring to plant, and one day in the fall to reap, and as there is a rule on Sea Island {{plantations}} fixing the tasks required each day to be done, it occurs, during the long days of summer, that the hand is generally done his task by 2 p.m., often sooner, so they have abundance of time to work their own crop, fish, etc., etc.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas morning, {{everybody}} {{wakes up}} to find no presents under their trees. They turn on the news, which is broadcasting the same story. Brian and Stewie appear on the broadcast and bring the dying Santa out in a wheelchair, explaining that humanity's greed is killing him and if they don't shorten their demands to one Christmas present a year, they may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up Christmas altogether. Chastened, everyone agrees and by one year later, Santa has recovered, the workshop is once again a lively, colorful cottage and the elves and reindeer are all rejuvenated.|$|E
5|$|After the draft, Milwaukee {{attempted}} to convince Yi {{to sign with}} the team and on 2 July 2007, {{the owner of the}} Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract.|$|E

5|$|Newly crowned TNA X Division Champion, A.J. Styles, went on {{to defend}} his {{championship}} against Christopher Daniels in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Against All Odds. Styles had to defend the championship against Daniels at the event as per a pre-match stipulation to their bout on the January 21 episode of Impact!, in which if Styles failed to defeat Daniels in under 10 minutes, then he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Daniels a title shot. Styles failed to win the contest in under ten minutes, which granted Daniels a title match. Dusty Rhodes then made the match a 30-minute Iron Man match. Styles {{went on to}} defeat Daniels at Against All Odds 2 to 1 in falls during over-time.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant stature of the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, to sit in the cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin legs in the aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't mind if he took it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape and they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E

5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland {{that she would}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a management contract and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends {{at home with her}} mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize her as much as she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The Nutcracker at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in Don Quixote at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate Nutcracker, an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, British Airways {{took over}} British Midland International (BMI) which {{gave them a}} {{monopoly}} on UK mainland flights from Heathrow. In order for the deal to be completed, the European Union Competition Commissioner decreed that BA would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up 14 of BMI's landing slots at Heathrow to comply with EU competition regulations. 12 of these slots were set aside for domestic usage, which were bought by Virgin Atlantic after they outbid Aer Lingus for the required British domestic operating licence. Virgin announced that they would set up Virgin Atlantic Little Red as a subsidiary to use these slots to cover domestic UK mainland routes as Aer Lingus already provided competition for BA on flights to Northern Ireland from Heathrow. Little Red was later revealed to be operated on a wet-lease by Aer Lingus whereby the planes would be operated by Aer Lingus but would bear Virgin Atlantic livery. The pilots would be employed by Aer Lingus, with cabin crew supplied by McGinley Aviation. The cabin crew would wear Virgin Little Red uniforms and had training from Virgin, {{despite the fact that}} airline had not previously operated narrow-body aircraft.|$|E

If he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> in, then it should be to no woman, and to no social ideal, and to no social institution. No!--if he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> yield his wilful independence, and give himself, then he would rather <b>give</b> himself <b>to</b> the little, {{individual}} man than {{to any of the}} rest. For to tell the truth, in the man was something incomprehensible, which had dominion over him, if he chose to allow it.|$|R

And you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up your faith to win in the NFL. It confirmed and re-affirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching....|$|E
25|$|The {{leaders of}} {{military}} cells {{are responsible for}} training them, and, when an operation is scheduled, selecting the operational commander, giving him the basic objective and arranging whatever support is needed, and then release him from tight control to execute the meeting. Depending on the specific case, the military leaders might have direct, possibly one-way, communications with their cells, or they might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Kim the messages to be transmitted, by means that Anton and Hassan have no need to know.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August 1976, a censored and toned-down yet devastating {{report on}} Prince Bernhard's {{activities}} was released to a shocked Dutch public. The prince resigned his various high-profile positions as a lieutenant admiral, a general, and an Inspector General of the Armed Forces. He resigned from his {{positions in the}} board of many businesses, charities, the World Wildlife Fund, and other institutions. The prince also accepted that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up wearing his beloved uniforms. In return, the States-General accepted that {{there was to be}} no criminal prosecution.|$|E

25|$|Roanoke Island {{was the key}} {{to control}} of the Sounds. If {{controlled}} by the Union forces, they would have a base that could be attacked only by an amphibious operation, which the Rebels could not mount. If the Union established naval superiority there, all points on the mainland shores would be equally vulnerable to assault. The Confederate defenders would be forced into an impossible situation: they would either <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up some positions without a fight, or they would have to spread their assets too thin to be of any use.|$|E
25|$|Emirati {{nationality}} {{law does}} not offer dual citizenship, hence those who become citizens of other countries <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up their UAE nationality. The giving up of UAE citizenship is generally frowned upon in Emirati society. Government figures show that around 250 Emiratis became British citizens between 1990 and 2012, while a few others also gained American and Western citizenships over the years. Most such cases are typically {{of those who have}} been settled in their resident countries for long periods, or have married foreign spouses.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{would retain}} around 9% in the West Bank in {{exchange}} for 1% of land within the Green Line. The land that would be conceded included symbolic and cultural territories such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, whereas the Israeli land conceded was unspecified. Additional to territorial concessions, Palestinian airspace would be controlled by Israel under Barak's offer. The Palestinians rejected the Halutza Sand region (78km²) alongside the Gaza Strip {{as part of the}} land swap on the basis that it was of inferior quality to that which they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up in the West Bank.|$|E
