[...] They proposed to investigate the function and evolution of animal communication between predators and prey using robots that can interact with predators. They also stated in their proposal that their research project would support and provide training for future scientists and engineers.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{rates of}} discontinuation and restarting of statins, {{and to identify}} patient characteristics associated with either discontinuation or restarting. Design: Prospective open cohort study. Setting: 664 general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in the United Kingdom. Data extracted in October 2014. Participants: Incident statin users aged 25 - 84 years identified between January 2002 and September 2013. Patients with statin prescriptions divided into two groups: primary prevention and secondary prevention (those already diagnosed with cardiovascular disease). Patients with statin prescriptions in the 12 months before study entry were excluded. Main outcome measures: Discontinuation of statin treatment (first 90 day gap after the <b>estimated</b> <b>end</b> <b>date</b> of a statin prescription), and restarting statin treatment for those who discontinued (defined as any subsequent prescription between discontinuation and study end). Results: Of 431 [*] 023 patients prescribed statins as primary prevention with a median follow-up time of 137 weeks, 47...|$|E

The impact on causal effects based on matching is highest during the lock-in period and for long programs. The advice for future users of the IEBS is to decide depending on their evaluation design and goal if an explicit correction of <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> is necessary. In case an explicit correction is dispensable, it seems still important to take care that program spells are not given priority to employment spells in case of conflict.

40|$|Many wars or {{conflicts}} in U. S. history have federally designated “periods of war,” dates marking their beginning and <b>ending.</b> These <b>dates</b> {{are important for}} qualification for certain veterans’ pension or disability benefits. Confusion can occur because beginning and <b>ending</b> <b>dates</b> for “periods of war” in many nonofficial sources are often different from those given in treaties and other official sources of information, and armistice dates can be confused with termination dates. This report lists the beginning and <b>ending</b> <b>dates</b> for “periods of war” found in Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, dealing with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It also lists and differentiates other beginning dates given in declarations of war, as well as termination of hostilities dates and armistice and <b>ending</b> <b>dates</b> given in proclamations, laws, or treaties.
