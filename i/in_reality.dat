5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. <b>In</b> <b>reality,</b> the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official.
