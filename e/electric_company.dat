50|$|The New Mexico Supreme Court {{issued a}} ruling in 1978 {{and found that}} the state energy tax was valid. The court concluded, if the total tax burden on the <b>electric</b> <b>companies</b> was considered, that since the tax on {{electricity}} generated was applicable to both electricity sold in-state and out-of-state, and that the credit against the state gross receipts tax was available to both in-state and out-of-state <b>electric</b> <b>companies,</b> it did not result in a discriminatory tax burden. The <b>electric</b> <b>companies</b> then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming that the tax violated the Commerce and Export-Import Clauses of the Constitution and was invalid under 15 U.S.C. § 391.|$|R

5|$|Beatty's {{population}} grew {{slowly in the}} first half of the 20thcentury, rising from 169 in 1929 to 485 in 1950. The first reliable <b>electric</b> <b>company</b> in the community, Amargosa Power Company, began supplying electricity in about 1940. Phone service arrived during World War II, and the town installed a community-wide sewer system in the 1970s. When a new mine opened west of Beatty in 1988, the population briefly surged from about 1,000 to between 1,500 and 2,000 by the end of 1990. Since the mine's closing in 1998, the population has fallen again to near its former level.|$|E
