5|$|Many early sources {{gave the}} {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> as Carcharias (later Carcharhinus) lamiella, which originated from an 1882 account by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert. Although Jordan and Gilbert referred {{to a set of}} jaws that came from a <b>dusky</b> <b>shark,</b> the type specimen they designated was later discovered to be a copper shark (C. brachyurus). Therefore, C. lamiella is not considered a synonym of C. obscurus but rather of C. brachyurus. Other common names for this species include bay shark, black whaler, brown common gray shark, brown <b>dusky</b> <b>shark,</b> brown shark, common whaler, dusky ground shark, dusky whaler, river whaler, shovelnose, and slender whaler shark.|$|E
5|$|Teeth {{belonging}} to the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> are fairly well represented in the fossil record, though assigning Carcharhinus teeth to species can be problematic. <b>Dusky</b> <b>shark</b> teeth dating to the Miocene (23-5.3 Ma) have been recovered from the Kendeace and Grand Bay formations in Carriacou, the Grenadines, the Moghra Formation in Egypt, Polk County, Florida, and possibly Cerro La Cruz in northern Venezuela. Teeth dating to the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (11.6-3.6 Ma) are abundant in the Yorktown Formation and the Pungo River, North Carolina, and from the Chesapeake Bay region; these teeth differ slightly from the modern <b>dusky</b> <b>shark,</b> and have often been misidentified as {{belonging to}} the oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus). <b>Dusky</b> <b>shark</b> teeth have also been recovered from the vicinity of two baleen whales in North Carolina, one preserved in Goose Creek Limestone dating to the Late Pliocene (c. 3.5 Ma), {{and the other in}} mud dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene (c. 12,000 years ago).|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable {{in the northwestern}} Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. The American Fisheries Society has also assessed North American <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> populations as Vulnerable. Its very low reproductive rate renders the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> extremely susceptible to overfishing.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the broad-scale movements and pelagic habitats of large juvenile <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus obscurus) off Southern Australia.

5|$|The <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus obscurus) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, {{occurring}} in tropical and warm-temperate continental seas worldwide. A generalist apex predator, the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> can be found from the coast to the outer continental shelf and adjacent pelagic waters, and has been recorded from a depth of 400 m (1,300ft). Populations migrate seasonally towards the poles {{in the summer and}} towards the equator in the winter, traveling hundreds to thousands of kilometers. One of the largest members of its genus, the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> reaches 4.2m (14ft) in length and 347kg (765lb) in weight. It has a slender, streamlined body and can be identified by its short round snout, long sickle-shaped pectoral fins, ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins, and faintly marked fins.|$|E
5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> is {{very vulnerable}} to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E
5|$|Stocks off {{the eastern}} United States are {{severely}} overfished; a 2006 stock assessment {{survey by the}} U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) showed that its population had dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. In 1997, the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> {{was identified as a}} Species of Concern by the NMFS, meaning that it warranted conservation concern but there was insufficient information for listing on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species gear. In addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area closure to reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from prohibited species like the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark,</b> versus similar allowed species such as the sandbar shark.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial <b>shark</b> fisheries, <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> are also caught as bycatch on longlines meant for tuna and swordfish (and usually kept for its valuable fins), and by recreational fishers. Large numbers of <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks,</b> mostly juveniles, are caught by sport fishers off South Africa and eastern Australia. This shark was {{once one of}} the most important species in the Florida trophy shark tournaments, before the population collapsed.|$|R
500|$|Full-grown <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> have no {{significant}} natural predators. Major predators of young sharks include the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus), {{the great white}} shark (Carcharodon carcharias), the bull shark (C. leucas), and the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Off KwaZulu-Natal, the use of shark nets to protect beaches has reduced the populations of these large predators, leading to {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of juvenile <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> (a phenomenon called [...] "predator release"). In turn, the juvenile sharks have decimated populations of small bony fishes, with negative consequences for the biodiversity of the local ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|The Virginia Institute of Marine Science has {{conducted}} a fishery-independent longline survey during summer months since 1974. Data for sandbar <b>sharks</b> and <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> {{captured in the}} survey between 1975 and 2009 are presented. Most of the sandbar sharks encountered by the survey were immature, with females composing {{almost all of the}} mature sandbar catch. Almost all <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> captured were immature. Most of the catch since the early 1990 ’s has been composed of 0 - 4 year age classes. Nominal and standardized catch rates are presented.

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} {{moderately}} falcate (sickle-shaped), with the origin over the pectoral fin rear tips. It {{is followed by a}} low midline ridge running to the second dorsal fin. The second dorsal fin originates over the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large with pointed tips. The coloration is brownish gray above and white below, with a faint white stripe on the sides. The edges of the fins are darker but not prominently marked. The Galapagos shark can be distinguished from the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> in having taller first and second dorsal fins and larger teeth, and it can be distinguished from the grey reef shark in having a less robust body and less pointed first dorsal fin tip. However, these characters can be difficult to discern in the field. These similar species also have different numbers of precaudal (before the tail) vertebrae: 58 in the Galapagos shark, 8697 in the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark,</b> 110119 in the grey reef shark.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (Prionace glauca). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while {{there appears to be}} no reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Adult <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> have a {{broad and}} varied diet, {{consisting}} mostly of bony fishes, sharks and rays, and cephalopods, but also occasionally crustaceans, sea stars, bryozoans, sea turtles, marine mammals, carrion, and garbage. This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after {{which there is a}} year of rest before they become pregnant again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be few and far between due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. <b>Dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|R
40|$|Predator–prey {{dynamics}} {{represent an}} important determinant in {{the functioning of}} marine ecosystems. This study provides the first quantitative investigation of the diets of sympatric pelagic shark species in gulf and shelf waters off southern Australia. Stomachs of 417 sharks collected from fishery catches between 2007 and 2011 were examined, including 250 bronze whalers, 52 shortfin makos, 49 <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks,</b> 39 smooth hammerheads, and 27 common threshers. <b>Dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> had the highest dietary diversity of the five species examined. We found overlap in the consumption of cephalopods, small pelagic teleosts, crustaceans, and benthic teleosts in bronze whalers, <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks,</b> and smooth hammerheads, and preliminary evidence of specialization in the highly migratory species, the common thresher and the shortfin mako. Findings were discussed and compared with previous studies in other temperate marine ecosystems. This study will significantly improve {{the understanding of the}} ecological roles of these top predators in the gulf and shelf habitats off southern Australia, and enhance the ecosystem models being developed for this unique bioregion.

5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} silky shark {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the sandbar shark (C.plumbeus) and the bignose shark (C.altimus), while the silky shark is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef shark (C.perezi), Galapagos shark (C.galapagensis), oceanic whitetip shark (C.longimanus), <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> (C.obscurus), and blue shark (Prionace glauca). Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|E
5|$|The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezii) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{belonging}} to the family Carcharhinidae. It {{is found in the}} tropical waters of the western Atlantic Ocean from Florida to Brazil, and is the most commonly encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea. With a robust, streamlined body typical of the requiem sharks, this species is difficult to tell apart from other large members of its family such as the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> (C. obscurus) and the silky shark (C. falciformis). Distinguishing characteristics include dusky-colored fins without prominent markings, a short free rear tip on the second dorsal fin, and tooth shape and number.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, {{tuna and}} mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dusky</b> Whaler <b>sharks</b> {{are seen}} {{regularly}} by divers in this area.|$|R
500|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, around 60% of the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark's</b> diet {{consists}} of bony fishes, from over ten families with bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) being especially important. Cartilaginous fishes, mainly skates and their egg cases, are the second-most important dietary component, while the lady crab (Ovalipes ocellatus) {{is also a}} relatively significant food source. In South African and Australian waters, bony fishes are again the most important prey type. Newborn and juvenile sharks subsist mainly on small pelagic prey such as sardines and squid; older sharks over [...] long broaden their diets to include larger bony and cartilaginous fishes. The run of the southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax), occurring off the eastern coast of South Africa every winter, is attended by medium and large-sized <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks.</b> Pregnant and post-partum females do not join, possibly because the energy cost of gestation leaves them unable to pursue such swift prey. One South African study reported that 0.2% of the sharks examined had preyed upon bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus).|$|R
5|$|The predators of the {{tilefish}} {{are poorly}} understood. Juveniles can be preyed upon by dogfish or conger eels, which are prey for adult tilefish. Sharks have been presumed be predators of the tilefish, but no evidence is seen of free-swimming tilefish {{being attacked by}} <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> or sandbar sharks. The one listed predator for the tilefish is the goosefish. The function of the tilefish's burrows was predator avoidance, but this has been disputed because chased tilefish try to outswim their predators rather than entering their burrows to seek shelter.|$|R
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark,</b> the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> is {{considered}} to be potentially dangerous to humans because of its large size, though little is known of how it behaves towards people underwater. As of 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists it as responsible for six attacks on people and boats, three of them unprovoked and one fatal. However, attacks attributed to this species off Bermuda and other islands were probably in reality caused by Galapagos sharks. Shark nets used to protect beaches in South Africa and Australia entangle adult and larger juvenile dusky sharks in some numbers. From 1978 to 1999, an average of 256 individuals were caught annually in nets off KwaZulu-Natal; species-specific data is not available for nets off Australia. Young dusky sharks adapt well to display in public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked, the skin is made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 tons per year. The fishery utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three years old, with 1828% of all newborns captured in their first year. Demographic models suggest that the fishery is sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E
50|$|The predators of the {{tilefish}} {{are poorly}} understood. Juveniles can be preyed upon by dogfish or conger eels, which are prey for adult tilefish.

40|$|Sharks {{vary widely}} in life-history strategies, and possess unique lipid metabolism. Because of this diversity, and {{organochlorine}} (OC) lipid association, dynamics of OC accumulation in elasmobranch-rich ecosystems may be ineffectively {{predicted by the}} typically relied upon indicators, stable isotopes and body size. I compared ontogenetic OC profiles and concentrations between dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) and white (Carcharodon carcharias) sharks. OC concentrations were elevated in the larger, higher trophic position (TP) white shark, but despite a tenably faster growth rate, ontogenetic diet shifts to mammal prey, and regional endothermy, slopes of growth-dilution corrected concentrations with age were equal between species. Similar ontogenetic TP increases, infrequent white shark seal predation, or inaccurate growth parameters are possible explanations. Inshore habitat use and mass varied in white and <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> respectively with OC profiles and concentrations. TP and mass predicted interspecific concentrations and may therefore be considered reliable indicators of OC accumulation in these sharks...|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks</b> attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|R
5|$|The {{range of}} the <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> extends worldwide, albeit discontinuously, in {{tropical}} and warm-temperate waters. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it is found from Massachusetts and the Georges Bank to southern Brazil, including the Bahamas and Cuba. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{it has been reported}} from the western and central Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and possibly elsewhere including Portugal, Spain, Morocco, and Madeira. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off South Africa, Mozambique, and Madagascar, with sporadic records in the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and perhaps the Red Sea. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan, mainland China and Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia, and New Caledonia in the west, and from southern California to the Gulf of California, around Revillagigedo, and possibly off northern Chile in the east. Records of dusky sharks from the northeastern and eastern central Atlantic, and around tropical islands, may in fact be of Galapagos sharks. Mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite evidence suggest that Indonesian and Australian sharks represent distinct populations.|$|E
25|$|For most of {{the smaller}} species of dolphins, {{only a few of}} the larger sharks, such as the bull shark, <b>dusky</b> <b>shark,</b> tiger shark, and great white shark, are a {{potential}} risk, especially for calves. Dolphins can tolerate and recover from extreme injuries (including shark bites) although the exact methods used to achieve this are not known. The healing process is rapid and even very deep wounds do not cause dolphins to hemorrhage to death. Even gaping wounds restore in such a way that the animal's body shape is restored, and infection of such large wounds are rare.|$|E
500|$|The <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> is a generalist {{that takes}} {{a wide variety of}} prey from all levels of the water column, though it favors hunting near the bottom.

The bite force exerted by a [...] long <b>dusky</b> <b>shark</b> has been measured at [...] over the [...] area at the tip of a tooth. This is the highest figure thus far measured from any shark, though it also reflects the concentration of force at the tooth tip. Dense aggregations of young sharks, forming in response to feeding opportunities, have been documented in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
500|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} for {{the copper}} shark exist off New Zealand, Australia (though the [...] "bronze whaler fishery" [...] of Western Australia actually takes mostly <b>dusky</b> <b>sharks),</b> South Africa, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico, and China; it {{also contributes to}} the bycatch of other commercial fisheries across its range. This species is caught in gillnets and on bottom longlines, and to a much lesser extent in bottom trawls and on pelagic longlines. The meat is sold for human consumption. The copper shark is also popular with recreational fishers in Namibia, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Mexico and California, predominantly by anglers but also by bowfishers and gillnetters. In New Zealand, it is the Carcharhinus species most frequently caught by sport fishers and sustains a small, summer recreational fishery in northern North Island, that mainly captures pregnant and post-partum females {{and for the most}} part practices tag and release. A tag and release program is also practiced in Namibia.|$|R
