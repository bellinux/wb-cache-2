5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales. Different tales {{have been told}} of the corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the <b>Dachshund</b> breed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dachshunds</b> {{may not be}} {{the best}} pets for small children. Like any dog, <b>dachshunds</b> need a proper {{introduction}} at a young age. Well trained <b>dachshunds</b> and well behaved children usually get along fine. Otherwise, they may be aggressive and bite an unfamiliar child, especially one that moves quickly around them or teases them. However, many <b>dachshunds</b> are very tolerant and loyal to children within their family, but these children should be mindful of the vulnerability of the breed's back.|$|R
5000|$|Liliane Kaufmann, wife of Edgar J. Kaufmann who {{commissioned}} the home Fallingwater from Frank Lloyd Wright in 1935, was a well known breeder {{and owner of}} long-haired <b>dachshunds.</b> At the Fallingwater bookstore, visitors are able to purchase a book titled [...] "Moxie" [...] which is {{about one of the}} <b>dachshunds</b> who lived at Fallingwater. [...] Liliane raised long haired <b>dachshunds</b> and they travelled from Pittsburgh to Bear Run with her.|$|R
5|$|While {{stationed}} in Cologne, Müncheberg trained for the decathlon at the ASV Köln (sports club in Cologne) during {{his spare time}} and competed in various national and international track and field events. He even had a training field built on the family estate at Friedrichshof in Pomerania {{and at the time}} had strong ambitions to compete in the 1940 Summer Olympics. His commanding officers supported him in this athletic vision and gave him additional time off to practice for the Olympics. Müncheberg owned a <b>dachshund</b> (Dackel), which his mother had bred, named Seppl. The dog accompanied him from the start of World War II until his death on 23 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a <b>Dachshund.</b> There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
25|$|The {{trademark}} {{symbol for}} the Urbino bus series is a green <b>dachshund.</b> Different versions of buses have symbols with different details. <b>Dachshund</b> hybrid models have two hearts symbolising a dual drive system, and ecological models in EEV version have a <b>dachshund</b> holding a flower in its mouth.

50|$|<b>Dachshunds</b> are playful, but as hunting dogs can {{be quite}} stubborn, and {{are known for their}} {{propensity}} for chasing small animals, birds, and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity. Many <b>dachshunds</b> are stubborn, making them a challenge to train.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the cross sectional area (CSA) and fat infiltration of the epaxial muscles in <b>Dachshunds</b> with compressive spinal cord lesions due to intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH) and in dogs with non-compressive spinal cord lesions with fibrocartilaginous embolism (FCE). The CSA and fat infiltration of the multifidi and longissimus dorsi muscles were determined from T 1 weighted magnetic resonance images. Difference in CSA and fat infiltration between the lesion- and non-lesion side in the <b>Dachshunds</b> was assessed using mixed model analysis. Difference in CSA and fat infiltration between <b>Dachshunds</b> and FCE dogs was analysed with independent sample t-tests. There {{was no difference in}} CSA or fat infiltration between sides in the <b>Dachshunds.</b> FCE dogs had greater CSA (multifidus P[*]=[*] 0. 036, longissimus P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and less fat infiltration compared to <b>Dachshunds</b> (longissimus P[*]=[*] 0. 017). Duration of neurological deficits, age, body size and conformation are likely to have influenced the difference between the groups...|$|R

5000|$|Light-colored <b>dachshunds</b> can sport amber, light brown, {{or green}} eyes; however, kennel club {{standards}} {{state that the}} darker the eye color, the better. They can also have eyes of two different colors; however, this is only found in dapple and double dapple <b>dachshunds.</b> <b>Dachshunds</b> can have a blue and a brown eye. Blue eyes, partially blue eyes, or a blue eye and a brown eye are called [...] "wall" [...] coloring, and are considered a non-desirable trait in kennel club standards. Dappled eyes are also possible.|$|R
50|$|The lion {{continues}} to chase Krazy for many yards. On the way, the lion comes across {{a pack of}} <b>dachshunds.</b> The <b>dachshunds</b> try to outrun the lion but the big cat swallows them. The <b>dachshunds</b> are able to exit the lion's mouth. But as they come out, the little dogs have been transformed into little lions. Despite their size, the little lions manage to scare away their swallower. The little lions then turn to and confront Krazy. But as they jump forth, Krazy traps the tiny beasts in a bottle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dachshunds</b> are {{statistically}} more aggressive to both strangers and other dogs. Despite this, they are rated {{in the intelligence}} of dogs as an average working dog with a persistent ability to follow trained commands 50% of the time or more. They rank 49th in Stanley Coren's Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working and obedience intelligence.They can have a loud bark. Some bark quite a lot and may need training to stop, while others will not bark much at all. <b>Dachshunds</b> {{are known for their}} devotion and loyalty to their owners, though they can be standoffish towards strangers. If left alone, many <b>dachshunds</b> will whine until they have companionship. Like many dogs if left alone too frequently, some <b>dachshunds</b> are prone to separation anxiety and may chew objects in the house to relieve stress.|$|R

However, during filming, one of the <b>Dachshunds</b> playing the rats died on set, {{possibly}} due to suffocation from being trapped in the rat suit. Although the dogs were generally treated well during production, this was an unfortunate exception.|$|R
5000|$|A new {{minimally}} invasive procedure called [...] "percutaneous laser disk ablation" [...] has been developed at the Oklahoma State University Veterinary Hospital. Originally, the procedure was used in clinical trials only on <b>dachshunds</b> that had suffered previous back incidents.

25|$|On Sunday, September 5, 1982, in {{the suburb}} of West Des Moines, Johnny Gosch left home before dawn {{to begin his}} paper route. Though it was {{customary}} for Johnny to awaken his father {{to help with the}} route, the boy took only the family's <b>dachshund,</b> Gretchen, with him that morning. Other paper carriers for The Des Moines Register would later report having seen Gosch at the paper drop, picking up his newspapers. It was the last sighting of Gosch that can be corroborated by multiple witnesses.|$|E
25|$|Dachs is German for badger, a {{term used}} for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by {{crossbreeding}} long-legged Bracken with the <b>Dachshund.</b> Historically, the term Bracke {{was used in}} German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.|$|E
500|$|Some interbreeding {{with other}} breeds {{took place in}} the mid-1800s, which may have {{introduced}} <b>Dachshund</b> blood into the breed, although certain breeders maintained pure-bred lines. The <b>Dachshund</b> theory was first introduced by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym of [...] "Stonehenge" [...] in the 1880s, and was denied by many breeders of that era. By the mid-1800s, the breed was known as the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, and became sought after for hunting after Scott's writings were published. They remain the only dog breed to have been named after a fictional character. Around this time the breed had some involvement {{in the development of the}} Bedlington Terrier.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to back problems, the breed is also prone to patellar luxation {{which is where}} the kneecap can become dislodged. <b>Dachshunds</b> may also be affected by Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease). The condition seems to be mainly limited to wire-haired <b>Dachshunds,</b> with 17% being carriers. A genetic test is available to allow breeders to avoid breeding carriers to carriers. In such pairings, each puppy will have a 25% chance of being affected.|$|R
