50|$|A sabretache (derifed from Säbeltasche) is a <b>flat</b> <b>bag</b> or pouch, {{which was}} worn {{suspended}} from the belt of a cavalry officer together with the sabre.|$|E
5000|$|Duvet: A soft <b>flat</b> <b>bag</b> {{traditionally}} {{filled with}} down or feathers, {{or a combination}} of both, and used like a blanket. Usually not as thin as a comforter, but may be referred to as a [...] "down comforter".|$|E
5000|$|The {{etymology}} {{is unclear}} - see [...] Some {{suggest that it}} is named after the mountain peak Le Gibas in the Luberon mountains. Alternatively, the old form [...] is also a <b>flat</b> <b>bag,</b> used to carry game (from the French word for game, , from Latin); these words may be homophones, or the origin, the pastry having a similar shape to the bag.|$|E
50|$|A {{cigarette}} {{made with}} shag tobacco {{may be called}} a rollie, a roll-up/dole-up or hand-rolled. The <b>flat</b> <b>bags</b> in which shag is typically packaged for commercial sale are often called tobacco pouches. Oppositely, pre-processed and packaged cigarettes may be referred to colloquially as tailor-mades or straights.|$|R

60|$|The {{horses were}} unsaddled and picketed, Dave and Joe taking care {{themselves}} to unload the three packed ponies, {{and that the}} <b>flat</b> <b>bags,</b> over which blankets had been stuffed, should not be noticed. They stopped there for two days to rest the horses, and then proceeded on their way, arriving at Pueblo a fortnight later. Thence they traveled together to Santa Fe, and then hired a wagon and joined a large caravan going across the plains east. When they reached St. Louis they separated. A division {{was made of the}} gold, and the lads started by train for New York, and the next day took their passages for England.|$|R
5000|$|A duvet ( [...] , , or {{from the}} French duvet [...] "down") {{is a type of}} bedding {{consisting}} of a soft <b>flat</b> <b>bag</b> filled with down, feathers, wool, silk or a synthetic alternative, and typically protected with a removable cover, analogous to a pillow and pillow case. Sleepers often use a duvet without a top bed sheet, as the duvet cover can readily be removed and laundered as often as the bottom sheet. Duvets originated in rural Europe and were filled with the down feathers of ducks. The best quality is taken from the eider duck, often while still alive, for its down is known for its effectiveness as a thermal insulator.|$|E
50|$|The sabretache {{is derived}} from a {{traditional}} Hungarian horseman's <b>flat</b> leather <b>bag</b> called a tarsoly. Early examples have been found the tombs of Magyar warriors from the 10th century Conquest of Pannonia. They were often strengthened and decorated with silver plates and would have contained fire-making tools and other essentials.|$|R
40|$|A lot of {{packages}} for food or pet food was tested for insect-resistant quality. After locating most of shortcomings {{at the bottom}} of bags, it could be removed by stepwise optimizing, especially by a better bonding. Leakiness with <b>flat</b> <b>bags</b> (tabular film bags) was caused by defective cross- and side seams. Developing insect-proof folding-cartons {{turned out to be more}} complicated, especially the standard-folding-carton. When tested at the start of project totally all samples were untight at 100 %. Exceptionally, folding-cartons bounded with cold adhesive respectively closed on the top and bottom sides with a cap-seal of "Expresso"-type were insect-resistant at more than 50 %. The participants of this project were confronted with problems about leaky packages and they became aware of the importance of insect-pro{{of packages}} for the exporting food industry. Packaging producers now intend to develop systematically sufficiently insect-proof packaging systems, especially the folding carton and the bag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Traditional {{text mining}} {{techniques}} transform free text into <b>flat</b> <b>bags</b> of words representation, {{which does not}} preserve sufficient semantics {{for the purpose of}} knowledge discovery. In this paper, we present a two-step procedure to mine generalized associations of semantic relations conveyed by the textual content of Web documents. First, RDF (Resource Description Framework) metadata representing semantic relations are extracted from raw text using a myriad of natural language processing techniques. The relation extraction process also creates a term taxonomy {{in the form of a}} sense hierarchy inferred from WordNet. Then, a novel generalized association pattern mining algorithm (GP-Close) is applied to discover the underlying relation association patterns on RDF metadata. For pruning the large number of redundant overgeneralized patterns in relation pattern search space, the GP-Close algorithm adopts the notion of generalization closure for systematic overgeneralization reduction. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through empirical experiments conducted on an online database of terrorist activities. Index Terms—RDF mining, association rule mining, relation association, text mining. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{suitcase}} {{is a form}} of luggage. It {{is often}} a somewhat <b>flat,</b> rectangular-shaped <b>bag</b> with rounded square corners, either metal, hard plastic or made of cloth, vinyl or leather that more or less retains its shape. It has a carrying handle on one side and is used mainly for transporting clothes and other possessions during trips. It opens on hinges like a door. Suitcases lock with keys or a combination.|$|R
40|$|As the {{measuring}} equipments {{used for the}} abrasion testing of lacquers and plastics are generally not suitable for hotmelt coatings {{it had to be}} examined in how far the hotmelt coatings can be differentiated by a simple laboratory vibration test. Thereby hand-made <b>flat</b> <b>bags</b> (100 x 100 mm) with sealed seams, filled with glassy Raschig rings (20 g), were used. The bags were shaken in an eccentrically operated laboratory machine during a fixed period (0, 5 to 2 hrs.). After the transfer of the bag content into extraction shells the abrasion rate was determined and the data regarding time and surface were recorded. The investigations which had been conducted with different hotmelt coatings reflected correctly and sufficiently reproducible the rank of the abrasion resistance noticed in practical operation. The effort to show a relation between the abrasion characteristics and the properties of the coatings resulted {{in the fact that the}} toughness of the coating obviously is an importantcriterion which by itself, however, is not sufficient to predict the abrasion resistance of the coating...|$|R
5000|$|Gussets {{are also}} used when making three-piece bags, for example in a pattern [...] a bag as a long, wide piece which connects the front piece and back piece. By {{becoming}} the sides {{and bottom of the}} bag, the gusset opens the bag up beyond what simply attaching the front to the back would do. With reference to the dimension of the gusset, the measurements of a <b>flat</b> bottom <b>bag</b> may be quoted as LxWxG.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the following changes accompany differentiation in the plastid of the liverwort Anthoceros eckloni. The inner membrane of the plastid folds to give rise to small vesicles which grow and may fuse to form thylakoids, i. e. <b>flat</b> <b>bags.</b> The thylakoids may "pair" to produce the doublets (thick membranes) of the grana. The doublets may be produced also by the invagination of a thylakoid. In both cases, the doublets are produced only where outside-to-outside contact of thylakoid membranes occurs, which supports the thesis that the thylakoid membranes are polarized. The thylakoids also fold outwards, anastomose, and may fuse. This results in a complicated membrane system, for which an interpretation becomes very difficult. The starch is produced in the matrix, and the pyrenoid bodies are interpreted as specialized regions of the matrix. Younger plastids have grana, but the mature plastid has so many doublets that distinct grana cannot be recognized. This interpretation of the changes which occur during the differentiation of the plastid differs radically from those of Menke (1961) and Manton (1962) who studied this same genus, but is compatible with findings in algae and angiosperms...|$|R
50|$|In geometry, {{the paper}} bag problem or teabag problem is to {{calculate}} the maximum possible inflated volume of an initially <b>flat</b> sealed rectangular <b>bag</b> which has the same shape as a cushion or pillow, made out of two pieces of material which can bend but not stretch.|$|R
50|$|A 'hold-all' is {{also used}} to carry bedding and {{blankets}} etc. Students, enrolled in boarding schools in India, are issued a 'hold-all' to carry their blankets, quilts and clothes. It is a <b>flat,</b> rectangular, canvas <b>bag,</b> when unravelled. Once filled, it is rolled like a sleeping bag and held together with straps.|$|R
50|$|A punched pocket (UK English), punch pocket (UK English), plastic wallet (UK English), polypocket (UK English slang), {{slippery}} fish (UK English slang), sheet protector (US English), {{or sometimes}} perforated document <b>bag</b> is a <b>flat,</b> slitted plastic <b>bag</b> with a perforated edge {{used to hold}} paper documents, originally created in 1986 by Mike Townsend.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basis of}} the product line is blended {{high-quality}} tea and herbal teas of which, in January 2013, there are 79 varieties including black, green, white, herbals, and oolong. Available as individual servings, the tea is sold in elongated pyramidal [...] "silken" [...] tea bags, or infusers, made and packaged in China. The tall, square pyramid design of the infuser is trademarked, following the tradition of a tetrahedral Japanese design which permits loose tea to swell as it steeps. These three-dimensional designs allow higher-quality [...] "whole leaf" [...] teas to be used than previously possible with traditional <b>flat</b> tea <b>bags.</b>|$|R
5|$|The sky-cycle airship {{continued}} {{to climb to}} about two thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the airship down {{to the size of}} a <b>flat</b> carpet <b>bag.</b> He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle airship to the railroad station so he could get back to his place of origin.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast, still musing on the circumstances, he went upstairs, {{turned over}} his bed, and drew out a <b>flat</b> canvas <b>bag</b> which lay between the {{mattress}} and the sacking. In this he kept his leases, which had remained there unopened ever since his father's death. It was the usual hiding-place among rural lifeholders for such documents. Winterborne {{sat down on the}} bed and looked them over. They were ordinary leases for three lives, which a member of the South family, some fifty years before this time, had accepted of the lord of the manor in lieu of certain copyholds and other rights, in consideration of having the dilapidated houses rebuilt by said lord. They had come into his father's possession chiefly through his mother, who was a South.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Italian {{stone cutting}} equipment, {{originally}} {{designed for use}} in Tuscany's marble quarries was imported by Albion Stone and applied to the extraction of Portland stone. This new technology eliminated the need for blasting, significantly improved the quarries' environmental performance and removed the potential for any possible damage to the stone being quarried through shock. Full account of the local jointing pattern is made when deciding the position and orientation of cuts. Once the quarry faces have been cut, the stone is gently displaced hydraulically. This is done using [...] "hydro-bags", which are thin, <b>flat,</b> steel <b>bags</b> or envelopes that when inflated with water under moderate pressure, are capable of producing the forces necessary to loosen the stone {{to the point where}} it can be easily removed using large wheeled loaders. Splitting stone, using pneumatic drills is arduous work and so wire-saws have been introduced into the quarries, replacing much of the plug and feather cutting.|$|R
50|$|A growbag {{is a large}} {{plastic bag}} filled with a growing medium and used for growing plants, usually {{tomatoes}} or other salad crops. The growing medium is usually based on a soilless organic material such as peat, coir, composted green waste, composted bark or composted wood chips, or a mixture of these. Various nutrients are added, sufficient for one season's growing, so frequently only planting and watering are required of the end-user. Planting is undertaken by first laying the <b>bag</b> <b>flat</b> on the floor or bench of the growing area, then cutting access holes in the uppermost surface, into which the plants are inserted.|$|R
5000|$|PG Tags, {{tea bags}} with a string, were {{launched}} in 1985, and tetrahedron-shaped tea bags in 1996 (branded as Pyramid Bags). The tetrahedral bag {{was designed to}} help the tea leaves move more freely, as loose tea moves in a teapot, and supposedly create a better infusion. One 2011 version of the product packaging makes the claim: [...] "The PG Tips pyramid tea bag gives the tea leaves 50% more room to move around than a <b>flat</b> conventional tea <b>bag.</b> So the tea bag works more like a miniature tea pot. This allows for all the freshness to be released for the best tasting cup of PG." [...] During the T-Birds era, the tetrahedral tea bags were remade with a [...] "freeflow" [...] material, to allow further infusion of the tea.|$|R
50|$|Justin {{is invited}} to a meal with the Ashworths, however he feels guilty when he punches Rhys. Ash decides to make the Ashworths think Hannah is having a relapse of her {{anorexia}} by hiding food in her room. The Ashworths then think Justin is to blame. Justin and Hannah decide to leave Hollyoaks. He is approached by Warren, who tells him he will give him money if he gives him an alibi as they burn down The Loft. Hannah discovers Justin is doing a deal with Warren. He tells her it is one deal and they can leave. Justin heads to The Loft. On his way, he meets Calvin, who warns him to stay away. Calvin does not tell him that Clare is back and has tied Warren up and poured petrol around The Loft. Justin changes his mind and heads back to his flat, on {{the way he is}} seen by Sasha Valentine. Hannah waits at Justin and Ste's <b>flat</b> with her <b>bags.</b> Hannah realises Justin is at The Loft and leaves to find him..|$|R
30|$|Historically, {{the fashion}} handbag has partly been {{determined}} by its function, with some features remaining constant, {{such as a}} place for money, cosmetics, keys, handkerchief, diary, note pad, pencil, and even printed literature such as a novel or commercial pocket book. Riding in {{a car in the}} early 20 th century, a passenger could be wrapped in a blanket wearing a cap or veil, and sheltered under thick goggles; often, the fashionable passenger held a <b>flat</b> Morocco leather <b>bag</b> in her arms. Its simple form, in varying sizes, stored readily available items: gloves, stole, vials. This was the prelude to the handbag and fashion bag, which flourished in the 20 th and 21 st centuries (Louis Vuitton 2017). After World War I, women needed handbags for utility purposes because they increasingly occupied jobs outside the home. In the 20 th century, the fashion bag took on both utility and fashion; utilitarian and fashionable bags became known worldwide. In the 1930 s, the clutch bag was very popular and during and after World War II, a shoulder bag was functional, first as part of the military, and later gaining widespread popularity. In the 1970 s, a trend of the hippy style was to incorporate various fabric patches and twisted thread bags; in the 1980 s, sports bags were popular; and by the 1990 s, the fashion handbag was being designed to consider both ergonomics and function (Jeon 2005).|$|R
