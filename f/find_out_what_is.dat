25|$|Sometimes {{it is of}} {{interest}} to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> the immediate effect of a perturbation or knockout, since it takes time for regulatory changes to occur and for the organism to re-organize fluxes to optimally utilize a different carbon source or circumvent {{the effect of the}} knockout. MOMA predicts the immediate sub-optimal flux distribution following the perturbation by minimizing the distance (Euclidean) between the wild-type FBA flux distribution and the mutant flux distribution using quadratic programming.

Rumors and legends abound, though, of some Days or another betraying his vows of noninterference and sharing knowledge with his lord.
