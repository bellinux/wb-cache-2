5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>obtained,</b> though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the process}} that was {{to lead to the}} 1996 Doctor Who film, Universal Television had Amblin Entertainment produce a writers' bible which {{detailed}} John Leekley's proposed pilot and episodes of a new series. The new series would have established a new continuity rather than following on from the classic series, and the bible reused many elements from the classic series. It is unclear whether clearance could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>obtained</b> for all the episodes detailed, as the costs would likely have fallen to the BBC.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>obtained</b> by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E
