5|$|Having {{performed}} in parlor theatricals as a child, from 1916 Simonovich-Efimova began staging puppet shows for fellow artists. The plays were so well received {{that she and}} her husband were invited to create a children's puppet theater by the Russian authorities in 1918, becoming two of the first professional puppeteers in Russia. She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft. They performed over 1,500 shows throughout Russia between 1920 and 1940, moving from place to place with their traveling puppet theater.|$|E
5|$|A {{major element}} of the plot {{is based on the}} wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), {{released}} in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used it at the end of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the fight with the Landlady and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, she and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down {{a picture of the}} family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{also argues}} that {{contradictory}} beliefs {{show that there is}} a connection between beliefs and knowledge. He gives the example of a woman who has learned <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> dead but cannot bring herself to believe <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> dead. She both believes and disbelieves <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|R

25|$|Onassis and {{her husband}} had a home base in São Paulo, but they {{traveled}} throughout the year with the Global Champions Tour, of which Onassis was official patroness. The Rio de Janeiro leg of the tour is, in fact, named the Athina Onassis International Horse Show; established in 2007, it was initially set in São Paulo, but as of 2009, its venue is a newly renovated center in Rio de Janeiro.

25|$|Later in 1915, Lane's mother visited San Francisco {{for several}} months. Together they {{attended}} the Panama-Pacific International Exposition; {{details of this}} visit and Wilder's daily life in 1915 are preserved in Wilder's letters to her husband in West from Home, published in 1974. Although Lane's diaries indicate she was separated from her husband in 1915, her mother's letters do not indicate this. Lane and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> recorded as living together with him unemployed and looking for work during her mother's two-month visit. It seems the separation was either covered up, or had not yet involved separate households.|$|E
25|$|Prisca and {{her husband}} Aquila. She and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> {{mentioned}} six times in the Bible, as missionary partners with the Apostle Paul. They were also partners in the craft of tentmaking. The author of Acts states that they were refugees who came first to Corinth when the Emperor Claudius expelled all Jews from Rome. Paul mentions {{that at some point}} they had risked their necks for him. When Paul refers to Priscilla and Aquila, Priscilla is listed first two out of three times. Some scholars have suggested that she {{was the head of the}} family unit.|$|E
25|$|Womack and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> {{best friends}} with Scott Maslen {{and his wife}} Estelle Rubio. They {{have known each other}} since they were teenagers. Maslen is godfather to Womack's two {{children}} and she is godmother to Maslen's son, Zak. They often go on holiday together with their children, which Womack revealed during an appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in January 2008. In late 2007 Maslen joined the cast of EastEnders as Jack Branning, who has a relationship with Womack's character, Ronnie. This was something that both Maslen and Womack were initially uncomfortable with when they read the scripts, with Maslen commenting in various interviews that having to kiss Womack was like having to kiss his sister.|$|E

25|$|Mrs Patmore's {{decision}} to invest her inheritance {{in real estate}} inspires Carson, Downton's butler, to do likewise. He suggests that head housekeeper Mrs Hughes invest with him; she confesses she has no money due to supporting a mentally incapacitated sister. The Crawleys' cousin, Lady Rose, daughter of Lord and Lady Flintshire, becomes engaged to Atticus Aldridge, son of Lord and Lady Sinderby. Lord Sinderby strongly objects to Atticus' marrying outside the Jewish faith. Lord Merton proposes to Isobel Crawley (Matthew's mother). She accepts, but later ends the engagement due to Lord Merton's sons' disparaging comments over her commoner background. Lady Flintshire employs underhanded schemes to derail Rose and Atticus's engagement, including announcing to everyone at the wedding that she and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> divorcing, intending to cause a scandal to stop Rose's marriage to Atticus; they are married anyway.|$|E
25|$|When the Second World War {{broke out}} Sark was {{occupied}} by the German military and Beaumont joined the Royal Air Force, reaching the rank of flight lieutenant. In May 1941 Flt Lt Beaumont received a week's leave and he, Lawson, friends and family travelled to Liverpool, where according to Hathaway they stayed at a hotel at 126 Smithdown Road in the Sefton Park district. This, however, is unlikely as 126 Smithdown Road was the address for Smithdown Road Infirmary (later Sefton General Hospital) and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission information suggests they were staying at 74 Bedford Street in Toxteth. On 1 May the German Luftwaffe began a bombing campaign on Liverpool that would last more than a week. On 4 May as the warning sirens went off, family and friends at the home, including Lawson's sister Dorothy, took safety in a shelter, while Lawson and Beaumont stayed in their room. The home was destroyed, killing the couple, while all those who sought safety in the shelter survived. Lawson's death was announced in newspapers around the globe, but was overshadowed by the greater destruction of the war. Both Lawson and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> buried in Kirkdale Cemetery, Liverpool.|$|E

500|$|The first {{inscription}} mentioning Zenobia as queen is dated two {{or three}} years after Odaenathus' death, so exactly when Zenobia assumed the title [...] "queen of Palmyra" [...] is uncertain. However, she was probably designated as queen when her husband became king. As queen consort, Zenobia remained in the background and was not mentioned in the historical record. According to later accounts, including one by Giovanni Boccaccio, she accompanied her husband on his campaigns. If the accounts of her accompanying <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> true, according to Southern, Zenobia would have boosted the morale of the soldiers and gained political influence, which she needed in her later career.|$|E

According to Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte, the historian of Dunster Castle, [...] "the union proved exceptionally happy and her letters to <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> ... <b>are</b> conceived {{in the spirit of}} the sincerest affection." [...] Following his marriage and inheritance not only was he required under the bequest to add to his surname but was also compelled to spend six months of each year at Dunster Castle.

500|$|Queen Mary I's plan {{to marry}} Philip II of Spain {{was greeted with}} {{widespread}} opposition, not just among the populace but also among Members of Parliament and privy councillors.

Nevertheless, [...] the government, {{at the height of the}} military crisis around 7February, decided to execute Jane and her husband, possibly out of panic. It was also an opportunity for removing possible inspirations for future unrest and unwelcome reminders of the past. It troubled Mary to let her cousin die, but she accepted the Privy Council's advice. Bishop Gardiner pressed for the young couple's execution in a court sermon, and the Imperial ambassador Simon Renard was happy to report that [...] "Jane of Suffolk and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>are</b> to lose their heads." ...|$|E

However, Wright's tales for Scribner's Magazine, beginning with [...] "As Haggards of the Rock" [...] (May 1890), attracted more notice, and the initial six of them, including also [...] "A Truce," [...] "A Portion of the Tempest," [...] "From Macedonia," [...] "Deep as First Love," [...] and [...] "A Fragment of a Play, With a Chorus," [...] were collected in her first book, A Truce, and Other Stories (1895).
