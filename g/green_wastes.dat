40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>waste</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} of California’s solid waste stream and so is an important target for effective waste diversion. The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) reports that about 15 million cubic yards of organics comprised largely of <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> are diverted annually in California. The diverted organics are principally used as compost and mulch in agricultural and urban green areas. In California, {{one of the most popular}} alternative waste diversion options is the use of <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> as landfill alternative daily cover (ADC). <b>Green</b> <b>waste</b> ADC reduces the need for importing clean daily cover soil and so helps conserve limited landfill volume. However when landfilled, <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> can generate methane, an important greenhouse gas (GHG), and so may be regarded as environmentally inferior to <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> composting. This study uses GHG emissions estimated from life-cycle inventory methodology to compare <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> ADC and composting alternatives. A United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) based life-cycle inventory methodology was developed that considers differences in transport, material handling, <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> emissions, capture and management, energy impacts, and carbon sequestration. The ADC analysis addresses the range of conditions at landfills particular to California landfills including the extent of gas recovery, the gas collection efficiency and methane energy recovery. This study supports the reported benefits of composting but also shows that <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> ADC can actually be more beneficial in reducing GHG emissions when compared to the composting of <b>green</b> <b>waste.</b> This result indicates the importance of site-specific environmental analysis when considering organics management options.

The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report for Africa describes a trend of warming at a rate faster than the global average and increasing aridity: in many parts of Africa, it seems that warmer climates and changes in precipitation will destabilise agricultural production and aggravates food security. The present work concerns the vegetables cultivation in the Parakou region in Benin, where agriculture employs approximately 70 % of the active population and contributes to 36 % of the Gross Domestic Product and 88 % of export earnings. However, the agricultural sector has been regarded as unproductive with low adaptation capacities because of structural factors (e. g. high level of poverty among rural populations, weak mechanization and intensification of production modes), but also because of natural constraints (e. g. poor management of water and soils, leading to soil degradation). Considering the aridity, the low carbon content and the reduced level of nutrients available in the soil, the use of an hydroponic module has been hypothesised. In this way sufficient yields of the crops may be assured and no agricultural machines will be needed for the tillage operations. In addition, the nutrients can be added to the growing solution using residual materials as poultry manure, ashes and <b>green</b> <b>wastes.</b> In order to verify if some construction or maintenance problems can occur and if a growing solution can be easily obtained using agricultural wastes, some tests have been carried out. Moreover laboratory analyses have been done for different solutions that may be adopted with different shares of water, poultry manure, ashes and <b>green</b> <b>wastes.</b> The tests have indicated that the hydroponic module could be used in Benin without incurring in technical problems and that a growing solution containing poultry manure, ashes and <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> can supply to the crops a significant amount of nutrients...|$|E

In the presence of worms, CO 2 emissions during composting increased for all treatments except for the low clay dose. The effect of the amendments on carbon mineralization after addition to soil was small in the short term. Overall, composts increased OM mineralization, whereas vermicomposts had no effect. The presence of biochar reduced OM mineralization in soil with respect to compost and vermicompost without additives, whereas clay reduced mineralization only in the composts. Our study indicates a significant role of the conditions of composting on mineralization in soil. Therefore, the production of a low CO 2 emission amendment requires optimization of feedstocks, co-composting agents and worm species...|$|E

For the Nursery Production Industry sustainability and environmental accountability are also significant issues. Determining alternatives to pine bark and peat as potting media components is one aspect to be addressed by the Industry. In this thesis the properties and performance of composted Eucalyptus <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> as a component of potting media has been investigated. The investigation examined different systems for composting Eucalyptus camaldulensis <b>green</b> <b>waste.</b> All composting systems used showed an elimination of toxic compounds found in composting feedstock. However, composted E. camaldulensis <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> could not be used as a major component of potting media without significant amendments, as both Electrical Conductivity (EC) and pH were extremely high. The high EC could be overcome by leaching out soluble salt and the high pH by adding iron sulphate. Construction of a potting media using composted E. camaldulensis <b>green</b> <b>waste</b> was then undertaken. The compost was mixed with various fractions of rice hulls, coir and fine sand to provide a medium with physical characteristics within the guidelines set down by the Australian Standard for Potting Mixes (AS 3743 - 1996). The growth of six common ornamental crop species in the constructed media was then compared to that obtained in a traditional pine-bark based medium.

Though {{it is not}} a new technology, studies on its integrated process simulation and analysis are limited, in particular for municipal solid waste (MSW) gasification. This paper develops an integrated fixed bed gasifier model of biomass gasification using the Advanced System for Process ENngineering (Aspen) Plus software for its performance analysis. A computational model was developed on the basis of Gibbs free energy minimization. The model is validated with experimental data of MSW and food waste gasification available in the literature. A reasonable agreement between measured and predicted syngas composition was found. Using the validated model, the effects of operating conditions, namely air-fuel ratio and gasifier temperature, on syngas production are studied. Performance analyses have been done for four different feedstocks, namely wood, coffee bean husks, <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> and MSWs. The ultimate and proximate analysis data for each feedstock was used for model development. It was found that operating parameters have a significant influence on syngas composition. An air-fuel ratio of 0. 3 and gasifier temperature of 700 °C provides optimum performance for a fixed bed gasifier for MSWs, wood wastes, <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> and coffee bean husks. The developed model can be useful for gasification of other biomasses (e. g., food wastes, rice husks, poultry wastes and sugarcane bagasse) to predict the syngas composition. Therefore, the study provides an integrated gasification model which can be used for different biomass feedstocks...|$|E

The thesis study focuses on three different types of Small Scale Industries (SSI) in India that are bumper manufacturing industry, dyeing industry and food processing industry. The product life cycles of the process for each industry are identified and their final green waste disposal methods are investigated. The industries are identified with more lean wastes within their product life cycle process. The major <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> from their disposal methods have high influence on environment. These wastes have to be reduced or eliminated by practicing a suitable supply chain. In present the companies doesn’t practice any supply chain in their organization. The implement of supply chain could reduce the environmental pressures and wastes of the companies to some extent. The lean wastes identified in the process could be eliminated by practicing suitable lean tools and methods.

The small scale industries experiences both wastes, so it has to integrate lean for practicing green supply chain, the implementation of lean would pay a way for green supply chain management. As a result of it a comprehensive lean and green model is suggested for the industries because the model is composed of both lean and green waste reduction techniques and it also helps in achieving both lean and green business results. ...|$|E

40|$|Lean {{management}} was first implemented by Toyota in {{the automobile industry}} and has {{attracted the attention of}} many companies worldwide from various industries and sectors due to cost pressures and resource scarcity issues. Moreover, contemporary human activities have caused concern regarding its negative effects on the environment. Therefore, global agreements such as the Kyoto protocol were initiated to force companies to adopt green production and eliminate <b>green</b> <b>wastes.</b> The adoption of lean to cut wastes for cost reasons and then to separately adopt green, to cut wastes for legal and environmental reasons was questioned by researchers who believe that lean and green should be adopted simultaneously to maximise the benefits. Although, lean and green are targeting similar types of wastes, there are several contradictions related mainly to the Just In Time (JIT) tool which could decrease lean wastes but increase <b>green</b> <b>wastes.</b> The developed frameworks focus on maximising similarities and minimizing conflicts. The dairy industry faces a lot of challenges due to its intensive use of natural resources and fierce competition. The purpose of this research is to design a green and lean model for the dairy supply chain. A model implemented in the automobile industry at the production cell developed by Pampnelli et al. (2014) was chosen because of its comprehensiveness and it was well tested. The model was adapted to the dairy industry and expanded to include the whole supply chain to make sure that lean and <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> are removed for ever rather than moved {{to other parts of the}} supply chain. There are several prerequisites that have to be satisfied to ensure successful and fast roll out of the model. These are related, mainly, to the existence of a mature lean management approach within the supply chain. Case studies of two companies from the food and dairy industry (Arla foods and Nestlé) which have implemented lean and green were used to inform the process of designing the model. The model has five stages which are, specifying its boundaries (the whole supply chain), identifying the system inputs and outputs, measuring the environmental aspects of the current value stream map (VSM), developing an improved VSM and finally, continuous improvement. The applicability of the model was tested at a dairy company in a developing country (Libya) called Al Naseem for Food Industries. The discussions with the company managers showed that the company does not have a lean management system which, is a condition for implementing this model. Although, the company production facilities can be easily adapted to the lean approach, there are external reasons related to the country’s lack of manufacturing base, its political instability and lack of cooperation with suppliers and customers that prevent it from implementing it across the supply chain. Therefore, Al Naseem may have to change the scope of its supply chain and seek help from international organisations to be able to implement the model...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{preserve}} natural soil {{resources and}} in order to create fertile constructed Technosols for plant cultivation, wastes and by-product mixtures were studied in relation to their pedogenic properties and especially soil organic matter contents. We assessed interactions between aggregation and nutrient availability, focusing on phosphorus (P) transfer in the soil-water-plant system. Materials and methods Four typical urban wastes, dried and sieved to pass 2 mm, were mixed selectively to mimic a fertile topsoil material: excavated subsoil AE, compost from sludge and <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> CO, <b>green</b> <b>wastes</b> GW, and bricks BR. After characterization of the wastes for physico-chemical and toxicological parameters, we focused on four mixtures: AE/CO, AE/GW, BR/CO, and BR/GW. The mixtures were tested in a 55 -day long pot experiment under controlled conditions in aclimate chamber. Pots were bare and planted with Lolium perenne (ryegrass) and Brassica napus (rape). The two plant species were selected for contrasting root activities and architectures and phosphorus (P) acquisition strategies. The aggregate formation was tested using the mean weight diameter method {{at the end of the}} experiment. Results and discussion We have measured intense aggregation in mixture AE/GW, low aggregation in AE/CO, and no aggregation in BR/CO and BR/GW. After 55 days, neither Technosol aggregation nor aggregate stability was significantly affected by plant development. Available phosphorus (POlsen) content was sufficient for plant development in all the mixtures (from 0. 28 to 0. 58 g kg− 1). The POlsen/Ptotal ratio was higher in mixtures with GW, even if the mixtures with compost (AE/CO and BR/CO) induced the highest biomass production for ryegrass and rape. Conclusions The nutrient availability in constructed Technosols and the transfer of P to plant were highly dependent on organic matter type, with high or low delivery of POlsen linked to the mineralization potential and the size and distribution of aggregates. Therefore, pedological engineering processes can be improved by the selection of adapted constitutive wastes and byproducts to create a fertile substrate allowing high biomass production...|$|E
