60|$|Again, such muscular {{development}} as {{is necessary to}} the perfect beauty of the body, is to be rendered. But that which is necessary to strength, or which {{appears to have been}} the result of laborious exercise, is inadmissible. No herculean form is spiritual, for it is degrading the spiritual creature to suppose <b>it</b> <b>operative</b> through impulse of bone and sinew; its power is immaterial and constant, neither dependent on, nor developed by exertion. Generally, it is well to conceal anatomical development as far as may be; even Michael Angelo's anatomy interferes with his divinity; in the hands of lower men the angel becomes a preparation. How far it is possible to subdue or generalize the naked form I venture not to affirm, but I believe that it is best to conceal it as far as may be, not with draperies light and undulating, that fall in with, and exhibit its principal lines, but with draperies severe and linear, such as were constantly employed before the time of Raffaelle. I recollect no single instance of a naked angel that does not look boylike or child-like, and unspiritualized; even Fra Bartolomeo's might with advantage be spared from the pictures at Lucca, and, in the hands of inferior men, the sky is merely encumbered with sprawling infants; those of Domenichino in the Madonna del Rosario, and Martyrdom of St. Agnes, are peculiarly offensive, studies of bare-legged children howling and kicking in volumes of smoke. Confusion seems to exist in the minds of subsequent painters between Angels and Cupids.|$|E

60|$|Congress is {{sometimes}} complained of for wasting time in discussion, and for not having, after a four months' session, arrived at any definite plan of settlement. There has been, perhaps, a little eagerness {{on the part}} of honorable members to associate their names with the particular nostrum that is to build up our national system again. In a country where, unhappily, any man may be President, it is natural that a means of advertising so efficacious as this should not be neglected. But really, we do not see how Congress can be blamed for not being ready with a plan definite and precise upon every point of possible application, when it is not yet in possession of the facts according to whose varying complexion the plan must be good or bad. The question with us is much more whether another branch of the government,--to which, from its position and its opportunity for a wider view, the country naturally looks for initiative suggestion, and in which a few months ago even decisive action would have been pardoned,--whether this did not let the lucky moment go by without using it. That moment was immediately after Mr. Lincoln's murder, when the victorious nation was ready to apply, and the conquered faction would have submitted without a murmur to that bold and comprehensive policy which is the only wise as it is the only safe one for great occasions. To let that moment slip was to descend irrecoverably from the vantage ground where statesmanship is an exact science to the experimental level of tentative politics. We cannot often venture to set our own house on fire with civil war, in order to heat our iron up to that point of easy forging at which it glowed, longing for the hammer of the master-smith, less than a year ago. That Occasion is swift we learned long ago from the adage; but this volatility is meant only of moments where force of personal character is decisive, where the fame or fortune of a single man is at stake. The life of nations can afford to take less strict account of time, and in their affairs there may always be a hope that the slow old tortoise, Prudence, may overtake again the opportunity that seemed flown by so irrecoverably. Our people have shown so much of this hard-shelled virtue during the last five years, that we look with more confidence than apprehension to the result of our present difficulties. Never was the common-sense of a nation more often and directly appealed to, never was it readier in coming to its conclusion and making <b>it</b> <b>operative</b> in public affairs, than during the war whose wounds we are now endeavoring to stanch. It is the duty of patriotic men to keep this great popular faculty always in view, to satisfy its natural demand for clearness and practicality in the measures proposed, and not to distract it and render it nugatory by the insubstantial metaphysics of abstract policy. From the splitting of heads to the splitting of hairs {{would seem to be a}} long journey, and yet some are already well on their way to the end of it, who should be the leaders of public opinion and not the skirmishing harassers of its march. It would be well if some of our public men would consider that Providence has saved their modesty the trial of an experiment in cosmogony, and that their task is the difficult, no doubt, but much simpler and less ambitious one, of bringing back the confused material which lies ready to their hand, always with a divinely implanted instinct of order in it, to as near an agreement with the providential intention as their best wisdom can discern. The aggregate opinion of a nation moves slowly. Like those old migrations of entire tribes, it is encumbered with much household stuff; a thousand unforeseen things may divert or impede it; a hostile check or the temptation of present convenience may lead it to settle far short of its original aim; the want of some guiding intellect and central will may disperse it; but experience shows one constant element of its progress, which those who aspire to be its leaders should keep in mind, namely, that the place of a wise general should be oftener in the rear or the centre than the extreme front. The secret of permanent leadership is to know how to be moderate. The rashness of conception that makes opportunity, the gallantry that heads the advance, may win admiration, may possibly achieve a desultory and indecisive exploit; but it is the slow steadiness of temper, bent always on the main design and the general movement, that gains by degrees a confidence as unshakable as its own, the only basis for permanent power over the minds of men. It was the surest proof of Mr. Lincoln's sagacity and the deliberate reach of his understanding, that he never thought time wasted while he waited for the wagon that brought his supplies. The very immovability of his purpose, fixed always on what was attainable, laid him open to the shallow criticism of having none,--for a shooting star draws more eyes, and seems for the moment to have a more definite aim, than a planet,--but it gained him at last such a following as made him irresistible. It lays a much lighter tax on the intellect, and proves its resources less, to suggest a number of plans, than to devise and carry through a single one.|$|E

Using closereadings of the comics against the {{backdrop}} of Jacques Derrida’s and Martin Heidegger’stheories on the boundary between man and animal, I explore the following ideas which seemcommon in the discourses on that which separates humans from animals: intelligence vs. instinct,the human hand vs. the animal’s paw, humanity’s richness-in-world vs. animal’s poorness-inworld,and language. In Animal Man, Morrison gives voice to animal characters by giving them personalities,which seems a romanticizing of the real state of affairs. Alongside all the depicted animals, thereare many hybrid characters, which take on the characteristics of both humans and animals. Theuse of hybrid characters such as the Coyote and Animal Man problematize the boundary betweenman and animal. This study of Animal Man, most importantly, shows that the differences as wellas similarities between humans and animals are based on ideologically produced discourses, andthis includes Morrison’s own philosophy on animal rights and his activism.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The primary {{objective}} of a grid {{is to maintain}} a balance between generation and load. If these quantities are not in balance with each other, severe damages such as voltage fluctuations, low power quality, power outages or even cascaded blackouts may occur. Hence {{one of the primary}} factors that holds the grid together and makes <b>it</b> <b>operative</b> is the frequency. Thus maintaining the frequency within certain limits is the basic operational requirement. Lately, the power system's dependency on wind power has increased, suggesting that wind power generation is expected to contribute its services which are normally delivered by conventional power plants. However a system that has high wind penetration results in reduced system inertia due to the wind turbine's lack of droop characteristics that may lead to frequency control issues. Thus a backup system is needed such as an energy storage system that can be controlled to supply energy when demand is high i. e., during demand response operations, energy can be stored by increasing load and temperature, and energy can be effectively returned by reducing load and temperature. This thesis presents the modelling of such an energy storage system which consists of several generators responding at different time scales and several water heaters that can be controlled based on the frequency deviation from its nominal value. The ultimate goal {{of this paper is to}} perform transient analysis on a simplified Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system for frequency response, wind integration and energy storage using primary frequency control and secondary frequency control. Simulation results will showcase the frequency excursions of the WECC system with and without energy storage under normal loss of generation event and under wind penetration...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to apply a Model Predictive Fuzzy Controller (MPC and Takagi-Sugeno) to a {{specific}} Steam Boiler Plant. This is a very common problem in control. The considered plant {{is based on the}} descriptions obtained from the data of a referenced boiler in the combined cycle plant as Abbot in Champaign, Illinois. The idea is to take all the useful data from the boiler according to its performance and capability in different operation points in order to model the most accurate plant for control. The considered case study is based in a modification of a model proposed by Pellegrinetti and Bentsman in 1996, considering to be tested under the demands of the Control Engineering Association (CEA). The system is Multi-Input and Multi-Output (MIMO), where each controlled output has a specific weight in order to measure the performance. The objective is to minimize cost index but also make <b>it</b> <b>operative</b> and robust {{for a wide range of}} variables, discovering the limits of the plant and its behaviour. The model is supposed to manage real data and was constructed under real physical descriptions. However, this model is not a white box, so the analysis and development of the model to be used with the MPC strategy have to be identified to continue with the evaluation of the controlled plant. There are some physical variables that have to be taken into account (Drum Pressure, Excess of Oxygen, Water Level, Water Flow, Fuel Flow, Air Flow and Steam Demand) to know if these variables and other parameters are evolving in the correct way and satisfy the logic of the mass and energy balances in the system. After measuring and analysing the data, the model is validated testing it for different values of steam demands. The controller is tuned for every one of the considered demands. Once tuned, the controller computes the manipulated variables receiving information from the controlled ones, including their references. Finally, the resulting controller is a combination of a set of local controllers using the Takagi-Sugeno approach using the steam demand setpoint as scheduling variable. To apply this approach, a set of local models approximating the non-linear boiler behaviour around a set of steam demand set-points are obtained and then their a fused using the Takagi-Sugeno approach to approximate any unknown steam demand located in the valid range of values...|$|E
40|$|Substantial {{seismic risk}} to public buildings, such as schools and medical centres, affects a wide {{segment of the}} world’s population: from the {{developing}} countries and those with considerable socio-economic diversity (Africa, Latin America), to those currently undergoing economic transformation and rapid demographic expansion (China, India, Southeast Asian). The direct exportation of modern technologies or know-how through simple economic aid programmes cannot alone solve the problem: local populations are often unable to handle the maintenance and management of modern buildings, whether it be for economic reasons, a lack of organizational support or simply a poor understanding of the materials, systems and construction techniques supplied them. The use of low-cost, easily available materials is a necessary, though insufficient, condition for balanced development {{in the field of}} earthquake-resistant structures. The goal, in this respect, is to improve existing local technologies by enhancing the peoples’ understanding of the seismic behaviour of buildings, and by applying modern techniques to enhance traditional local materials and technologies. In doing so, all aspects relevant to structural stability (statics, energetics, systems, and sanitation) must be addressed. Another essential undertaking is to promulgate scientific knowledge: this involves understanding the linguistic and popular customs of local populations, their organizational structures and to implement means of language communication aimed at segments of the population or social structures able to receive such knowledge and render <b>it</b> <b>operative.</b> In this regard, the case of the Republic of Malawi – the object of the present project – is emblematic. The project involves designing and constructing a simple school building with materials and techniques found in the area, by adopting some strategies to increase the structure’s capacity to withstand seismic actions. The basic structural material to be used is bamboo, reinforced with timber, straw and mud, and masonry blocks. The seismic-resistant structure elements are fashioned of plywood and stainless-steel screws, easily assembled given suitable instructions. The construction methods are simple and can followed by locals with proper dissemination of the techniques throughout the community and organization of the building site. Three levels of communication are proposed: a) technical dissemination through local institutions (local technical offices, Universities); b) training work-site foremen in the local community; c) support to and verification of the work progress. Each of the three levels calls for specific communication methods for disseminating know-how, through documents, sketches, information boards and verbal explanations. In the first, typical western-culture technical and economic documents are used; in the second, a dissemination manual with simplified language, sketches and illustrations for assembly are adopted, using the communication techniques of “picture books” or “comic strips” typical of the educational brochures used in primary and secondary schools; lastly, in the third, descriptive charts will be drawn up to illustrate, through simple pictures and sketches, the various construction stages – a technique similar to the classical “story-board”, which serves to bring to life the time sequence of the various stages and make them more easily understandable...|$|E
