40|$|Can {{sovereign}} debt write-downs {{be used to}} achieve the Mil-lennium Development Goals (MDGs) ? This paper shows that transparency of domestic governance determines how a sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>write-down</b> is structured to attain the MDGs. When domes-tic governance is transparent, an unconditional <b>debt</b> <b>write-down</b> enhances non-elite’s welfare. Without such transparency, con-ditions that directly link the <b>debt</b> <b>write-down</b> to public goods that improve non-elite’s welfare are required. In the latter case, in a dynamic setting, the <b>debt</b> <b>write-down</b> also has to be directly linked {{to the amount of}} new debt issued.

40|$|At present, the {{enhanced}} HIPC initiative and the Gleneagles Proposal for <b>debt</b> <b>write-downs</b> by the G 8 {{are the main}} mechanisms used to reduce indebtedness of low-income countries. In these countries where poor governance is a key issue, it is naÃ¯ve {{to believe that the}} Millennium Development Goals can be achieved if the current debt relief mechanisms fail to address such problem. In this paper, we develop a model of sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>write-downs,</b> where governance problems reflect domestic distributive conflict between two classes in the society and intertemporal conflict. The main policy issue is how to design the optimal form of <b>debt</b> <b>write-downs</b> and the conditionality requirements attached to it with such governance problems in mind. To deal with the domestic distributive conflict, it is crucial that the conditionality requirements target both provision of public goods and private consumption level of the poor citizens. Addressing the intertemporal conflict problem requires the use of long-run conditionality requirements. Against such a benchmark, we then evaluate the efficacy of the current debt relief initiatives and discuss some policy implications. Debt Relief, Conditionality, HIPC Initiative. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{frequent}} failure of the debt swaps is not an accident. Instead, it follows from fundamental forces driven by the market's assessment of the scarcity of fiscal revenue relative to the demand for fiscal outlays. It follows from the observation that arbitrage forces systematically impact prices in asset markets. Ignoring these price adjustments would lead to too optimistic {{an assessment of the}} gains from swaps or buybacks. A by-product of our paper is to highlight the perils of financial engineering that ignores the intertemporal constraints imposed by fiscal fundamentals. As a country approaches the range of partial default (either on domestic or external debt), swaps may not provide the expected breathing room and could even bring the crisis forward. Our methodology combines three independent themes: exchange rate crises as the manifestation of excessive monetary injections [Krugman-Flood-Garber], the fiscal theory of inflation [Sargent-Wallace (1981) ], and sovereign debt. The integrated framework derives devaluation and external debt repudiation as part of a public-finance optimizing problem. We shows that under conditions similar to those which prevailed in Russia and Argentina prior to their meltdown, swaps are not just neutral, but could actually make the situation worse and even trigger a speculative attack. An unsettlingly clear implication of the model is that there may be very few options left once public debt reaches levels regarded as unsustainable in relation to fiscal fundamentals. Dollarization only makes matters worse, and pushes the <b>debt</b> <b>write-down</b> option to the fore. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two years, Europe has been facing a debt crisis, and Greece has been at its center. In {{response}} to the crisis, drastic actions have been taken, including the halving of Greek debt. Policy makers acted because interest rates for sovereign debt increased dramatically. High interest rates imply that default is likely due to economic conditions. High interest rates also increase the cost of borrowing and thus cause default to be likely. If there is a departure from equilibrium, increasing interest rates may contribute to [...] -rather than be caused by [...] -default risk. Here we build a quantitative equilibrium model of sovereign default risk that, for the first time, is able to determine if markets are consistently set by economic conditions. We show that over the period 2001 - 2012, the annually-averaged long-term interest rates of Greek debt are quantitatively related to the ratio of debt to GDP. The relationship shows that the market consistently expects default to occur if the Greek debt reaches twice the GDP. Our analysis does not preclude non-equilibrium increases in interest rates over shorter timeframes. We find evidence of such non-equilibrium fluctuations in a separate analysis. According to the equilibrium model, the date by which a half-default must occur is March 2013, almost {{one year after the}} actual <b>debt</b> <b>write-down.</b> Any acceleration of default by non-equilibrium fluctuations is significant for national and international interventions. The need for austerity or bailout costs would be reduced if market regulations were implemented to increase market stability to prevent short term interest rate increases. We similarly evaluate the timing of projected defaults without interventions for Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy to be March 2013, April 2014, May 2014, and July 2016, respectively. All defaults are mitigated by planned interventions. Comment: 35 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|Most public {{discussion}} of the world’s continuing financial and macroeconomic troubles focuses rightly on debt. It focuses wrongly, however, on public debt. The real source of our ills is global-trade-related private debt overhang among millions of households below {{the top of the}} wealth distribution in the “developed” world. That is the provenance of both (a) the asset price bubbles and busts in whose aftermath we still struggle, and (b) the fact that we’re still struggling. Public sector debt growth in the developed world since 2009 is merely a symptom – the product of thus far failed treatment – of this fundamental condition. In sum, then, we are now living with over three decades’ postponed secular stagnation {{on the part of the}} global middle class and the economies whose growth they once fueled, the destructive consequences of which we simply put off to, and accordingly concentrated into, the present moment. This is why times are so tough and so volatile. What then to do? Relative to the state of the {{public discussion}}, the answer is lamentably obvious. In the immediate term, private debt must be massively restructured and largely forgiven on a scale commensurate with those asset price plummets that were the crash. In the longer term, the structural conditions that render us debt-dependent have to be radically, even if incrementally, altered, while financial regulation for its part must become forthrightly macroprudential in character. This is the only sustainable way to eliminate our now crippling private debt overhang and prevent a recurrence. The only alternatives are intolerable: (a) continuing slump, with all of the waste and continuing tragedy it entails; or (b) further asset price bubbles and busts, of the sort in which all efforts to pare overhang artificially from the asset side of the balance sheet alone – e. g., through non-supplemented monetary policy – ultimately issue. This paper aims to head-off these intolerable alternatives. It begins by elaborating more fully on the role played by inequality and private debt in fomenting financial crisis and then underwriting post-crisis slump, first modeling the mechanism through which this occurs, then empirically corroborating the presence and operation of this mechanism in the nation’s most devastating bubbles, busts, and ensuing deflations. The paper then documents the magnitude of that post-bubble private debt overhang with which we now struggle. It shows that this overhang is by far the most salient cause of our ongoing troubles. The paper then turns to elaborating a full menu of shorter and longer term policy actions that must be taken to eliminate private debt overhang and restore healthy growth to the macroeconomy. These include carefully integrated <b>debt</b> <b>write-down,</b> capital-ownership-spreading, finance-regulatory, and global currency reform measures...|$|E

This thesis {{consists of three}} separate chapters. In the first chapter, I review the literature on sovereign debt crises. In the second chapter, I analyze the role nominal debt plays in sovereign debt crises, and in particular default and inflation policies. Using bond-level data on government borrowing, I document that nominal obligations are a large fraction of government debt in emerging market countries. I then show that default and inflation rates vary systematically with debt denomination: high nominal debt shares are associated with low inflation and default rates in these countries. I build a monetary model of sovereign debt with lack of commitment, in which differences in debt denomination generate this pattern, and the government inflates more when debt is real. Issuing real instead of nominal debt has two effects in the model. On the one hand, real debt reduces the incentive to create costly inflation because {{the value of the}} debt is fixed in real terms. It thus helps mitigate the commitment problem. On the other hand, because the commitment problem is less severe, real debt facilitates more debt accumulation over time, causing the government to resort to the printing press after all to finance the debt burden. In a calibrated version of the model this second effect dominates: As in the data, inflation and default rates are higher on average when debt is real instead of nominal. Default risk helps generate large differences in inflation and default rates across debt regimes as the government optimally inflates in order to avoid default. In the third chapter, I study incomplete debt relief in sovereign debt crises. I show that, in the data, sovereign defaults typically do not result in a full <b>debt</b> <b>write-down.</b> On the contrary, creditors recover on average more than half of their investment. I then build a model of sovereign default and incomplete debt relief to study the causes and consequences of incomplete debt relief. In the model, the degree of debt relief directly affects default incentives via bond prices. In particular, a high debt recovery rate - equivalently, little debt relief - reduces recovery risk to investors and tends to offset the effects of default risk. In equilibrium, incomplete debt relief lowers spreads and increases debt-to-output ratios and welfare. Default rates are non-monotonically related to debt relief and lowest for intermediate, but relatively low degrees of debt relief. I use the model to analyze the trade-off between long renegotiations and low debt relief and show that the latter is a more effective tool for achieving low equilibrium default rates and high welfare. Finally, the model predicts that countercyclical recovery rates are not welfare-improving...|$|E

Current proposals for dealing with bank and sovereign debt problems appear to assume that we can get through the next few years without <b>debt</b> <b>write-downs</b> or a further crisis, so the role of new resolution procedures is to deal with some future crises that will not happen for a number of years. This approach is based on wishful thinking. A future transition to a world in which newly-issued bank and sovereign bonds are treated as junior to previouslyissued debt would most likely produce a bigger crisis than the one seen last year.

40|$|Any {{arrangement}} {{that is to}} serve as a long-term framework for international debt management must permit a politically acceptable rate of economic growth in the debtor countries while gradually improving the financial positions of the creditor banks. In addition, a realistic debt management strategy must maintain enough new lending to the debtor countries to provide an incentive for continued compliance with debt service responsibilities. This paper establishes the conditions under which these three goals are compatible. The analysis indicates that Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are now all capable of achieving significant rates of economic growth without <b>debt</b> <b>write-downs</b> or interest rate reductions. They do require additional amounts of credit but the resulting increases in the absolute size of their debts is compatible with declining ratios of debt to their own exports and to the total earnings of the creditor banks. Stated differently, limiting the ratio of debt service payments to GNP to country-specific standards, whether by long-term agreements or by annual negotiations, can achieve economic growth while improving the financial conditions of the creditor banks. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple model of {{sovereign}} debt crises {{in which a}} country chooses its optimal mix of short and long-term bonds subject to standard contracting frictions: the country cannot commit to repay its debts nor to a specific path of future debt issues, and contracts cannot be made state contingent nor renegotiated.
