5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E

25|$|While the {{negative}} <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> phenomenon {{may have been}} exaggerated, Parliament passed legislation in 1736 to discourage consumption by prohibiting the sale of gin in quantities of less than two gallons and raising the tax on it dramatically. However, the peak in consumption was reached seven years later, when the nation of six and one-half million people drank over 18 million gallons of gin. And most was consumed by the small minority of the population then living in London and other cities; people in the countryside largely consumed beer, ale and cider.|$|E
25|$|Conservation and {{management}} {{efforts in the}} lower Esopus are not as coordinated {{as they are in}} the upper stream, and there is no stream management plan. Most efforts have been spearheaded by local municipalities. In the wake of the 2005 flood, the towns of the lower Esopus and the city of Kingston began holding an annual Esopus Creek Lower Basin Watershed Conference. One of its chief concerns was the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> flood on the region: it took some farmers several months to recover from its effects.|$|E

25|$|According to one dental textbook, eating seafood {{once a week}} raises urine mercury {{levels to}} 5 to 20µg/L, which is {{equivalent}} to two to eight times the level of exposure that comes from numerous amalgam fillings. Neither exposure has any known health effect. Scientists agree that dental amalgam fillings release elemental mercury vapor, but studies report different amounts, {{which may or may}} not be sufficient to pose a significant risk to health. Estimates range from 1-3 micrograms (µg) per day according to the FDA. The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> amount of exposure are also disputed.|$|E
25|$|Many {{structures}} {{near the}} bay shore {{on either side}} would probably be severely affected by either a major Hayward Fault rupture or a nearby San Andreas Fault rupture. Severe effects were seen in both Oakland and northern San Francisco from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, even though this event was not extremely large and was centered a significant distance away in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the severe <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> event were due to poorly responding soil conditions and design deficiencies in large structures. Only {{a portion of the}} structural deficiencies in the larger area have been addressed, and the surface motion effects of a large event are likely to be far more severe than seen in the Loma Prieta event.|$|E
25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now.

25|$|In 457BC Sparta, {{needing a}} {{counterpoise}} against Athens in central Greece, reversed her policy and reinstated Thebes {{as the dominant}} power in Boeotia. The great citadel of Cadmea served this purpose well by holding out as a base of resistance when the Athenians overran and occupied {{the rest of the}} country (457–447BC). In the Peloponnesian War, the Thebans, embittered by the support that Athens gave to the smaller Boeotian towns, and especially to Plataea, which they vainly attempted to reduce in 431BC, were firm allies of Sparta, which in turn helped them to besiege Plataea and allowed them to destroy the town after its capture in 427BC. In 424BC, at the head of the Boeotian levy, they inflicted a severe defeat on an invading force of Athenians at the Battle of Delium, and for the first time displayed the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> firm military organization that eventually raised them to predominant power in Greece.|$|E
25|$|Stimulating the OFC in {{laboratory}} animals results in drug self-administration. In animal studies the OFC is hypothesized {{to not only}} {{be associated with the}} response to reward, but also to respond and adjust animal behavior when the rewarding properties of the reinforcement change - as well as learning the association between stimulus and reward. The damage to the OFC results in deficits in reversal of stimulus reinforcement in which an animal perseverates on a behavior and fails to extinguish a behavior. This perseveration and inability to extinguish a behavior can be related to drug administration in substance abuse and substance dependence where individuals compulsively self-administer a drug even with drastic decrease of reinforcing <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> drug and tolerance to the pleasurable effects and in the presence of adverse consequences of drug use. Rats who are reintroduced to an environment in which they used cocaine experience activation of the OFC. In addition, in rats, repeated alcohol use causes degeneration of the OFC.|$|E
25|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, {{measurements}} of aether wind effects of first order, i.e. effects proportional to v/c (v being Earth's velocity, c {{the speed of}} light) {{were thought to be}} possible, but no direct measurement of the speed of light was possible with the accuracy required. For instance, the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus could measure the speed of light to perhaps 5% accuracy, which was quite inadequate for measuring directly a first-order 0.01% change in the speed of light. A number of physicists therefore attempted to make measurements of indirect first-order effects not of the speed of light itself, but of variations in the speed of light (see First order aether-drift experiments). The Hoek experiment, for example, was intended to detect interferometric fringe shifts due to speed differences of oppositely propagating light waves through water at rest. The results of such experiments were all negative. This could be explained by using Fresnel's dragging coefficient, according to which the aether and thus light are partially dragged by moving matter. Partial aether-dragging would thwart attempts to measure any first order change in the speed of light. As pointed out by Maxwell (1878), only experimental arrangements capable of measuring second order effects would have any hope of detecting aether drift, i.e. effects proportional to v2/c2. Existing experimental setups, however, were not sensitive enough to measure <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> size.|$|E

2500|$|In {{sociology}} and social psychology, racial {{identity and the}} acquisition of that identity, is often used as a variable in racism studies. Racial ideologies and racial identity affect individuals' perception of race and discrimination. Cazenave and Maddern (1999) define racism as [...] "a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates {{at every level of}} society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Racial centrality (the extent to which a culture recognizes individuals' racial identity) appears to affect the degree of discrimination African American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> discrimination. Sellers and Shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and social beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|The sheer {{scale of}} {{military}} funding for science since World War II has instigated {{a large body}} of historical literature analyzing the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> funding, especially for American science. [...] Since Paul Forman’s 1987 article “Behind quantum electronics: National security as a basis for physical research in the United State, 1940-1960,” there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery. [...] Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected science—particularly physics—toward applied research, and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science; ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners. [...] An alternate view has been presented by Daniel Kevles, that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research, scientists by-and-large retained their intellectual autonomy.|$|E
