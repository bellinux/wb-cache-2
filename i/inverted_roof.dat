40|$|This {{contribution}} {{illustrates the}} application of the standard EN ISO 6946 regarding the heat loss of an <b>inverted</b> <b>roof</b> for different regions of Europe. An addendum to the standard (EN. ISO 6946 : 19961 Al, 2003) introduces a correction to the thermal transmittance of inverted roofs due to rain water flowing between the insulation and the waterproofing membrane. It is possible to calculate the extra heat loss of inverted roofs caused by rain water below the heat insulation. The extra heat loss depends on the average rainfall and on which fraction of the rain water that will drain between the waterproofing membrane and the thermal insulation. This paper explains {{the application of}} the standard for areas of Europe. Furthermore, some constructions are proposed, which have such small extra heat losses caused by rain water that they may be disregarded in the calculation...|$|E

40|$|Green roofs are {{becoming}} more and more popular because their thermal inertia, combined with latent heat effects, saves energy both in summer and winter and helps improve the microclimate in cities. Due to a multitude of influencing factors like moisture storage, freezing, evaporation, shading, reduced radiation absorption through the plant cover, etc., a simulation of the hygrothermal behavior of green roofs is still difficult. In Germany, green roofs are often applied on so-called <b>inverted</b> <b>roofs,</b> where a vapor-retarding foam insulation is used above the roofing membrane in direct contact with the growth medium. Due to a more or less permanent moisture film beneath the insulation panels and a mostly moisture-saturated growth medium above, these insulation boards experience a continuous moisture accumulation during their service life. In numerous in-situ investigations of <b>inverted</b> green <b>roofs,</b> the accumulation of moisture was determined by periodical probing over a period of 10 years. Temperature and humidity sensors at several positions in the roofs served to monitor the transient behavior. Based on these tests, new models for the hygrothermal performance of <b>inverted</b> green <b>roofs</b> have been developed to simulate the moisture behavior of the foam insulation boards, depending on material properties and boundary conditions. Together with further experimental investigations, this model allows a detailed analysis of the longterm hygrothermal and energy performance of green roofs...|$|R
40|$|Green roofs {{become more}} and more popular {{especially}} in cities where they can help to improve the microclimate by reduced peak temperatures compared to conventional roof surfaces. They also reduce the gutter loads by rain water retention and save both heating energy in winter and cooling energy in summer. On the other hand, the cooler temperatures in summer may reduce the drying potential of the load bearing structure beneath the green <b>roof.</b> In <b>inverted</b> <b>roofs</b> the permanently humid conditions can lead to moisture accumulation in the foam insulation slabs. Due to a multitude of influencing factors like moisture storage, freezing, evaporation, shading and reduced radiation absorption through the plant cover etc. a simulation of the hygrothermal behaviour of green roofs represents a challenge. Therefore, the hygrothermal conditions of green roofs on wooden structures and on <b>inverted</b> concrete <b>roofs</b> at different locations has been measured and evaluated for several locations in Europe. Based on these experimental results a new approach was developed to calculate in a realistic way the hygrothermal performance of green roofs including the important influencing factors mentioned before. This contribution first investigates the conditions beneath the growth medium layers and the water content of the insulation boards and of the wooden sheathing by field tests in Holzkirchen, Vienna and Leipzig. In the second part a new approach to simulate green roofs including the growth medium layer is shown. In the case of <b>inverted</b> green <b>roofs,</b> the moisture film beneath the insulation boards is a dominant factor too that {{must be taken into account}} in the simulation. Finally, the results of simulations and experiments are compared in order to validate and fine-tune the new approaches that have been developed to model the behaviour of vegetated wooden structures and <b>inverted</b> concrete <b>roofs</b> in South, Central and North Europe...|$|R
40|$|A normal roofing {{membrane}} {{is exposed}} to various mechanical and climatic impacts which can reduce durability and the service life of the membrane. In so called <b>inverted</b> <b>roofs</b> the membrane is situated beneath the insulation layer - which is ballasted with gravel or vegetated substrate. Thus, the sealing is protected versus the above mentioned damaging influences. Drawback of this solution is the direct exposure of the insulation to the outdoor climate. Therefore only materials with a high vapour diffusion resistance shall be used to minimize the entry of water into the insulation. However, the long term experience shows that also XPS boards experience some moisture accumulation especially in case where the cover layer remains humid most of the time. This slows down the drying process towards the top compared to gravel ballasted roofs. Based on long term field tests of green roofs this paper provides new approaches to simulate the hygrothermal conditions in <b>inverted</b> <b>roofs.</b> The model includes the simulation of the moisture behaviour of the substrate and an estimation {{of the amount of}} rainwater remaining at the interface between the sealing membrane and the insulation boards. Applying this model allows to asses the moisture accumulation in the insulation and the subsequent increase in the material's thermal conductivity over the life time of the roof. Considering the long-term moisture behaviour helps to specify the thickness of the insulation layer required to maintain the aspired level of thermal resistance over the whole service life of the roof...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{discussed}} flat roof structures during the last 20 years is a structure called <b>inverted</b> <b>roof,</b> where the main thermal insulation layer is placed above the main waterproofing system. The reasons why this type of flat roof is or could be chosen are more less clear. Usually it is the intention to protect the main waterproofing system, usually of synthetic or bituminous membranes, against the impact of outdoor air thermal changes, against any prospective mechanical damages and also to reduce risk of water vapor condensation in the structure. This type of structure could help to solve the vapor/thermal difficulties during {{the design of the}} flat roof over the space with higher indoor air humidity like swimming pools or specific industrial processes. Due to the higher rate of safety against mechanical damage it is also used quite often {{in the case of the}} design of the roof terraces or roof gardens. Nevertheless, the correct attitude during the design of the structure is to take into considerations all possible aspects including the defects and problems which are most typical for each one type of structure. This paper is willing to give the brief overview of the typical defects for inverted flat roofs and to contribute a little to the understanding of commonly discussed effect of undergoing water beneath the thermal insulation itself and decreasing thus the thermal protection efficiency as well as the inner surface temperature...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} of one-dwelling {{building}} is to conduct a study of thermal flux and diffusion of water vapour through {{a part of the}} building cladding. By means of a computer program, examples of structural complexes of flat roofs of two types are made – <b>inverted</b> flat <b>roof</b> and combined flat roof. By complying to the criteria of allowed thermal transmittance of flat roofs as are written in the PURES 2010 (Pravilnik o učinkoviti rabi energije v stavbah), including the corresponding technical directive and the treatment of calculation method of the thermal transmittance of building components set by the ISO 6946 standard, the effect of different ratios of thermal insulation between the two types of flat roof on the change of thermal flux and the corresponding needed change of the thermal insulation thickness of the material in the system of the roofs in consideration is studied. An appendix on <b>inverted</b> flat <b>roofs</b> is taken into account {{in the first part of}} the study of the thermal flux through structural complexes, a correction stated in the ISO 6946 standard. The latter contains a correction on the system’s thermal transmittance in regard to the additional heat loss due to the water percolation through the juncture of thermal insulation layer. Additionally, an appeal for the correction of the thermal conductivity in regard to the change of thermal conductivity of the thermal insulation is made in the aforementioned appendix, to integrate the possible increase of the moisture content due to the diffusion of water vapour.

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> flat <b>roofs</b> {{were adopted}} {{as a common}} {{construction}} solution throughout the Modern Movement. They require greater protection of the waterproofing layer and sufficient thermal insulation. Depending on the climate conditions, a thicker or thinner thermal layer is installed and energy saving {{in keeping with the}} climatic conditions, regulations or national or regional energy policies is obtained. However, the common construction systems tend to be focused on minimising the construction costs of each project, using thermal insulation layers of extruded polystyrene, a modified bitumen waterproofing layer and a finishing layer of 5 cm of gravel. In the case of trafficable roofs, this layer is substituted with ceramic or hydraulic concrete paving. These solutions have given rise to an enormous reduction in the thermal mass of the roof layers located above the isolation layer and consequently, a lack of thermal inertia with which to cushion the effect of the thermal wave of the outdoor environment produced in the indoor climate of the building. Roofs flooded with water in climatologies which allow their application generate significant thermal inertia depending on the depth of the water. They reduce the amplitude of the thermal wave produced in the inside temperature of the buildings by the external thermal variations, generating a considerable increase in comfort and a reduction in energy consumption. This paper outlines the research carried out in the Alicante University Museum. The whole building and its flooded roof have been monitored over a full year cycle and data has been obtained regarding the dry interior temperatures of each layer of the walls, outdoor temperatures and solar radiation, relative humidities, etc. Through the use of simulation tools, comparative results of this roof with respect to <b>inverted</b> flat <b>roofs</b> have been obtained, such as the decrement factor and the heat wave...|$|R

40|$|Low slope roofs are roofs with an {{inclination}} between 1 : 16 and 1 : 4 {{and have}} been constructed and preferred for many years due to the benefits they present. The goal of the present work is to study the following problems of low slope roofs, as they are suggested by previous relevant theses and the current needs of the market. Moisture transfer in low slope roofs with constant exposure {{to high levels of}} relative humidity. Is protection against corrosion required for steel beams placed directly under the external membranes? If yes, what kind of protection is that? Roof drainage on low slope roofs The study of the first subject was based on simulations of this type of structures in order to see how external moisture affects the moisture level and the potential for corrosion on steel beams. The main goal was to conclude whether we can actually build <b>inverted</b> <b>roofs</b> with steel plates or beams lying right under the roof membrane and what kind of protection is more appropriate to apply, in case it is required. According to the literature review conducted on roof structures, corrosion and corrosion protection, as well as the results of the simulations, the main factor defining the corrosion potential is the indoor environment. Moreover, paint coating seems to be the indicated anticorrosive protection. Regarding drainage, the study focused on the literature review of the current situation, the solutions applied, the existing regulations and guidelines regarding the type of systems used (full flow or gravity, internal or external), the construction of drainage valleys (inclined or horizontal) and the placement and dimensioning of drains and overflows, {{in order to create a}} short handbook with issues to be considered by the roof engineer. The main conclusions are that drain valleys are suggested to be constructed completely horizontal, in order to facilitate the cooperation between drains, and that full-flow systems are more efficient than gravity ones and should be preferred, as long as the roof is not exposed to solid material and prone to its accumulation around drains (e. g. roofs covered with vegetation or stone ballast, with overhanging or nearby trees) ...|$|R

50|$|The façades are characterised by {{tiers of}} repeating arched white frames around {{recessed}} windows of bronze-tinted glass, with each tier {{separated by a}} black granite string course which incorporates hidden drainage. The cladding units are pre-cast double-skinned 1.5 m wide modules of glass fibre reinforced cement (GRC), using a mixture of Portland cement with 5% alkali-resistant glass fibre as reinforcement. It was the first building {{in the world to}} be entirely clad with GRC panels. Triple-width modules on the ground floor 4.5 m wide have two canted windowpanes meeting at an angle, with similar modules repeated on upper floors to either side of the entrances. The slim profile and light weight of the GRC panels allowed the architect to slope the walls outward at an angle of five degrees, with each floor slightly larger than the one below, creating extra square metres of office space. The units of the partial upper floor are <b>inverted,</b> creating a <b>roof</b> line that resembles a crown to the north side and at the eastern end; a roof deck occupies at the south-western corner. Railings on the street have shapes similar to the cladding panels.|$|R
