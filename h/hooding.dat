The legal brief held that “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment could be inflicted on the Guantanamo detainees with near impunity”.|$|E

In particular, noted Aileen McColgan, the techniques alleged in 1950s Kenya were refined into what are now known as the [...] "five techniques" [...] for use in internment in 1970s Northern Ireland: wall-standing, <b>hooding,</b> subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink. She went on to note: [...] "The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1977 that Britain had breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and 'inhuman and degrading treatment', by the use of the five techniques in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister, Edward Heath, told the Commons in 1972 that the techniques would never again be used 'as an aid to interrogation', a commitment reiterated before the European Court." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 21, 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union {{released}} {{copies of}} internal memoranda from the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{that it had}} obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. These discussed torture and abuse at prisons in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan, and Iraq. One memorandum dated May 22, 2004 was from an individual described as the [...] "On Scene Commander – Baghdad," [...] but whose name had been redacted. This individual referred explicitly to an Executive Order that sanctioned the use of extraordinary interrogation tactics by U.S. military personnel. The torture methods sanctioned included sleep deprivation, <b>hooding</b> prisoners, playing loud music, removing all detainees' clothing, forcing them to stand in so-called [...] "stress positions", {{and the use of}} dogs. The author also stated that the Pentagon had limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the chain of command. The author identifies [...] "physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching" [...] as being outside the Executive Order. This was the first internal evidence since the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse affair became public in April 2004 that forms of coercion of captives had been mandated {{by the president of the}} United States.|$|E
50|$|On {{passenger}} cars, a <b>hood</b> may be {{held down}} by a concealed latch. It is designed to protect a car from thefts, damage and sudden <b>hood</b> opening on the road. The <b>hood</b> release system is common on the most of vehicles and usually consists of interior <b>hood</b> latch handle, <b>hood</b> release cable and <b>hood</b> latch assembly. The <b>hood</b> latch handle is usually located below the steering wheel, beside the driver's seat or set into the door frame. When a driver pulls a <b>hood</b> latch handle the <b>hood</b> panel pops up and allows access to the engine compartment. On race cars or cars with aftermarket <b>hoods</b> (that do not use the factory latch system) the <b>hood</b> may be held down by <b>hood</b> pins. A <b>hood</b> may sometimes contain a <b>hood</b> ornament, <b>hood</b> scoop, power bulge, and/or wiper jets. <b>Hoods</b> are typically made out of steel, but aluminum is rapidly gaining popularity with auto companies. Aftermarket manufacturers may construct <b>hoods</b> out of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or dry carbon.|$|R

2500|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, the British {{government}} focused a lot {{of effort}} on measures to combat the activities of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. In Northern Ireland, the government curtailed the civil liberties of all those, disproportionately from the Catholic nationalist minority (as the UK government commissioned Stevens Inquiries concluded; [...] "This included examination and analysis of RUC records to determine whether both sides of the community were dealt with in equal measure. They were not."), who were interned without trial, and violated the human rights of some. During Operation Demetrius, for instance, a total of 1,981 people were interned without trial, of whom only 107 were loyalists, and no loyalists were arrested until 1973, 2 years after the introduction of internment. The Ministry of Defence stated [...] "moderate physical pressure" [...] was applied to the men. The Republic of Ireland lodged a complaint against the British government for its alleged treatment of interned prisoners in Northern Ireland (ECHR Ireland v UK 1978). The European Court of Human Rights initially ruled that torture had been used, but on appeal amended the ruling to state that the techniques used, including sleep deprivation, <b>hooding,</b> stress postures, subjection to [...] "white noise" [...] and deprivation of food and drink, constituted [...] "cruel and inhuman treatment", but fell short of torture, in a landmark 1978 case. However, on December 2, 2014, in response to petitions from organisations including Amnesty International and the Pat Finucane Centre after RTÉ broadcast a documentary entitled The Torture Files - which included evidence that the UK government of the time had intentionally misled the European Courts by withholding information, and that the decision to use the five techniques had been taken at UK cabinet level - Charles Flanagan TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, announced that the Irish government had formally petitioned the EUCHR to re-examine the case. As of January 2016, the case remains before the EUCHR. There have also been persistent allegations of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and British security forces, such as in the 1989 murder of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane by members of the UVF, allegedly in collusion with MI5. In 2011, then UK Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that members of the UK security service were involved in the murder.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hooding</b> is the placing of a hood {{over the}} entire head of a prisoner. <b>Hooding</b> is widely {{considered}} to be a form of torture, one legal scholar considers the <b>hooding</b> of prisoners to be a violation of international law, specifically the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, which demand that persons under custody or physical control of enemy forces be treated humanely. <b>Hooding</b> is also potentially dangerous, especially when a prisoner's hands are also bound. It is {{considered to be a}}n act of torture when its primary purpose is sensory deprivation during interrogation; it causes [...] "disorientation, isolation, and dread." [...] According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, <b>hooding</b> is used to prevent people from seeing and to disorient them, and also to prevent them from breathing freely. <b>Hooding</b> is sometimes used in conjunction with beatings to increase anxiety as to when and where the blows will fall. <b>Hooding</b> also allows the interrogators to remain anonymous and thus to act with impunity. Moreover, if a group of prisoners is hooded, the interrogator can play them off against each other by pretending, for instance, that some of them are cooperating, which the prisoners will be unable to verify.|$|E
