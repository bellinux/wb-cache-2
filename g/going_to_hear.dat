A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

Cyndi Lauper does a song ('All Through the Night') that's on a solo record of mine. I just thought, 'No one's really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> this.' Then she does it, {{and it becomes a}} Top 5 song." [...] "I'm just glad people know the songs, really. I think they're really good. The only problem is with people who don't know I wrote them. I do them and they think, 'God, he's doing that Cyndi Lauper song,'" [...] Shear said.|$|E

Greene deemed it a [...] "sweetly reflective response" [...] by Nas to his daughter's behavior, while Amidon found his level of honesty on the song [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "probably the most honest we’re ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Nas". Alex Macpherson of Fact called it [...] "a song that's as likely to make fathers everywhere misty-eyed {{as it is to}} make teenage girls cringe in horror".

500|$|Consistent with Bolkovac's account, The Whistleblower portrays DynCorp International {{employees}} {{as participants in}} the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E

Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E

It is a double-handed weapon that takes the shape of two [...] "Kingdom Key" [...] Keyblades that intersect in an [...] "X" [...] shape, with additional features that give it the shape of an actual sword. The weapon has the power to open the heart of all worlds, and it exists alongside Kingdom Hearts as its guardian. It led to [...] "Keyblades" [...] being crafted in its image by those seeking Kingdom Hearts' power, those who sought to extinguish the light, and those who sought to protect it. The end result was the Keyblade War, which ended in a world known as the Keyblade Graveyard; the aftermath led the χ-blade itself to shatter into seven pieces of light and thirteen pieces of darknesses. These seven lights, which are said to be the source of all light in the World, later became the hearts of the Princesses of Heart.|$|E

In contemporaneous interviews, Wilson stated that the group's next album Smile (originally called Dumb Angel) was to be [...] "a teenage symphony to God", and that [...] "It will be as much an improvement over [...] Sounds as that was over Summer Days." [...] A Los Angeles Times West Magazine piece by Tom Nolan focused on the contradictions between Wilson's [...] "suburban" [...] demeanor and the reputation that preceded him ("he doesn’t look at all like the seeming leader of a potentially-revolutionary movement in pop music"). When asked where he believes music will go, Wilson responds: [...] "White spirituals, I think that’s what we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> Songs of faith." [...] At the end of 1966, NME conducted a reader's poll that placed Wilson as the fourth-ranked [...] "World Music Personality"—about 1,000 votes ahead of Bob Dylan and 500 behind John Lennon.|$|E

5000|$|A person's {{specific}} {{rights and duties}} depend on the federal statute involved, but here is an outline of how the doctrine works in practice. [...] "Exhaustion of administrative remedies" [...] requires a person to first go to the agency which administers the statute; this process usually involves filing a petition, then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a <b>hearing,</b> and finally using the agency's internal appeal process. Once the agency's own procedures are finished, or [...] "exhausted", then the aggrieved person can file a complaint in a federal court.
