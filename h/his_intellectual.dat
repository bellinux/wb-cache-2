5|$|Along {{with various}} love poems, Panait Cerna's {{writings}} also evince <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> pursuits. This intellectual characteristic {{earned him a}} dedicated following, but was criticized by many of his peers, who found it artificial and outdated.|$|E
5|$|As a {{military}} man, al-Mu'tasim's outlook was utilitarian, and <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> pursuits {{could not be}} {{compared with those of}} al-Ma'mun or his successor al-Wathiq, but he continued his brother's policy of promoting writers and scholars. Baghdad remained a major centre of learning throughout his reign. Among the notable scholars active during his reign were the astronomers Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi and Ahmad al-Farghani, the polymath al-Jahiz, and the distinguished Arab mathematician and philosopher al-Kindi, who dedicated his work On First Philosophy to his patron al-Mu'tasim.|$|E
5|$|As his father's second son, Alexander {{was third}} {{in line to}} the throne, after his father and elder brother, George. His {{education}} was expensive and carefully planned, but while George spent part of his military training in Germany, Alexander was educated in Greece. He joined the prestigious Hellenic Military Academy, where several of his uncles had previously studied and where he made himself known more for his mechanical skills than for <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> capacity. He was passionate about cars and motors, {{and was one of}} the first Greeks to acquire an automobile.|$|E

5|$|Despite his superb playing results, chess was not Lasker's only interest. His parents {{recognized}} <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> talents, {{especially for}} mathematics, {{and sent the}} adolescent Emanuel to study in Berlin (where he found {{he also had a}} talent for chess). Lasker gained his abitur (high school graduation certificate) at Landsberg an der Warthe, now a Polish town named Gorzów Wielkopolski but then part of Prussia. He then studied mathematics and philosophy at the universities in Berlin, Göttingen (where David Hilbert was one of his doctoral advisors) and Heidelberg.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole was an antiquary with {{a strong}} Baconian leaning towards the study of nature. His library {{reflected}} <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> outlook, including works on English history, law, numismatics, chorography, alchemy, astrology, astronomy, and botany. Although {{he was one of}} the founding Fellows of the Royal Society, a key institution in the development of experimental science, his interests were antiquarian and mystical as well as scientific. He was an early freemason, although the extent of his involvement and commitment is unclear. Throughout his life he was an avid collector of curiosities and other artefacts. Many of these he acquired from the traveller, botanist, and collector John Tradescant the Younger. Ashmole donated most of his collection, his antiquarian library and priceless manuscripts to the University of Oxford to create the Ashmolean Museum.|$|E
5|$|Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta was {{employed}} as a linguistic informant for the Phonetics Department at University College London (UCL); his voice recordings of the Kikuyu language assisted Lilias Armstrong in her production of The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu. The book was posthumously published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed {{that he should have}} been recognised as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a course in phonetics from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled {{by a grant from the}} International African Institute, he also took a social anthropology course under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> equality with white Europeans.|$|E

5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he felt as a fatherless child {{and the experience of}} being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was {{involved}} in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> property. Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own Nothing Records imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} {{a meeting at}} the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, addressed by the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> equals.|$|E

5|$|Wagner {{planned for}} a {{collected}} {{edition of his}} publications as early as 1865; he believed that such an edition would help the world understand <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> development and artistic aims. The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner's own account of his progress. Wagner's autobiography Mein Leben was originally published for close friends only {{in a very small}} edition (15–18 copies per volume) in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years, Boganda {{was adopted by}} Catholic missionaries. As a boy he {{attended}} the school opened at Mbaiki (the administrative centre for the Lobaye prefecture) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer. From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent {{two hours a day}} with Monsignor Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending the rest of his time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name Barthélemy, in honour of one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ who was believed to have worked as Christian missionary in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at Bangui, where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom he would consider his spiritual father. The missionaries there, encouraged by <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in Brazzaville and Kisantu (under Belgian Jesuits) before he moved on to the great seminary at Yaoundé. On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve, he was ordained and became the first Roman Catholic priest native to Oubangui-Chari, as the colony was then called. He ministered at Bangui, Grimari and Bangassou, and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the French Army. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in World War II, during which he served in a number of missions.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{found himself}} in battles to protect <b>his</b> <b>intellectual</b> {{property}} many times throughout his career, but he pursued the cause most doggedly during his latter years. His first and most successful patents concerning flour-milling proved the most problematic to defend, and Evans' battles proved influential in setting precedent for the newly established area of federal patent law. His original patent for his automated flour-mill expired in January 1805, but Evans believed that the fourteen year patent term was too brief and petitioned the Congress to extend it. In January 1808 An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans was passed and signed by President Jefferson, a long-time admirer of Evans's work. The act took the extraordinary step of reviving to Evans his expired patent and giving it another fourteen year term— Evans was delighted, but the move was to highly problematic, particularly regarding those who had implemented Evans's designs in the intervening three year period between the patent terms, as many millers had waited for Evans's patent to expire before upgrading their mills.|$|E

2500|$|Howard Richards {{was born}} in Pasadena. California, United States, the eldest child of Kenneth F. Richards, a truck mechanic, {{originally}} from Connecticut, and his wife Donna. [...] It was <b>his</b> mother's <b>intellectual</b> interest in philosophers such as Henri Bergson which prompted the family to break its ties with mormonism. His paternal grandparents fell into unemployment in Connecticut during the Great Depression and moved to Pasadena in 1932. It was his uncle Jack from his mother's side, who died during World War II, and especially his mother who fostered <b>his</b> early <b>intellectual</b> interest.|$|R
