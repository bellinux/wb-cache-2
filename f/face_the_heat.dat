50|$|In {{some cases}} the lamp will be made of hand-blown glass and where the glass was blown, {{there is a small}} bubble that looks like a nipple. The {{position}} of the nipple is very important and if it’s facing the wrong way, it may damage the lamp. This 'nipple' is inherently the weakest part of the lamp and should thus be positioned so as to be exposed to the least amount of heat as possible. It is industry standard to position the nipple out, away from the reflector at back. Another reason for the “nipple out” position {{has more to do with}} the long glass stems on either end of the lamp. In those stems is a thin metal bar through which the electricity travels through. With the nipple out position, the metal bar is parallel with the light avoiding most of the heat. If the globe was rotated 90 degrees either way, the full surface of the metal bar would <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the light from the reflector and potentially cause it to flex and damage the lamp.|$|E
5000|$|The {{delivery}} filming {{caused a}} [...] "culture shock" [...] in Kerala. The debate began when Kerala Legislative Assembly Speaker G. Karthikeyan criticised Shwetha Menon for allowing her delivery {{to be captured}} live on camera. The speaker added that some years ago, a movie titled The Birth was screened at theatres across Kerala. However, the film was tagged as a medical movie, and so did not face any problem. Since Blessy is promoting Kalimannu as a commercial movie, it might have to <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> since it might {{have a negative impact}} on the family audience. Karthikeyan also expressed his surprise why cultural and women’s rights organisations are not coming out against this. A few days after Karthikeyan made his comments, BJP Mahila Morcha activists announced that they would stall the screening of the movie in Kerala, alleging that Shwetha Menon and Blessy are [...] "exploiting motherhood for commercial purposes" [...] by incorporating the actress's delivery. Shobha Surendran, Mahila Morcha leader said at a press meet: [...] "We urge the Censor Board and the state government not to allow its screening here. Otherwise, the activists of the Mahila Morcha will stall the film’s release. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy should intervene in the matter at the earliest and should bring in a law to prohibit such films, which infringe on the morality of the common people. As per the reports, it is learnt that the depiction of Shweta Menon’s motherhood in the movie is so objectionable that it offends the morality of all the right-thinking women. The movie is not only polluting the family values and the rich cultural heritage of ancient Bharata but also legitimising a woman’s efforts to sell her moral values for making money and attaining cheap publicity. I will not be surprised if she plans to deliver her second baby at a public place like festival venues as part of making money. This is totally unacceptable for the right-thinking society and if the director and crew go ahead with the release, they will have to face stiff resistance from the Kerala society." [...] The film was also condemned by the Kerala Film Exhibitors' Federation who said that they will boycott the movie if Blessy includes the delivery scene. Liberty Basheer, president of the federation, said, [...] "We are concerned about the movie's content. If the director includes the delivery scene, we will definitely boycott it," [...] However, the Film Employees' Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) was all support for director Blessy. Speaking to the media, B. Unnikrishnan, general secretary, FEFKA said, [...] "The controversy is baseless. This is not the first time that a delivery is being canned. Moreover, we don't know how he has visualised it. There is a censor board which looks into such matters. There are specific norms that have to be followed while portraying women in movies. If the board feels women are shown in a poor light, it will definitely censor it. Blessy is a director with a good track record. Let's just wait for the final output." ...|$|E

40|$|Efficient and {{effective}} cooling of the trailing edges of gas-turbine vanes and blades is challenging {{because there is}} very little space to work with. In this study, CFD simulations based on steady RANS closed by the shear-stress transport turbulence model were performed to study the flow and heat transfer in an L-shaped duct for the trailing edge under two operating conditions. One operating condition, referred to as the laboratory condition, where experimental measurements were made, has a Reynolds number at the duct inlet of ReD = 15, 000, coolant inlet temperature of Tinlet = 300 K, wall temperature of Twall = 335 K, a back pressure of Pb = 1 atm. When rotating, the angular speed was Ω = 1, 000 rpm. The other condition, referred to as the engine-relevant condition, has Re D = 150, 000 at the duct inlet, Tinlet = 673 K, Twall = 1, 173 K, and Pb = 25 atm. When rotating, Ω was 3, 600 rpm. ^ The objective is {{to understand the nature of}} the flow and heat transfer in an L-shaped cooling passage for the trailing edge that has a combination of ribs and pin fins under rotating and non-rotating conditions with focus on how pin fins and ribs distribute the flow throughout the passage and to understand what features of the flow and heat transfer can or cannot be extrapolated from the laboratory to the engine-relevant operating conditions. ^ When there is no rotation, results obtained show that for both operating conditions, the pin fins minimized the size of the separation bubble when the flow exits the inlet duct into the expanded portion of the L-shaped duct. The size of the separation bubble at the tip of the L-shaped duct created by the adverse pressure gradient is quite large for the laboratory condition and relatively small for the engine condition. Each rib was found to create two sets of recirculating flows, one just upstream of the rib because of the adverse pressure gradient induced by the rib and one just downstream of the rib because of flow separation from a sharp edge. These recirculating flows spiral from the ribs towards the exit of the L-shaped duct, and the spiraling brings cool fluid from the middle of the passage to the walls. Each pin fin was found to induce a pair of counter-rotating separated regions behind it and has horse-shoe vortices that wrap around it next to the top and bottom walls. The heat transfer is highest just upstream of the each rib, around the pin fins, and when the cooling fluid impinges on walls, and very low in the separated region next to the tip. ^ When there is rotation, Coriolis force creates a pair of counter-rotating vortices that bring the cooler fluid to the trailing wall in the inlet duct. Thus, the trailing wall has higher heat transfer than the leading wall. In the inlet duct, centrifugal buoyancy causes a massive flow separation on the leading wall. In the expanded portion of the L-shaped duct, the centrifugal-buoyancy-induced separation on the leading wall is limited to the region with the ribs, and the separation degenerates into a series of smaller spiraling separation bubbles, one between every set of consecutive ribs. On the leading and trailing walls, the ribs and the pin fins induce the same kind of flows as they did under non-rotating conditions. ^ Because of centrifugal-buoyancy-induced flow separation on the leading <b>face,</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer on the leading wall is 10 - 15 % lower than that on the trailing wall, which is not significant. The adverse effects of centrifugal buoyancy were mitigated because the separation bubbles between the ribs are spiraling from the side wall to the trailing-edge exit and are constantly supplied by new coolant. The heat transfer on the side and back walls is higher near the trailing wall because centrifugal buoyancy directed most of the coolant flow towards the trailing wall. The size of the separation bubble at the tip of the L-shaped duct essentially disappeared when there is rotation for both the lab and engine-relevant conditions. ...|$|E
