2500|$|Reed {{followed}} Transformer {{with the}} darker Berlin. Berlin {{is a concept}} album about two junkies in love in the city. The songs variously concern domestic violence ("Caroline Says I," [...] "Caroline Says II"), drug addiction ("How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>It</b> Feels"), adultery and prostitution ("The Kids"), and suicide ("The Bed"). Reed's late-1973 European tour, featuring dual lead guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, mixed his Berlin material with older numbers. Response to Berlin {{at the time of}} its release was decidedly negative, with Rolling Stone pronouncing it [...] "a disaster". Since then the album has been critically reevaluated, and in 2003 Rolling Stone included it in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.|$|E
2500|$|When Liu Bei {{expressed}} joy {{during a}} banquet in Fu County {{to celebrate his}} success, Pang Tong chided him, saying that [...] "celebrating the invasion of others' territory isn't what a man of ren (benevolence) should do". The drunk Liu Bei retorted angrily, [...] "King Wu of Zhou also rejoiced after his victory over King Zhou of Shang. Is he not {{an example of a}} man of ren? You're wrong, so get out now!" [...] After Pang Tong left, Liu Bei regretted what he said so he invited Pang back. Pang Tong returned to his seat and did not say anything, so Liu Bei asked, [...] "When that quarrel happened just now, whose fault <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was?" [...] Pang Tong replied, [...] "It was both yours and mine." [...] Liu Bei laughed and the banquet continued.|$|E
2500|$|Qiao Zhou asked Du Qiong, [...] "Zhou Shu {{once said}} that the 'something tall on the road' [...] refers {{to the state of}} Wei. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is so?" [...] Du Qiong replied, [...] "Wei (魏) also refers to either of the two viewing towers at each gate of the {{imperial}} palace. It faces the road and stands out as a very tall structure from a distance away. (Because Wei was also the name of an ancient state,) the sages decided {{to use it as a}} double entendre." [...] When Qiao Zhou sought clarification, Du Qiong further explained, [...] "The term cao (曹) was never used to refer to the positions held by government officials in ancient times. This practice only started in the Han dynasty: clerks are called shu cao (屬曹) and guards are called shi cao (侍曹). This is probably Heaven's will." ...|$|E

2500|$|At that time, Wu Zetian's son Li Dan (the former Emperor Ruizong) was crown prince, but Wu Zetian's nephews Wu Chengsi the Prince of Wei and Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang {{both had}} designs on the position, and {{repeatedly}} had their associates reason with Wu Zetian {{that there had}} never been an emperor who made someone of a different family name his heir. [...] Di, on the other hand, repeatedly argued to her that it is more proper for her to make her son her heir, and that Li Dan's brother Li Zhe the Prince of Luling, himself a former emperor that Wu Zetian removed in 684, be recalled to the capital, a suggestion echoed by fellow chancellors Wang Fangqing and Wang Jishan, and Wu Zetian began to agree. [...] On one occasion, Wu Zetian asked him, [...] "Last night I dreamed of a large parrot that had two broken wings. [...] What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> means?"

2500|$|On 24 November, Hannam, Hewett and {{the head}} of Eastbourne CID, Detective Inspector Pugh, searched Adams' house with a warrant issued (in Pugh's name) under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951. When told they were looking for, [...] "Morphine, Heroin, Pethidine and the like", Adams was surprised: [...] "Oh, that group. You will find none here. I haven't any. I very seldom ever use them", he said. When Hannam asked for Adams' Dangerous Drugs Register – the record of those ordered and used – Adams responded: [...] "I don't know what you mean. I keep no register." [...] He had not kept one since 1949. When shown a list of {{dangerous}} drugs he had prescribed Morrell, and asked who administered them, Adams said, [...] "I did nearly all. Perhaps the nurses gave some but mostly me" [...] – contradicting what the nurses' notebooks would show during his trial. Hannam then observed, [...] "Doctor, you prescribed for her 75 – 1/6 grains heroin tablets the day before she died." [...] Adams replied, [...] "Poor soul, she was in terrible agony. It was all used. I used them myself [...] <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is too much?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Heroine", {{with the}} refrain, I'm aching {{to see my}} heroine, has a celebrity influence, paying homage to Marilyn Monroe, while evoking Lord Byron. [...] "She Walks in Beauty like the night", the song's opening line, is {{the first line of}} a Byron poem. Anderson wrote the eulogy [...] "Daddy's Speeding", about a dream {{involving}} taking drugs with the late American actor James Dean. The slow-tempo song culminates with a build-up of feedback and white noise, depicting a car crash. Osman stated that this was an effort to replicate the sound of machinery using guitars. It was partly inspired by [...] "How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>It</b> Feels" [...] from Lou Reed's Berlin. The recurring theme of self-loathing is reflected in the ballad [...] "The Wild Ones", which tells of a dying relationship. Anderson considers this song to be his favourite single moment in Suede's history. Pitchfork agreed, saying it [...] "might be Suede's best single, its sweeping orchestration, vocals, and guitar parts coming together in fragile but perfect balance." [...] The main refrain was partly inspired by Jacques Brel's [...] "Ne me quitte pas". Here, Anderson alternates between tenor and falsetto. Anderson's voice is generally deeper compared to other Suede albums, where he sang in a higher register.|$|E

2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She {{had a bunch of}} different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her I wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E
