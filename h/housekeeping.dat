5|$|Essential genes include <b>Housekeeping</b> genes (critical {{for basic}} cell functions) {{as well as}} genes that are {{expressed}} at different times in the organisms development or life cycle. <b>Housekeeping</b> genes are used as experimental controls when analysing gene expression, since they are constitutively expressed at a relatively constant level.|$|E
5|$|Since then, as <b>housekeeping</b> {{becomes less}} and less {{important}} of a family role, the amount of advertisements portraying women solely as performing household tasks {{have been on the}} decline.|$|E
5|$|Wendy Oxenhorn, {{director}} of the Foundation, arranged for <b>housekeeping</b> and free medical care for Norman, as well as helping him plan for his future, providing back rent and negotiating with Norman's landlord. In {{the course of that}} <b>housekeeping,</b> in July 2002, Norman's rare tape of his jam session with Marley was located in his apartment and placed on auction, retrieving considerably above its estimated value when auctioned at $26,290. During the same <b>housekeeping</b> session, Norman rediscovered old notebooks containing his compositions. Producer Kerryn Tolhurst recorded Norman performing the songs on a tape recorder in his apartment, taking the tapes into the studio later to add parts by other musicians. Judy Collins, whose drummer Tony Beard contributed to the project, released the resultant album under her own Wildflower label in 2004. The project, titled Little Pieces, is the first album Norman has ever released with wide distribution. In 2006, Little Pieces won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} to also note that images of the family depend upon the specific source in which the image is found {{and the type of}} audience that the source aims to reach. For example, in a women’s magazine such as Good <b>Housekeeping,</b> one can expect to find women in the family portrayed solely as domestic housewives.|$|E
5|$|The library {{incorporates}} many {{energy and}} water saving design features such as rainwater harvesting for flushing water, computerized building management, use of local species in landscape design, and automatic lighting control. Low-emission interior finishes {{have been used to}} improve indoor air quality, and a green <b>housekeeping</b> policy seeks to reduce exposure of occupants to contaminants.|$|E
5|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% {{of the known}} phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important {{for the health of}} the intestinal tract. There are two types of functions in these range clusters: <b>housekeeping</b> and those specific to the intestine. The <b>housekeeping</b> gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patients’ gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ingredients}} of the BLT have existed for many years, {{there is little evidence}} of BLT sandwich recipes prior to 1900. In the 1903 Good <b>Housekeeping</b> Everyday Cook Book, a recipe for a club sandwich included bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a slice of turkey sandwiched between two slices of bread. Whilst the 1929 book Seven Hundred Sandwiches does include a section on bacon sandwiches, the recipes often include pickles and none contain tomato.|$|E
5|$|Anna Maria Rückerschöld (5 February 1725–25 May 1805), born Rücker, was a Swedish {{author who}} wrote several popular books on <b>housekeeping</b> and {{cooking in the}} late 18th and early 19th century. She was an {{advocate}} of women's right to a good education in household matters and propagated this view in public debate through an anonymous letter in 1770. Along with Cajsa Warg and other female cookbook authors, she was an influential figure in culinary matters in early modern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{what many}} outsiders believed, most {{residents}} of the Walled City behaved similarly to other Hong Kong natives. In response to difficult living conditions, the residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did <b>housekeeping,</b> while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The City's rooftops were an important gathering place, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school.|$|E
5|$|Spacecraft {{communications}} {{included a}} command subsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4MHz and a PCM narrow-band telemetry subsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86MHz, for spacecraft <b>housekeeping,</b> attitude, and sensor performance data. Video {{data from the}} three-camera RBV system was transmitted in both real-time and tape recorder modes at 2265.5MHz, while information from the MSS was constrained to a 20MHz radio-frequency bandwidth at 2229.5MHz.|$|E
5|$|The Good Huswifes Jewell is an English cookery book by the cookery and <b>housekeeping</b> writer Thomas Dawson, first {{published}} in 1585. It includes recipes for medicines as well as food. To the spices found in Medieval English cooking, the book adds herbs, especially parsley and thyme. Sugar is used {{in many of the}} dishes, along with now-unfamiliar ingredients like violets and rosewater.|$|E
5|$|The {{repertory}} of <b>housekeeping</b> instructions {{laid down}} by manuscripts like the Ménagier de Paris also include many details of overseeing correct preparations in the kitchen. Towards {{the onset of the}} early modern period, in 1474, the Vatican librarian Bartolomeo Platina wrote De honesta voluptate et valetudine ("On honourable pleasure and health") and the physician Iodocus Willich edited Apicius in Zurich in 1563.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the living}} quarters, the {{atmosphere}} resembled {{that of a}} college dormitory. <b>Housekeeping</b> and laundry services were provided, but the quarters were small and little entertainment was available. Television broadcasts were delayed two days {{because of the need}} to fly tapes from California, and most workers had to develop their own forms of entertainment. In the winter, some took to skiing or sightseeing; in the summer, some went hiking. In general, however, little time was available for recreation because of the long hours worked by most people.|$|E
5|$|Although in {{the past}} {{cardinal}} electors could be accompanied by attendants ("conclavists"), now only a nurse may accompany a cardinal who for reasons of ill-health, as confirmed by the Congregation of Cardinals, needs such assistance. The Secretary of the College of Cardinals, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, two Masters of Ceremonies, two officers of the Papal Sacristy and an ecclesiastic assisting the Dean of the College of Cardinals are also admitted to the conclave. Priests are available to hear confessions in different languages; two doctors are also admitted. Finally, a strictly limited number of servant staff are permitted for <b>housekeeping</b> and the preparing and serving of meals.|$|E
5|$|As campus residences {{accommodate}} just 6,400 {{students in}} all, the university guarantees housing only for undergraduates {{in their first}} year of study, while most upper-year and graduate students reside off-campus. Traditionally, the adjacent neighbourhoods of The Annex and Harbord Village are popular settling grounds for University of Toronto students, forming a distinct student quarter enclave. In 2004, the university purchased and converted a nearby hotel into the Chestnut Residence, which houses students from all colleges and faculties. There are also numerous fraternity houses and student housing cooperatives, where boarders pay reduced rent for assuming <b>housekeeping</b> duties.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept {{for the arrival of}} the rescue ship, cooking and <b>housekeeping</b> rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Warner Bros. {{released}} a film {{based on the}} book, starring Gary Cooper as Howard Roark, Patricia Neal as Dominique Francon, Raymond Massey as Gail Wynand, and Kent Smith as Peter Keating. Rand, who had previous experience as a screenwriter, was hired to adapt her own novel. The film was directed by King Vidor. It grossed $2.1million, $400,000 less than its production budget. Critics panned the movie. Negative reviews appeared in publications ranging from newspapers such as The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, to movie industry outlets such as Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, to magazines such as Time and Good <b>Housekeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pre-planning for a year, {{including}} {{ten months}} for production issues {{and two months}} for his character, was tiring for Aamir. As a first-time producer, he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months. Due {{to the lack of}} comfortable hotels in Bhuj, he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew. Security was set up and a special <b>housekeeping</b> team was brought {{to take care of the}} crew's needs. Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers. Initially, they did not want to part with their equipment, but after much coaxing, they gave in. They then travelled to different parts of the country to collect the musical instruments used in that day and era.|$|E
5|$|The {{company began}} as a {{development}} team that created software called Picture This Home in the mid-1990s for Autodesk in San Rafael, California. The program allowed people to virtually preview room decoration projects before any work began. Users could create virtual rooms, change walls and arrange furniture, and create photo-realistic renderings of completed designs. Picture This Home was awarded the Good <b>Housekeeping</b> Seal of Approval. In 1998, the software and its team of 40developers were sold to Broderbund, which was owned by The Learning Company, a subsidiary of Mattel Inc. Broderbund eventually spun Picture This Home off as a company called GoodHome.com in June 1999. The company received $30 million in venture capital from Hearst Interactive Media.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} contains, {{in the west}} section, the former dining room and kitchen. The {{openings}} in the wall between the billiard room and the garden room had been blocked up but the rooms were reconnected in the 19th century under Sir William Henry Cope, uncovering an original doorway with a four-centred pointed arch. Cope applied arabesque patterns to the panelling in the garden room, which he had traced when two of the bedrooms were being repainted. The billiard room has a hidden door leading to the original entrance {{on the north side}} of the house through the Foxley gatehouse into the interior courtyard, and several doorways remain in the kitchen and <b>housekeeping</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|When the Welsh {{family moved}} to Los Angeles, the Earps {{accepted}} an invitation to stay {{with them for a}} while in their top-floor apartment until the Earps found a place to rent. After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh's daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little <b>housekeeping</b> or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister Alma were concerned about the care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, she still did not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals.|$|E
5|$|Bursać {{was born}} on 2August 1920 {{in the village of}} Kamenica, near Drvar in the region of Bosanska Krajina, the {{north-western}} sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina (then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed as Yugoslavia in 1929). The Drvar area was inhabited primarily by ethnic Serbs, with Bosnian Muslims and Croats forming less than four percent of the population. Bursać was the oldest of five children of stonemason Nikola Bursać and his wife, Joka, who mostly raised sheep and cattle on their family farm. Like other village girls, Bursać did not go to school—only the boys attended elementary school in Drvar. A shepherdess until age fourteen, she later helped her mother with <b>housekeeping</b> and agricultural work. Bursać became skilled at weaving, spinning, knitting and embroidery before completing a six-month tailoring course in Drvar.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sharma et al. {{presented}} a comprehensive analysis of transcription at single-nucleotide resolution by differential RNA-seq that confirmed the known acid induction of major virulence loci, {{such as the}} urease (ure) operon or the cag pathogenicity island (see below). More importantly, this study identified a total of 1,907 transcriptional start sites, 337 primary operons, and 126 additional suboperons, and 66 monocistrons. Until 2010, only about 55 transcriptional start sites (TSSs) were known in this species. Notably, 27% of the primary TSSs are also antisense TSSs, indicating that—similar to E. coli—antisense transcription occurs across the entire H. pylori genome. At least one antisense TSS is associated with about 46% of all open reading frames, including many <b>housekeeping</b> genes. Most (about 50%) of the 5' UTRs are 20–40 nucleotides (nt) in length and support the AAGGag motif located about 6 nt (median distance) upstream of start codons as the consensus Shine–Dalgarno sequence in H. pylori.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, Chyna {{became the}} first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring tournament. She was also the first female to be the number one {{contender}} for the WWF Championship, but lost the spot to Mankind before SummerSlam in August. Later that year, Laurer became a fan favorite again during her long feud with Jeff Jarrett. At Unforgiven, she had a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jarrett, which she lost. She defeated Jarrett for the title at No Mercy in his last WWF match, a Good <b>Housekeeping</b> match, on October 17 at No Mercy, in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship. She also gained the services of his valet, Miss Kitty. Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman. His contract had expired on October 16, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view. If he had not appeared, the WWF would have been criticized for false advertising, and the lineage of the title would have been broken.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Star Tribune, Alexis McKinnis {{recommended}} the device {{for a woman}} having difficulty achieving orgasm. She wrote that for thirty-years a multitude of females had {{found it to be}} an assured way to reach orgasm. McKinnis {{recommended the}} Magic Wand again in a subsequent column as a Valentine's Day gift, and wrote that it faced little competition due to its basic construction, efficiency, intensity, and reliability. Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was among the highest-demanded vibrators in the United States. Rubel stated that approximately ninety-percent of females are able to achieve orgasm with the Magic Wand. A panel of users arranged by Good <b>Housekeeping</b> tried the Magic Wand for relief of lumbar discomfort and were unimpressed with the results. Self Magazine observed in 2010 that the device's appreciation had become a cultural phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Alice's birth {{prompted}} {{her parents}} to find a larger family home. Buckingham Palace was not equipped with the private apartments that Victoria's growing family needed, including suitable nurseries. Therefore, in 1844, Victoria and Albert purchased Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a family holiday home. Alice's education was devised by her father and his close friend, Baron Stockmar. At Osborne, Alice and her siblings were taught practical skills such as <b>housekeeping,</b> cooking, gardening and carpentry, as well as daily lessons in English, French and German. Victoria and Albert favoured a monarchy based on family values; Alice and her siblings, who wore middle class clothing on a daily basis, slept in sparsely furnished bedrooms with little heating. Alice was fascinated with the world outside the Royal Household; at Balmoral, where she seemed happiest, she visited the tenants living and working on the estate. On one occasion, she escaped from her governess at the chapel at Windsor Castle and sat in a public pew, so she could better understand {{people who were not}} strict adherents to royal protocol. In 1854, during the Crimean War, the eleven-year-old Alice toured London hospitals for wounded soldiers with her mother and her eldest sister. She was the most emotionally sensitive of her siblings and was sympathetic to other people's burdens, possessing a sharp tongue and an easily triggered temper. In her childhood, Alice formed a close relationship with her brother, the Prince of Wales, and her eldest sister, The Princess Royal. Victoria's marriage to Prince Frederick of Prussia in 1858 greatly upset her.|$|E
