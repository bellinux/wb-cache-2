40|$|The Enhanced Oceanic Operations Human-In-The-Loop In-Trail Procedure (ITP) Validation Simulation Study {{investigated}} {{the viability of}} an ITP designed to enable oceanic <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> changes that would not otherwise be possible. Twelve commercial airline pilots with current oceanic experience flew a series of simulated scenarios involving either standard or ITP <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> change maneuvers and provided subjective workload ratings, assessments of ITP validity and acceptability, and objective performance measures associated with the appropriate selection, request, and execution of ITP <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> change maneuvers. In the majority of scenarios, subject pilots correctly assessed the traffic situation, selected an appropriate response (i. e., either a standard <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> change request, an ITP request, or no request), and executed their selected <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> change procedure, if any, without error. Workload ratings for ITP maneuvers were acceptable and not substantially higher than for standard <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> change maneuvers, and, {{for the majority of}} scenarios and subject pilots, subjective acceptability ratings and comments for ITP were generally high and positive. Qualitatively, the ITP was found to be valid and acceptable. However, the error rates for ITP maneuvers were higher than for standard <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> changes, and these errors may have design implications for both the ITP and the study's prototype traffic display. These errors and their implications are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The 707 cruised at <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 310 {{for about}} two hours, after which it was cleared for descent to <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 110. <b>Flight</b> <b>level</b> 110 was reached at {{approximately}} 09:23, and clearance was granted to begin descent towards a target of <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 70.

50|$|SHK {{concluded}} that the incident took place because the Gripen pilot inadvertently went below his assigned <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> and {{ended up on the}} same <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> at the passenger aircraft. SHK placed the root cause of this with the lack of adequate routines in the Swedish Air Force for receiving and reading back instructions from air traffic control. A contributary cause of the incident was said to be a lack of support systems in the Gripen to help the pilot with the aforementioned task. Such a system is currently being introduced in the Swedish Air Force Gripens. The system will alert the pilot if the flight deviates from the assigned <b>flight</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R
