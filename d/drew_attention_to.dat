5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
30|$|Attunement to noticing {{patterns}} and structure {{is a key}} part of the ‘looking for structure’ strand. <b>Attention</b> <b>to</b> juxtaposing examples in ways that <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> variations, invariances, and connections between examples has been argued as one way to develop this attunement (Watson and Mason 2006). Careful sequencing can <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> ideas like ‘doing and undoing’ and the regularities within sets of related examples in ways that <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> underlying mathematical structure.|$|R

5|$|The Metropolitan Police, City of London Police, {{and private}} {{organisations such as}} the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee were {{involved}} in the search for the killer or killers. Despite extensive inquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded identification and capture. The murders <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who committed the crimes has captured public imagination to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{is named}} after Mr. John Kimber, student, teacher, and {{collector}} who lost his life during an expedition to Central Australia in 1964. Originally it was described with the name Kimberia. Dr. N. H. Ludbrook <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that the}} name Kimberia is preoccupied by Kimberia Cotton and Woods, a turtle subgenus. Accordingly, the new name Kimberella was proposed by Mary Wade in 1972.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{was completed}} as planned, and provided an important link of continuous motorway between Greater London and the South Coast ports. Nevertheless, the protests attracted interest {{from the national}} media, and <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> this form of campaigning. Subsequent road schemes were altered to take greater account of the environment or cancelled altogether. Several protesters at Twyford Down subsequently went on to form campaign {{groups such as the}} Campaign for Better Transport.|$|E

5|$|Total <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the unexplained {{absence from}} his post of the Gulf {{employee}} whose duty it was to supervise the unloading from the on-shore control room. The individual concerned had left the control room some time before the trouble started (see below) and his absence {{may have contributed to}} a lack of urgency in responding to events. Exactly what happened that night has never been established beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|As large {{consumers}} of fossil fuels, First World countries <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based}} on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E

5|$|By 23BC, {{some of the}} un-Republican {{implications}} {{were becoming}} apparent concerning the settlement of 27BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his de facto dominance over the Roman political system, and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters– Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> a lack of support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis {{without regard to the}} risks.|$|E
5|$|Revelation is {{the ninth}} studio album by American Christian rock band Third Day, {{released}} on July 29, 2008. The album {{was produced by}} Howard Benson, who had decided {{to work with the}} band after rock singer Chris Daughtry <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> lead singer Mac Powell's vocal ability. Although they were initially uncomfortable working with Benson, Third Day achieved a positive working relationship with Benson, who felt that their different religious beliefs made them challenge each other in a way reflected in the record.|$|E

5|$|The Macdonald Liberals easily won {{re-election}} in 1949 and 1953, but the Conservatives made steady gains under Robert Stanfield, their new leader. The Conservatives for example, <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> kickback schemes under which brewing companies, wineries and distilleries {{contributed to the}} Liberal party {{in exchange for the}} right to sell their products in government liquor stores. The Liberals seemed secure against such allegations however, {{as long as they were}} led by the popular Angus L. Macdonald. However, Macdonald suffered a slight heart attack on April 11, 1954, and was admitted to hospital where he died in his sleep two nights later, just four months before his 64th birthday.|$|E
5|$|The Sprawl trilogy was {{followed}} by the 1990 novel The Difference Engine, an alternative history novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with Bruce Sterling. Set in a technologically advanced Victorian era Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991 and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1992, and its success <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the nascent steampunk literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the murders and of the victims <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the poor living {{conditions}} in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In the two decades after the murders, {{the worst of the}} slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites. The Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street was frequented by {{at least one of the}} victims and was the focus of such tours for many years. In 2015, the Jack the Ripper Museum opened in east London.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the fact that those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked an {{election}} controversy when it <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Warren's Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directory entries from 1986 to 1995, which listed {{her as a}} minority professor. According to the AALS, the directory was compiled by information supplied by law school deans, based on questionnaires filled out by individual teachers. Warren stated that she had self-identified as having Native American ancestry {{in order to meet}} others with a similar background. Harvard Law School had listed her as a minority professor in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren said that she was unaware of this until she read about it in a newspaper during the 2012 election.|$|E
