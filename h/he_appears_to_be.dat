5|$|Almost {{certainly}} {{a native of}} Angus, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a descendant of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William I of Scotland, through an illegitimate son whom Earl David settled {{in the area around}} Brechin.|$|E
5|$|Another figure, to {{the right}} of Małachowski, is being carried; he is Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha (5), marshal of the Lithuanian {{confederation}} and the second Sejm marshal. He is dressed in more traditional Polish clothing. Between Małachowski and Sapieha, the head of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (6), a well-known writer, is visible. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carrying Sapieha. The other figure carrying Sapieha, to his right, is Michał Zabiełło (7).|$|E
5|$|Francis's disciple, {{secretary}} and confessor Brother Leo acts as eyewitness. He {{is dressed in}} sombre colours and rendered in a more compact manner than Francis; crouched as if sunk into the pictorial space in the far right of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and his successors. Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resting or asleep.|$|E
60|$|The child looked puzzled. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trying <b>to</b> {{recollect}} something.|$|R
60|$|But Cetewayo said nothing, for <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{thinking}} of something else.|$|R
60|$|At length, after a pause, {{during which}} <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{thinking}} deeply, <b>he</b> spoke.|$|R
5|$|General Eusebio Canales (alias Chamarrita or Prince of Arms) {{is forced}} into exile after {{being accused of}} the murder of Colonel José Parrales Sonriente. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{organizing}} a guerrilla attack on the President, but dies of a broken heart after reading a false news report detailing his daughter's wedding to Miguel Angel Face, at which the President was apparently present. The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being taken advantage of by a doctor who visited their ailing mother. This episode demonstrates that corruption and malice exist not just in the capital city but also in rural villages.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the single}} {{was never a}} {{physical}} CD release, artwork was created for it. The artwork featured the headless man who is otherwise seen throughout the releases for other singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, however on this cover, the area where his head would be is a fireball, and <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> holding a briefcase while walking down the hallway of a hotel, another common theme throughout the artwork for the album. Unlike the last two singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, the artwork doesn't follow the picture-in-picture theme.|$|E
5|$|Brandon {{invites the}} Dashwoods and the Middletons {{to a party}} on his estate at Delaford, but before the trip can take place, he is called away on urgent business. Willoughby {{requests}} a private audience with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne, leading them both to expect that he will propose. However, Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London, and {{he may not be}} able to return to Devonshire for at least a year. Shortly after Willoughby's departure, Edward comes to visit, and the Dashwoods notice that <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unhappy and distant. Mrs. Jennings' nieces, Lucy (Anna Madeley) and Anne Steele (Daisy Haggard), come to Barton Park. When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars, Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years, news that devastates Elinor. Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.|$|E
60|$|Dr Noble {{looked at}} him with much surprise, but did not reply. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paralysed.|$|R
60|$|Wally Mason {{started at}} the sound of her voice. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deep in {{thoughts}} of his own.|$|R
60|$|Penrose {{was perhaps}} {{deficient}} {{in the sense}} of humor. Instead of being amused, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anxious for more information.|$|R
5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully {{in the first part of}} the game with finding the clues to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E
5|$|Keen gets to {{the girl}} first but loses her in a daring raid by Zamani's forces. Now aware of Keen, Zamani attacks her husband, Tom, in their home, gravely {{wounding}} him. Keen notes a stamp on the man’s hand and deduces the attack {{will take place at}} a zoo. Reddington briefly escapes custody to meet with Zamani, revealing that unbeknownst to the FBI, he masterminded the ploy, as well as the attack on Tom. Reddington removes the tracking device and places it with Zamani, which helps the FBI track down and kill the latter. Keen finds the daughter and a bomb in her backpack. Reddington calls in a clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb, who then escapes with it. Reddington tells Elizabeth that her husband, with whom she is trying to adopt a baby, is not what <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{considering}} the point as they edged {{back under the}} lee of the deck-house, and the mate grinned.|$|R
60|$|The skipper sighed wearily and {{wondered}} whether Mr. Glover {{was such an}} adept at silly remarks as <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|R
60|$|The man {{drew his}} arm away. Though she could {{scarcely}} see his face, <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> looking down upon her gravely.|$|R
5|$|Trevor is {{depicted}} as a sociopath in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very insecure about {{having grown up in}} Canada, and takes offence to people mocking his accent. Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems to care about people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother, Ashley Butler, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy, Lamar Davis, Ron, Lester, Wade and Franklin Clinton. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his silence on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.|$|E
25|$|Zoroaster {{is rarely}} {{depicted}} as {{looking directly at}} the viewer; instead, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching. Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard, this along with other factors bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Clancy Brown as Rawhide, arguably Buckaroo's lieutenant. Plays piano. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{killed by}} a Red Lectroid's {{poisoned}} barb, but the 'Pinky Carruthers' fact overlay feature on the DVD states that he was put into suspended animation until a cure is found.|$|E
25|$|In test cricket, Ijaz Ahmed {{was much}} {{significant}} with his bat. Though <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unreliable often, Ijaz scored 12 test centuries.|$|R
50|$|Dole {{delivered}} the most remembered {{line of the}} debate when <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blaming the Democratic Party for all of America's wars.|$|R
60|$|I {{had barely}} time to notice this, before we reached my lodgings. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unwilling <b>to</b> follow {{me into the}} house.|$|R
25|$|Michael Grant Terry as Wendell Bray (seasons 4–12): He is Dr. Brennan's top {{scholarship}} intern. He dates Angela briefly during season five. In season nine, he {{is diagnosed}} with Ewing's sarcoma. After seeking treatment, <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in full remission {{and continues to}} work at the lab.|$|E
25|$|While Juvenal's mode of satire {{has been}} noted from antiquity for its wrathful scorn toward all representatives of social deviance, some {{politically}} progressive scholars such as, W. S. Anderson and later S. M. Braund, have attempted to defend his work {{as that of a}} rhetorical persona (mask), taken up by the author to critique the very attitudes <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exhibiting in his works.|$|E
25|$|He is {{slightly}} shorter than {{his best friend}} Butt-Head, although <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the same height when viewed at a distance because of his hairstyle. Beavis works as a fry cook at the (fictional) fast food restaurant Burger World and once defiantly revealed {{that he is a}} fan of the rock band Bon Jovi to Butt-Head, who dislikes the band and its leader Jon Bon Jovi.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite pleased <b>to</b> sing it, for {{he came up}} at once, and {{sat down}} to the piano without another word.|$|R
50|$|His {{early works}} in Antwerp show a {{resemblance}} {{to the work of}} Jacob Marrel, with whom <b>he</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in correspondence while Marrel was in Frankfurt.|$|R
50|$|In April 2007, Henry's transplanted kidney failed, {{and he went}} to {{hospital}} to have it removed. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recovering well, but died of internal hemorrhaging.|$|R
25|$|Prince Diponegoro stands, defiant, {{in front}} of Lieutenant General Hendrik Merkus de Kock {{in front of}} the colonial officer's mansion. He wears a green turban, white tabard over pantaloons, and a jacket; around his waist is a golden belt, to which prayer beads are attached, and over his {{shoulder}} is a shawl. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> struggling to control his anger– as would be expected from Javanese gentry– while the Europeans' eyes are static and avoid the eyes of others.|$|E
25|$|Field {{stayed with}} a children's company until 1613, his twenty-sixth year. <b>He</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the only one}} of the boy actors of 1600 to remain with the Blackfriars troupe when, in 1609, Philip Rosseter and Robert Keysar assumed control of the company. In this company, he {{performed}} in the theatre in Whitefriars and, frequently, at court, in plays such as Beaumont and Fletcher's The Coxcomb. From the latter years of this period come the first of his plays: A Woman is a Weathercock and The Honest Man's Fortune (the latter with Fletcher and Philip Massinger).|$|E
25|$|Miller, in one {{spirited}} over, {{altered the}} whole {{course of the}} game. With the third ball of that eventful over he trapped Hutton with his legs {{in front of the}} wicket trying to defend against an inswinger which moved in late. The value of Miller's bowling lies wholly and solely in its surprise element. Just when <b>he</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> well {{under the control of the}} batsman he comes to light with a ball that can upset anyone...with the sixth ball of the over Compton played-on before he had opened his score. The seventh and eighth balls did everything else but put paid to Parkhouse's account. Miller deserved every bit of the thunderous applause which the big crowd handed him when the over was completed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forty!" [...] {{said the}} young man promptly. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rich, and <b>was</b> bidding more <b>to</b> tease the old countryman than because he desired the knife.|$|R
6000|$|... "They might {{set fire}} to the cabins," [...] added Bill Isbel. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the gloomiest of the Isbel faction. There was {{something}} on his mind.|$|R
50|$|Bruni's final start {{was in the}} Doncaster Cup at the St Leger meeting. <b>He</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{struggling}} {{from the}} start and pulled up lame in the straight.|$|R
