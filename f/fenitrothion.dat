25|$|<b>Fenitrothion</b> {{is a kind}} of {{organophosphate}} and it {{can affect}} the development of reproductive system of male rats. Treatment with <b>fenitrothion</b> to male rats causes regression of androgen-dependent organ weights because <b>fenitrothion</b> is a potent competitive androgen receptor antagonist. Its effect on SDN-POA is different between male rats and female rats. In male rats, prenatal exposure to <b>fenitrothion</b> causes significantly increase of the volume of SDN-POA; whereas, in female rats, prenatal exposure to <b>fenitrothion</b> causes significantly decrease of the volume of SDN-POA. One possible explanation is that <b>fenitrothion</b> can alter the activity of aromatase, which then alters the level of estrogens converted by it from androgens and finally alters the volume of SDN-POA.|$|E

Habitat clearing, fragmentation, landscape degradation, and fires which occur too frequently and extensively, are also threats to the stripe-faced dunnarts habitat. Predation by feral cats and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) also directly impacts the species population. Removal of fallen timber also threatens the species as it relies on it for shelter form the heat and predator, as well forages for invertebrates that may live in or under woody debris. The dunnarts are very sensitives to the organophosphorus pesticide <b>fenitrothion</b> which at sub-lethal intoxication can cause lethargy and temporary immobilisation, increasing the risk of predation.

50|$|In Japan, {{scientists}} and officers {{think that the}} mainstream of prevent this disease is removing sawyers, the vector of the nematode. The sawyers like to spawn at dying or dead pine trees, so they advise to cut down these trees until next spring.

50|$|The LUBILOSA team {{continued}} to look for opportunities to test Metarhizium against locusts and grasshoppers. Field trials were conducted against Senegalese grasshoppers, African rice grasshoppers (Hieroglyphus daganensis), variegated grasshoppers, Sahelian tree locusts (Anacridium melanorhodon), brown locusts and desert locusts. These trials demonstrated that Metarhizium at a dosage of 50 g/ha could reduce grasshopper populations and those of tree locusts by 80-90% within two to three weeks. Population level control was more difficult to achieve with other locusts, but a significant effect was demonstrated on hopper bands notwithstanding the great difficulties in tracking individual bands. Some trials against Senegalese grasshoppers included the chemical insecticide <b>fenitrothion</b> for comparison. Because of its rather short persistence, this chemical {{turned out to be}} much less effective than commonly believed. It was highly effective in producing an immediate sharp reduction in population densities, but continued hatching and remigration into the treated plots caused these densities to start increasing again after less than a week, until they reached or exceeded the original levels after about two to three weeks. Metarhizium, on the other hand, reduced population levels at a slower rate, but maintained low levels for at least one and a half months. The half-life of its spores on the vegetation was estimated at more than 7 days under rainy season conditions in the Sahel and, of course, some conidia must survive between seasons.|$|E

Metabolism of the pesticide was examined in young seedlings with OC 14 H 3 labelled <b>fenitrothion.</b> <b>Fenitrothion</b> {{was shown to}} be detoxified by dealkylation in white pine via a glutathione dependent S-alkyl transferase enzyme to form desmethyl <b>fenitrothion</b> and S-methyl glutathione.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Fenitrothion</b> residue {{is found}} {{primarily}} in soil, {{water and food}} products {{and can lead to}} a variety of toxic effects on the immune, hepatobiliary and hematological systems. However, the effects of <b>fenitrothion</b> on the male reproductive system remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of <b>fenitrothion</b> on the sperm and testes of male Sprague-Dawley rats. METHODS: A 20 mg/kg dose of <b>fenitrothion</b> was administered orally by gavages for 28 consecutive days. Blood sample was obtained by cardiac puncture and dissection of the testes and cauda epididymis was performed to obtain sperm. The effects of <b>fenitrothion</b> on the body and organ weight, biochemical and oxidative stress, sperm characteristics, histology and ultrastructural changes in the testes were evaluated. RESULTS: <b>Fenitrothion</b> significantly decreased the body weight gain and weight of the epididymis compared with the control group. <b>Fenitrothion</b> also decreased plasma cholinesterase activity compared with the control group. <b>Fenitrothion</b> altered the sperm characteristics, such as sperm concentration, sperm viability and normal sperm morphology, compared with the control group. Oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, total glutathione and glutathione S-transferase, were significantly increased and superoxide dismutase activity was significantly decreased in the fenitrothion-treated group compared with the control group. The histopathological and ultrastructural examination of the testes of the fenitrothion-treated group revealed alterations corresponding with the biochemical changes compared with the control group.

We hypothesize that <b>fenitrothion</b> prevented normal mitotic divisional processes from occurring. Uninhibited biomolecular synthesis resulted in an accumulation of macromolecules and subsequent cell weight augmentation. The ecological implications of the observed effects were discussed.

40|$|A {{biocompatible}} nano TiO 2 /nafion composite modified glassy {{carbon electrode}} {{was developed for}} the detection of <b>fenitrothion.</b> This composite electrode was characterized by SEM, XRD, UV–visible, FTIR, TGA and cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry and amperometry were used {{for the detection of}} <b>fenitrothion.</b> Such modified electrode produced high sensing current {{which is one of the}} promising characteristics of the electroanalytical sensor. The linear relationship between sensing current and concentration is obtained in differential pulse voltammetry technique for the <b>fenitrothion</b> concentration ranging from 0. 2 to 4 lM with LOD and LOQ of 0. 0866 and 0. 2889 lM respectively. The peak currents were reproducible with the relative standard deviation of 5. 1...|$|E
40|$|Field {{strains of}} Tribolium castaneum, Rhyzopertha dominica, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, Sitophilus oryzae and S. zeamais were studied for their {{response}} to lindane, malathion and <b>fenitrothion.</b> Bioassay tests were conducted using the insecticide-impregnated filter paper method according to the standard technique recommended by F. A. O. The synergist triphenyl phospate was used to check for malathion specific resistance. Several strains of T. castaneum were resistant to lindane and malathion, with specific malathion resistance, R. dominica were susceptible to lindane but resistant to malathion and <b>fenitrothion,</b> O. surina mensis were diagnosed resistant to the three compounds tested. The last two species were non-malathion specific resistant. All Sitophilus spp. strains tested were susceptible to lindane, malathion and <b>fenitrothion...</b>|$|E
40|$|The three {{electrode}} system {{was used to}} detect the pesticide <b>fenitrothion</b> (C 9 H 12 NO 5 PS. MW= 277. 24) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV). The working electrode was mercury immobilized on a carbon nanotube paste electrode (Hg-CNTPE). At the optimized condition, the limit of detection (LoD) was 0. 6 ppt (2. 16 × 10 - 12 M), and the relative standard deviation was 0. 035 % (n= 15). And there is more sensitive in detecting <b>fenitrothion</b> than common type carbon nanotube paste electrode. When it was implanted into the brain of live fish (carp), the existence of <b>fenitrothion</b> was measured without any destruction or damage of tissue...|$|E
