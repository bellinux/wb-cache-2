40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 90 - 91) The {{ever increasing}} number of organizations with international operations, {{and the necessity of}} accumulating financial information about the entire business controlled and operated?? by this type of enterprise, introduces a unique problem: translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries. The problem of translation is magnified by the diversity of accounting standards and methods currently in use throughout the world. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), currently the most authoritative rule-making body of the accounting profession in the United States, issued Statement No. 8 in an attempt to set accounting standards for <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>translation.</b> The investors in multinational organizations need a more realistic representation of foreign earnings capacity than that provided by the temporal method of accounting for <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>translation</b> proposed by the FASB. The temporal method presents a serious problem for investors in that it ignores the financial relationships as they exist in foreign environments. The primary objective and the purpose of this thesis is to search for, investigate, and develop a useful method of translation of foreign currency financial statements for use by investors and to illustrate the application of this method. The proposed method, while not an absolute or perfect translation method under all circumstances, is the most theoretically sound of the currently available methods for use by investors because it recognizes and maintains the financial relationships as they exist in foreign environments.

Basic assumptions of a new <b>Foreign</b> <b>Currency</b> Act of Feb. 15, 1989 is the principle according to which the duty to obtain a permit to enter into a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transaction is required only in matters expressly stated in the Act. It means that the Act introduces freedom of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transactions in relations indifferent {{from the point of view}} of economic and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> interests of the State. Besides, the new law provides for statutory guaranties of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> property rights. However, it also imposes on economic units the duty to resell to the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> banks part of those units' revenues in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The Act introduces also <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> auctions, open for all economic units. The auction price of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> is to be shaped by supply/demand rules.

The permit is necessary also in case of taking Polish currency and Polish securities abroad. A new solution is the provision allowing the retired persons who receive their pensions from foreign insurance companies to collect part of their allowances in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The new Law, although not free from defects, is a step in the right direction.

40|$|The New Zealand {{standard}} on <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>translation</b> (FRS- 21), similar to {{standards in the}} US, Australia, and Canada and the International Accounting Standard (IAS- 21), requires the classification of foreign operations for translation purposes into two mutually exclusive types: integrated or independent. In judging whether a foreign operation is either integrated or independent, the accounting standard requires the evaluation of five qualitative factors. The standard neither describes the judgement process nor identifies {{the relative importance of}} the determining factors. It has been asserted that the lack of clarity in the {{standard on}} <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>translation</b> may yield dissimilar results for firms whose circumstances are similar and consequently may reduce the comparability of financial statements across firms. Using a repeated measures design, this paper examines the judgement of preparers of financial statements (New Zealand financial controllers) in determining the designation of foreign operations for translation purposes. The results indicate that the relative importance of the determining factors is marginally unequal. No support is found for the assertion that the use of qualitative factors in accounting standards results in dissimilar judgements (lack of consensus) across respondents. Further, the results show that the subjects demonstrated consistency and self-insight in their judgements. Further, the results indicate that the judgements of respondents are not biased toward either classification of foreign operation. This may suggest that the observed bias may be motivated by economic factors rather than the outcome of using the qualitative cues in the accounting standard. When the respondents were debriefed, several of them identified ‘managerial independence’ as another determining factor that has not been included in the NZ standard...|$|E

40|$|Policy {{makers have}} long been {{concerned}} that adjustments to retained earnings might give rise to unwarranted differences across income numbers of adjusting and nonadjusting firms. Researchers of financial markets, meanwhile, have generated a body of evidence showing that markets set security prices using an information set broader than, and superior to, accounting measurements of net income. This evidence suggests that markets are capable of pricing securities efficiently even if adjustments to retained earnings {{have given rise to}} unwarranted differences across income numbers. ^ This dissertation compared cumulative market returns observed in the two years after adjustments to retained earnings with contemporary changes in net income that were not attributable to economy and industry effects. Independent comparisons were performed with 1, 026 observations associated with seven types of adjustments. On the assumption that markets do price securities efficiently, the comparisons may provide a basis for judging, normatively, the appropriateness of post-adjustment income numbers. ^ These comparisons provided evidence of (1) full compatibility following adjustments for compensated absences and for SFAS No. 52 <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>translation,</b> (2) partial compatibility following adjustments for oil and gas exploration and events of prior period, and (3) incompatibility following adjustments for lease commitments, poolings of interests, and SFAS No. 8 <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>translation.</b> ^ The results of these comparisons appeared to support three major conclusions: First, the security returns generated by efficient financial markets may be useful as a basis for evaluating the relevance of alternative measurements of net income. Second, compatibility between market returns and income numbers probably cannot be achieved until accounting policy makers adopt the concept of 2 ̆ 2 comprehensive income. 2 ̆ 2 Third, the poolings of interests method of accounting for certain business combinations may create a conflict between interests of managers and shareholders, and that conflict may be sufficiently serious as to justify the method 2 ̆ 7 s termination. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} firm- and country-level {{determinants}} {{of the currency}} denomination of small business loans. We first model the choice of loan currency in a framework which features a trade-off between lower cost of debt {{and the risk of}} firm-level distress costs, and also examines the impact of information asymmetry between banks and firms. When <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> funds come at a lower interest rate, all <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> earners as well as those local currency earners with high revenues and low distress costs choose <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans. When the banks have imperfect information on the currency and level of firms revenues, even more local earners switch to <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans, as they do not bear the full cost of the corresponding credit risk. We then test the implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries. The survey contains details on 3, 105 recent bank loans. At the firm level, our findings suggest that firms with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> income and assets are more likely to borrow in a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> In contrast, firm-level distress costs and financial transparency affect the currency denomination only weakly. At the country level, the interest rate advantages of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> funds and the exchange rate volatility do not explain the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing in our sample. However, foreign bank presence, weak corporate governance and the absence of capital controls encourage <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing.

However, the empirical analysis of profits and return on equity provided little support for this hypothesis. Instead, there were indications of a less conservative accounting treatment in the Swedish accounts compared with US GAAP.
