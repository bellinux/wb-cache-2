The conventional method {{spends most of}} the design time on nonlinear analysis. The NROESL algorithm makes the <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> load cases for each response and repeatedly performs linear response optimization and uses them as multiple loading conditions. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> loads are defined as the loads in linear analysis, which generate the same response fields as those in non-linear analysis. The algorithm is validated for the convergence and the optimality. The NROESL algorithm is applied to several structural problems with geometric and/or material nonlinearity. Conventional optimization with sensitivity analysis using the finite difference method is also applied to the same examples. The results of the optimizations are compared. The proposed NROESL method {{is found to be}} very efficient and good solutions are derived...|$|R

The seismic response of building structures can be estimated through utilization {{of a variety of}} analysis methods that range from simple <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> analysis to complex nonlinear dynamic analysis. The traditional approach is to employ <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> analysis methods, while current design practice is moving toward an increased emphasis on the nonlinear analysis method. The Egyptian code provisions for building seismic design adopt the traditional approach of <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> load method as the main method for evaluating seismic actions and recommend the response spectrum method for nonsymmetrical buildings. This study aims to evaluate the Egyptian code provisions for the seismic design of moment-resistant frame multi-story building through using nonlinear time history analysis. The analysis procedures are evaluated for their ability to predict deformation demands in terms of inter-story drifts, potential failure mechanisms and story shear force demands.

30|$|The dynamic {{resistance}} of timber joints {{has been discussed}} primarily by converting dynamic forces into <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> forces as products of given mass and input accelerations [7]. This simple conversion is convenient for practical design, however, the actual dynamic behavior is more complicated. A principal incompatibility between actual {{dynamic resistance}} and <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> resistance is frequency dependence in dynamic response. The current design codes in Japan provide design procedures that take into consideration this frequency dependence related to the load-deformation characteristics of entire structures or principal structural elements [8]. Another important behavior of timber joints under dynamic forces is the low-cyclic bending fatigue failure of metal fasteners. The low-cyclic bending fatigue failure, which also is frequency dependent, has occasionally been observed in shaking table tests of full-scale wooden structures and structural elements, however, this observation has not been discussed in detail until now.|$|R
50|$|Statnamic testing {{works by}} {{accelerating}} a mass upward {{that in turn}} imparts a load onto the foundation pile below the Statnamic device. The load is applied and removed smoothly resulting in load application of 100 to 200 milliseconds. This is 30 to 40 times the duration of dynamic pile load testing. As {{the duration of the}} loading is relatively long, piles less than 40m in length remain in compression throughout resulting in negligible stress wave effects and potentially simpler analysis. For foundation design it is necessary to derive the <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> load-settlement curve from the Statnamic data. The simplest form of Statnamic analysis used to obtain <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> pile response is known as the unloading point method (UPM) The UPM analysis method was conceived to be simple and based on measured results alone (Middendorp et al., 1992).|$|R
30|$|Building code {{restrictive}} seismic design {{provisions and}} building system type and configuration have remarkable implications on the seismic performance of reinforced concrete moment-framed structures. The specifications permit the designer to utilize {{a variety of}} methods for seismic analysis that range from simple <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> analysis to complex nonlinear dynamic analysis (UBC 1997; AIJ 1999; SEAOC 1999; ICC 2003; ECS 2004; ASCE 2005; ECP 2007, 2008). For building structures, it is common practice to utilize a simplified approach, such as <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> load. This approach has several shortcomings, which have been accepted due to its simplicity and a lack of alternative practical approaches. Such approach may be regarded as force based since the method’s primary emphasis is on the forces within the structure. In recent years, there has been a shift of attention away from linear methods of seismic analyses to nonlinear methods which put emphasis on the displacements within the structure. Thus, nonlinear analysis methods that are capable of realistically predicting the deformations imposed by earthquakes on structures are needed. In response to this need, nonlinear static analysis procedures have appeared in national resource documents such as the ATC- 40 report on seismic evaluation and retrofit of concrete buildings (ATC 1996) and the FEMA- 356 pre-standard on seismic rehabilitation of buildings (FEMA 2000). Such analysis methods are useful for predicting inelastic displacement capacities while simultaneously offering a compromise between the oversimplification of linear static analysis and the inherent complexity of nonlinear dynamic analysis. The latest Egyptian code for load and forces (ECP 2008) and most of the international participating building codes depend on the traditional approach of <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> load method as the main method for evaluating seismic actions on symmetrical buildings (UBC 1997; AIJ 1999; ECS 2004; ECP 2008). For nonsymmetrical buildings, ECP (2008) recommended the response spectrum method to be used for building seismic analysis and design, which was considered to be a more accurate method of analysis than the <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> load method (Chopra 1995; Paz and Leigh 2003).|$|R

In order to overcome these difficulties, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> loads method for nonlinear response structural optimization (ESLSO) primarily used for size and shape optimization has been applied to topology optimization. The nonlinear analysis is performed with the given loading conditions to calculate <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> loads (ESLs) and these ESLs are used to perform linear response optimization.

30|$|Under seismic loads on structures, {{the maximum}} drift without total {{collapse}} is called target displacement. Most of low- and medium-rise building structures are seismically designed using <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> method.

The larger this coefficient, the higher the level of energy absorption and the more the formation of plastic joints, so accurate determination of yielding points and ultimate displacements are very important.

However, accelerometers measure a summed acceleration derived from 2 components: static (due to gravity) and dynamic (due to motion).

40|$|Laminated {{glass panes}} are widely adopted as blast-resistant glass windows to {{mitigate}} the hazard from ejecting fractured glass fragments. The response of laminated glass windows under blast loads is often predicted by <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> analysis or simplified equivalent single degree of freedom (SDOF) analysis. The equivalent SDOF and <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> analyses are also respectively adopted in UFC and ASTM design guide for glass window designs. Owing to the inherent problems, the SDOF analysis can only predict the global responses of glass windows and the predictions are not necessarily always satisfactory. Therefore the accuracy and applicability of the SDOF analysis is sometimes questioned. Often numerical simulations and/or experimental tests have {{to be carried out}} for reliable predictions of laminated glass window responses to blast loads. In this study, experimental tests on laminated glass windows subjected to impact and blast loads were carried out to evaluate the accuracy of available analyses and design methods. Pendulum impact tests were conducted first on laminated panes of various thicknesses. Full-scale field blast tests were performed on laminated glass windows of dimension 1. 5 m × 1. 2 m. Glass pane deflections were monitored by mechanical linear voltage displacement transducer (LVDT) and high-speed cameras. The responses of the tested windows are compared with the estimations of SDOF models and design standards in this paper.

40|$|The {{application}} of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> method (or simplified spectral method) for the seismic design of the spatial asymmetric buildings presupposes {{the existence of the}} elastic axis (center of stiffness) -geometrical locus of the elastic centers of the floors- so as to identify the eccentricity of the static seismic loads. But, while in single-storey buildings the elastic center is always defined and has determined static properties, in multi-storey buildings the above properties are not, in general, identified and the definition of the vertical elastic axis is, in general, impossible. In the present doctoral thesis we will first proceed to the analysis of the cases of existence and non-existence of the elastic axis and of a building’s principal bending planes, according to research data. Following this stage, and based on the buildings’ “optimum torsion” criterion, the fictitious elastic axis is defined for every case of frame-wall multistorey building that is regular in elevation. In order to define the fictitious elastic axis the mathematic theory of the continuous model of the structure, which outdoes in natural comprehension, has been used. Next, the results of analyses have been verified by using the discrete model of the structure that outdoes in numerical accuracy. In addition, the fictitious principal directions and the torsional stiffness radius of the frame-wall multistorey building are defined. The fictitious elastic axis may play the same role as the real elastic axis during the documented {{application of}} the <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> method of seismic design. Indeed, using the above elements, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> eccentricities (or dynamic eccentricities) are easy calculated, so the results of this analysis always envelope the respective results by the seismic dynamic analysis. ...|$|R

A large percentage of failures of mechanical structures can be attributed to fatigue.

The fatigue loads experienced by vehicle structures are especially difficult to quantify. In the current competitive markets, it is essential to use a pro-active, timely and cost effective process to solve fatigue related problems. The heart of the FESL methodology is the ability to condense a large amount of input load data into a single fatigue load.

This thesis has contended that for animation to be an effective instructional tool, its transiency must be controlled with an appropriate design to avoid overloading learners’ severely limited working memory and eroding any advantages animations may have in comparison with <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> representations. A tracing design that kept key information available as a trace throughout a sequence of displays was investigated as a method for reducing transience in animation. A total of five experimental studies compared relative instructional efficiency of animation (with and without pause/play feature) and <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> formats, each designed with either trace or no trace facilities, from a cognitive load perspective. The experimental materials presented dynamic electrical circuit operation to relatively inexperienced learners receiving training from a post-secondary technical education institution. As expected, in all the five studies, the tracing feature consistently reduced transience in the continuous animation format, resulting in this format to be either as efficient as any of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>static</b> formats or more efficient when the level of content complexity was within the learners’ current level of prior knowledge. Besides the tracing feature, a pause/play feature was also found to be able to reduce transience when incorporated into animation. With transience reduced by both tracing and pause/play effects, animations resulted in more efficient learning than their <b>static</b> <b>equivalents</b> when the level of content complexity was within the learners’ current level of prior knowledge. For relatively inexperienced learners who tended to use the pause/play feature in the animation infrequently, the tracing method compensated for reduced effect of this feature in managing transience.
