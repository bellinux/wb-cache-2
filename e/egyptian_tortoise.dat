2500|$|World of Reptiles {{has been}} an {{attraction}} at the zoo since it first opened. The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo. The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, {{as well as a}} window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of endangered species, including Cuban crocodile, false gharial, yellow-headed day gecko, Mary River turtle, Fly River turtle, golden coin turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Volcán Darwin giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra microphyes), <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoise,</b> pancake tortoise, Panamanian golden frog, and golden poison dart frog. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction. Other species held include lace monitor, northern caiman lizard, Taylor's cantil, green anaconda, eyelash palm pitviper, giant snake-necked turtle, Chiapas giant musk turtle, and Solomon Island leaf frog. On March 25, 2011, a cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra [...] "MIA" [...] (Missing In Action) and placed it on-exhibit.|$|E

50|$|Once {{found in}} Egypt and Libya, their habitat in Egypt {{has been all}} but destroyed, and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoises</b> are close to {{complete}} extinction there. Two populations can still be found in Libya, {{but much of the}} coastline habitat has been destroyed because of human activity. Habitat loss and the illegal pet trade are huge issues facing the species; it is also hunted locally for use in folk medicine. Their population is still on the decline, and the risk of extinction in the wild is very real if habitat degradation and illegal trade continue at their present rate.|$|R
50|$|The zoo also {{includes}} a reptile house and a 'birds and small mammals' section, {{as well as a}} museum. The reptile house is home to several endemic Egyptian species, including the Egyptian cobra, the Nile crocodile and the critically endangered <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diergaarde Blijdorp {{participates in}} about 70 {{breeding}} programs and studbooks, and coordinates {{a number of}} these, including the international breeding program for red pandas, EEPs for Asian elephant, Komodo dragon, red-crowned and Siberian crane, Visayan warty pig and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoise,</b> and the ESB for the crowned pigeons.|$|E
50|$|Mixing {{individuals}} from the subpopulations for reintroduction purposes should be avoided, as the ecological parameters of habitat differ. DNA fingerprinting of individuals to help maintain heterozygosity in captive and reintroduction populations can be performed during routine stool analyses. In this context, notably, {{there may be a}} haplotype uniquely found in the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the suitability of}} using translocations as a method {{to create a new}} population of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoises</b> Testudo kleinmanni in an area where the species historically occurred. We released 109 tortoises, comprising 57 males, 48 females and 4 juveniles. Dispersal from the release site influenced survival and retention rate, i. e. the proportion of individual tortoises found after the original release. The number of times a tortoise was recaptured decreased as the minimum distance at which it was found from the release site increased. In addition, live tortoises {{were significantly more likely to}} be found at shorter minimum distances from the release site than were dead tortoises. The sex ratio of pre-released tortoises tended to be different from the sex ratio of tortoises found during later surveys, with females proportionally more likely to be found than males. Pre-release mass was not a significant predictor of an individual tortoise being recaptured. Retention rates of future reintroductions may be improved by allowing tortoises to acclimatize and develop fidelity to the release site before they are translocated...|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} are more {{distinct}} and ancient lineages than the closely related latter three species. Arguably, T. horsfieldii belongs {{in a new}} genus (Agrionemys) {{on the basis of}} the shape of its carapace and plastron, and its distinctness is supported by DNA sequence analysis. Likewise, a separate genus Eurotestudo has recently been proposed for T. hermanni; these three lineages were distinct by the Late Miocene as evidenced by the fossil record. Whether these splits will eventually be accepted remains to be seen. The genus Chersus has been proposed to unite the <b>Egyptian</b> and marginated <b>tortoises</b> which have certain DNA sequence similarities, but their ranges are (and apparently always were) separated by their closest relative T. graeca and the open sea and thus, chance convergent haplotype sorting would better explain the biogeographical discrepancy.|$|R
5000|$|Kleinmann's {{tortoise}} (Testudo kleinmanni [...] ), {{often called}} the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoise</b> and occasionally Leith's tortoise, is a critically endangered species of neck-hiding tortoise.

5000|$|The spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (or Greek tortoise) (Testudo graeca) {{is one of}} five species of Mediterranean tortoise (genus Testudo, family Testudinidae).

The {{spur-thighed tortoise}} is a very long lived animal, achieving a lifespan of upwards of 125 years, with some unverified reports of up to 200 years.|$|E
5000|$|Hermann's {{tortoise}} (Testudo hermanni) {{is one of}} five tortoise species {{traditionally placed}} in the genus Testudo, the others being the marginated tortoise (T. marginata), Greek tortoise (T. graeca, or spur-thighed tortoise), Russian tortoise (T. horsfieldii [...] ), and Kleinmann's tortoise (T. kleinmanni, or <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoise).</b> Two subspecies are known: the western Hermann's tortoise (T. h. hermanni [...] ) and the eastern Hermann's tortoise (T. h. boettgeri [...] ). Sometimes mentioned as a subspecies, T. h. peleponnesica is not yet confirmed to be genetically different from T. h. boettgeri.|$|E
5000|$|According to the 2005 DNA {{sequence}} data, {{these species}} {{do not seem}} to hybridize to a notable extent in the wild, though they are obviously very close relatives, and as evidenced by morphology, some allele flow still occurs, but slowly. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoise</b> appears to represent a lineage that diverged from the same ancestral stock southwards into northeastern Africa around {{the same time as the}} marginated tortoise's ancestors diverged in Greece. These two are actually more similar to each other than to T. graeca regarding DNA sequence data, but considering biogeography, this is either due to (rather unlikely) dispersal across the Mediterranean, or the supposed [...] "clade" [...] is invalid and the similarity due to convergent evolution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>tortoise</b> Testudo kleinmanni was {{recently}} {{split into two}} species {{on the basis of}} apparent differences in shell morphology and markings. Testudo kleinmanni was restricted to areas west of the Nile river and a new form, T. werneri, was described which occurred east of the Nile river (Perälä, 2001). However, when the morphometric analysis on which this decision was based (Perälä, 2001) was adjusted to allow for experiment-wise Type I error, by using P-value corrections, the proportion of the 46 characters that differed significantly between the two populations fell from 36. 9 % to only 13 % in males and from 39. 1 % to just 8. 7 % in females. We then conducted a new morphometric analysis using our own data set that showed minor significant variation in morphometric and plastron markings between populations. An analysis of mitochondrial DNA based on 393 base pairs of the 12 S rRNA gene, also showed near uniformity of western and eastern populations. Genetic divergence was only 0. 2 %, with the only consistent difference being a single G – A substitution at position 205. Based on the revised interpretation of Perälä (2001) results, our morphometric analysis on our own data set, and the molecular evidence, the variation observed between populations is normal within a species and therefore T. werneri is not a distinct independent evolutionary lineage and should not be considered a separate species from T. kleinmanni...|$|E
