The Spectral <b>Edge</b> image <b>fusion</b> algorithm creates a result which combines details from any number of multispectral input images with natural color information from a visible spectrum image. Spectral <b>Edge</b> image <b>fusion</b> is a derivative–based technique, which creates an output fused image with gradients which are an ideal combination of those of the multispectral input images and the input visible color image. This produces both maximum detail and natural colors. We present two new applications of Spectral <b>Edge</b> image <b>fusion.</b> Firstly, we fuse RGB–NIR information from a sensor with a modiﬁed Bayer pattern, which captures visible and near–infrared image information on a single CCD. We also present an example of RGB–thermal image fusion, using a thermal camera attached to a smartphone, which captures both visible and low–resolution thermal images.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} intensity edge maps (IEMs) on the segmentation of noisy range images. Two edgebased segmentation algorithms are considered. The first is a watershed-based segmentation technique {{and the other is}} the scan-line grouping technique. Each of these algorithms is implemented in two different forms. In the first form, an IEM is fused with the range edge map prior to segmentation. In the second form, the range edge map alone is used. The performance of each algorithm, with and without the use of the IEM information, is evaluated and reported in terms of correct segmentation rate. For our experiments, two sets of real range images are used. The first set comprises inherently noisy images. The other set is composed of images with varying levels of artificial, additive Gaussian noise. The experimental results indicate that the use of IEMs can significantly improve edge-based segmentation of noisy range images. Considering these results, it seems that segmentation tasks involving range images captured by noisy scanners would benefit from the use of IEM information. Additionally, the experiments indicate that higher quality edge information can be obtained by fusing range and intensity edge information.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a robust {{approach}} for tracking targets in forward looking infrared (FLIR) imagery taken from an airborne moving platform. First, the targets are detected using fuzzy clustering, <b>edge</b> <b>fusion</b> and local texture energy. The {{position and the}} size of the detected targets are then used to initialize the tracking algorithm. For each detected target, intensity and local standard deviation distributions are computed, and tracking is performed by computing the mean-shift vector that minimizes the distance between the kernel distribution for the target in the current frame and the model. In cases when the ego-motion of the sensor causes the target to move more than the operational limits of the tracking module, we perform a multi-resolution global motion compensation using the Gabor responses of the consecutive frames. The decision whether to compensate the sensor ego-motion is based on the distance measure computed from the likelihood of target and candidate distributions. To overcome the problems related to the changes in the target feature distributions, we automatically update the target model. Selection of the new target model is based on the same distance measure that is used for motion compensation. The experiments performed on the AMCOM FLIR data set show the robustness of the proposed method, which combines automatic model update and global motion compensation into one framework...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a robust segmentation algorithm {{for the detection}} and localization of woven fabric defects. The essence of the presented segmentation algorithm is the localization of those events (i. e., defects) in the input images that disrupt the global homogeneity of the background texture. To this end, preprocessing modules, based on the wavelet transform and <b>edge</b> <b>fusion,</b> are employed {{with the objective of}} attenuating the background texture and accentuating the defects. Then, texture features are utilized to measure the global homogeneity of the output images. If these images are deemed to be globally nonhomogeneous (i. e., defects are present), a local roughness measure is used to localize the defects. The utility of this algorithm can be extended beyond the specific application in this work, that is, defect segmentation in woven fabrics. Indeed, in a general sense, this algorithm can be used to detect and to localize anomalies that reside in images characterized by ordered texture. The efficacy of this algorithm has been tested thoroughly under realistic conditions and as a part of an on-line fabric inspection system. Using over 3700 images of fabrics, containing 26 different types of defects, the overall detection rate of this approach was 89 % with a localization accuracy of less than 0. 2 inches and a false alarm rate of 2. 5 %...|$|E

By comparing existing building data sources, this paper firstly explained the reason why the estate spatial management data is chosen as the data source. Then, an applicable method of construction three-dimensional route model in a building is introduced by establishing the mapping relationship between geographic entities and their topological expression. This data model is a weighted graph consist of "node" and "path" to express the spatial relationship and topological structure of a building components.

40|$|Structural {{variations}} in zinc phosphate cluster chemistry {{have been achieved}} through a careful selection of phosphate ligand, ancillary ligand, and solvent medium. The use of 4 -haloaryl phosphates (X-dippH(2)) as phosphate source in conjunction with 2 -hydroxypyridine (hpy) ancillary ligand in acetonitrile solvent resulted in {{the isolation of the}} first examples of octameric zinc phosphates [Zn- 8 (X-dipp) (8) (hpy) (4) (CH 3 CN) (2) (H 2 O) (2) }center dot 4 H(2) O (X = Cl 2, Br 3) and not the expected tetranuclear D 4 R cubane clusters. Use of 2, 3 -dihydroxypyridine (dhpy) as ancillary ligand, under otherwise similar reaction conditions with the same set of phosphate ligands and solvent, resulted in isolation of another type of octanudear zinc phosphate clusters {[(Zn- 8 (X-dipp) (4) (X-dippH) (4) (dhpyH) (4) (dhpyH(2)) (2) (H 2 O) (2) ]center dot 2 solvent} (X = Cl, solvent = MeCN 4; Br, solvent = H 2 O 5), as the only isolated products. X-ray crystal diffraction studies reveal that 2 and 3 are octanudear clusters that are essentially formed by <b>edge</b> <b>fusion</b> of two D 4 R zinc phosphates. Although 4 and 5 are also octanudear clusters, they exhibit a completely different cluster architecture and have been presumably formed by the ability of 2, 3 -dihydroxypyridine to bridge zinc centers in addition to the X-dipp ligands. Dissolution of both types of octanuclear clusters in DMSO followed by crystallization yields D 4 R cubanes [Zn(X-dipp) (DMSO) ](4) (X = Cl 6, Br 7), in which the ancillary ligands such as hpy, H 2 O, and CH 3 CN originally present on the zinc centers of 2 - 5 have been replaced by DMSO. DFT calculations carried out to understand the preference of Zn- 8 versus Zn- 4 clusters in different solvent media reveal that use of CH 3 CN as solvent favors the formation of fused cubanes of the type 2 and 3, whereas use of DMSO as the solvent medium promotes the formation of D 4 R structures of the type 6 and 7. The calculations also reveal that the vacant exoduster coordination sites on the zinc centers at the bridgehead positions prefer coordination by water to hpy or CH 3 CN. Interestingly, the initially inaccessible D 4 R cubanes [Zn(X-dipp) (hpy) ](4) center dot 2 MeCN (X = Cl 8, Br 9) could be isolated as the sole products from the corresponding DMSO-decorated cubanes 6 and 7 by combining them with hpy in CH 3 CN...|$|E
