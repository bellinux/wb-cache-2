30|$|The {{preservation}} of historic tapestries {{is essential for}} the longevity of future public engagement with these objects. These highly elaborate objects consist of organic animal protein fibres (silk and wool) and inorganic material (silver or gold and silver gilt metal threads). During their construction, historic tapestries were often woven sideways due to loom width restrictions. Consequently, they are hung in the weft direction when on display rather than the warp direction, which is the structural frame on which the pictorial element is built. Wool fibres are a major structural and <b>decorative</b> <b>component</b> in tapestries and may arguably {{play a significant role in}} enabling the tapestries to bear their own weight.|$|E

A king’s throne name and birth name were each enclosed in a cartouche, forming a kind of heraldic motif expressing the ruler’s dual nature as both human and divine. The cartouche could occur as a simple <b>decorative</b> <b>component.</b> When shown independently the cartouche took on an iconic significance and replaced the king’s, or more rarely, the queen’s, anthropomorphic image, enabling him or her to be venerated as a divine entity. Conversely, the enclosure of a god’s or goddess’s name in a cartouche served to render the deity more accessible to the human sphere...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This study {{explores the}} {{intersection}} of the developments in the growing advertising, railroad, and automotive sectors of the U. S. economy. It examines the latter two sectors’ advertising to the elite by focusing on how industries that targeted the luxury market used fine art to emphasize and underscore the exceptionalism of that high-end market compared with the mass market. It does so by looking at the transition from using art as a <b>decorative</b> <b>component</b> unrelated to the product to using art specifically designed to advertise a product or experience. In the literature, advertising history has been delineated rather narrowly as the history of advertising to the mass consumer or as the history of advertising a specific type of product. This work broadens the focus in advertising history to show that luxury advertisers, as a sub-category of advertisers, developed particular advertising strategies, which recognized and exploited the relationship between their respective service or product, and a consciously selected audience for their respective advertisements. It shows that high art became a differentiating characteristic of advertising strategies aimed at the social elite market. This work also proposes the need for adding a specific timeline for the development of luxury advertising to the broad, more generally known outline of advertising history...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} an alternative {{framework for the}} interpretation of the painted and plain Athenian vase during the Late Archaic and Classical period. The primary focus is on {{the way in which the}} vase came to interact with society. As a commodity with a practical use, the vase was permitted to circulate in social spaces in Athens. As a consequence of this contact, the accumulated meaning became more symbolic than practical. For instance, due to its use within the domestic sphere, the vase became a symbol of domesticity. This development of symbolism involves a transformation in the perception of the vase as something more than a practically functioning thing. The functions that the vase performed were meaningful in themselves. For the purposes of exploring the manifestation of this transformation, this study draws upon an anthropological theory of art as well as theories which interpret the experience of viewing. Although the painted vase is discussed alongside plain vessels, its <b>decorative</b> <b>component</b> is considered as a further expression of communication between the vase and society, Athens in particular. The manifestation of this communication between the vase, context and user is isolated to three characteristics in this study; size, surface and shape. Alterations in these components reduce the practical function of the vase in favour of its symbolic qualities. These factors are discussed over five chapters. In so doing, this study offers a radically revised interpretation of the vase as an object which is entirely context dependent and came to represent the communication between commodities and society.

40|$|Deformation of 3 D shapes usually {{requires}} {{the use of}} a deformation tool. The freeform deformation technique {{requires the use of}} a lattice of control point for deforming an object. This may require a synchronized movement of the lattice control points in order to obtain the desired effects. The axial deformation technique allows an object to be deformed by manipulating an axial curve. However, unexpected twist of the object may be obtained. This {{is a result of the}} lack of control on the local coordinate frame of the curve. This paper presents a technique for deforming objects with a set of axial curve-pairs. The use of a curve-pair allows the local coordinate frame to be controlled intuitively. A curve-pair is composed of a primary and an orientation curve. The orientation curve is an approximate offset of the primary curve. A technique is proposed for maintaining the relation between the primary and the orientation curve when the curve-pair is adjusted. By associating a complex 3 D object to a curve-pair, the object can be stretched, bended, and twisted intuitively through manipulating the curvepair. This deformation technique is particularly suitable for manipulating complex shapes �e. g. <b>decorative</b> <b>components)</b> in industrial and aesthetic design, and is also suitable for modelling characters and animals with ¯exible bodies. Adjusting the curve-pair according to some motion constraints produces different postures of a character or animal model.

40|$|Rattan {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} non-timber forest products (NTFP) in the Philippines. It is in great demand for furniture and handicrafts for local and overseas markets. The country’s exports of rattan furniture alone averaged US$ 119 million per year from 1994 - 1998. Rattan is a climbing palm with unique physical and mechanical properties. It is light and has good strength properties but the main attribute of the material that influences product designs and quality, whether in round pole or split form, is its flexibility. Round poles can be bent into various forms and shapes for the structural and <b>decorative</b> <b>components</b> of rattan furniture and handicrafts. The bending of rattan poles into the desired shape is traditionally done with a blowtorch. This process produces scorch or burn marks on the surface of the bent items and this consequently degrades product quality and value. The most efficient bending method involves plasticizing the stocks for a suitable period in a steaming chamber prior to bending to the required shape with the aid of appropriate bending jigs. After this the bent pieces are dried to the required moisture content in restrained mode before product assembly. This is referred to as “steam bending”. The main equipment for steam-bending rattan poles that served as the model for this TOTEM was located inside the plant site at the Asia Rattan Manufacturing Company (ARMC), one of the four privately owned organizations that compose the AWECA group of companies based in Angeles City, Central Luzon. The ARMC and its sister companies have been the major beneficiaries of the technology transfer program of the FPRDI on rattan processing since 1987. ARMC cooperated in the documentation of the rattan pole steam-bending technology for this TOTEM. Steam-bending technology for rattan pole...|$|R
40|$|The Basilica of San Miniato al Monte {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} churches in Florence: its {{construction}} began in 1018 by the Bishop Hildebrand who wanted to celebrate St. Minias, the patron Saint of the city. The Basilica {{is one of the}} finest examples of Romanesque in Tuscany and presents intriguing astronomical and symbolic allusions that, however, largely remain undiscovered. This article presents the study on the relationship between architecture, religious symbols and astronomical elements of the church of San Miniato al Monte. In order to identify possible correlations between the position of the Sun and the <b>decorative</b> <b>components</b> of the Basilica that are illuminated by sunlight, we adopted the GNSS methodology and a Total Station. We found that the figures of Christ and the Virgin Mary on the apse mosaic are illuminated by the Sun during the Easter period, and the crypt altar, containing the relics of Saint Minias, is brightened on the day of his martyrdom. The preeminent symbolic/astronomical element is certainly the marble zodiac, similar to that of the Baptistery, which Capricorn-Cancer axis coincides with the axis of the Basilica. At the summer solstice a fascinating light phenomenon occurs: the sunlight perfectly illuminates the Cancer sign, thereby confirming the astronomical function of the marble zodiac. Furthermore the sunbeams coming from the windows of the right wall of the nave design a path of light on the ideal axis of the Basilica. The re-discovered astronomical role of this zodiac led us to hypothesize that the marble zodiac of the Baptistery of Florence was originally placed adjacent to the basement of the columns in front of the northern door of the Baptistery. In this way, on summer solstice day the light beam coming from the central opening of the dome, would have illuminated the Cancer sign, similarly to what happens for the zodiac of San Miniato...|$|R
40|$|Traditional Chinese {{architecture}} {{is one of}} the major historic building types in Hong Kong. Though the documentation on traditional Chinese building structure and form is extensive, the study on the <b>decorative</b> <b>components</b> is not as abundant. The deficiency is recognized particularly in timber components due to their high vulnerability to weather and fast deterioration under natural condition. Such situation is also observed in the design of traditional Chinese timber lattices in the partition doors and windows, which are regarded as unique artistic components in the traditional Chinese architecture. The objectives of the study are set to re-discover on the design, expression and associated cultural meanings of the traditional Chinese lattices in Hong Kong and its identity in the Lingnan context. Apart from being an artistic expression with high aesthetic value, the design of the lattice patterns and features are also recognized as symbolic means for the manifestation of collective and individual aspirations and beliefs of the people. They carry the hope for fortune, peace and longevity; and the influence of traditional Chinese thinking from Confucian and Taoist can also be traced. In the traditional Lingnan architecture, Hong Kong is closely related to its context, Guangzhou style. However variations in character of the local lattice design can still be found and the identity of Hong Kong is also to be sought. A field survey on the lattice design in the graded historic Chinese architecture in Hong Kong was carried out. As there is little research reference and the sampling is limited, the objective is set to establish a procedure for the collection of data for comparative analysis. By recording the results, finding out the characters and symbolic meanings, the associated intangible cultural significance can be established. The understanding of such intangible substances will be the essence for future conservation and the conserving of authenticity will rest on the inheritance of the intangible rather than the tangible form and material. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{growing body}} of {{knowledge}} about restorative environments shows that nature offers a restorative advantage over common outdoor urban public spaces with regard to recovery from attentional fatigue and stress. There is however a lack {{of research on the}} environmental components in natural environments that promote restoration. This detailed knowledge is important to landscape architects, who have a professional responsibility for the development of green structure in cities. The need for this information is perhaps even more important today, as the trend in European city planning is densification. This pattern of urban development is sometimes created at the cost of urban parks. In light of the densification process, this thesis is about the environmental components in small urban Scandinavian parks (pocket parks) that can support restorative experiences for people living and working in an urban setting. The environmental components under study are: hardscape, grass, lower ground vegetation, flowering plants, bushes, trees, water, and park size. Other people in the park are also of interest as a social component. The empirical research presented in this thesis is based on three different methods: photo ratings with regression analysis, photo ratings with eye tracking analysis and a questionnaire with choice-based conjoint analysis. With this battery of methods the ambition was to demonstrate the potential of quantitative methods that have previously been little used in landscape architecture. The respective strengths and weaknesses of the different methods are addressed in the thesis. The results from the studies converge in showing that people will assign high likelihoods of restoration to even small urban parks. All environmental components except for hardscape contributed to perceived likelihood of restoration. However, the components most important for these judgments were grass and trees. This result is in conflict with the common trend in Scandinavia, where use of hard paving materials such as concrete or granite is growing. Trees and grass take a relatively long time to establish compared to <b>decorative</b> <b>components</b> such as water features and flowers, hence, their use requires long term planning. To conclude, vegetation and in particular trees and grass are important components in small urban parks with regard to anticipated restoration. Despite a restricted park size and the presence of a moderate number of other people small parks can with the right design function as restorative spaces, hence in a longer perspective contribute to public health...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In Portugal, product {{development}} in decorative ceramic industry is usually done using traditional methodologies. In most cases manual modelling is used, {{which is very}} slow, highly inaccurate and demands skilled persons, {{that are difficult to}} find and too much time consuming to train.

Components cast during these trials ranged from functional electronic heat sinks to <b>decorative</b> household plumbing <b>components.</b> Whereas laboratory work indicated that die temperature and draft angle {{were the most}} important process factors influencing solder accumulation, {{it was not possible to}} vary draft angle on the established production dies used for these trials. Substantial variations in die temperature were realized however and also die surface conditions were varied, confirming the influence of a secondary variable in the laboratory investigation. Substantial evidence from the trials indicated that die surface temperature is the most important factor for controlling solder build up. The surface roughness of the die casting die greatly influenced the number of castings that could be run before solder initially appeared. Development of careful thermal management techniques, now judged to be beyond the capabilities of most US die casters, will be necessary to control incidences of die soldering found in typical production. Thermal control will involve both control of the bulk die temperature through use of thermally controlled cooling lines, and also regulation of surface temperature by well controlled cooling lines, and also regulation of surface temperature by well controlled die spraying (lubrication) techniques.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{integration}} of modern historic preservation laws, ethics, and techniques with the practical management of historic sites. The planned restoration (1999 - 2001) of the New Harmony, Indiana Labyrinth Temple by its managing entity, Historic New Harmony, provided an opportunity for the investigation of questions relevant to the application, in terms of accepted historic preservation practices, of the correct preservation treatment of state-owned cultural resources. A central question of this thesis was whether early New Harmony preservation efforts deemed by some to be more "historicism" than "history" possessed actual historical value. Of further interest was the relationship between implementation of the correct preservation treatment at the subject historic site and the resultant effects of that treatment upon its historic interpretation to the visiting public. This thesis examines the activity of the first New Harmony Memorial Commission in late- 1930 s/early 1940 s New Harmony, Indiana. To provide context for the New Harmony activity, contemporaneous national and state preservation efforts are also studied. The thesis also examines Historic New Harmony's initial plan to restore the Labyrinth Temple. Failures of that initial plan include omission of basic historic preservation principles, specifically the lack of required regulatory oversight of the planned activity by the Indiana SHPO's office (Section 106 compliance). The "restoration" plan developed by Historic New Harmony advocated the implementation of incorrect treatments of the Temple's structural <b>components,</b> <b>decorative</b> elements, and interpretive signage. In effect, Historic New Harmony's restoration plan was more "historicism" than "historic preservation. "This investigation of the Labyrinth Temple finds contextual validity in the preservation activity of the first New Harmony Memorial Commission, as well as relevance of that activity to the history of Indiana's historic preservation movement. These facts, in consideration with other factors, are reflected in the development herein of a procedurally correct project plan based on historic preservation laws, ethics, and techniques, as well as the inclusion of the historic site's entire story.
