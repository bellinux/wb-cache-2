40|$|Asbestos {{has been}} used for so long as {{automobile}} brake lining material because of its good physical and chemical properties. However, due to the health hazard associated with its handling, it has lost favour and several alternative materials are being increasingly used. Asbestos-free brake lining was developed in this work using pulverized cow hooves along with epoxy resin, barium sulphate, graphite and aluminium oxide. This was with a view to exploiting the characteristics of cow hooves, which are largely discarded as waste materials to replace asbestos which {{has been found to be}} carcinogenic. Samples <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> were produced using compressive moulding in which the physical and mechanical properties of the samples were studied.

It is a very important issue due to effect on the vehicle safety. Safety concerns are applicable to both road/track vehicles and aircraft. Scientific institutions and research centers make continuous efforts in order to improve brake lining materials and full-scale <b>brakes.</b> Analytical prediction <b>of</b> the friction material properties and behavior is not accurate enough due to complexity of the physical phenomena.

40|$|The <b>brake</b> {{architecture}} <b>of</b> hybrid {{and full}} electric vehicle includes the distinctive function <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> blending. Known approaches {{draw upon the}} maximum energy recuperation strategy and neglect the operation mode <b>of</b> friction <b>brakes.</b> Within this framework, an efficient control of the blending functions is demanded to compensate external disturbances induced by unpredictable variations of the pad disc friction coefficient. In addition, the control demand distribution between the conventional frictional brake system and the electric motors can incur failures that compromise the frictional braking performance and safety. However, deviation of friction coefficient value given in controller from actual one can induce undesirable deterioration <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> control functions. The main objective of the presented study is to propose a method to compensate disturbances induced by variations <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> friction coefficient through modifications <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> torque demand for the enhancement <b>of</b> both <b>brake</b> performance and active safety. The achievement of a compensation mechanism requires the estimation of relevant vehicle states.

40|$|Passenger vehicle disk brakes produce {{large amounts}} of wear debris {{that needs to be}} {{analyzed}} to verify its environmental and health impact because its effects are amplified by the massive extent of vehicular transportation around the world. An efficient and thorough method for wear debris analysis should be derived from this research to assist brake manufacturers and researchers in understanding the characteristics of wear particulates being released from current brake materials. In addition, a test method allowing <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> formulations in development phase should be provided and several model 2 ̆ 2 environmentally friendly 2 ̆ 2 brake lining materials should be developed. The most hazardous constituents in a known brake lining formula should be replaced with non-hazardous materials that will obtain performance specifications comparable to the original formula. The brake manufacturing industry and general public should be notified of important findings from this research. Model <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> fabricated on-site with known constituents were run through an AO 4 D performance dynamometer test to collect airborne and non-airborne wear debris that is comparable to wear debris produced by an average passenger vehicle. Based on previous experience with analysis <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>linings,</b> this wear debris will be analyzed with scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy with EDX (TEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer (LSPSDA). Research presented in this report indicates clearly that the previous work published by several groups is lacking sufficient information and the findings should be corrected. For instance the particle size distribution detected by particle size analyzers and impactors (recommended by EPA) is not accurate and TEM as well as SEM studies allowing direct observation of wear particles revealed considerable differences between sizes detected by these analyzers and realistic particle size. EDX in combination with XRF and XRD allows for reliable identification of chemical species and crystalline phases present in wear debris. True airborne wear debris should be sampled from brake exhaust from an appropriate distance. Degummed hemp shows promising results as a copper replacement in low-metallic friction material...|$|R

40|$|Insights {{into the}} {{speciation}} of Sb in samples <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>linings,</b> <b>brake</b> pad wear residues, road dust, and {{atmospheric particulate matter}} PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were obtained combining several well established and advanced characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy e energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SR-XAS). The advantage of SR-XAS is that samples do not undergo any chemical treatment prior to measurements, thus excluding possible alterations. These analyses revealed that the samples of wheel rims dust, road dust, and atmospheric particulate matter are composed by an admixture of Sb(III) and Sb(V) in different relative abundances. <b>Brake</b> <b>linings</b> {{turned out to be}} composed by Sb(III) oxide (Sb 2 O 3) and stibnite (Sb 2 S 3).

In addition to emission factors also size distribution and chemical composition of road traffic related particulates were investigated.

K. and Ireland at four observation sites simulating extreme degrees of vehicular-traffic influence in the environment. Trace metals in urban PM showed distinct types of size-fractionated behavior depending on the particle sources from which they originate. In coarse PM (1. 5 < Dp < 3. 0 microm) the concentrations of copper, barium, and iron correlated closely across over 2 orders of magnitude in urban air, which is seen as evidence that major portions of transition metals (Cu, Ba, Fe, and Mn) are released through abrasive vehicular emissions, particularly the wear <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>linings.</b> Further results are strongly indicative of a decoupling of coarse iron and calcium, the former arising predominantly from vehicles, the latter from soil resuspension. In fine PM (Dp < 0. 5 microm), several combustion and secondary sources of particulates were identified, but these were much less unique in terms of elemental fingerprints.

40|$|A model semi-metallic {{brake lining}} was {{subjected}} to full-scale automotive brake dynamometer tests. The structural properties and surface topography <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> were analyzed {{at different stages of}} wear testing and correlated to frictional performance. Characteristics of released wear particles were also addressed. A combination of abrasive and adhesive wear with oxidative processes dominated the friction process. Formation of a friction layer adhering to the friction surfaces of pads and discs is the major feature responsible for friction performance. Characteristics of the friction layer depend mostly on surface temperature, normal pressure, and sliding speed. It is a newly formed sintered composite matter consisting of a mixture of wear particulates. Wear rates and friction levels depend on chemistry, structure and hardness of the friction layer covering the surface of a pad or a disc; however, there is no simple Archard-type relationship between wear and measured hardness. Wear debris generated during the dynamometer tests was collected from containers placed under the brake inside dynamometer chamber. The collected debris was compared with ball-milled particles from identical brake lining. It is necessary to combine several analytical methods to characterize wear particles properly. The presence of copper and iron oxides as well as carbonaceous components is typical for all collected debris samples. Chemistry of wear debris resembles chemistry of the friction layer. Composition, mutagenic potency and pulmonary toxicity of wear debris and ball-milled particles were also analyzed. Mutagenic potency of initial friction composite and wear particles was evaluated by two in vitro bacterial microbioassays (SOS Chromotest, Ames test). Obtained results show potency of wear particles for interacting with DNA after metabolic activation, which indicates the presence of indirect mutagens.

In addition, marked increase in visceral pleural thickness and collagen deposition was observed following crocidolite asbestos inhalation. No significant pathological response was observed in the lung or the pleural cavity at any time point in either the brake-dust or chrysotile/brake-dust exposure groups. These results provide support that brake-dust derived from chrysotile containing brake drums would not initiate a pathological response in the lung following short term inhalation...|$|R
