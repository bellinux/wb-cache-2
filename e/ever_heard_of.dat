5|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic. Cabot sailed in 1497, {{five years after the}} European discovery of America, but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland, and, mistakenly believing (like Christopher Columbus) that he had reached Asia, there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> his ships again.|$|E
25|$|One day {{his father}} had promised {{to take him to}} a tannery the next day to see an engine that could run without a steam boiler. This tannery was located in Greenville, Ohio that {{his father had}} {{previously}} seen. When they arrived at the tannery the next morning, Lambert was disappointed to find that the building had burned to the ground the night before. He searched amongst the ashes and found the burned Otto gas engine. This was the only one he had <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> or seen. He took it apart to see how it was constructed. It was a slide valve coal gas engine.|$|E
25|$|Pullen often {{polarized}} {{critics and}} suffered from two undeserved allegations: the first (despite his grounding {{in the church}} and blues) that he was purely a free jazz player and thus unemployable in any other context; the second that he had been heavily influenced by Cecil Taylor or was a clone of Taylor, to whose playing Pullen's own bore a superficial resemblance. Pullen strenuously denied that he had any link with Taylor, stating that his own style had been developed in isolation before he <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Taylor. But the assertion of Taylor's influence continued to haunt Pullen to the end of Pullen's life, and persists even to this day.|$|E

25|$|Prince Shuysky now enters. Boris insults him, {{accusing him}} of conspiring with Pushkin, an {{ancestor}} of the poet. However, the prince brings grave tidings. A Pretender has appeared in Lithuania. Boris angrily demands to know his identity. Shuysky fears the Pretender might attract a following bearing the name of Tsarevich Dmitriy. Shaken by this revelation, Boris dismisses Fyodor. He orders Shuysky to seal the border with Lithuania, and, clearly {{on the edge of}} madness, asks Shuysky whether he has <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> dead children rising from their graves to question Tsars. Boris seeks assurance that the dead child the prince had seen in Uglich was really Dmitriy. He threatens Shuysky, if he dissembles, with a gruesome execution. The Prince describes the ghastly scene of Dmitriy's murder in a brief and beautiful aria ("In Uglich, in the cathedral"). But he gives hints that a miracle (incorruptibility) has occurred. Boris begins choking with guilt and remorse, and gives a sign for Shuysky to depart.|$|E

500|$|Most {{scholarly}} historians view such traditions as [...] "profoundly kerygmatic" [...] {{and that}} [...] "enormous difficulties" [...] exist in using these sources for actual history. Furthermore, any messengers sent by Muhammad to Heraclius {{would not have}} received an imperial audience or recognition. Outside of Islamic sources {{there is no evidence}} to suggest Heraclius <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Islam, and it is possible that he and his advisors actually viewed the Muslims as some special sect of Jews.|$|E

500|$|In September 1973, Maryland All-American guard Paul Vellano, then playing under Claiborne, said of {{the past}} coaches' difficulties: [...] "A lot of the kids said that Ward was a good coach {{but that he had}} a lot of bad apples. Lester was a high school coach and nobody had <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> him. I can't {{understand}} it. We had nine freshman who were All-Americans my first year here under Lester.

[...] Casey Stengel called Rogan [...] "one of the best—if not the best—pitcher that ever lived." ...|$|E
500|$|The inquest in August 1971 was {{not able}} to {{establish}} the exact sequence of events. [...] It was established that all three were shot at very close range, probably in a line. All had been drinking, and Joseph was found to be severely intoxicated. The jury was told that the three were probably shot whilst relieving themselves beside the road. The coroner commented: [...] "You may think that this was not only murder, but one of the vilest crimes <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> in living memory". The bodies were heaped {{on top of each other}} with two beer glasses lying near to them. After failing to return to their barracks by 18:30 the three were listed as AWOL.

500|$|It {{appears that}} David {{asked for and}} {{obtained}} extensive military aid from King Henry. Ailred of Rievaulx related {{that at this point}} a large fleet and a large army of Norman knights, including Walter l'Espec, were sent by Henry to Carlisle in order to assist David's attempt to root out his Scottish enemies. The fleet seems to have been used in the Irish Sea, the Firth of Clyde and the entire Argyll coast, where Máel Coluim was probably at large among supporters. In 1134 Máel Coluim was captured and imprisoned in Roxburgh Castle. Since modern historians no longer confuse him with [...] "Malcolm MacHeth", it is clear that nothing more is <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Máel Coluim mac Alaxadair, except perhaps that his sons were later allied with Somerled.|$|E

500|$|The band became {{associated}} with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork.

Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY.

500|$|Carnarvon {{had been}} succeeded as Colonial Secretary by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who {{received}} the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: [...] "Have you <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> an instance where the British Lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw?" [...] Kruger retorted: [...] "Yes. The Orange Free State." [...] The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon's decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the Eastern Question dominating the political scene few were interested. One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold ring, bearing the inscription: [...] "Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end." [...] Kruger was touched and wore {{it for the rest}} of his life.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{penetration of}} southern Florida offered {{the opportunity to}} map a poorly understood part of the country.

To avenge repeated surprise attacks on himself and ammunition stores, Colonel William Harney led an expedition into the Everglades in 1840, to hunt for a chief named Chekika. With Harney were 90soldiers in 16canoes. One soldier's account of the trip in the St. Augustine News was the first printed description of the Everglades available to the general public. The anonymous writer described the hunt for Chekika and the terrain they were crossing: [...] "No country that I have <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> bears any resemblance to it; it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees, and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally Indian, from which the white man would never seek to drive them".|$|E
