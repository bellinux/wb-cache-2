5|$|The keenest socialist {{among the}} Fasci leaders was Garibaldi Bosco. In August 1892 he {{attended}} the Socialist party’s congress at Genoa and on his return obediently purged his fascio of its anarchist and other non-socialist members. His <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> united democratic front was shared by the father of Sicilian socialism, Napoleone Colajanni. The leader in Catania, De Felice, also maintained contact with leading anarchists like Amilcare Cipriani. On these and other important issues there was much friction between Catania and Palermo.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the set of}} all numbers ua + vb is {{equivalent}} to the set of multiples m of g. In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers (a and b) {{is equivalent}} to the set of multiples of gcd(a, b). The GCD {{is said to be the}} generator of the <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> and b. This GCD definition led to the modern abstract algebraic concepts of a principal ideal (an ideal generated by a single element) and a principal ideal domain (a domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal).|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
40|$|Let A be a C*-algebra. Since the bidual <b>of</b> <b>A</b> can be {{considered}} as a W*-algebra, this enables us to prove the following duality theorems: (i) There exists a bijection between the norm-closed 2 -sided <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and the norm-closed invariant order <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> (ii) There exists a bijection between the norm-closed left <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and the norm-closed order <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> (iii) There exists an order inverting bijection between the norm-closed 2 -sided <b>ideals</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and the weak*-closed invariant faces of S(A), where S(A) is the state space <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> The object <b>of</b> the thesis is to verify the above observations and to give Stormer's solution to J.

25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{and until}} the 19th century, this {{attitude}} and practice prevailed, and the legal protection of women in war time related indirectly to the legal protection women were granted in peace times. In medieval Europe, women were considered as an inferior gender by law. The Catholic Church sought to prevent rape during feudal warfare through the institution of Peace and Truce of God which discouraged soldiers from attacking women and civilians in general and through the propagation of a Christianized version of chivalry <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knight who protected innocents and did not engage in lawlessness.|$|E
25|$|Only 700 copies {{were sold}} in France; the claim that {{thousands}} of copies {{were sold in}} Germany (see, for example) {{is thought to be}} an exaggeration. De Gaulle used the book to widen his contacts among journalists, notably with André Pironneau, editor of L'Écho de Paris. The book attracted praise across the political spectrum, apart from the hard left who were committed to the Republican <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> citizen army. De Gaulle's views attracted the attention of the maverick politician Paul Reynaud, to whom he wrote frequently, sometimes in obsequious terms.

25|$|There is a {{remarkable}} characterization of Cohen–Macaulay rings, sometimes called miracle flatness or Hironaka's criterion. Let R be a local ring which is finitely generated as a module over some regular local ring A contained in R. Such a subring exists for any localization R at a prime <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finitely generated algebra over a field, by the Noether normalization lemma; it also exists when R is complete and contains a field, or when R is a complete domain. Then R is Cohen–Macaulay {{if and only if}} it is flat as an A-module; it is also equivalent to say that R is free as an A-module.|$|E

25|$|Although {{successful}} economically, Austro-Hungarian policy - {{which focused}} on advocating the <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pluralist and multi-confessional Bosnian nation (largely favored by the Muslims) - failed to curb the rising tides of nationalism. The concept of Croat and Serb nationhood had already spread to Bosnia and Herzegovina's Catholics and Orthodox communities from neighboring Croatia and Serbia in the mid 19th century, and was too well-entrenched {{to allow for the}} widespread acceptance of a parallel idea of Bosnian nationhood. By {{the latter half of the}} 1910s, nationalism was an integral factor of Bosnian politics, with national political parties corresponding to the three groups dominating elections.|$|E
25|$|Phillips's {{philosophical}} ideal {{was mainly}} self-control of the animal, physical self by the human, rational mind, although he admired rash activists like Elijah Lovejoy and John Brown. Historian Gilbert Osofsky {{has argued that}} Phillips's nationalism was shaped by a religious ideology derived from the European Enlightenment as expressed by Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton. The Puritan <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Godly Commonwealth through a pursuit of Christian morality and justice, however, was the main influence on Phillips' nationalism. He favored fragmenting the American republic in order to destroy slavery, and he sought to amalgamate all the American races. Thus, it was the moral end which mattered most in Phillips' nationalism.|$|E
25|$|At Dakshineswar, Sarada Devi {{stayed in}} a tiny room in the nahabat (music tower). She stayed at Dakshineswar until 1885, except for short periods when she visited Jayrambati. By this time Ramakrishna had already embraced the monastic life of a sannyasin; as a result, the {{marriage}} was never consummated. As a priest, Ramakrishna performed the ritual ceremony—the Shodashi Puja where Sarada Devi was made {{to sit in the}} seat of goddess Kali, and worshiped as the divine mother Tripurasundari. According to Swami Saradananda a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna married to show the world an <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sexless marriage.
