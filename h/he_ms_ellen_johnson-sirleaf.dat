5000|$|... : On 14 June Liberian {{president}} <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf</b> {{announced that}} [...] "the Government of Colonel Gaddafi {{has lost the}} legitimacy to govern Libya", so the Liberian government decided to sever diplomatic relations with Libya by withdrawing its envoy in Tripoli and suspending {{the activity of the}} Libyan representation in Monrovia. She also added that they can be resumed when [...] "the people of Libya reach a political settlement which offers the best hope of lasting peace".|$|R
50|$|Controversy {{followed}} Mary Broh {{throughout her}} tenure {{and came to}} the forefront in 2011 and 2012; media reports focused on Mary Broh's destruction of public market places, physical altercations with Senate staff members and heated verbal exchanges with legislators and journalists. In February 2013, Mary Broh came to the aid of another embattled public official, Grace Kpaan, Montserrado County Superintendent, whom security officials apprehended as a result of bribery allegations she made against Representative Edward Forh (CDC-district #16 Montserrado County). Mary Broh was cited with obstruction of justice when she intervened in Grace Kpaan's arrest and both were suspended by President <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf.</b> Intense public opinion and collateral damage from previous legislative clashes created a difficult position for President <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf,</b> who was away on government business when this situation developed. Mary Broh submitted her resignation to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, effective February 28, 2013. Among a number of noteworthy statements issued in defense of Mary Broh and her impact on Monrovia, Ms. Deborah R. Malac, US Ambassador to Liberia, weighed in on what she perceived as the culmination of gender politics and an atmosphere of sexist hostility and violence towards women.|$|R

Liberia’s President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, joined Malac in {{a tour of the}} Liberian capital and implored U.S. President Barack Obama to assist the country.When aid was forthcoming, Malac assured Liberians that American military assistance (which became Operation United Assistance) were not there to organize a coup against <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf.</b> [...] Malac later noted that coordinated efforts helped to curb the epidemic.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} announcement, some Liberian {{political}} analysts {{believed that the}} merger of Bassa County's Charles Brumskine and Bong County's Franklin Siakor would pose trouble for <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf's</b> re-election bid. It was also argued that Brumskine's pairing with Siakor delivered a fatal blow to other opposition political parties that might enter the race for President, as the race was thought likely {{to come down to}} Brumskine and Johnson-Sirleaf. [...] However, Winston Tubman was the most popular of Johnson-Sirleaf's opponents, and the third-place finisher in the contest was Prince Johnson.|$|R
2500|$|Porter {{discusses}} the growing role of female leadership in countries prone {{to war and}} its impact on peacebuilding. When the book was written, seven countries prone to violent conflict had female heads of state. <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf</b> of Liberia and Michelle Bachelet of Chile were the first female heads of state from their respective countries and President Johnson-Sirleaf was the first female head of state in Africa. Both women utilized their gender to harness [...] "the power of maternal symbolism - the hope that a woman could best close wounds left on their societies by war and dictatorship." ...|$|R
5000|$|Not {{long after}} her {{appointment}} as Acting Mayor of Monrovia by President <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf,</b> Mary Broh struggled {{to gain the}} confidence of the Legislature as her prolonged [...] "acting" [...] status was called into question on several occasions. Mary Broh's efforts to clean and improve the capital's landscape through task force initiatives rankled various elements of the community. In September 2009, Muslim residents in Monrovia expressed concern over the Special Presidential Task Force to clean the city streets after an incident at the Benson Street mosque created an inconvenience for worshipers during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.|$|R
5000|$|Higby {{was elected}} as a Republican to the Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, and Fortieth Congresses and served from March 4, 1863 to March 3, 1869.

He served as chairman of the Committee on Mines and Mining (Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Congresses). He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1868.|$|R
5000|$|Upon graduating law school, Tetrick {{was hired}} by the Liberian {{government}} to work on the reform of Liberia's investment laws for its president, <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf,</b> a job that he has joked in interviews he was not qualified for at the time, but learned a tremendous amount in doing. He also worked on other social campaigns, including teaching street children and working to encourage child prostitutes from lives on the streets and into schools. This worked help with the idea for the basis of the non-profit organization, [...] "More Than Me."

50|$|White {{was born}} in 1840 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, son of Emily and David W. White.

5000|$|Among {{the list}} of persons that should be [...] "specifically barred from holding public offices; elected or {{appointed}} {{for a period of}} thirty (30) years" [...] for [...] "being associated with former warring factions" [...] was <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf,</b> the current president of Liberia. On 26 July, Sirleaf apologized to Liberia for supporting Charles Taylor, adding that [...] "when the true nature of Mr. Taylor's intentions became known, there was no more impassioned critic or strong opponent to him in a democratic process" [...] than she. On 28 August Liberia's parliament announced they must [...] "consult our constituents for about a year" [...] before deciding whether or not to implement the Commission's recommendations.|$|R
50|$|Because Taylor still enjoyed {{considerable}} {{support in}} Liberia, President <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf</b> requested the trial {{to be moved}} to The Hague. The Dutch government called for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1688 to take him but also requested a third country to hold him if convicted, to which the United Kingdom agreed. His trial in Freetown was deemed undesirable for security reasons with UNAMSIL having considerably reduced its presence. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1688 of 17 June 2006 allowed the Special Court to transfer Taylor's case to The Hague, Netherlands, where the physical infrastructure of the International Criminal Court would be used with the trial still being conducted under the SCSL's auspices. Taylor's trial started on 4 June 2007, with the first witness appearing 7 January 2008.|$|R
5000|$|On January 24, 2012, President <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf</b> {{nominated}} Lewis Brown, {{the architect}} of the National Democratic Coalition (NDC) as her new Minister of Information, Culture Affairs and Tourism. Brown, who served as interim foreign minister of Liberia in 2003 under President Charles Taylor replaces Cletus Sieh who was dismissed in the wake of last year’s violent riots by rampaging vacation students protesting the failure of the Monrovia City Corporation to pay their week’s wages. Brown, a once-vocal critic of the Sirleaf administration, threw his weight behind the incumbent just weeks before the disintegration of the NDC headed by Dew Mayson. His sudden support of the president raised eyebrows and accusations from his detractors that he was eyeing a position in Sirleaf’s Cabinet ...|$|R
5000|$|In early July 2013, {{media outlets}} {{announced}} that President <b>Ellen</b> <b>Johnson-Sirleaf</b> reappointed several mayors to their posts, Mary Broh being chief among these appointments. Shortly after Mary Broh's controversial and highly publicized resignation from City Hall, reports began to surface about the declining state of sanitation and cleanliness in the capital. Members of the 53rd Liberian Legislature, {{some of which}} demanded Mary Broh's resignation in late February 2013, acknowledged the unsanitary conditions in the capital by calling upon the acting mayor, Henry Reed Cooper, to give account for the conditions in the city. Mary Broh's reappointment as Acting City Mayor remains contingent upon confirmation by the 53rd Liberian Legislature, the same body that blocked her confirmation and submitted a vote of [...] "no confidence" [...] in July 2012.|$|R

500|$|Concerned {{about the}} children's education, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Ellen</b> reveals she will buy {{dinner for the}} winner of a {{spelling}} test. The boys actively try to court <b>Ms.</b> <b>Ellen,</b> but Chef (having beaten them to it) warns them she is a lesbian and thus only likes other lesbians. The boys do not realise what this means and try to become lesbians {{in order to attract}} <b>Ms.</b> <b>Ellen.</b> Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison's nose job makes him a [...] "hot and sexy" [...] man, with his face resembling David Hasselhoff, and he decides to quit teaching to pursue women. Stan wins the dinner (much to Wendy's dismay), but finds out that <b>Ms.</b> <b>Ellen</b> has no intention of making love with him. Wendy however sees them through the window and leaves distraught. The next day, several Iraqi men burst into the classroom and declare that <b>Ms.</b> <b>Ellen</b> is actually an Iraqi fugitive. As she resists arrest, she inadvertently kills Kenny by impaling him with a sword to his face. The soldiers take her into custody and shoot her {{into the center of the}} Sun via a rocket.|$|R
