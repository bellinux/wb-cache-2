40|$|Hypothesis: Although several {{staging systems}} for {{colorectal}} liver metastasis have been proposed, simple and generally accepted staging {{systems are not}} available for this disease. We hypothesized that more detailed analysis of primary colorectal cancer may {{make it possible to}} develop a simple staging system and that its stratification ability may be demonstrated by validation against data from unrelated patients. Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively documented data, development of a stage, and validation against an unrelated cohort. Setting: Four tertiary referral centers. Patients: Twenty-two clinicopathologic factors were examined in 369 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for liver metastasis from colorectal cancer (original cohort). Using the independent prognostic factors, a simplified staging system was developed and was validated by data from 229 unrelated patients (validation cohort). Main Outcome Measures: Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses between different prognostic groups in the cohorts. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed several independent prognostic variables, including <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis (relative risk 4. 39), 4 or more colorectal lymph node metastases (RR 1. 50), carcinoembryonic antigen level of 50 ng/mL or higher (RR 1. 29), and multiple hepatic metastases (RR 1. 27). Patients with <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis were assigned to stage 4, and the remaining patients were divided according to number of factors: none, stage 1; 1, stage 2; 2 or 3, stage 3. In the original cohort, median survival in stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 7. 2, 3. 5, 2. 0, and 1. 3 years, respectively. In the validation cohort, these values were 9. 6, 4. 1, 2. 8, and 1. 6 years, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed simplified staging system was easy to use, was highly predictive of patient outcome, and permitted categorization of patients into treatment groups.

There was a significant improved response rate for I. A. (62 %) compared with I. V. (17 %) treatment (p less than 0. 003). However, the improved response rate for patients in whom I. A. therapy was used did not translate to a significantly improved survival rate. The 2 -year actuarial survival rates for the groups for which I. A. and I. V. therapy was used were 22 % and 15 % respectively, with the survival curves not differing significantly (p = 0. 27). These results {{may have been due}} to the inclusion of patients with tumor in draining <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The presence of tumor in <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was associated with a poorer prognosis.

Here, we explore the responses of CD 4 T-cells within the major draining lymph nodes. We found minimal expression of Foxp 3 within CD 4 cells but elevated levels within the γδ (WC 1 +) population. There is a strong T-cell-intrinsic exhaustion phenotype within the <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (HLN) characterized {{by a lack of}} antigen-specific proliferation and cytokine secretion. CD 4 T-cells recovered from the HLN had high levels of PD- 1 expression and low levels of IL- 2 secretion. Exogenous IL- 2 partially rescued this defect; when combined with neutralization of IL- 10 and TGF-β, full restoration of proliferation, and cytokine production was achieved. Moreover, there is a clear uncoupling of the mechanisms that facilitate this regulation with parasite-specific proliferation and cytokine secretion being governed by independent means. These data would suggest that there is a CD 4 T-cell-intrinsic regulation in place early in chronic infection, potentially leading to failure in resistance to reinfection...|$|E
40|$|Objective Indocyanine green fluorescence-guided surgery (ICG-FGS) {{has emerged}} as a {{potential}} new imaging modality for improving the detection of <b>hepatic,</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (LN), and peritoneal metastases in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the available literature in the clinical setting of ICG-FGS for tumoral detection in various fields of metastatic colorectal disease. Methods PubMed and Medline literature databases were searched for original articles on the use of ICG in the setting of clinical studies on colorectal cancer. The search terms used were “near-infrared fluorescence”, “intraoperative imaging”, “indocyanine green”, “human” and “colorectal cancer”. Results ICG fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is clearly supported as an intraoperative technique that allows the detection of additional superficial hepatic metastases of CRC. Data on the role of ICG-FI in the intraoperative detection of peritoneal metastases and LN metastases are scarce but encouraging and ICG-FI could potentially improve the staging and treatment of these patients. Conclusion ICG-FI is a promising imaging technique in the detection of small infraclinic LN, hepatic, and peritoneal metastatic deposits that may allow better staging and more complete surgical resection with a potential prognostic benefit for patients.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One {{hundred and}} ninety livers {{condemned}} due to chronic disease (fibrosis) were evaluated in a bovine slaughterhouse over 12 months. <b>Hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were also examined while {{still attached to}} livers. The major macroscopic lesion observed in the livers was moderate to severe atrophy of the left lobe associated with compensatory hypertrophy of the right lobe. Histologically, the main changes corresponded to sites of macroscopic lesions, and fibrosis was observed in all livers, along with bile duct hyperplasia and neovascularization. Masson's trichrome stain highlighted the fibrous connective tissue. Most of the livers analyzed had macrophages with foamy cytoplasm and a peripheral nucleus that infiltrated fibrotic areas. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for macrophages with monoclonal antibody clone MAC 387 revealed that the cytoplasm of the foamy macrophages of the liver and of the <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were positively immunostained. These cells are frequently associated to the consumption of grasses of the genus Brachiaria. Although the liver gross lesions described in this study have not been previously reported in animals consuming Brachiaria, the associated changes observed histologically, such as fibrosis and infiltration of foamy macrophages, showed {{a new form of}} chronic liver disease probably associated with the consumption of this forage. The IHC technique was important to prove that the foam cells observed are macrophages...|$|R

40|$|Further {{to define}} the epitopes of PDC-E 2, the major {{autoantigen}} in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), we have developed and characterized five human monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies were derived by fusing a regional <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> from a patient with PBC with the mouse human heterohybrid cell line F 3 B 6. Previous studies of epitope mapping of PDC-E 2 have relied on whole sera and {{have suggested that the}} immunodominant epitope lies within the inner lipoyl domain of the molecule. However, selective absorption studies using whole sera and a series of overlapping recombinant peptides of PDC-E 2 have suggested that the epitope may also include a large conformational component. Moreover, several laboratories have suggested that autoantibodies against the 2 -oxo acids dehydrogenase autoantigens are cross-reactive. The five monoclonal antibodies generated included three IgG 2 a and two IgM antibodies and were studied for antigen specificity using recombinant PDC-E 2, recombinant BCKD-E 2, histone, dsDNA, IgG (Fc), collagen and a recombinant irrelevant liver specific control, the F alloantigen. The antibodies were also used to probe blots of human, bovine, mouse and rat mitochondria. Finally, fine specificity was studied by selective ELISA and absorption against overlapping expressing fragments of PDC-E 2. All five monoclonals, but none of the other mitochondrial autoantigens were specific for PDC-E 2. In fact, although affinity purified antibodies to PDC-E 2 from patients with PBC cross-reacted with protein X, the human monoclonals did not, suggesting that protein X contains an epitope distinct from that found on PDC-E 2. Additionally, all three IgG 2 monoclonals recognized distinct epitopes within the inner lipoyl domain of PDC-E 2. © 1992...|$|E
40|$|Interleukin 4 (IL- 4) is {{expected}} to play a dominant {{role in the development}} of T helper (Th) 2 cells. Th 2 immune responses with expression of relatively large amounts of interleukin 4 (IL- 4) but little interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) are characteristic for chronic helminth infections. But no information is available about IL 4 expression during early Fasciola hepatica (F. hepatica) infections in cattle. Therefore, we investigated F. hepatica specific IL- 4 and IFN-gamma mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from calves experimentally infected with F. hepatica. Cells were collected prior to infection and on post-inoculation days (PIDs) 10, 28 and 70. Interestingly, PBMCs responded to stimulation with F. hepatica secretory-excretory products (FhSEP) already on PID 10 and expressed high amounts of IL- 4 but not of IFN-gamma mRNA suggesting that F. hepatica induced a Th 2 biased early immune response which was not restricted to the site of infection. Later in infection IL- 4 mRNA expression decreased whereas IFN-gamma mRNA expression increased slightly. Isolated lymph node cells (LNCs) stimulated with FhSEP and, even more importantly, non-stimulated LN tissue samples indicated highly polarized Th 2 type immune responses in the draining (<b>hepatic)</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> but not in the retropharyngeal lymph node. During preliminary experiments, two splice variants of bovine IL- 4 mRNA, boIL- 4 delta 2 and boIL- 4 delta 3, were detected. Since a human IL- 4 delta 2 was assumed to act as competitive inhibitor of IL- 4, it was important to know whether expression of these splice variants of bovine IL- 4 have a regulatory function during an immune response to infection with F. hepatica. Indeed, IL- 4 splice variants could be detected in a number of samples, but quantitative analysis did not yield any clue to their function. Therefore, the significance of bovine IL- 4 splice variants remains to be determined...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> {{involvement}} {{is generally considered}} a contraindication for liver resection performed for colorectal liver metastases. However, some advocate hepatic lymphadenectomy {{in the presence of}} macroscopic involvement and others routine lymphadenectomy. The aim of this review is to assess the role of lymphadenectomy in resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Methods. Medline, Embase and Central databases were searched using a formal search strategy. Trials with survival data with a minimum follow-up of 1 year were considered for inclusion. Meta-analysis was performed using Revman. Results. A total of 4230 references were identified. Ten reports of nine studies including 926 patients qualified for the review. The prevalence of nodal metastases after routine lymphadenectomy was 16. 3 %. The overall 3 -year and 5 -year survival rates in node-positive patients were 9 / 151 (11. 3 %) and 2 / 137 (1. 5 %), respectively, compared to 3 -year and 5 -year survival rates of 424 / 787 (53. 9 %) and 246 / 767 (32. 1 %) in node-negative patients. The odds ratios for 3 -year and 5 -year survivals in node positive disease compared to node-negative disease were 0. 12 (95 % CI 0. 06 to 0. 24) and 0. 08 (95 % CI 0. 03 to 0. 22). There was no randomized controlled trial which assessed the survival benefit of routine or “selective ” lymphadenectomy. Conclusion. Currently, {{there is no evidence of}} survival benefit for routine or selective lymphadenectomy. Survival rates are low in patients with positive lymph nodes draining the liver irrespective of whether they are detected by routine lymphadenectomy or by macroscopic involvement. Further trials in this patient group are required. Copyright © 2008 Kurinchi S. Gurusamy et al. This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attributio...|$|E

While infection {{is associated with}} suppression of cell-mediated, immunity, drug-cured patients are resistant to reinvasion by amoebae. Macrophages are the principal effector cells in host defence against E. histolytica via production of nitric oxide which is cytotoxic for the parasite. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the T cell cytokine responses associated with host defence against E. histolytica. A mixed Th 1 /Th 2 (Th 0) response predominated at days 5 [...] 10 of amoebic liver abscess development in gerbils, as indicated by spleen and <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cell IL- 2 (Th 1 marker) and IL- 4 (Th 2 marker) production. However, T cell responses were profoundly suppressed at day 20 of infection. Serum collected at day 20, but not at other times, markedly suppressed T cell proliferative responses by inhibiting IL- 2 production. A switch to a Th 1 response occurred after day 20 of infection. Following drug-abbreviation of infection at day 20, animals were completely resistant to challenge infection in the liver and demonstrated a Th 1 response. The Gal-lectin 170 -kDa heavy subunit of E. histolytica is a protective antigen in gerbils and a potential subunit vaccine candidate. We determined which region of the Gal-lectin stimulates IL- 12 production, as IL- 12 is key to inducing Th 1 cytokine responses. Native Gal-lectin plus interferon-gamma stimulated IL- 12 p 40 and p 35 gene transcription and IL- 12 p 70 protein production in human macrophages. Using a panel of anti- 170 -kDa subunit monoclonal antibodies in inhibition studies, aa 596 [...] 998 was identified as the IL- 12 -inducing domain. These results suggest that this portion of the Gal-lectin has potential for use as a subunit vaccine to induce Th 1 -mediated immunity against E. histolytica...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of bioimpedance {{measurements}} {{within the field of}} electrosurgery. A standard monopolar electrosurgery setup has been utilized in order to discriminate between the characteristic impedance of the proper hepatic artery (PHA) and common bile duct (CBD) in domestic pigs. The end goal is to aid a surgeon performing a cholecystectomy, primarily laparoscopic, in order to avoid dividing or damaging the wrong part of the arteries or ducts in the area surrounding Calot s triangle. It could also be a potential building block for further research into for example smart electrosurgery knives or other tissue discrimination for use within electrosurgery. The Valleylab E 1551 X, E 1450 G and E 1475 X electrosurgery electrodes has been evaluated. The E 1551 X blank stainless steel electrosurgery electrode was chosen as the most optimal electrode to use during the experiments. Basic characteristics of this electrode and its sensitivity field have been measured through a series of experiments using a cucumber model. A total of 9 in vivo pig experiments were performed between March and June 2013 at the Institute for Surgical Research at Oslo University Hospital. Impedance measurement data has been collected from the pig experiments using the Solartron 1260 / 1294. The measurement locations consists of the common bile duct, proper hepatic artery, gall bladder, right lateral lobe of the liver, <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> splenic artery and spleen. The measurement results for the CBD and PHA has been statistically analyzed. The proper hepatic artery was found to have overall lower impedance than the common bile duct over almost all frequencies. The results show a statistical significant difference between the CBD and PHA in 6 out of 9 pigs (66 %) according to the Mann- Whitney U test. Among these, 5 out of 9 pigs (55 %) supported the hypothesis that the phase for the PHA was higher than the phase for the CBD at 630 kHz. 1 out of 9 pigs (11 %) were a false positive. The result is based upon what part of the phase data had the most amount of statistically reliable results. The hypothesis is tested with an arithmetic mean test for all of the measurements series combined...|$|E

They also had available and studied histologic slides from both subchronic and chronic studies of certain mineral hydrocarbons 90 -day oral study {{of low melting point}} wax (LMPW) in female Fischer 344 and Sprague-Dawley rats; 90 -day studies of P 15 H* and P 70 H white oil and high melting point wax (HMPW) in male and female F 344 rats and 24 month study of P 70 H white oil in male and female F 344 rats. The Panel also reviewed mineral oil-induced alterations in tissues of human patients (liver, <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and spleen). The Panel agreed that certain of the mineral hydrocarbons produced lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes and liver of the F 344 rat and these lesions were best described as microgranulomas/granulomas. The lesions were fundamentally similar in both organs, although varying in severity with dose and type of mineral hydrocarbons. The Panel agreed that hepatic lesions with inflammatory cell infiltration, necrosis, and fibrosis were produced only by feeding of LMPW and the lesions were confined to F 344 rats and not found in Sprague-Dawley rats. The most severe granulomatous lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes were found in high dose LMPWfed F 344 rats. The microgranulomas were similar in subchronic and chronic studies. Also, little difference existed between controls and treated F 344 rats in the incidence and severity of the lesions after 2 years of feeding P 70 H white oil. The Panel agreed that some slight reversibility existed for these lesions, but also agreed that complete resolution was unlikely as regression of the lesions in the rat would likely be slow. The Panel agreed that a minimal severity infiltrate of mononuclear inflammatory cells occurred in the base of the mitral valve in a slightly increased incidence in F 344 rats fed LMPW. The Panel concluded that these mitral valve alterations had little if any toxicologic significance as the focal infiltrate was minimal in severity, occurred in controls, occurred in association with murine cardiomyopathy, and were unlike the responses in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes. The Panel agreed that the lesions observed in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes of F 344 rats exposed to MHCs, especially the LMPW, were different morphologically from changes observed in lymph node, liver, and spleen of humans that were mineral oil-users, These changes in humans are usually found incidentally in tissues taken at biopsy or autopsy. The MHC-induced lesions can be considered incidental and inconsequential in humans. Granulomatous lesions are produced in rats by MHC-feeding, especially in livers of the F 344 rat with certain of the MHCs, but are not found in human tissues. This suggests a heightened and perhaps different type of toxic response in the rat compared to humans. The MHC-associated alterations in humans are ubiquitous, present after a certain age in most, if not all, humans, and consist of intra-and extra-cellular oil droplets with a minimal macrophage (including giant cells) response...|$|E

Designing of future approaches for the control of tropical fasciolosis requires {{an understanding of the}} host-parasite relationships. This study was therefore undertaken to look at and compare the hostparasite interactions of F. gigantica infection between cattle (Bos indicus) and swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). This study compared the prevalence of infection, clinicopathological and parasitological manifestations, sequential production of antibody isotypes and of Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines, local immune responses, and the histopathology of the infection between cattle and swamp buffaloes during infection with F. gigantica. The study shows that cattle and buffaloes are both susceptible to infection with F. gigantica in the Philippines with the infection affecting young and old animals. However, there are indications that these animals differ in their responses to infection. The red blood cell (RBC) count was significantly higher in infected than in noninfected swamp buffaloes (P 0. 05). Red blood cell count was significantly higher in buffaloes with high fluke burdens (> 70 flukes) than those with no flukes or with medium fluke burden (21 - 70 flukes) (P 0. 05). On the other hand, infected cattle showed significantly lower RBC counts than non-infected cattle (P< 0. 05) and these counts were negatively related to fluke burden. Packed cell volume was also significantly lower in cattle with high fluke burden than those with fewer flukes (P< 0. 05). These findings showed that swamp buffaloes were not as severely affected by F. gigantica compared with cattle suggesting that they can cope with infection much better than cattle. From these observations, it was concluded that swamp buffaloes are more resilient to F. gigantica infection than cattle. There was a trend of a lower fluke burden and faecal egg counts in naturally infected swamp buffaloes than in cattle. Fluke burdens were also lower in buffaloes than cattle at 3, 7, 12 and 16 weeks post- experimental infection with 1000 metacercariae. Sixteen weeks after the experimental infection, eggs were already seen in cattle but none in buffaloes and only immature flukes were present in buffaloes at this time, indicating that the prepatent period of F. gigantica in cattle is shorter than in swamp buffaloes. These findings support a conclusion that swamp buffaloes are more resistant than cattle to F. gigantica. An indirect ELISA was done to assess the sequential production of antibody isotypes IgG 1, IgG 2 and IgE reacting to F. gigantica. Infected cattle and buffaloes showed increased levels of these isotypes relative to the controls. No marked increase in IgG 1 and IgG 2 occurred in cattle except during the later part of infection. In buffaloes, the elevations of these two isotypes showed a pattern of increasing trend. IgG 1 and IgG 2 values in buffaloes were higher than in cattle. It is proposed that IgG 2 may be associated with resistance against F. gigantica in these species, higher IgG 2 in buffaloes being related to the higher resistance observed in these animals compared with that in cattle. The levels of IFN-γ, IL- 6 and IL- 8 in serum of cattle and buffaloes were assessed by a sandwich ELISA. IFN-γ was not present in detectable levels in the serum of these animals suggesting that this cytokine may not be important in the immune response against F. gigantica in cattle and swamp buffaloes. Serum IL- 6 levels were higher in infected than in non-infected animals from one to 16 weeks post-infection and higher in cattle than in buffaloes. This suggests that IL- 6 is not important in resistance against F. gigantica in these animals. Higher serum IL- 8 levels were observed in infected buffaloes than in cattle suggesting that this cytokine is associated with the higher degree of resistance against F. gigantica in swamp buffaloes than in cattle. The local immune response in the liver of infected animals was assessed by immunohistochemistry and histology. T and B lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils and mast cells were present in hepatic lesions. A progressive increase in T cell numbers occurred after infection in buffaloes whereas these continuously declined in cattle after a sharp rise at three weeks post-infection. The numbers of B lymphocytes and plasma cells increased from 3 - 16 weeks post-infection in both species. Eosinophils were also present in hepatic lesions, which may be partly a consequence of the degranulation of mast cells in hepatic lesions as a result of antigenic stimulation from the flukes. It is concluded that both cellular and humoral responses are induced in the liver of cattle and swamp buffaloes infected with F. gigantica. The T cell response in cattle was apparently suppressed after week 3 of infection which may be due partly to the rapid migration of flukes or to a suppression of the local immune response in the liver of cattle by F. gigantica. The increasing responsiveness in buffaloes represented by the gradually increasing numbers of T lymphocytes {{may have contributed to the}} suppression of development of flukes or delayed their migration in these animals. This difference in the expression of the hepatic T cell response between cattle and swamp buffaloes may be related to the observed differences in their level of resistance against F. gigantica. The percentage of eosinophils in the blood increased in infected animals. The eosinophilia observed may have resulted from the generalized inflammation following liver fluke infection and may not be protective as migrating flukes or dead flukes with surrounding eosinophils were not seen in the liver. Eosinophilia also indicates a stimulation of a Th 2 -type of immune response in these animals during infection with F. gigantica. The kinetics of eosinophilia differed between hosts. A rapid eosinophilia was observed within 1 - 3 weeks post-infection in cattle whereas this was considerably delayed in buffaloes to weeks 6 - 11. The slower eosinophil response in buffaloes may be associated with the increased resistance to F. gigantica in this host, i. e eosinophils are not an effector cell involved in killing immature F. gigantica during the first five weeks of infection. Histopathology of liver and hepatic lymph nodes revealed some differences in the extent of lesions between cattle and swamp buffaloes at different periods of infection. At three weeks post-infection, focal necrosis was present in cattle but not in buffaloes. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (HLN) of cattle showed stronger follicular and parafollicular hyperplasia compared with buffaloes. Lymphocytic infiltration in portal areas was more marked in cattle than buffaloes at seven weeks post-infection and more plasma cells were present in the medullary cords of HLN of cattle than buffaloes. Marked portal reaction, bile duct hyperplasia and severe cirrhosis were seen in cattle at 12 weeks post-infection. Only moderate cirrhosis was observed in buffaloes at the same time post-infection. At 16 weeks post-infection in cattle necrosis of bile ducts was seen with mostly eosinophils in the inflammatory infiltrate. In buffaloes, most of the inflammatory cells were lymphocytes. These results imply that there was milder damage and inflammatory response in the liver and milder stimulation of the HLN at some stages of infection in buffaloes compared with cattle which could be due to their lower fluke burden or to the delayed migration or suppressed development of flukes in buffaloes. Results of this study showed that there were similarities and differences in the immune responses of cattle and buffaloes during infection with F. gigantica. These varying responses to F. gigantica infection represent differences in host-parasite relationships of F. gigantica infection between cattle and swamp buffaloes and may be linked to the observed varying levels of resistance and resilience to infection between these hosts...|$|E

Objective: We intend to describe the clinical, radiological and histological aspects of this tumor. Case report: A- 64 -year-old woman presented with abdominal pain and dyspepsia. Tomography showed hepatic, renal and mesenteric nodules. Histological evaluation of mesenteric <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> revealed perivascular epithelioid differentiation neoplasia, compatible with AML/perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa), positive for anti-S 100, anti-human melanoma black- 45 (HMB- 45) and anti-smooth muscle actin.

40|$|<b>Hepatic</b> allograft-derived <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were {{examined}} in the post-transplant period on {{order to determine the}} origin of lymphocytes and structural elements of the <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Histologic assessment and immunohistochemical studies verified that T-cell infiltration of donor <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> by recipient-derived lymphocytes occurred early in the post-transplant period. These T cells bore T-cell activation markers, e. g. TAC receptor and HLA-DR antigens. In addition, functional analysis demonstrated alloreactive T cells in secondary proliferation assays. The pattern of alloreactivity in these assays was dependent upon the phenotypic make-up (and therefore origin) of the lymphocytes within the <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> A gradual shift in predominance of donor-derived lymphocytes to recipient-derived lymphocytes occurred, but even late in the post-transplant course the stromal elements and a residium of lymphocytes within the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> continued to bear donor HLA antigens. The possible role of these 'passenger' lymphocytes in allograft immunity is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{standardized}} procedure for examination of the canine abdomen using endoscopic ultrasound and to describe the organs and structures that could be identified transgastrically. The abdomen of four healthy dogs and two cadavers were examined with endoscopic ultrasound. Five anatomic landmarks were used for standardized imaging of the cranial abdomen. These were the portal vein, splenic head and body, duodenum, left kidney, and aorta. High-resolution images of the following organs and structures could be made: distal esophagus, gastric wall from the cardia to the pylorus, liver, caudal vena cava, <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> liver hilus, and associated vessels, trifurcation of the celiac artery as well as the path of its branches and the left pancreatic limb and body. Structures that were more difficult to image were the distal duodenum and right pancreatic limb, the entire jejunum, ileum, and cecum as well as the tail of the spleen. Endoscopic ultrasound allowed excellent visualization of the gastric wall and regional structures without interference with gas artefacts. Centrally located organs such as the pancreas could be well examined transgastrically with endoscopic ultrasound without interference by overlying intestinal segments as is common with transabdominal ultrasound...|$|R
40|$|The {{postoperative}} recurrence rate after colorectal liver metastases (CLM) resection often exceeds 50 %. 1 Chemotherapy {{has been}} associated with a significant decrease of CLM recurrence rate. 2 Several prognostic factors and clinical scores have been reported from surgical series. These prognostic factors and scores allow improved patient selection for hepatic resection and identify high-risk patients for recurrence who might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Among the different prognostic factors, presence of <b>hepatic</b> pedicle <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> metastases is now recognized {{to be one of the}} strongest risk factor for tumor relapse and for deleterious effect on survival. 3, 4 Interestingly, the survival rate is significantly higher when <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement is limited to the hepatoduodenal ligament and the retropancreatic area compared to patients with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement along the common hepatic artery and around the celiac axis.

Particles began to enter hepatic hilar nodes only after an interval of 7 - 8 h. They were subsequently redistributed from marginal, trabecular and medullary sinuses to the paracortex and finally to medullary cords. Particles accumulated predominantly in the paracortex at 12 - 24 h and thereafter in medullary cords.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of lymphocyte subpopulations (TCD 4 +, TCD 8 +, TCD 43 + and Ig+ cells), macrophages and eosinophils were analysed in the inflammatory infiltrates associated with hepatic lesions and in <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (HLN) from rats experimentally infected with F. hepatica and necropsied 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 week post infection (WPI). We also investigated the fixation of immunoglobulin isotypes on migrating flukes in the liver. As early as 1 WPI, portal tract areas surrounding migratory tunnels were infiltrated with immune and inflammatory cells. The dominant cells were eosinophils and to lesser extent, macrophages and lymphocytes (TCD 4 +, TCD 8 + and B). Most of the inflammatory and immune cells reached the posterior part of flukes, whereas {{in front of}} the parasites these cells were fewer in number. Except for eosinophils, no immune cells penetrated through granuloma consisting of hepatic necrotic cells. As early as 1 WPI, IgM could be detected in the liver, {{and to a lesser extent}} IgA, IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b. At 2 WPI, IgE and IgG 1, began being detected. IgG 2 c was detectable at 3 WPI. In HLN, we observed numerous microscopic follicles in the cortical zone with proliferation of germinal centres and medullary cords.

40|$|<b>Hepatic</b> artery <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (HALN) {{involvement}} is an adverse prognostic factor in patients treated for colorectal liver metastases. The prevalence of HALN positivity for mid-gut and hind-gut derived colonic tumours, for differing amounts of liver involvement, and for Dukes' A and B versus Dukes' C primary tumours was compared in 75 patients with colorectal liver metastases. All patients whose primary tumours did not invade <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (Dukes' A or B) had liver metastases {{that did not}} involve local hepatic nodes, regardless {{of the extent of}} the disease within the liver. This suggests that factors controlling metastasis are not identical with those which control lymphatic invasion in colorectal cancer.

40|$|Background: Liver {{resection}} {{is considered}} the best treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Several prognostic factors have been investigated, and many {{studies have shown that}} <b>hepatic</b> hilum <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> involvement has a negative impact on prognosis. The present study evaluated the frequency of microscopic involvement of hilar <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> through systematic lymphadenectomy and analysis of micrometastases in patients undergoing hepatectomy due to colorectal metastasis. Methods: A total of 28 patients underwent hepatic resection with hilar lymphadenectomy. <b>Lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> considered negative by conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were analyzed by serial sectioning with 100 -mu m intervals and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with antihuman pancytokeratin antibody AE 1 /AE 3. Results: In average, 6. 18 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were dissected per patient. No morbidity or mortality was associated to lymphadenectomy. In two patients, conventional H&E analysis showed presence of microscopic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis. H&E analysis allowed the identification of three other patients with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> micrometastases. The overall frequency of microscopic metastases, including micrometastasis, was 18 %. Conclusions: Systematic lymphadenectomy allowed the detection of microscopic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases, resulting in more accurate staging of extrahepatic disease. The inclusion of IHC increased the detection of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> micrometastasis. J. Surg. Oncol. 2009; 100 : 534 - 537. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|CONTEXT: Hepatectomy is the {{treatment}} of choice for colorectal liver metastases, and several studies have shown good results, with 5 -year survival rates ranging from 40 % to 57 %. Several clinical and pathological predictive factors for survival after liver resection have been studied. Involvement of the <b>hepatic</b> hilum <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> the incidence of which varies from 2 % to 10 %, indicates a poor long-term prognosis. RESULTS: Despite variable results, some authors have reported a not-insignificant improvement in survival rate in liver-metastasis patients with hilar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement who undergo combined liver resection and lymphadenectomy. Due to the low rates {{of morbidity and mortality}} for liver-resection surgery, several specialized centers perform liver resections combined with lymphadenectomies in selected cases. It {{should be noted that the}} therapeutic value of systemic lymphadenectomy is not yet entirely understood, and only controlled studies comparing groups with and without lymphadenectomy can fully resolve the issue. CONCLUSION: In any case, hilar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection has been shown to be a useful tool for improving the accuracy of extra hepatic disease staging, regardless of its impact on survival...|$|R

The {{nature of the}} local immune response was assessed by examining the distribution of CD 2 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 + and &# 947;´+ T lymphocytes along with IgG+, IL- 4 + and IFN-&# 947;+ cells in the liver and <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (HLN). The goats used consisted of group 1 (unimmunized and uninfected), group 2 [infected control - immunized with Quillaia A (Quil A) ] and group 3 (immunized with rSm 14 in Quil A and infected), each containing seven animals. Immunization with rSm 14 in Quil A adjuvant induced a reduction in gross hepatic lesions of 56. 6 % (p < 0. 001) and reduced hepatic and HLN infiltration of CD 2 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 + and &# 947;´+ T lymphocytes as well as IL- 4 + and IFN-&# 947;+ cells (p < 0. 05). This is the first report of caprine immunization against F. hepatica using a complete rSm 14 molecule derived from S. mansoni. Immunization reduced hepatic damage and local inflammatory infiltration into the liver and HLN. However, considering that Quil A is not the preferential/first choice adjuvant for Sm 14 immunization, further studies will be undertaken using the monophosphoryl lipid A-based family of adjuvants during clinical trials to facilitate anti-Fasciolavaccine development...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Infection with Mycobacterium microti {{can cause}} chronic disease in animals and {{threaten}} human health through its zoonotic potential. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical findings, diagnostic investigations, necropsy, and epidemiology results in South American camelids (SAC) infected with M. microti, {{member of the}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. ANIMALS: Eleven SAC with tuberculous lesions. METHODS: Description of 10 llamas and 1 alpaca, aged 4 - 18 years, from 6 herds {{with a history of}} wasting and weakness admitted to the Vetsuisse-Faculty of Berne over 8 years. RESULTS: Clinical signs included weight loss, recumbency, and anorexia in late stages of the disease. Respiratory problems were seen in 6 animals of 11. No consistent hematologic abnormalities were identified. Suspect animals were examined in detail by abdominal ultrasonography and thoracic radiology. Abnormal findings such as enlarged mediastinal, mesenteric, or <b>hepatic</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were seen only in animals with advanced disease. Single comparative intradermal tuberculin test with bovine protein purified derivate (PPD) and avian PPD was negative in all animals. At necropsy, typical tuberculous lesions were found, and confirmed by bacteriological smear and culture, molecular methods, or both. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Infection caused by M. microti should be considered a differential diagnosis in chronic debilitating disease with or without respiratory signs in SAC. Antemortem confirmation of the diagnosis remains challenging at any stage of infection. Because cases of M. microti infection have been reported in immunocompromized human patients, the zoonotic potential of the organism should be kept in mind when dealing with this disease in SAC...|$|R
