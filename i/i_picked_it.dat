500|$|While touring rigorously {{in support}} of Happiness... in mid-2000, Mike Turner came across The Age of Spiritual Machines, a 1999 book by {{inventor}} and futurist Ray Kurzweil. [...] "I happened to be lucky enough to discover a really shiny book cover in a book store." [...] Turner stated, [...] "I wish I could say it was like, 'Well, I've been on this intellectual quest.' <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up, read it and went mental." [...] Becoming fascinated by the futuristic ideology of the book, he proceeded {{to share it with}} the other band members, reading them passages on their tour bus over the next several months.|$|E
2500|$|The BPD's {{handling}} {{of this incident}} has been criticized by some Boston residents and justified by others: [...] "We all thought it was pretty funny," [...] said one student. [...] "The majority of us recognize {{the difference between a}} bomb and a Lite-Brite," [...] said another. One resident said that the police response was [...] "silly and insane," [...] and that [...] "Weâ€™re the laughing stock." [...] Another resident said that the device [...] "looked like a bomb. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up, pulled the tape off it, and there were batteries, two on the top and three on the bottom." [...] The same devices had been distributed in nine other cities across the USA without provoking a similar reaction. The United States Department of Homeland Security praised Boston authorities [...] "for sharing their knowledge quickly with Washington officials and the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

6000|$|... "An' is it goin' to be wasted?" [...] said Morel. [...] "I'm {{not such}} a extravagant mortal as you lot, with your waste. If I drop a bit of bread at pit, in all the dust an' dirt, <b>I</b> <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up an' eat it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm dead sure there's {{one right}} here," [...] said the captain, looking through his glasses. [...] "I can't {{understand}} why <b>I</b> can't <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up. Send {{one of the}} boys up the mast to have a look." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "When I {{was leaving}} Rio Frio, I found a crimson rose on the pavement. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up because I ventured {{to think it}} was meant for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--pretty little thing! <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up in Holland;" [...] {{as though}} he had found it by the roadside, and slipped it into his {{umbrella}} when nobody was looking! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up," [...] <b>I</b> gurgled feebly, as I got {{on to my}} feet again, and it is {{a solemn}} fact that my mind was so {{disturbed}} that at the moment I could remember nothing else about the ring except that <b>I</b> had <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up in Leo's cave.|$|R
60|$|It {{was almost}} eight {{before he got}} the draft {{finished}} to his satisfaction, and <b>I</b> had <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> out on the typewriter. As I handed it to him, my chief held it a moment, gazing at me with an odd smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was when}} I was {{asking him to}} let me look inside the cab. I had grasped {{the handle of the}} door, when he {{suddenly}} struck my hat, causing it to fly off. And, while <b>I</b> was <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> up, he drove away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I believe <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> {{up in the}} colonies." [...] Then he added, sullenly, [...] "I suppose I shouldn't use slang in {{speaking}} to you. I beg your pardon." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up. It was {{a common}} square envelope. Thinking it {{contained}} a letter I {{turned it over to}} read the address. Judge of my astonishment when I read the following:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The letter {{had fallen}} on to the floor. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up. The {{handwriting}} was very broken. The address gave a village some few miles away; the date was three days before.|$|E
6000|$|... "The place I mean is the loneliest {{place in}} the neighborhood. You have no prying eyes to dread there. <b>I</b> have <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> out {{expressly}} for that reason.

60|$|This {{fragment}} is {{the translation}} of part of some German work, whose title I have vainly endeavoured to discover. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up, dirty and torn, some years ago, in Lincoln's-Inn Fields.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I'm {{afraid it}} has spoilt your {{beautiful}} bust, for it passed {{right through the}} head and flattened itself on the wall. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up from the carpet. Here it is!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's clever," [...] he said, {{slowly and}} perplexedly, when I had finished. [...] "It's damned clever, but somehow {{it looks to}} me all wrong. <b>I</b> can't <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> to pieces." [...] He got up rather heavily. [...] "I--I guess I ought to be going.

6000|$|... "There {{were lots}} of cross goddesses," [...] I said rather crossly myself; for I saw that, after having trodden my romance in the dust, she was willing <b>I</b> should <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up again and shake it off, and I wished to show her that I {{was not to be}} so lightly appeased.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Gavin Ogilvy is your name,' I said. 'No,' you answered, 'I {{have a new}} name. My mother telled me my name is aye to be Gavin Dishart now.

6000|$|... "Blood," [...] she explained. [...] "I had a bet with Alan that I'd get a brace {{more than}} Flo; that's why I went after a cripple {{running in the}} ling. It wasn't dead when <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> up--rather horrid, wasn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You push me to {{the bald}} fact," [...] he declared; [...] "you are not in sympathy with my argument. But I will answer you so.

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> saw Carson <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up {{from the}} spot where I threw it," [...] {{returned}} Saunders. [...] "This puts a new face on the matter," [...] he added, with a sharp look at Ferris.|$|R
6000|$|Query--How long is {{it since}} I heard that strain of dulcet mood, and where or how came <b>I</b> to <b>pick</b> <b>it</b> up?
