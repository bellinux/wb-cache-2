50|$|Panini and Yaska, two celebrated ancient {{scholars}} of Vyakarana, are both dated to several centuries {{prior to the}} start of the common era, likely the 5th-century BCE.

In Deuteronomy, however an allusion is made to a third potential <b>etymology</b> <b>-</b> that it may be connected with zibhe, literally meaning sacrifice, in reference to commercial activities of the tribe of Zebulun - a commercial agreement made at Mount Tabor between the tribe of Zebulun and a group of non-Israelites was referred to as zibhe-tzedek, literally meaning sacrifice to justice or sacrifice to Tzedek.|$|E

5000|$|The Greek word kentauros is {{generally}} regarded as of obscure origin.

Another possible related etymology can be [...] "bull-slayer". Some [...] say that the Greeks took the constellation of Centaurus, and also its name [...] "piercing bull", from Mesopotamia, where it symbolized the god Baal who represents rain and fertility, fighting with and piercing with his horns the demon Mot who represents the summer drought.
