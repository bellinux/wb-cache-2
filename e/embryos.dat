5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have {{swept across the}} asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative action of the resonances and the <b>embryos</b> either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive <b>embryos</b> too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary <b>embryos</b> left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} <b>embryos,</b> tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile <b>embryos</b> develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the <b>embryos</b> of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird <b>embryos</b> that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E

To clarify the cytological mechanism of <b>embryo</b> sac abortion, the megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis in an autotetraploid japonica/indica hybrid were examined by the whole-mount eosin B-staining confocal laser scanning microscopy (WE-CLSM) technique. Abnormalities were observed from the megasporocyte stage to the mature <b>embryo</b> sac stage. The degeneration of the tetrad cells and the functional megaspore was the characteristic of abnormalities during megasporogenesis.

5|$|Mating in the tawny {{nurse shark}} is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the <b>embryos</b> hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non-viable egg capsules, {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The {{tawny nurse shark}} is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing <b>embryos</b> exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous <b>embryos.</b> Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the <b>embryos</b> are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny {{nurse shark}} tends {{to spend the day}} resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} inside caves or under ledges.

The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the <b>embryos</b> hatch from egg capsules inside the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the <b>embryos</b> are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while inside the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term <b>embryos.</b>|$|E

5|$|The last {{stage of}} rocky planet {{formation}} is the merger stage. It begins when {{only a small}} number of planetesimals remains and <b>embryos</b> become massive enough to perturb each other, which causes their orbits to become chaotic. During this stage <b>embryos</b> expel remaining planetesimals, and collide with each other. The result of this process, which lasts for 10 to 100million years, is the formation of a limited number of Earth sized bodies. Simulations show that the number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5. In the Solar System they may be represented by Earth and Venus. Formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10–20 <b>embryos,</b> while an equal number of them were thrown out of the Solar System. Some of the <b>embryos,</b> which originated in the asteroid belt, are thought to have brought water to Earth. Mars and Mercury may be regarded as remaining <b>embryos</b> that survived that rivalry. Rocky planets, which have managed to coalesce, settle eventually into more or less stable orbits, explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to the limit; or, in other words, why they always appear to be at the brink of instability.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} a {{planetary}} system {{adjacent to the}} giant planets will be influenced in a different way. In such a region, eccentricities of <b>embryos</b> may become so large that the <b>embryos</b> pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all <b>embryos</b> are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional consequence is that {{a huge number of}} small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without the help of <b>embryos.</b> The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the <b>embryos</b> before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4AU from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis.

5|$|<b>Embryos</b> {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure <b>embryos</b> affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free <b>embryos</b> are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{mackerel}} sharks, common threshers are aplacental viviparous. They {{give birth}} to litters of two to four (rarely six) pups in the eastern Pacific, and three to seven pups in the eastern Atlantic. They are believed to reproduce throughout their range; one known nursery area is the Southern California Bight. Breeding occurs in the summer, usually July or August, and parturition occurs from March to June following a gestation period of nine months. The developing <b>embryos</b> are oophagous, feeding on eggs ovulated by the mother. The teeth of small <b>embryos</b> are peg-like and non-functional, being covered by a sheath of soft tissues.

5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} <b>embryos</b> exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment.

Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing <b>embryos</b> eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest <b>embryos</b> eat weaker and smaller siblings.
