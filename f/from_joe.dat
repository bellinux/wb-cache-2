Bob Kelly scored for the fourth game in succession and Joe Anderson scored four goals as Burnley won the match 7–3, {{the first time the}} team had scored seven goals in a competitive match away from home.

Strips <b>from</b> <b>Joe</b> 90 Top Secret were reprinted in a new publication, Joe 90, which was launched to tie in with the 1994 BBC re-runs but which also, after just seven issues, merged into a related comic, on this occasion Fleetway's Thunderbirds. Other Joe 90 print media include 1968 and 1969 Joe 90 annuals from Century 21 Publishing and two short paperback novels, Joe 90 and the Raiders (by Tod Sullivan) and Joe 90 in Revenge (by Howard Elson), published by May Fair Books.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{improvisation}} {{took place}} during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film.

This success was followed by a 2–1 friendly victory over a Scottish Football League XI in a benefit match for Celtic winger Patsy Gallacher. Burnley also participated in the Lancashire Senior Cup; the league matches against Blackburn Rovers and Preston North End also counted as group stage matches in the competition. The team won all four of these games to qualify for the semi-finals, where they were drawn against Manchester City.

He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{carried their}} good form into March; Bottrill scored {{for the first}} time in over two months to help the team defeat New Brighton by five clear goals. This seventh {{straight}} win closed the gap between Nelson and Darlington to five points, with the league leaders having played three more matches. In an attempt to push for the title the Nelson directors invested in two new players in March; inside forward John Stevenson arrived from Second Division side Bury for a fee of £500, while Fred Laycock joined Nelson from Barrow. However, the team suffered their first loss of 1925 in of the following match away at Grimsby Town as goals <b>from</b> <b>Joe</b> Cooper and Frank McKenna gave the home side a 2–0 win. This was followed by another defeat four days later; a goal on debut for Stevenson could not prevent Lincoln City winning by two goals to one. On 21 March Nelson returned to winning ways with a 2–0 defeat of Hartlepools United at Seedhill, and later the same week Eddleston scored his second hat-trick of the campaign as struggling Hartlepools were beaten 4–2 in the reverse fixture. A first goal in Nelson colours for Laycock secured a third successive win away at Rochdale on 28 March.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 2008, first City's keeper Donovan Ricketts {{was blocked}} from {{coming back into}} the country {{following}} a Jamaica call-up, before City lost 2–1 at Rochdale, following a late winning goal from Rochdale's Adam Le Fondre. City returned to winnings ways four days later, when Eddie Johnson scored the only goal of a 1–0 victory over Morecambe. Johnson scored for a second successive game, three days later to secure a 1–1 draw with Barnet in a rearranged game at Valley Parade. A second successive draw on 12 April, this time 2–2 against Brentford, meant that City could no longer reach the play-offs, ensuring that they would again be playing in League Two during 2008–09. A late goal <b>from</b> <b>Joe</b> Colbeck on 19 April prevented a third successive draw and gave City a 2–1 victory over Grimsby Town. Colbeck was named the club's player of the season at the annual award ceremony on 23 April, but was sent off in the club's final home of the season against Milton Keynes Dons. Bradford were already 2–0 behind when Colbeck was dismissed, and despite a goal from Omar Daley, they lost 2–1, which crowned Milton Keynes as the league champions.|$|E

The 49ers scored the only {{touchdown}} {{of the game in}} the second quarter on a 23-yard pass <b>from</b> <b>Joe</b> Montana to John Taylor. With four minutes left, they stopped the Giants on four passes from the 49ers' 9-yard line and went on to win, 7–3, after which 49ers safety Ronnie Lott and Simms had a heated verbal exchange. The Giants defense performed well in the loss. They held the 49ers to 152 passing yards, 88 rushing yards, and limited All-Pro Wide receiver Jerry Rice to one reception for 13yards. 49ers defensive end Charles Haley recorded five tackles, 1.5 sacks, and two forced fumbles in the victory.|$|E
