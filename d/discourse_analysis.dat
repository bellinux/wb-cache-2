40|$|This is a R&D Paper. It {{describes}} an analysis {{coming from a}} research project about opinion measurement and monitoring on the Internet. This research is realized within "Paragraphe" laboratory, {{in partnership with the}} market research institute Harris Interactive (CIFRE grant beginning July 2010). The {{purpose of the study was}} to define CRM possibilities. The targets of the study were self-employed workers and very small businesses. The <b>discourses</b> <b>analysis</b> is linked to a qualitative study. It turns around three types of discourses: brands, journalists and clients’ discourses. In the brand <b>discourses</b> <b>analysis</b> we benchmarked brand websites belonging to several businesses. In this first step, we tried to identify the most used words and promises by brands to the target we were studying. For that benchmark, we downloaded "Professionals" sections of the websites. Clients’ <b>discourses</b> <b>analysis</b> is based on opened answers coming from satisfaction questionnaires. The questions we are studying have been asked after a call to a hot line or after a technician intervention. Journalists’ <b>discourses</b> <b>analysis</b> is based on articles, published on information websites specialized in Harris Interactive's client sector. These websites were chosen because we considered them to be representative of information sources, which the target could consult...|$|R

25|$|The {{study of}} parole (which manifests through {{cultural}} discourses and dialects) is {{the domain of}} sociolinguistics, the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain speech community (governed by {{its own set of}} grammatical rules and laws). <b>Discourse</b> <b>analysis</b> further examines the structure of texts and conversations emerging out of a speech community's usage of language. This is done through the collection of linguistic data, or through the formal discipline of corpus linguistics, which takes naturally occurring texts and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora (or corpus data).|$|E
25|$|Language, {{linguistics}} {{and discourse}} are active {{areas of study}} in the humanities, along with literature and the arts. <b>Discourse</b> <b>analysis</b> seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study {{of the ways in}} which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. Van Dijk (1992), for example, examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims. He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, The Souls of Black Folk by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early African-American literature that describes the author's experiences with racism when he was traveling in the South as an African American.|$|E

25|$|James Paul Gee {{was born}} in San José, California. He {{received}} his B.A. in philosophy from the University of California at Santa Barbara and both his M.A. and Ph.D in linguistics from Stanford University. He started his career in theoretical linguistics, working in syntactic and semantic theory, and taught initially at Stanford University {{and later in the}} School of Language and Communication at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. After doing some research in psycholinguistics at Northeastern University in Boston and at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, Prof. Gee's research focus switched to studies on <b>discourse</b> <b>analysis,</b> sociolinguistics, and applications of linguistics to literacy and education. He went on to teach in the School of Education at Boston University, where he was the chair of the Department of Developmental Studies and Counseling, and later in the Linguistics Department at the University of Southern California. At Boston University he established new graduate programs centered around an integrated approach to language and literacy, combining programs in reading, writing, bilingual education, ESL, and applied linguistics. From 1993 to 1997 he held the Jacob Hiatt Chair in Education in the Hiatt Center for Urban Education at Clark University in Massachusetts. From 1997 until 2007, he held the Tashia Morgridge Professor of Reading at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E
500|$|Svärd, {{taking a}} more {{empirical}} approach {{than many other}} contributors, explores laws surrounding animal welfare in early 20th century Sweden. He seeks to offer an empirical grounding for the argument that animal welfarism is problematic for animals, entrenching harmful use and speciesism. He analyses all official documentation from the Riksdag from 1900–1944 {{on the subject of}} animal slaughter and welfare drawing upon Foucauldian policy analysis and poststructuralist <b>discourse</b> <b>analysis.</b> He conceives of the debates as a political problematisation in which (drawing upon Lacanian psychoanalysis) animal cruelty was blamed on certain [...] "other" [...] groups (such as Jews and Sami). He argues that animal welfarism was not the natural continuation of an old anti-cruelty discourse, but that Sweden's 1937 regulation of slaughter and 1944 animal protection laws served to reconstitute, reaffirm and expand speciesist relations, paving the way for animal exploitation's expansion.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} policy {{discourse}} comprises actor-centered and content-oriented approaches. We attempt {{to close the}} gap between the two kinds of approaches by introducing a new methodology for the <b>analysis</b> of political <b>discourse</b> called <b>Discourse</b> Network <b>Analysis.</b> It is based on social network analysis and qualitative content analysis and takes an entirely relational perspective. Political discourse can be analyzed in a dynamic way, and the approach makes previously unobservable cleavage lines and alignments measurable at the actor level, {{at the level of the}} contents of a discourse, and a combined layer. We compare <b>discourse</b> network <b>analysis</b> with political claims analysis, a competing method, and apply both methods to the European-level discourse on software patents.

2500|$|An {{influential}} {{development in}} British studies of intonation has been Discourse Intonation, {{an offshoot of}} <b>Discourse</b> <b>Analysis</b> first put forward by David Brazil. This approach lays great emphasis on the communicative and informational use of intonation, pointing out its use for distinguishing between presenting new information and referring to old, shared information, as well as signalling the relative status of participants in a conversation (e.g. teacher-pupil, or doctor-patient) and helping to regulate conversational turn-taking.

2500|$|Other critics {{point out}} that there is little if {{anything}} that can unequivocally be called universal across the world's languages.

[...] What these critiques have in common is the claim that the analysis of I-language does not carry over to E-language.
