5|$|At SuperBrawl VII on February 23, 1997, the <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear {{competed in}} a Three Way match. They faced The Public Enemy and Harlem Heat but lost when Rocco Rock from The Public Enemy pinned The Barbarian. At Fall Brawl 1997, The Barbarian and Meng faced Wrath and Mortis. Because Wrath and Mortis {{were part of}} a heel group, WCW had the <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear compete as faces during the match. Wrath and Mortis won the match, as Wrath pinned Meng for the victory. The <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear were {{successful}} at World War 3 1997, however, when they defeated the team of Glacier and Ernest Miller.|$|E

5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign {{they were to be}} executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made to sit, with Crawford and Knight a short distance away from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims and slapped the bloody scalps in the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5|$|Link: The <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure {{are three}} action-adventure games {{produced}} by Philips for the CD-i {{as part of}} Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games owe their existence to negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have Philips create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i third-party developer games. The <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994. The games were given little funding or time for completion, and Nintendo provided only cursory input.|$|E
5|$|Reversing the {{traditional}} Link-saves-Zelda plotline, Wand of Gamelon stars Zelda as she adventures to rescue Link {{and her father}} the king who have not returned from their quest. As with <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Evil, the game was patterned most closely upon Nintendo's previous side-scroller, , and again features outsourced Russian animation for all cutscenes. Despite the game's similarly positive contemporary reception along with <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Evil, modern critics have almost unanimously derided and ridiculed the game for its inability {{to live up to}} modern expectations with the animated cutscenes again having become a particular target of negative reception.|$|E

50|$|To further brand exposure, {{the company}} signs celebrities for ad campaigns. Brenda Song was the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Bebe's 2007 ad campaign. The company signed actresses Rebecca Romijn as the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Bebe from Spring 2007 through Spring 2008 and Eva Longoria as the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> BebeSport from spring 2007 through spring 2009. Mischa Barton was the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> Bebe's 2006 ad campaign.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear {{eventually}} split up, as Meng turned face. The former partners {{faced each}} other at Road Wild 1998; The Barbarian had heel manager Jimmy Hart in his corner. Meng won the match, but The Barbarian, Hugh Morrus and Hart attacked him after the match. Hart later convinced The Barbarian and Meng to reconcile, however, and they wrestled as a tag team again as part of Hart's First Family stable. The <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear entered a tournament for the WCW World Tag Team Championship in early 1999 after an injury to co-champion Rick Steiner caused the belts to be vacated. According {{to the rules of}} the tournament, teams had to lose two matches before they were eliminated. The <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear won one match in the tournament, defeating the team of David Taylor and Fit Finlay on the January 25 episode of WCW Monday Nitro. However, they were eliminated after losses to the team of Mike Enos and Bobby Duncum, Jr. and the team of Horace Hogan and Brian Adams. In the latter match, The Barbarian attacked Meng, which caused the loss and led to the team splitting up for good.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Dungeon of Doom and the Four Horsemen broke down {{as a result of}} Kevin Sullivan's feud with Horsemen member Chris Benoit. As a result, the <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear were booked to face Benoit and Steve McMichael, another member of the Four Horsemen, at Halloween Havoc 1996. Benoit pinned Meng to win the match for the Horsemen team. The Barbarian and Meng's next major appearance was at Starrcade 1996, when they faced Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, who were members of another rival heel stable known as the New World Order. Hall and Nash's WCW World Tag Team Championship was on the line, but the <b>Faces</b> <b>of</b> Fear were unable to win the belts, as Nash pinned The Barbarian.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are {{somewhat}} oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the tubes) are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> his characters.|$|E
5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E

[...] Would not the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the cherub and the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> a man be the same? The Gemara answered that one was a big face, and the other was a small face.|$|R

5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
