500|$|Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) becomes {{engaged to}} her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who {{strongly}} believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion.

Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to have, before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls.

He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches!
