40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{computer}} <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> technology is a vital component for lighting designers. Lighting computer programs are preferred in preparing architectural projects <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> techniques, especially <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> calculations. Lighting computer programs, which arise with the aim of helping lighting designers, gain more interest day by day. The most important property of lighting computer programs is the ability to enable the simulation of lighting projects without requiring any real life applications. In addition, with the use of lighting computer programs, incomplete parts of projects are determined to make necessary calculations. In this study, the details about lighting computer programs, especially as used <b>in</b> interior <b>lighting,</b> are mentioned. A comparison of programs will be made by pointing out necessary characteristics <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> computer programs...|$|R
50|$|The {{usage of}} Brush {{electric}} arc lights spread quickly. Scientific American reported in 1881 {{that the system}} was being used in:800 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> rolling mills, steel works, shops, 1,240 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> woolen, cotton, linen, silk, and other factories, 425 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> large stores, hotels, churches, 250 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> parks, docks, and summer resorts, 275 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> railroad depots and shops, 130 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> mines, smelting works, 380 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> factories and establishments of various kinds, 1,500 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> <b>lighting</b> stations, for city <b>lighting,</b> 1,200 <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> England and other foreign countries.A total of over 6,000 lights which are actually sold.|$|R

5|$|Although much of Thoughts {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman.

5|$|An urban {{district}} council {{had been considered}} a year previously, <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the expansion of areas within the parish, particularly Northwood. A report was prepared in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood—2,700 by that time, with 530 houses—compared with the largely rural character {{of the rest of}} Ruislip parish. The Metropolitan Railway extension from Harrow to Uxbridge was also discussed at the meeting on 28 October 1903, as a station was to be opened in Ruislip on the line. Kings College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish, were planning to sell some for development <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of the new line. As a result of these events, the council voted in favour of becoming an {{urban district}}.|$|E
5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is {{the interdependence of}} the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism.

5|$|At the conference, <b>in</b> <b>light</b> of {{the little}} {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed {{on how to do}} so. Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E
