5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|Attalus was now {{forced to}} return to Asia, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned at Opus that, at the {{instigation}} of Philip, Prusias I king of Bithynia, related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Soon after, the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal, their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved. In 206BC the Aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by Philip. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205BC, formally ending the First Macedonian War. Attalus was included as an adscriptus {{on the side of}} Rome. He retained Aegina, but had accomplished little else. Since Prusias was also included in the treaty, the war between Attalus and Prusias must also have ended by that time.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston was not exiled immediately; he did {{not have}} to leave the realm until 25 June, but faced excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, should he return. Edward used the {{intervening}} period to provide for his favourite's continued prosperity and political importance. As a compensation for the loss of the earldom of Cornwall, which was another condition of the exile, Gaveston was granted land worth 3,000 marks annually in Gascony, and land amounting to the same value in England. Further to this, he was appointed the King's Lieutenant of Ireland, so that a certain amount of honour could be maintained despite the humiliation of the exile. The appointment came the day after Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, had been given the same position, indicating that it was an improvised measure. Gaveston's appointment came with wider authority than Ulster's, however, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> full regal powers to appoint and dismiss any royal officers.|$|E

5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account <b>for.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
25|$|Guy thus {{ordered the}} army to march against Saladin at Tiberias, which is indeed just what Saladin had planned, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{calculated}} that he could defeat the crusaders only in a field battle rather than by besieging their fortifications.|$|E
25|$|Bernard, {{the first}} prior of the house, was closely {{associated}} with the introduction of Austin Canons into England, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> accompanied his brother Norman (afterwards prior of St. Botolph's, Colchester, and then of Holy Trinity, London) to Chartres and Beauvais, in Anselm's time, to learn the rule of St. Augustine, with a view to introduce it into England.|$|E

25|$|Three goddesses {{claimed the}} apple: Hera, Athena and Aphrodite. They asked Zeus to judge {{which of them}} was fairest, and {{eventually}} he, reluctant to favor any claim himself, declared that Paris, a Trojan mortal, would judge their cases, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> recently shown his exemplary fairness in a contest in which Ares in bull form had bested Paris's own prize bull, and the shepherd-prince had unhesitatingly awarded the prize to the god.|$|E
25|$|Shidibala, {{the young}} emperor, however, {{did not sit}} with folded hands. The throne soon {{became the focus of}} loyalty for the Confucian scholar-officials in their {{struggle}} against the powerful Temüder. Shidibala was prepared for such a role, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been as well educated in Chinese as his father had been. Deeply affected by Confucianism as well as by Buddhism, Shidebala could cite Tang poems from memory and also was a creditable calligrapher.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{had heard}} that there were 500 poorly {{supplied}} French troops at Fort Duquesne, and thus he led the 300 Virginians out of Great Meadows on June 16 to widen the road, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been unable to convince the other chiefs to assist. They had {{said that they would}} also be unable to help the Virginians. Although he had lost Indian support, which made his troops more vulnerable to attack, Washington continued to widen the road towards Red Stone Creek.|$|E

25|$|When Theseus {{abandoned}} Ariadne {{sleeping on}} Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but {{he committed suicide}} or was killed by Perseus. In some variants, he had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another different account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne {{on the island of}} Naxos <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her.|$|E
25|$|During his {{lifetime}} Lorenzo Lotto was a well respected painter and certainly popular in Northern Italy; he is traditionally {{included in the}} Venetian School, but his independent career actually places him outside the Venetian art scene. He was certainly not as highly regarded in Venice as in the other towns where he worked, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a stylistic individuality, even an idiosyncratic style and, after his death, he gradually became neglected and then almost forgotten; this {{could be attributed to}} the fact that his oeuvre now remains in lesser known churches or in provincial museums.|$|E
25|$|Gambetta {{rendered}} France three inestimable services: by preserving her self-respect {{through the}} gallantry {{of the resistance}} he organized during the Franco-Prussian War, by his tact in persuading extreme partisans to accept a moderate Republic, and by his energy in overcoming the usurpation attempted by the advisers of Marshal MacMahon. His death at forty-four cut short a career which had given promise of still greater things, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> real statesmanship in his conceptions {{of the future of}} his country, and he had an eloquence which would have been potent in the education of his supporters.|$|E

25|$|By 1924, he had {{qualified}} {{to play for}} Lancashire, initially, because of his League commitments, in midweek games only. Again, he was a sensation. In his first full season, 1925, he took 205 wickets, and in the five seasons from 1926 to 1930, Lancashire won the County Championship four times, the most successful period in the county's history. In all, he took 1053 wickets for Lancashire. His value to the county was recognised in the award of a benefit in 1929, an unusually fast reward, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been playing county cricket for only five seasons.|$|E
25|$|Hengist {{was struck}} by terror at the news of Vortigern's death and fled with his army beyond the Humber. He took courage at the {{approach}} of Aurelius and selected the bravest among his men to defend. Hengist told these chosen men not {{to be afraid of}} Aurelius, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> brought less than 10,000 Armorican Britons (the native Britons were hardly worth taking into account), while there were 200,000 Saxons. Hengist and his men advanced towards Aurelius in a field called Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near Sheffield), intending to take the Britons by surprise, but Aurelius anticipated them.|$|E
25|$|Chamberlin's {{report was}} {{subsequently}} {{published in the}} Christmas Eve 1900 edition of New York's The Sun newspaper. Chamberlin reported:The Rev. Mr. Ament, of the American Board of Foreign Missions, has returned from a trip which he made {{for the purpose of}} collecting indemnities for damages done by Boxers. Everywhere he went he compelled the Chinese to pay. He says that all his native Christians are now provided <b>for.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> 700 of them under his charge, and 300 were killed. He has collected 300 taels for each of these murders, and has compelled full payment for all the property belonging to Christians that was destroyed. He also assessed fines amounting to THIRTEEN TIMES the amount of the indemnity. This money will be used for the propagation of the Gospel.|$|E

25|$|The prime {{reason for}} their {{migrating}} was the rumour of the wealth and peace of Beleriand as {{it was during the}} Siege of Angband, but many Easterlings have journeyed on behalf of Morgoth the Dark Lord, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> secretly corrupted some tribes and chieftains to his service. The Dwarves of the Blue Mountains had reported to the Elven-lord Maedhros of the coming of Easterlings. Maedhros then decided to make alliance with them in hope of overthrowing Morgoth, and gave them wide lands in Lothlann and in East Beleriand to the south of the March of Maedhros. The most powerful of their chieftains with the greatest followings and authority were Bór and Ulfang; their men were marshalled and trained for war by the Sons of Fëanor, and more of their kinsfolk from Eriador were summoned.|$|E
25|$|Nehru and the Congress {{dominated}} Indian politics {{during the}} 1930s {{as the country}} moved towards independence. His idea of a secular nation-state was seemingly validated when the Congress, under his leadership, swept the 1937 provincial elections and formed the government in several provinces; on the other hand, the separatist Muslim League fared much poorer. But these achievements were seriously compromised {{in the aftermath of}} the Quit India Movement in 1942, which saw the British effectively crush the Congress as a political organisation. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> desired to support the Allied war effort during World War II, came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. The Muslim League under his old Congress colleague and now opponent, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had come to dominate Muslim politics in India. Negotiations between Nehru and Jinnah for power sharing failed and gave way to the independence and bloody partition of India in 1947.|$|E
25|$|In late 1860 President Buchanan was formulating his yearly State of the Union {{address to}} Congress, and asked Attorney General Black to offer {{insight into the}} {{legality}} and constitutionality of secession. Black then asked Stanton for advice. Stanton approved a strongly worded draft of Black's response to Buchanan, which denounced secession from the Union as illegal. Buchanan gave his address to Congress on December 3. Meanwhile, Buchanan's cabinet were growing more discontent with his handling of secession, and several members deemed him too weak on the issue. On December 5 his Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb resigned. On December 9 Secretary of State Lewis Cass, disgruntled over Buchanan's failure to defend the government's interests in the South, tendered his resignation. Black was nominated to replace Cass on December 12. About a week later, Stanton, {{at the time in}} Cincinnati, was told to come to Washington at once, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been confirmed by the Senate as Buchanan's new Attorney General. He was sworn in on December 20.|$|E
