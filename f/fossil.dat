5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} <b>fossil</b> plants, but traditionally includes the study of <b>fossil</b> algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and <b>fossil</b> organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic <b>fossil</b> organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} <b>fossil</b> record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the <b>fossil</b> record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no <b>fossil</b> record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the <b>fossil</b> Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but <b>fossil</b> crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fossil</b> Creek's steady flow, warmth, deep pools, {{and small}} waterfalls attract {{visitors}} who wade, swim, float, kayak, and snorkel in its waters. Four named hiking paths intersect the <b>Fossil</b> Creek corridor: the Flume–Irving, <b>Fossil</b> Springs, Mail, and Deadman Mesa trails. The U.S. Forest Service allows dispersed camping {{in some parts}} of the area but has made other parts, such as riparian zones, off-limits to overnight stays. Other activities in the area include wildlife viewing, photography, fishing, and visits to the remains of the Childs-Irving infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Lichen-like fossils {{have been}} found in the Doushantuo Formation in {{southern}} China dating back to 635–551Ma. Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen <b>fossil</b> is 400Ma; this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known sporocarp <b>fossil,</b> a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie Chert. The oldest <b>fossil</b> with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian. Rare in the <b>fossil</b> record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a taxon roughly equivalent to the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius leggetti) appeared during the late Cretaceous, 90Ma.|$|E

50|$|Of {{the many}} {{thousands}} of <b>fossils</b> recovered from Motsetsi, no hominid <b>fossils</b> have yet been found.

25|$|Most of the <b>fossils</b> {{are found}} as {{impressions}} of soft-bodied organisms {{in the shape}} of disks, ribbons or fronds. There are also trace <b>fossils</b> that provide evidence that some of these Precambrian organisms were most-likely worm-like creatures that were locomotive. Most of these <b>fossils</b> lack any recognizable heads, mouths or digestive organs, and are thought to have fed via absorptive mechanisms and symbiotic relationships with chemoautotrophs (Chemotroph), photoautotrophs (Phototroph) or osmoautotrophs. The ribbon-like <b>fossils</b> resemble tentacled organisms, and are thought to have fed by capturing prey. The frondose <b>fossils</b> resemble sea pens and other cnidarians. The trace <b>fossils</b> suggest that there were annelid type creatures, and the disk <b>fossils</b> resemble sponges. Despite these similarities, much of the identification is speculation since the <b>fossils</b> do not show very distinct structures. Other <b>fossils</b> do not resemble any known lineages.|$|R
5|$|Little <b>fossil</b> {{remains of}} bats exist, as their {{delicate}} skeletons do not fossilize very well. Only an estimated 12% {{of the bat}} <b>fossil</b> record is complete at the genus level. Most of the oldest known bat fossils were already very similar to modern microbats. Archaeopteropus, formerly classified as the earliest known megachiropteran, is now classified as a microchiropteran. The extinct bats Palaeochiropteryx tupaiodon and Hassianycteris kumari are the first <b>fossil</b> mammals to have their coloration discovered: both were reddish-brown.|$|E
5|$|Mary's mother Molly {{initially}} ran the <b>fossil</b> {{business after}} Richard's death, {{but it is}} unclear how much actual <b>fossil</b> collecting she did herself. As late as 1821, she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an upholsterer, but he remained active in the <b>fossil</b> business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary had assumed the leading role in the family business.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in the <b>fossil</b> record 25 million years ago, during the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American <b>fossil</b> record until the early Miocene.

5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the <b>fossil</b> record, because the <b>fossil</b> record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the <b>fossil</b> record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in a review of}} <b>fossil</b> birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina. Finds included an early Miocene loon Colymboides minutus, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern royal tern Sterna maxima, {{and a member of the}} crow genus, one of the few <b>fossil</b> passerine birds from that period. The review found that <b>fossil</b> birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually be placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E

As {{recreational}} use of <b>Fossil</b> Creek increased after 2008, accumulations of trash and human waste as well as damage to forests and stream banks became problematic. The Forest Service at times closes parts of Forest Road 708 (<b>Fossil</b> Creek Road) to limit danger from traffic jams. Campfires are prohibited between the <b>Fossil</b> Creek headwaters and the dry bed of Stehr Lake, and other restrictions apply.
