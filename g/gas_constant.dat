25|$|Technical {{literature}} can {{be confusing}} because many authors fail to explain {{whether they are}} using the ideal <b>gas</b> <b>constant</b> R, or the specific <b>gas</b> <b>constant</b> Rs. The {{relationship between the two}} constants is Rs = R / m, where m is the molecular mass of the gas.|$|E

25|$|Here ΔG {{is change}} in Gibbs free energy, ΔG° is the cell {{potential}} when Q {{is equal to}} 1, T is absolute temperature(Kelvin), R is the <b>gas</b> <b>constant</b> and Q is reaction quotient {{which can be found}} by dividing products by reactants using only those products and reactants that are aqueous or gaseous.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, all {{volume flow}} {{specifications}} require the additional specification of density. Bernoulli's fluid dynamic principal {{is of great}} value in understanding this problem.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of varying the jet exhaust ratio of specific heats, <b>gas</b> <b>constants,</b> and temperatures on jet interference on afterbody drag. Jet exhaust simulation parameters were also evaluated. In addition to air, three other exhaust gases, each with a different value of each of the gas parameters, were tested. The range of the ratios of specific heats, <b>gas</b> <b>constants,</b> and total temperatures of the four gases are identified. Tests were made using a single nacelle model with afterbodies having boattail angles of 10 degrees and 20 degrees with sonic and Mach two jet exits. Wind tunnel tests were conducted through a Mach number range of 0. 60 to 1. 20 and a Reynolds number per meter from 10. 06 million to 14. 05 million...|$|R
50|$|The Wohl {{equation}} (named after A. Wohl) is {{formulated in}} terms of critical values, making it useful when real <b>gas</b> <b>constants</b> are not available, but it cannot be used for high densities, as for example the critical isotherm shows a drastic decrease of pressure when the volume is contracted beyond the critical volume.|$|R
25|$|It {{follows that}} the heat {{capacity}} of the gas is (3/2)NkB and hence, in particular, the heat capacity of a mole of such gas particles is (3/2)NAkB= (3/2)R, where NA is the Avogadro constant and R is the <b>gas</b> <b>constant.</b> Since R ≈ 2 cal/(mol·K), equipartition predicts that the molar heat capacity of an ideal gas is roughly 3cal/(mol·K). This prediction is confirmed by experiment.|$|E
25|$|By taking N {{to be the}} Avogadro {{constant}} NA, {{and using}} the relation R= NAkB between the <b>gas</b> <b>constant</b> R and the Boltzmann constant kB, this provides {{an explanation for the}} Dulong–Petit law of specific heat capacities of solids, which stated that the specific heat capacity (per unit mass) of a solid element is inversely proportional to its atomic weight. A modern version is that the molar heat capacity of a solid is 3R≈ 6cal/(mol·K).|$|E
25|$|Here {{the first}} {{equality}} {{follows from the}} first part of Einstein's theory, the third equality follows from the definition of Boltzmann's constant as kB = R / N, and the fourth equality follows from Stokes' formula for the mobility.
