5|$|In 1961, {{the studio}} {{released}} One Hundred and One Dalmatians, an animated feature which popularized {{the use of}} xerography {{during the process of}} <b>inking</b> and painting traditional animation cels. Using xerography, animation drawings could be photochemically transferred rather than traced from paper drawings to the clear acetate sheets ("cels") used in final animation production. The resulting art style– a scratchier line which revealed the construction lines in the animators' drawings– typified Disney films into the 1980s. The film was a success, being the tenth highest-grossing film of 1961 with rentals of $6.4 million.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} characters, Kishimoto {{consistently}} follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, <b>inking,</b> shading, and coloring. These steps are followed {{when he is}} drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, {{the cover of the}} Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ink</b> {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity}} of <b>ink</b> in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of <b>ink</b> to the distribution rollers from the <b>ink</b> fountain roller and the <b>ink</b> ductor roller. The <b>ink</b> ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the <b>ink</b> fountain roller and an <b>ink</b> distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the <b>ink</b> fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is <b>inked.</b> The ductor then swings forward to contact an <b>ink</b> distribution roller and transfers <b>ink</b> to it. There are generally two types of <b>ink</b> distribution rollers: the <b>ink</b> rotating rollers (or <b>ink</b> transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the <b>ink</b> oscillating rollers (or <b>ink</b> vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The <b>ink</b> distribution rollers receive <b>ink</b> and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the <b>ink</b> form rollers. A thin layer of <b>ink</b> is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the <b>ink</b> form rollers.|$|R

40|$|Some of the {{advantageous}} {{characteristics of}} ultra violet <b>ink</b> {{are said to}} be the absence of pollution and reasonable energy consumption as well as rapid drying (curing). Little is published about physical properties or print quality. Printers require information in this regard because the reports which are presently available are not clear and lack in detail. If the printability of UV <b>inks</b> were equal to that of conventional offset <b>ink,</b> this <b>ink</b> would be close to an ideal <b>ink.</b> This work was under taken so as to compare the properties of ultraviolet <b>ink</b> with conventional offset <b>ink.</b> The <b>inks</b> selected for study were black sheet-fed offset. One type of ultraviolet <b>ink</b> and a similar type of conventional offset <b>ink</b> were used for comparison. Comparisons were made as to tack, specific gravity, density, printing sharpness, slur, resolution, gloss and dot gain. Since it was learned that the ultra violet <b>ink</b> rendered a lower print density than conventional offset <b>ink</b> when using the same amount of <b>ink,</b> the on-press experiment was performed in order to: 1. Compare both <b>inks</b> at equal solid <b>ink</b> density. 2. Compare both <b>inks</b> under equal press conditions. All variables applied to both <b>inks</b> were the same {{in order to make the}} conditions as similar as possible. The experimental results indicated that the tack of ultraviolet <b>ink</b> at 400 rpm. 90 F was about the same as the tack of conventional offset <b>ink</b> during the first two minutes, but with increased time, the tack of ultraviolet <b>ink</b> increased more rapidly. The misting and flying of both <b>inks</b> were judged to be equal at 400 rpm. 2 ̆ 7 The specific gravity of UV <b>ink</b> was higher than conventional offset <b>ink</b> and the optical density was shown to be lower when using the same amount of <b>ink.</b> This experimental result indicated that more volume and more weight of UV <b>ink</b> had to be used to produce an optical density equal to conventional offset <b>ink.</b> At equal solid <b>ink</b> density, UV <b>ink</b> had much more dot gain than conventional <b>ink</b> at both low and high <b>ink</b> film thickness. The two <b>inks</b> were significantly different in terms of printing sharpness, slur, resolution and gloss. Printing sharpness, resolution and gloss were significantly effected by changing <b>ink</b> film thickness. The conventional offset <b>ink</b> provided better printing sharpness, gloss, resolution and less slur than UV <b>ink</b> at both low and high <b>ink</b> levels, with the exception that the slur values were approximately equal at low <b>ink</b> level. At equal press conditions (unequal solid <b>ink</b> density), the dot gain of the two <b>inks</b> was not much different. But it was obvious that the more <b>ink</b> film thickness or density, the more dot gain with UV <b>ink.</b> The two <b>inks</b> were significantly different in printing sharpness and gloss but not significantly different in slur and resolution. The change in <b>ink</b> film thickness affected printing sharpness, gloss and resolution. At high <b>ink</b> film thickness, the UV <b>ink</b> had lower printing sharpness, gloss and resolution than the conventional offset <b>ink.</b> The change in <b>ink</b> film thickness did not have much effect on slur. This study indicates that UV <b>ink</b> needs further development in order to be comparable with the conventional offset <b>ink</b> in terms of print quality...|$|R
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand <b>inking</b> for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E

5|$|Vandersteen {{could no}} longer handle the work load on his own. In 1949, he hired his first collaborator, François-Joseph Herman. Herman stayed with Vandersteen only three years, but his tenure {{was the start of}} the large Studio Vandersteen, which has {{continued}} the series. He was followed by Karel Boumans in 1952, who was an anonymous contributor until 1959. He worked mainly for De grappen van Lambik, a Suske en Wiske spin-off Vandersteen created for the weekly newspaper De Bond, which ran from 24 January 1954 on. But he also inked many Suske en Wiske comics, including those in Tintin. Vandersteen devoted himself more and more towards the storytelling and the initial pencil drawing, which he considered the artistic process, while the <b>inking</b> was more of a craft.|$|E
5|$|When Frank Sels {{left the}} Studio in 1967, Karel Biddeloo took {{over most of}} the {{realistic}} series of Vandersteen.

At the start of the series, Vandersteen did most of the creative work, but after a few albums he left most of the work to Biddeloo. The series ended in 1974. Biddeloo then devoted most of his time to De Rode Ridder, where he started <b>inking</b> the stories by Vandersteen in 1967 and took completely over in 1969, when Vandersteen lost his interest. He continued working on it until his death in 2004.|$|E
5|$|After {{dropping}} out of college, Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash. His sister's boyfriend encouraged him {{to apply for a}} job at Pacific Title and Art, which produced title cards for motion pictures. While working there, Hanna's talent for drawing became evident, and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio, which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series. Despite a lack of formal training, Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department. Besides <b>inking</b> and painting, Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics. For the first several years of Hanna's employment, the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art's Leon Schlesinger, who released the Harman-Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1933, Hanna was one of the employees who followed them.|$|E

40|$|The flow {{characteristics}} of the <b>ink</b> on the <b>ink</b> fountain roller of offset printing machine {{is very important for}} the <b>ink</b> amount control and the <b>ink</b> amount control can determine the color quality of printing products. This study simulates first the <b>ink</b> flow of only one <b>ink</b> area using CFX fluid simulation software, then two situations are simulated to analyze how the <b>ink</b> area is affected by its adjacent <b>ink</b> areas on each side. In the first situation, the adjacent sides of the middle <b>ink</b> area have the same <b>ink</b> key opening size that is larger than that of the middle area. In the second situation, the adjacent sides of the middle <b>ink</b> area have different <b>ink</b> key opening size and each is smaller than that of the middle area. From the analysis it can be seen that, in the printing process, the pressure and speed and <b>ink</b> layer thickness of <b>ink</b> on the <b>ink</b> fountain roller are affected by the interaction between adjacent <b>ink</b> areas. Compared with previous work that is limited to analyze the <b>ink</b> {{flow characteristics}} of only one <b>ink</b> area, the study aims to analyze the <b>ink</b> flow characteristics under the interactional effect of adjacent <b>ink</b> areas.

40|$|The Yule-Nielsen {{modified}} spectral Neugebauer model enables predicting reflectance spectra from surface coverages. In {{order to}} provide high prediction accuracy, this model is enhanced with an <b>ink</b> spreading model accounting for physical dot gain. Traditionally, physical dot gain, also called mechanical dot gain, is modeled by one <b>ink</b> spreading curve per <b>ink.</b> An <b>ink</b> spreading curve represents the mapping between nominal to effective dot surface coverages when an <b>ink</b> halftone wedge is printed. In previous publications, we have shown that using one <b>ink</b> spreading curve per <b>ink</b> {{is not sufficient to}} accurately model physical dot gain, and that the physical dot gain of a specific <b>ink</b> is modified by the presence of other <b>inks.</b> We therefore proposed an <b>ink</b> spreading model taking all the <b>ink</b> superposition conditions into account. We now show that not all superposition conditions are useful and necessary when working with cyan, magenta, yellow, and black <b>inks.</b> We therefore study the influence of <b>ink</b> spreading in different superposition conditions on the accuracy of the spectral prediction model. Finally, we propose new, simplified <b>ink</b> spreading equations that better suit CMYK prints and are more resilient to noise.

5|$|Adams {{did work}} for {{publishers}} other than Marvel during the 1980s, {{as when he}} drew several pages of Batman #400 in 1986 and Action Comics Annual #1 in 1987. The latter {{is viewed as a}} turning point in Adam's drawing style, characterized by bulkier figures of Batman and Superman, though Adams explains that this was in part due to the influence of The Dark Knight Returns, and that the overall change in art was style partly due to deliberate experimentation on his part, and partly to Dick Giordano's <b>inking,</b> which exhibited a different line weight. That same year, he illustrated Gumby Summer Fun Special #1 by Comico Comics, a job he obtained through Comico editor Diana Schutz, an old friend who noticed the incidental images of Gumby that Adams had included in the pages of Longshot. Adams, who did not harbor fond memories of that cartoon as a child, and who feared he would be typecast as a Gumby artist if he took the job, told Schultz he would only do it if she could get Bob Burden to write it, on the assumption that Schultz would decline this condition. Schultz, who initially wanted Mark Evanier for the job, considered this, and eventually agreed to it after contacting Burden, who was enthusiastic about the idea. That book, which demonstrated Adams' versatility in handling comedy as well as superheroics, garnered him and Burden a 1988 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue. Adams would later illustrate a second Gumby book, Gumby's Winter Fun Special, which was written by Steve Purcell.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{investigate}} whether p 16 <b>INK</b> 4 and p 15 <b>INK</b> 4 B inhibit cellular proliferation and exert a growth suppressive effect on esophageal cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The growth suppressive effects of p 6 <b>INK</b> 4 and p 15 <b>INK</b> 4 B {{were evaluated by}} transfecting vectors containing the p 16 <b>INK</b> 4 cDNA or the p 15 <b>INK</b> 4 B cDNA, or both, constitutively driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, into two human esophageal cancer cell lines containing or lacking endogenous p 16 <b>INK</b> 4 and/or p 15 <b>INK</b> 4 B. RESULTS: These experiments demonstrated that in both cells lines tested, the numbers of cells surviving dramatically decreased in p 16 <b>INK</b> 4 -transfected and p 15 <b>INK</b> 4 B-transfected cells compared with control vector-transfected cells. There {{was no significant difference}} in the degree of growth inhibition between p 16 <b>INK</b> 4 -transfected and p 15 <b>INK</b> 4 B-transfected cell lines.

40|$|In offset lithography, <b>ink</b> {{has been}} shown to pickup {{significant}} quantities of fountain solution as emulsified droplets. Good printability of lithographic <b>inks</b> is dependent on the balance between the flow of <b>ink</b> and water (fountain solution).

Emulsification must be controlled by using the correct fountain solution and proper surface tension value of fountain solution. If <b>inks</b> do not properly emulsify, <b>ink</b> tack may vary on the press during printing. <b>Ink</b> tack is expected to strongly influence printability and runnability of offset lithographic <b>inks.</b> Tack measurement is used as a production control testing and for the assessment of paper surface strength. The purpose of this thesis was to determine the relationship between emulsification and tack of offset lithographic <b>inks.</b> This research studied the water pickup characteristics of <b>ink</b> using different fountain solution surface tension values and different fountain solution. To observe any differences due to <b>ink</b> vehicle, three different oil-based inks: conventional, soybean, and vegetable were used and studied [...] For increased understanding of the relationship between emulsification and tack, an inkometer was used to study the <b>ink</b> tack response of different emulsified <b>inks</b> and the <b>inks</b> before emulsify fountain solution into their bodies. The effect of added water on the rheological properties (tack response) of unemulsified lithographic <b>ink</b> was also studied. This study indicates a change in water pickup characteristics due to surface tension value of fountain solution and the various fountain solutions tested. There is a significant effect due to the various oil-based <b>inks</b> on water pickup of the <b>ink.</b> Tack response is considerably affected by the capacity of the <b>ink</b> to pickup water.
