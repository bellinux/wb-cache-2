After months of practice, however, I realized that her summons was a valuable teaching. Not only did <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> many wonderful temples and meet extraordinary people, but Shihfu’s call taught me to stay alert in the moment and {{to be ready for}} anything.

30|$|I mean at {{my school}} we don’t really have many {{hands-on}} activities. It’s more of visual and audio learning. Like {{we do a lot}} of tests; {{we do a lot of}} things like that. And we really don’t get to do hands-on experimenting, and I am a pretty big hands-on learner, so it is hard for me to stay focused. It is hard for me to learn as fast as other people because I am more of a hands-on person. So, when there is a hands-on activity, I am really happy because I get [to] learn. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> I get to feel. I get to touch, and I like how STEM camp 1 incorporates that in a fun and awesome way. When we dissected pigs that helped [me] learn about biology in a way where it wasn’t like in health class, where here is a diagram of the human body. Here is a textbook. Read it through. We are going to read it through, we are going to learn about it. No, in this one we learned it in a fun and interesting way. We played bingo with pig parts. (Interview 2017).|$|E
30|$|Summarising {{the design}} {{requirements}} {{from the perspective}} of a participant in a citizen inquiry project, interviewees expressed the need for projects relevant to their interests that could connect them to like-minded individuals and that would help them learn (see Customer Jobs). As an interviewee explained: ‘I found a passion in citizen science it gave me something meaningful to contribute to’. In terms of gains, participants’ expectations were either personal or catholic; they seek to enjoy participation in citizen science projects and gain certain cognitive and affective benefits such as recognition, satisfaction, deep thinking, and knowledge acquisition. As stated: ‘a good website challenges me to think a little deeper’. In addition, more universal expectations were expressed such as moving science forward and be part of a collective effort. As explained: ‘You need to convince me it will be useful to science or I’ll keep uploading my images to Instagram instead’. In terms of barriers or obstacles faced when participating in existing citizen science platforms, they raised issues related to the design of the mission such as length and topic of tasks and lack of feedback and support to guide interactions. As explained: ‘Time is important both how long will it take to do the tasks and when will <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some results?’ and ‘You should leave the community with some analysis to make people feel their contribution is worthwhile’.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the cool}} things about being in the Regional Office is that I get to go around and visit people on their units. Usually {{everyone}} is really nice and <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a lot of cool plants. Another thing that entertains me while I’m travelling is seeing how people decorate their workspace. Not everyone has an office, or even a cubicle of their own, but almost everyone decorates. It’s the dog and fireplug thing. Pinecones are very popular items, and not just among the botanists. The most popular (or the most sought-after) {{seems to be the}} behemoth Pinus coulteri. But pinecones are like bottle-openers or socks; they can be nice to look at but they have an inescapably utilitarian veil. What I like to see on botanists ’ desks are the dry flower stems and the fragments of nonvascular plants. We take pride in little sticks and twigs bearing unidentifiable flowers, the remnants of long-shattered seed-heads, a thorny Crataegus stem with raisiny old pomes, or a twisty Xyris culm. And don’t we love our lichens and mosses. My computer is littered with schists, quartzites, and basalts, each festooned with contrasting orange, yellow, green, and black lichens. We bring this debris indoors to remind us of who we are while working on special use permits, EA’s, and Gordzilla, to remind us through the winter that field season will almost certainly return, and mostly to invoke memories of glories past.

40|$|Having {{worked in}} the Employees and Commercial Payments Branch of the Financial Management Division for the past 3 summers, I have seen the many changes that have {{occurred}} within the NASA organization. As I return each summer, I find that new programs and systems have been adapted to better serve the needs of the Center and of the Agency. The NASA Agency has transformed itself the past couple years with the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP). IFMP is designed to allow the Agency to improve its management of its Financial, Physical, and Human Resources through the use of multiple enterprise module applications. With my mentor, Joseph Kan, being the branch chief of the Employees and Commercial Payments Branch, I have been exposed to several modules, such as Travel Manager, WebTads, and Core Financial/SAP, which were implemented {{in the last couple of}} years under the IFMP. The implementation of these agency-wide systems has sometimes proven to be troublesome. Prior to IFMP, each NASA Center utilizes their own systems for Payroll, Travel, Accounts Payable, etc. But with the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program, all the "legacy" systems had to be eliminated. As a result, a great deal of enhancement and preparation work is necessary to ease the transformation from the old systems to the new. All this work occurs simultaneously; for example, e-Payroll will "go live" in several months, but a system like Travel Manager will need to have information upgraded within the system to meet the requirements set by Headquarters. My assignments this summer have given me the opportunity to become involved with such work. So far, I have been given the opportunity to participate in projects resulting from a congressional request, several bankcard reconciliations, updating routing lists for Travel Manager, updating the majordomo list for Travel Manager approvers and point of contacts, and a NASA Headquarters project involving improper payments on firm fixed price contracts. Each of the projects that I have worked on this summer presents a different aspect of the work performed on a regular basis by members of this branch. Not only do <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the "big picture" of what occurs within the organization, but I also get to experience the "little stuff" that goes on here and throughout the NASA Agency...|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} fifteen years, I 2 ̆ 7 ve taught in William Mitchell 2 ̆ 7 s Civil Advocacy Clinic. I have {{the best job in}} town. It 2 ̆ 7 s the best job for a lawyer because in the clinic we can always find more clients, we are free to take the cases that seem the most {{pressing}} or most interesting, and we {{never have to worry about}} billing our clients. It 2 ̆ 7 s the best job for a teacher because, unlike other teachers, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the end of the educational story. Each semester, I sit next to students and watch them as they interview and counsel clients, conduct direct and cross-examination, argue cases in front of the court of appeals, and generally demonstrate what it is they have learned about the law while they have been here at the college. It is also the best job for a lawyer and a teacher because so much of the time spent on the job is expressly focused on figuring out what lessons have been learned from all that experience. Most of the time, of course, my clinic students talk about what it is they have learned. That, however, is only half the story. Like every other clinical teacher I have ever talked to, I have frequently watched my students do something [...] during an interview, during a cross-examination, during an argument [...] and said to myself, “Wow! I never would have thought to do that. The next time I have a chance, I 2 ̆ 7 ll have to try that myself. ” My clinic students have taught me many lessons about lawyering and I 2 ̆ 7 ve put many of those lessons to good use in my own work with clients. Lately, though, as I 2 ̆ 7 ve worked with my clinic students, I have started to pay more attention to the lessons I 2 ̆ 7 ve learned [...] or should have learned [...] about my own teaching, and especially about my classroom teaching. In addition to teaching in the clinic, I have also taught Torts and Evidence. This past year, two experiences related to clinical teaching [...] one a moment of personal epiphany and the other, a conversation with a colleague [...] have caused me to spend more time thinking about what I should be learning in the clinic and applying in the classroom...|$|E
