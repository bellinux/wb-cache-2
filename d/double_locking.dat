25|$|Schecter is also {{a leader}} in the seven-string, and recently, eight-string guitar market. Schecter's 'Diamond series' guitars have enjoyed a growing {{positive}} reputation through the use of quality components such as TonePros locking bridge products on non-tremolo models and Original Floyd Rose <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> tremolos on many of the six and seven string models. Many models also feature USA EMG or Seymour Duncan pick-ups and Grover tuners.|$|E
2500|$|Speedcuffs {{consist of}} two {{conventional}} ratchet handcuffs {{connected by a}} rigid metal bar, which is enclosed in a plastic grip secured with bolts. Removal of the grip offers no advantage to escape, as it is only present to facilitate the comfortable manipulation of the cuffs by the arresting officer. Weighing 390 g (13.75 oz) and with a maximum dilation of 23.2 cm (9.13 inches), the speedcuffs are slightly larger than the chain-linked and hinged handcuffs previously manufactured by Hiatts, and accommodate a greater range of wrist sizes. They feature Hiatt's 'back loading' feature, which allows the ratchet to be pulled backwards for a few [...] "clicks" [...] through the lock casing to set the cuffs in the ideal position for quick application. The locks accept a standard handcuff key, and have a <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> facility which is activated through a small pin {{on the back of}} the cuff. The <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> facility must be depressed with a pointed object, such as the protrusion found on the top of the handcuff key; <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> prevents accidentally or knowingly tightening the cuff once it has been locked, helping to prevent paralysis or other injury.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of speedcuff application {{is the same}} as other modern [...] "swing through" [...] handcuffs. By pressing the pivoted arm of the cuff against the wrist, the arm can be made to swing around the wrist and engage with the lock. The officer may then tighten the cuff to an appropriate position before applying the other cuff, engaging the <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> system to prevent the handcuffs tightening further.|$|E
2500|$|The Blackhill locks took much longer, being {{completed}} in August 1793 although Thomson says (1794). There were four <b>double</b> <b>locks,</b> (i.e. two chambers with {{three pairs of}} gates,) each <b>double</b> <b>lock</b> having two falls of the total vertical interval was [...]|$|R
50|$|Thumbcuffs with <b>double</b> <b>locks</b> have a lockspring which when engaged, usually {{using the}} top of the key, stops the thumbcuff from {{ratcheting}} tighter and prevents the subject from tightening them, possibly causing injury. <b>Double</b> <b>locks</b> also make picking the locks more difficult.|$|R
50|$|The Blackhill locks took much longer, being {{completed}} in August 1793 although Thomson says (1794). There were four <b>double</b> <b>locks,</b> (i.e. two chambers with {{three pairs of}} gates,) each <b>double</b> <b>lock</b> having two falls of 12 ft; the total vertical interval was 96 ft.|$|R
2500|$|The JS line of guitars is his {{signature}} {{line with the}} JS1000, JS1200, JS2400, JSBDG, and JS20th using Ibanez's original Edge <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> tremolo bridge. The JS100 and JS120s both use Ibanez's Edge 3 tremolo bridge. The JS1600 is a fixed bridge guitar with no tremolo system. The guitar he was most associated with during the 90s was a chrome-finished guitar nicknamed [...] "Chrome Boy". This instrument {{can be seen on}} the Live in San Francisco DVD. However, the guitar used for most of the concert was in fact a lookalike nicknamed [...] "Pearly," [...] which featured Seymour Duncan Pearly Gates pickups.|$|E
2500|$|Satriani uses {{a number}} of other JS models such as the JS double neck model, JS700 (primary axe on the self-titled CD and seen on the 1995 tour [...] "Joe Satriani," [...] which {{features}} a fixed bridge, P-90 pickups, and a matching mahogany body and neck), JS6/JS6000 (natural body), JS1 (the original JS model), JS2000 (fixed bridge model), a variety of JS100s, JS1000s and JS1200s with custom paint work, and a large amount of prototype JSs. All <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> bridges have been the original Edge tremolo, not the newer models, which point to a more custom guitar than the [...] "off the shelf" [...] models. Satriani played a red 7-string JS model, seen in the [...] "G3 Live in Tokyo" [...] DVD from 2005. He also has a prototype 24-fret version of the JS—now called the JS-2400—which he has used with Chickenfoot. As of late he has used other prototypes featuring a Sustainer or a JS model with three single coil-sized humbucker pickups.|$|E
50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> {{bridge is}} a Floyd Rose {{licensed}} Jackson Low Profile JT-580 LP <b>Double</b> <b>Locking</b> 2-Point Tremolo, mounted in a routed recess. The headstock utilizes Jackson branded die-cast tuners supplied by Jin-Ho of Korea (model #J-07). These parts {{and the other}} minor bits (strap buttons, knobs) are coated in black chrome.|$|E

50|$|A {{staircase}} lock {{was built}} on the Sankey Canal and a second staircase was built later when the Ravenhead Branch was constructed in 1775. They are known respectively as the Old <b>Double</b> <b>Lock</b> and the New <b>Double</b> <b>Lock.</b> The latter was restored by St Helens Borough Council in 1992, although it has no navigable waterway either above or below it.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, {{a gift of}} a unit to Van Halen by Floyd Rose himself {{gave the}} unit instant {{overnight}} success and credibility. Still more stability {{was provided by the}} addition of a second lock on the bridge nut, making a <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> tremolo system that was more complex to set up. The <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> design is sometimes called a two-point locking tremolo, inviting confusion with the Fender two-point synchronized tremolo, which is a different concept and not a locking tremolo at all.|$|E

5000|$|The S {{series is}} the {{original}} Saber shape, with carved back and top.

The S series uses a Zero-Resistance (ZR) <b>double</b> <b>locking</b> tremolo system from 2003 till 2014. The ZR tremolo system uses ball-bearings as opposed to knife edges for pivot points and a built-in counter-tension system called the Zero Point System. The Zero Point System can be removed to change the tremolo to full-floating operation.The current line (2014) uses mainly Edge Zero ii systems, which are knife edge based.|$|E

50|$|Handcuffs with <b>double</b> <b>locks</b> have a detent which when engaged {{stops the}} cuff from {{ratcheting}} tighter {{to prevent the}} wearer from tightening them. Tightening could be intentional or by struggling; if tightened, the handcuffs may cause nerve damage or loss of circulation. Also some wearers could tighten the cuffs to attempt an escape by having the officer loosen the cuffs and attempting to escape while the cuffs are loose. <b>Double</b> <b>locks</b> also make picking the locks more difficult.|$|R
