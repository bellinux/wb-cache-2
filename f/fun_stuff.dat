500|$|Many critics {{considered}} {{that a great}} part of the episode's merits were due to George R. R. Martin's script. Sepinwall felt that [...] "Martin didn't get the easiest draw when he wound up having to dramatize the events depicted in 'The Pointy End,'" [...] but still loved the results. Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand at work here. Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly feel much more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of <b>fun</b> <b>stuff</b> to play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E

In the episode, Angela reveals that she wears large sizes of clothes purchased from American Girl, a doll store chain, but will not shop at children's retailer Gap Kids because it is [...] "too flashy."

The song was originally conceived with Dev as a featured act, but she was later made the main artist as they believed it represented her. Dev described [...] "Bass Down Low" [...] as [...] "sassy and fun" [...] and considered it a great follow-up to [...] "Like a G6". In an interview with teen magazine Seventeen, she spoke of the song's conception, stating: [...] "We'd been in the studio writing some really bossy, <b>fun</b> <b>stuff.</b> We've got a studio in the loft {{that we live in}} together, so it was made in there.

Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly had concerns about M.I.A.s third album {{after listening to}} previous single [...] "Born Free", but said with [...] "XXXO" [...] his worries had been eased. Wete wrote, [...] "this techno-tinged dance record is what we hoped for from our Sri Lankan anti-pop star. Its an aggressive but friendly love cut dressed up with playful lyrics ... Its the <b>fun,</b> naughty <b>stuff</b> we like." [...] Rolling Stones reviewer characterised the song as a [...] "futuristic, tribal jam", revolving around [...] "little more than reverb-dunked marching-band beat and M.I.A.s tweaked-to-the-max vocals", before concluding [...] "you have to admire her for always pushing her sound and art forward. When M.I.A. sings, [...] "You want me be somebody who Im really not", she does it with her middle finger raised high, pointing squarely at your face."

With the album, she wanted to {{establish}} herself as a musician; she did not just want to be known as [...] "the girl from ''''". Lovato explained that her goal was to have fun with the album and that she would include deeper themes on her sophomore effort, stating: [...] "You won't necessarily find a lot of songs on the album, but hopefully you will on the next album.

[...] He also says, [...] "The concept, based on a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, would lead naturally to intriguing considerations." [...] Some critics, however, were not too favorable to the film: Claudia Puig of USA Today called it [...] "a poor substitute of sci-fi thriller saying that {{the tone of the}} movie is rarely satirical and that it's more concerned with political intrigue involving pockets of anti-surrogate protesters that enjoy bludgeoning the machines." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave it a negative review, writing [...] "watchable, but obvious&hellip; Surrogates never manages to be anything more than a poor substitute for the real thing." ...|$|R

2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure out what we wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was, just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the <b>fun</b> little <b>stuff,</b> little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|R
5000|$|ECV flourished, in part, as {{the result}} of the miners' {{reaction}} to the [...] "established" [...] organizations such as the Masons and Odd Fellows.

ECV, on the other hand, made <b>fun</b> of the <b>stuffed</b> shirts of the Masons: they made great fun of the sashes and ceremonial attire of the [...] "upscale" [...] fraternities, and began dressing in red shirts and pinning on badges made of cut-out tin can lids. This practice, called [...] "wearing the tin", continues to this day, although the badges are frequently professionally made. Members commonly dress in a red shirt, black hat and Levi's jeans. ECV titles reflected the tongue-in-cheek nature of the organization.

5000|$|The episode {{received}} unfavorable reviews. The A.V. Clubs Alasdair Wilkins {{gave the}} episode a C+ grade, stating: [...] "Hell On Wheels doesn't {{need to be}} thematically rich or have complex, multifaceted characters to be a decent show. [...] "Durant, Nebraska" [...] already provided a blueprint for the show's success as shameless, over-the-top pulp, and the shootout taps into some of that goofily lurid sense of <b>fun.</b> There's been <b>stuff</b> to like in the subsequent episodes, such as the gleeful nihilism of [...] "Slaughterhouse", Cullen's low-rent Machiavellianism in [...] "Scabs", and the heist in tonight's episode, but the long-form storytelling remains ponderous and, worse, seemingly pointless." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste gave it a 6.0 rating, stating [...] "'The Railroad Job' points out the largest flaws in Hell on Wheels. It can't seem to remember the past and {{has no interest in}} the future. With the exception of Durant’s gunshot wound, it looks like this episode won’t have much influence in the long run of things except as another distraction from the railroad building." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rob Leane {{praised the}} episode, {{in his review}} for Den of Geek, for its focus on characters, relationships, and dialogue, noting how the series has moved away from more traditional, syndication-friendly {{standalone}} episodes, and instead relies more on the Netflix-style serialization. He stated that the episode did well [...] "building up to a dramatic rescue sequence {{with an array of}} action-free dialogue scenes. Some may call this boring, but I thought it was a brave decision executed well. I wouldn’t mind a few more like this." [...] Screen Crush's Kevin Fitzpatrick found [...] "Purpose in the Machine" [...] to have [...] "surprising momentum for the third year’s second hour, not only confirming to the team within minutes that Simmons was indeed alive {{on the other side of}} the monolith, but even rescuing her by the hour’s end. Movement like that might easily have been stretched over the course of a half-season". Though he felt that the Ward and Hydra subplot should be removed from the series at this point, Fitzpatrick was positive about the May storyline, and praised the performances of De Caestecker and Henstridge. Scott Meslow of Vulture gave a less favorable review, scoring the episode 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "maybe it sounds like I'm nitpicking at this point, and the last thing I want to do is ding a fun comic-book adaptation for doing <b>fun</b> comic-book <b>stuff.</b> But stories like the ones in [...] "Purpose in the Machine" [...] stand out because Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. would be more fun, not less, if it were willing to tackle them in all their complexity." [...] Meslow called out the decisions made by Coulson in particular, and named the episode's climax [...] "a moment of totally unearned triumph, with bad decision after bad decision resulting in nothing but good news for everyone involved." ...|$|R
