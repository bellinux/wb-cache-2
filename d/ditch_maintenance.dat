The {{purpose of this study}} was to suggest a method for inventory of the need for <b>ditching</b> <b>maintenance</b> in old forest ditches that takes biodiversity, water protection and forest production into consideration. Inventory methods from five Swedish and Finnish forest companies, agencies and organisations were compared. Their employees were interviewed about their handling with ditches, forest production and nature conservation. The results show that there are four major questions that have to be answered in order to decide whether old ditches should be left as they are, maintained or if there are other operations that could be needed. First, it is important to know whether the original ditches has had an improving effect on forest production and second, what effect a cleaning of the ditch would have on the growth at present. The third and fourth theme that has to be valued is what the effects could be on biodiversity and the environment and all this has to be weighted together. <b>Maintenance</b> of old <b>ditches</b> is a complex subject.

40|$|International audienceOne fourth (5. 5 Mha) {{of forests}} in Finland are growing on peatlands {{that have been}} drained to improve forest growth. Forestry {{operations}} such as cuttings and <b>ditch</b> network <b>maintenance</b> in these areas may increase export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in receiving lakes and rivers. Mitigation of the deterioration calls for understanding how forest management operations affect peatland hydrology. A process-based simulation model FEMMA was applied to quantify the effects of <b>ditch</b> network <b>maintenance</b> on peatland water balance. The model has separate computation routines for evapotranspiration in tree stand and understorey vegetation, snow accumulation and melt, water movement in unsaturated and saturated soil, and drainage. Hydraulic characteristics of peat, as well as different drainage designs can be parameterised in the model. The model was applied in artificially delineated research catchments in northern Finland, where the ditch network was maintained by cleaning and digging the ditches deeper. The simulation results indicated that ditch cleaning affected the water balance slightly and the effect was dependent on stand characteristics and soil structure. When the growing stock volume was low and poorly conductive soil extended close to the soil surface, ditch cleaning increased evapotranspiration. In stands with a high stock volume and a thick topmost layer of highly conductive soil, evapotranspiration was less affected. In the study catchments, the effect of ditch cleaning on runoff was small compared to the error between measured and modelled runoff...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAbstractAgriculture {{must now}} feed the planet {{with the lowest}} {{environmental}} impact. Landscape management is a means to protect natural resources from the adverse impacts. In particular, the adequate management of ditches could improve crop quality. Here, we review ditch design and maintenance. We found the following major points: (1) ditch networks have been primarily designed for waterlogging control and erosion prevention. Nonetheless, when properly managed, farm ditches provide other important ecosystem services, namely groundwater recharge, flood attenuation, water purification, or biodiversity conservation. (2) All ditch ecosystem services depend on many geochemical, geophysical, and biological processes, whose occurrence and intensity vary largely with ditch characteristics. (3) The major ruling characteristics are vegetative cover; ditch morphology; slope orientation; reach connections such as piped sections and weirs, soil, sediment and litter properties, biota, and biofilms; and network topology. (4) <b>Ditch</b> <b>maintenance</b> is an efficient engineering tool to optimize ecosystem services because several ditch characteristics change widely with <b>ditch</b> <b>maintenance.</b> For instance, maintenance operations, dredging, chemical weeding, and burning improve waterlogging and soil erosion control, but they are negative for biodiversity conservation.

40|$|One {{fourth of}} the forests in Finland are growing on drained peatlands. Forestry {{operations}} such as <b>ditch</b> network <b>maintenance</b> increase the export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in lakes and rivers. Water protection presupposes {{an understanding of how}} forestry operations affect peatland hydrology. The objective was to study the hydrological impacts of ditch cleaning on the basis of water table level and runoff measurements from two pairs of artificially delineated catchments in drained peatland forests in Finland. Data from treated and control catchments indicated that ditch cleaning lowered the level of the water table in sites where a shallow peat layer was underlain by mineral soil. In sites with deep peat formation, the water table showed no detectable response to ditch cleaning. Runoff data suggested that annual runoff clearly increased after ditch cleaning, which was in conflict with the previously reported small impacts of <b>ditch</b> network <b>maintenance.</b> The hydrological model FEMMA was calibrated and applied to assess the conformity of the data and the experimental setup. In the model application, the catchments were assumed to behave as independent hydrological units. However, assessment of the model results and the measurements suggested that ditch cleaning had an impact on hydrological measurements in both treated and control catchments. It appeared that the independence assumption was violated and there was a hydrological connection between the artificial catchments and, therefore, the results of the data analysis were considered misleading. Finally, a numerical experiment based on the model simulations was conducted to explain how the assumed relationship between soil moisture and transpiration is reflected in the modelled runoff. Modelled runoff decreases and evaporation increases when ditches are cleaned in poorly drained sites, where the initial ditch depth is small and the depth of a highly conductive topsoil layer is low. The numerical experiment can be applied to assess when ditch cleaning does not improve evapotranspiration and is unnecessary...|$|R

40|$|Availability of {{macrophyte}} {{habitat is}} recognized as an important driver of aquatic insect communities in peatland drainage ditches; however, eutrophication {{can lead to the}} decline of submerged vegetation. While emergent vegetation is able to persist in eutrophicated ditches, vegetation removal, carried out during <b>ditch</b> <b>maintenance,</b> can reduce the availability of this habitat. In this study, we applied the landscape filtering approach to determine whether the absence of emergent vegetation is a habitat filter which structures aquatic insect communities in peatland drainage ditches under different trophic conditions. To this end, a field study was carried out in one mesotrophic (Naardermeer) and one eutrophic (Wormer and Jisperveld) peatland in the province of North Holland, The Netherlands. We assigned life history strategies to insect species and applied linear mixed models and redundancy analyses to taxonomic and functional aquatic insect community data. Our results indicate that while differences between peatlands primarily determine the species pool within each wetland, emergent vegetation acted as a secondary filter by structuring functional community composition within ditches. The eutrophic peatland was dominated by insects adapted to abiotic extremes, while species with good dispersal abilities were strongly related to emergent vegetation cover. This study demonstrates the applicability of life history strategies to provide insight into the filtering of species due to availability of emergent macrophyte habitat. To ensure greater diversity of insect communities in ditch habitats, it is recommended that some vegetation be spared during maintenance to leave patches from which insect recolonization can occur...|$|E

This study focuses on whether the propagule bank of free-floating plantdominated ditch sediments can serve as potential source for recovery of a diverse plant community. The first objective was to determine differences in propagule germination from sediments of ditches in the Netherlands that differ in vegetation composition through a seedling-emergence experiment. The second objective was to analyze the effect of sediment disturbance on the number of germinating propagules. The results show that, compared to sediments from ditches with submerged vegetation, sediments from free-floating plantdominated ditches produced significantly lower numbers of individuals and species of submerged and emergent plants, while numbers of individuals and species of free-floating plants were higher. These results suggest that sediments from free-floating plantdominated ditches have lower potential to recover a diverse plant community probably resulting from positive feedback mechanisms caused by the vegetation present, maintaining the free-floating plantdominated state. Sediment disturbance strongly favors the germination of free-floating plant propagules, especially from free-floating plantdominated ditch sediments. <b>Ditch</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities such as mowing and dredging will therefore likely favor persistence of the free-floating plantdominated state.

Both lakes are affected by forestry, but the reference lake has no history of peat extraction in its watershed.

Recent changes in benthic macroinvertebrates (chironomids) and diatom algae were studied to assess the ecological effects of these practices in the lakes. No significant differences in recent increases in carbon accumulation were found between the peat extraction-impacted lake and the reference lake. The pairwise comparison allowed identification of a regional pattern of impacts that is closely related to the history of land use, particularly forestry, in the region. The approach also allowed identification of the transient signs of peat extraction in the chemical and chironomid records of the impacted lake.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. August 2011. Major: Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering. Advisor: Bruce N. Wilson, Ph. D., 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 163 pages. Agricultural drainage is a double-edged sword: helping farmers achieve everincreasing crop yields to meet consumers’ demands, while providing a short-circuit through the soil profile for excess water and nutrients. Drainage ditches {{are an important}} pathway as water moves downstream in headwater landscapes. As low order streams, ditches {{have the potential to}} remove and assimilate nutrients. In order to operate at their maximum nutrient removal potential, ditches should be healthy, self-sustaining ecosystems that function similarly to natural streams. The two-stage agricultural drainage ditch is an innovative solution for creating drainage ditches that behave more like natural streams. A low-flow channel provides sediment transport during low-flow periods, while benches within the ditch allow for overbank flow and energy dissipation during high-flow periods. The larger crosssectional area increases surface contact between water and the ditch at certain flow depths, which likely enhances nutrient removal. In this study, a two-stage agricultural drainage ditch was designed and then constructed in southern Minnesota, USA in the autumn of 2009. Extensive monitoring of the ditch has been conducted following construction; efforts have focused on establishing an understanding of the geomorphic, water source, and water quality aspects of the ditch. Analysis of field measurements from August 2010 show that between 10 and 15 percent of nitrate N entering the ditch was removed within the ditch reach. A slight increase in average channel thalweg elevation has been measured, while increased pool-riffle sequencing has also been observed. Channel cross-sectional surveys have showed slight changes in low-flow channel dimensions. Economic analyses have been performed to measure the feasibility of two-stage ditch construction. There are situations where predicted cost reductions in periodic <b>ditch</b> <b>maintenance</b> provide enough savings to offset two-stage channel construction costs. In other cases, subsidies may be required to economically justify a two-stage system. An analysis was performed to estimate the cost of additional nitrogen (N) removal ($/kg N removed) in two-stage ditches, using increased N removal as a basis for subsidies. Results show situations where N removal costs is less than $ 3 to $ 4 kg- 1 of N removed, which is competitive with other Best Management Practices...|$|E
40|$|Minnesota’s Lake Superior Coastal Program; Project No. 306 -STAR 02 - 08; Contract no. B 11991 Ditches along {{roads in}} rural areas are a {{dominant}} conveyor of stormwater to streams along the north shore. Loss of forest cover as well as increased rural development can increase runoff amounts, but ditches provide the structure that moves this water quickly to nearby stream channels (Forman and Alexander 1998, Wemple et al. 1996). Ditches capture overland flow from nearby forests, wetlands, homes, and businesses {{in rural areas}} and channel the flows to discharge points, often into streams (e. g., Duke et al. 2006). Much of this runoff would have otherwise infiltrated into the ground, evaporated, drained into wetlands, or flowed slowly across the landscape until reaching a natural stream channel (Forman and Alexander 1998). The result is more water reaching streams much faster after rainfall events (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). The resulting high stream flows during and after storms can increase the erosion of susceptible clay banks, increase bank failure rates, damage aquatic habitats, and impair water quality (Forman and Alexander 1998, Wemple et al. 1996). Road runoff and excess sediment are then delivered to the sensitive nearshore zone of oligotrophic Lake Superior. Eleven north shore streams are currently on the state’s impaired waters list for turbidity ([URL] and evaluations on both the Knife and Poplar rivers have indicated that increased flows and bank erosion are major contributing factors (Brady and Breneman 2007, 2008). We have also recently seen {{an increase in the}} frequency of large rainfall events, consistent with climate change predictions for this region, indicating that the need for runoff control will only increase in importance.

During one year, we monitored the vegetation, litter, soil properties, and ash cover of five ditches that were being unmanaged, dredged, mowed, burned, and chemically weeded, respectively, with timing and frequency as generally operated by farmers in the study area. We then used indicators to evaluate the effect that the evolution of these properties has on the ditch water conveyance, herbicide retention and biodiversity conservation functions. We found that the evolution of these properties significantly contrasted among the 5 maintenance strategies. All the maintenance operations cleared the vegetation, which improves the hydraulic capacity by up to 3 times. The optimal hydraulic capacity is maintained longer after chemical weeding and dredging, but these operations have negative impacts on the herbicide retention and biodiversity conservation functions. The litter and ash layers generated by mowing and burning, respectively, improve the herbicide retention by up to 45 %. Our results confirm that maintenance can be an efficient tool for optimizing ditch functions.

40|$|Abstract. Prevention and {{estimation}} of soil erosion from forest roads {{requires an understanding}} of how road design and maintenance affect sediment production. Seventyfour plots were installed on forest roads in the Oregon Coast Range {{to examine the relationship between}} sediment production and road attributes such as distance between culverts, road slope, soil texture, and cutslope height. An additional comparison was made between road segments with cutslopes and ditches freshly cleared of vegetation and segments with established vegetation on cutslopes and in ditches. All road segments were 5 m wide and insloped with aggregate surfacing, light traffic, and no overhanging forest cover. Sediment production was correlated to the product of segment length times road slope squared. Sediment production from aggregate covered roads on a silty clay loam was about 9 times greater than that from roads constructed on a gravelly loam. Sediment production was not correlated to the cutslope height. Road segments where vegetation was cleared from the cutslope and ditch produced about 7 times as much sediment as road segments where vegetation was retained, showing the potential reduction in erosion by revegetation following construction and the potential impact of <b>ditch</b> cleaning during <b>maintenance.</b> Relationships and estimates from this study provide a basis for improved erosion estimates by commonly used empirical procedures. 1...|$|R

Maintenance of populations’ connectivity through pollen and seed dispersal {{is a key}} factor in species persistence in the face of substantial habitat loss. The goals of this study were to investigate the potential corridor role of ditches and to identify the landscape components that significantly impact patterns of gene flow among remnant populations. Using microsatellite loci, we explored the spatial genetic structure of two hydrochorous wetland plants exhibiting contrasting local abundance and different habitat requirements: the rare and regionally protected Oenanthe aquatica and the more commonly distributed Lycopus europaeus, in an 83 km 2 agricultural lowland located in northern France. Both species exhibited a significant spatial genetic structure, along with substantial levels of genetic differentiation, especially for L. europaeus, whichalso expressed high levels of inbreeding. Isolation-by-distance analysis revealed enhanced gene flow along ditches, indicating their key role in effective seed and pollen dispersal. Our data also suggested that the configuration of the ditch network and the landscape elements significantly affected population genetic structure, with (i) species-specific scale effects on the genetic neighborhood and (ii) detrimental impact of human ditch management on genetic diversity, especially for O. aquatica. Altogether, these findings highlighted the key role of <b>ditches</b> in the <b>maintenance</b> of plant biodiversity in intensive agricultural landscapes with few remnant wetland habitats...|$|R
40|$|In Finland, <b>ditch</b> network <b>maintenance</b> (DNM) {{is carried}} out {{annually}} on 60 – 70, 000 ha of drained peatland to promote tree growth for forestry purposes. However, {{it is important to}} avoid ditching that contributes little to the stand growth and productivity, both to improve the economical profitability of forestry and to mitigate DNM-induced nutrient release to watercourses. We hypothesised that mature forest stands with substantial evapotranspiration potential do not necessarily need DNM, even if the ditch networks are in poor condition. We estimated evapotranspiration (EVT) of forest vegetation during the growing seasons (June–September) of 2007 – 2011 in four forested artificial peatland catchments dominated by Scots pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.) (stand volume 93 – 151 m 3 ha- 1) located in southern, western, central and northern Finland. Precipitation (P), runoff (R) and water table level (WTL) were monitored continuously in the field. The water storage change (ΔS) was estimated on the basis of WTL measurements and peat pF curves determined from in situ peat samples. In addition, tree stand transpiration (T) was estimated in two of the catchments using the sap flow method. EVT was estimated as the residual term of the water balance equation. During the growing season, EVT (153 – 295 mm) was 49 – 161 % of the total accumulated P (155 – 368 mm), and decreased from south to north. Within each growing season, EVT was always largest in July or August. Tree transpiration was about 50 % of the total forest EVT in the two sites where it was measured directly. The mean WTL was at depth 36 – 63 cm during the growing seasons. Clear-cutting of a 100 m 3 ha- 1 stand on one site resulted in an average rise of WTL by 18 cm. The results suggested that, in the southernmost site in particular, no drainage network management would be necessary to sustain satisfactory drainage conditions for tree growth because growing-season precipitation is transferred back to the atmosphere by forest EVT. In the northernmost site, ditch networks were considered important in controlling drainage conditions because of the low EVT potential of < 100 m 3 ha- 1 tree stands. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind forest EVT potential, as one site with high tree stand volume had surprisingly low EVT potential...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{years of}} {{research}} have demonstrated that the water quality of stormwater runoff can improve after flowing in a well-vegetated channel, relatively slowly, at a depth below the vegetation height. These channels are commonly called “biofiltration swales. ” Roadside ditches that are vegetated also may {{have the potential to}} provide the same water quality benefits as biofiltration swales by removing pollutants. Conversely, ditches that are devoid of vegetation are subject to erosion and could be significant sources of sediments and other pollutants. If the potential benefits are to be realized, and the pollutant source avoided, <b>ditch</b> condition and <b>maintenance</b> must be consistent with not only conveyance but also water-quality objectives. Because no systematic data have been collected that describe ditch characteristics with respect to water-quality considerations, Snohomish and King counties commissioned the Center for Urban Water Resources Management to evaluate ditch status in the two jurisdictions and to consider how road maintenance crews might maximize their potential for water-quality performance. The goal of this investigation was to develop strategies for improving runoff treatment and reducing downstream sediment loading from existing ditches, while retaining their hydraulic function of conveying roadway runoff. The principal focus was to guide maintenance actions, but it was anticipated that design of future ditches should also benefit. This report documents one aspect of the investigation— a systematic survey of ditches during the summer and fall of 1998, designed to evaluate the water-quality performance of ditches in the two counties’ road networks. The survey encompassed 113 ditch segments in Snohomish County and 87 segments in King County, ranging in length from 200 to 600 feet. Single-family residential is by far the dominant land use in the catchments adjacent to the ditches surveyed, a circumstance representative of areas in the two counties with roadside ditches. Specific measurements and observations were made at several transects in each ditch, extending across the width and spaced along the length of each segment. In total, 1000 transects were surveyed for this project, emphasizing the data collection and analysis of those factors that were anticipated to be both beneficial and detrimental to improving water quality.

An {{assessment}} of heavy metal and pesticide pollution {{was conducted at}} a commercial airport in Pietermaritzburg, which is the base for a local crop spraying operation, {{as well as a}} small-scale aircraft maintenance centre. The study investigated the presence of heavy metals from the aircraft activities (tyre wear, emission and aircraft body attrition) along the edges of the runway. In addition, the study assessed the pollution of the soil {{in different parts of the}} airport (areas adjacent to the crop sprayer hangar and <b>maintenance</b> hangars drainage <b>ditch)</b> caused by organic chemicals (pesticides) originating from the washing and maintenance of the crop spraying aircrafts. A total of 37 samples were taken from the top soil (0 - 15 cm) adjacent to both sides of the runway, approximately 100 meters apart, for heavy metal assessment. Total metal concentrations were determined on a 1 : 1 HNO 3 acid extract analysed using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and the results compared with the baseline concentrations of heavy metals in the soils of South Africa. The average levels of the heavy metals in the soils were: Cd - 4. 4, Co - 76, Cr - 142, Mn - 6580, Pb - 64 and Zn - 70 mg/kg. The Cd and Co concentrations of all samples and the Pb and Zn concentrations of 86 % of the samples were above the South African guidelines for the maximum permissible contents of these metals (2 mg/kg Cd, 20 mg/kg Co, 6. 6 mg/kg Pb, 46. 5 mg/kg Zn) in soils. In addition, the concentration of Cr was significantly above these guidelines (80 mg/kg Cr) in 51 % of the samples. All the metals, except zinc, were highly correlated with one another indicating the source for these heavy metals is the same. In addition the concentration of these metals was high at sampling points adjacent to the runway where pronounced aircraft tyre wear marks were observed, suggesting that the aircraft activities are the sources of these heavy metals. A total of 13 samples were collected from areas adjacent to the crop sprayer hangar and the drainage <b>ditch</b> (at the <b>maintenance</b> hangars) in order to determine the qualitative presence of organic pollutants. The samples were prepared using soxhlet extraction. Cypermethrin, deltamethrin, azoxystrobin, fusillade and fluazifop-p-butyl as well as fuel oils Jet Al and Avgas were qualitatively determined using GC/MS. Only fusillade and fluazifop-p-butyl were detected, in some of the samples. No quantitative analysis of the organic chemicals was attempted due to time constraints...|$|R
