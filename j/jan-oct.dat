As one critic wrote of issue #4: [...] "Unmatched by anything else he'd written at Marvel, Friedrich's script ... had reached a point that perfectly captured the 19th-century cadences of Shelley's prose and lifted the strip far above any past or, so far, future attempt to adapt the character to comics." [...] Friedrich co-created the supernatural hero the Son of Satan in Ghost Rider vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 1973). Friedrich recalled in 2009 that Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee [...] "had some idea that he wanted a character called Son of Satan. I {{have no idea why}} or where it came from. All he really had was the name and he wanted us to create a character based around that. I guess it just popped in his mind. He said [...] "I want a title called Son of Satan. Do it!" ...|$|E

Skeates also provided scripts for some of these issues they appeared in.

5000|$|Ploog recalled, in a 2008 interview: Now, there's {{been all}} kinds of dialog about who was the creator of Ghost Rider. Gary Friedrich was the writer on it. ... The flaming skull: That was the big area of dispute. Who thought of the flaming skull? To {{be honest with you}} I can't remember. What else were {{you going to do with}} him? You couldn't put a helmet on him, so it had to be a flaming skull. As far as his costume went, it was part of the old Western Ghost Rider's costume, with the Western panel front. The stripes down the arms and the legs were there merely so I could make the charactercostume as black as I {{possibly}} could and still keep track of his body. It was the easiest way to design him. Ploog and writer Gary Friedrich collaborated on the first six issues of Marvel's The Monster of Frankenstein (<b>Jan.-Oct.</b> 1973), the initial four of which contained a more faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel than has mostly appeared elsewhere; comics historian Don Markstein said, [...] "It was faithful to the story even to the point of leaving the monster trapped in the ice at the end — so of course, the fifth issue began with him being rescued." [...] In a 1989 interview, Ploog said, [...] "I really enjoyed doing Frankenstein because I related to that naive monster wandering around a world he had no knowledge of — an outsider seeing everything through the eyes of a child." [...] The following year, Ploog teamed with writer Steve Gerber on Man-Thing #5-11 (May-Nov. 1974), penciling a critically acclaimed series of stories involving a dead clown, psychic paralysis in the face of modern society, and other topics far removed from the usual fare of comics of the time, with Ploog's cute-but-creepy art style setting off Gerber's trademark intellectual surrealism.|$|E

Towards the east, the valley hosts numerous townships, while to the west it opens into a lowland marsh area, bordered by a five-kilometre beach. The wetland is subjected to various forms of anthropogenic pollution; {{the two most important}} being the discharge of urban runoff and treated effluent from the local sewage works.

40|$|Gravity shapes us. From {{birth to}} death, what bodies {{can do is}} bound by what they weigh. Things fall, softly or heavily, {{constantly}} or all at once. Some things are too heavy to carry, or to lift. Some things carry us. Loaded combines an evocative original soundscape with texts ranging from ancient literature to modern science. Its eight performers use planks, sandbags as well as each other to explore how bodies and structures learn to bear loads – or fall apart. Violent, lyrical and funny, Loaded is a startling new show about the mechanics of weight {{and what happens when}} we face the limits of our strength. The production developed as part of the BA Acting Collaborative and Devised Theatre curriculum at Royal Central which pioneers new approaches to actor-training and theatre-making. Working {{for the first time on}} a dance-theatre show, graduates from the BA Hons in Acting CDT and BA Hons in Theatre Practice programmes collaborate with established, award-winning artists, Neil Bettles, Vicki Manderson and Colin Grenfell ([URL] Artist residencies at Ormiston Academy Trust (<b>Jan-Oct</b> 2017), The Place Theatre, London (Sept 2017) and The Old Rep Theatre, Birmingham (Oct 2017) are followed by four performances at The Old Rep from 5 - 6 October 2017.
