5|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of <b>formicine</b> ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
5|$|Their {{colouration}} is variable; black {{combined with}} red and yellow is a common pattern, and many species have golden-coloured pubescence (hair). Many other species are brightly coloured, which warns predators to avoid them. The <b>formicine</b> ant Camponotus bendigensis is similar in appearance to M. fulvipes, and data suggest C. bengdigensis is a batesian mimic of M. fulvipes. The number of malpighian tubules differs between castes; in M. dispar, males have 16 tubules, queens range from 23 to 26, and workers have 21 to 29.|$|E
25|$|The {{workers in}} five ant species and the queens in some ants {{are known to}} {{reproduce}} by parthenogenesis. In Cataglyphis cursor, a European <b>formicine</b> ant, the queens and workers can produce new queens by parthenogenesis. The workers are produced sexually.|$|E
50|$|<b>Formicines</b> retain some {{primitive}} features, such as {{the presence}} of cocoons around pupae, the presence of ocelli in workers, and little tendency toward reduction of palp or antennal segmentation in most species, except subterranean groups. Extreme modification of mandibles is rare, except in the genera Myrmoteras and Polyergus. However, some members show considerable evolutionary advancement in behaviors such as slave-making and symbiosis with root-feeding hemipterans. Finally, all <b>formicines</b> have very reduced stings and enlarged venom reservoirs, with the venom gland, specialized (uniquely among ants) for the production of formic acid.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using {{published}} istributions of 65 {{species from}} the British Isles and northern Europe, {{we show that}} ant assemblages change with latitude in two ways. First, as commonly found for many types of organisms, the number of ant species decreased significantly with increasing lat-itude. For Ireland and Great Britain, species richness also increased significantly with region area. Second, although rarely demonstrated for ectotherms, the body size of ant species, as measured by worker length, increased signific-antly with increasing latitude. We found that this body-size pattern existed in the subfamily Formicinae and, to a lesser extent, in the Myrmicinae, which together com-prised 95 % of the ant species in our study area. There was a trend for <b>formicines</b> to increase in size with latitude faster than myrmicines. We also show that the pattern of increas-ing body size was due primarily to the ranges of ant species shifting to higher latitudes as their body sizes increased, with larger <b>formicines</b> becoming less represented atsouth-erly latitudes and larger myrmicines becoming more represented at northerly latitudes. We conclude by discussing five potential mechanisms for generating the observed body-size patterns: the heat-conservation hypo-thesis, two hypotheses concerning phylogenetic history, the migration-ability h pothesis, and the starvation-resist-ance hypothesis.

5000|$|Camponotus festinatus is {{a species}} of {{carpenter}} ant that is typically found in the Southwestern United States and northern reaches of Mexico. It is most commonly found around Tucson, Arizona. It lives in the semi-dead branches of palo verde trees found in the area. Camponotus festinatus is an exclusively liquid feeder. These ants can only feed on sap from trees or the juices of a deceased animal. Like most ants, their diet is primarily sugar with some protein. Camponotus festinatus ants are not known to be aggressive except towards other ants. Soldiers will prefer to run from humans rather than be aggressive. In principle, these ants can bite with their mandibles. However, as carpenter ants like these are <b>formicines,</b> they have no functional sting. Instead of stinging, they can use an acidopore to spray formic acid.|$|R

50|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that the age of the most recent common ancestor for Nothomyrmecia and Myrmecia is approximately 74 million years old, giving a likely origin in the Cretaceous. There are two hypotheses of the internal phylogeny of Nothomyrmecia: subfamily Formicinae is more closely related to Nothomyrmecia than it is to Myrmecia, evolving from Nothomyrmecia-like ancestors. Alternatively, Nothomyrmecia and Aneuretinae may have shared a common ancestor; the two most likely separated from each other, and the first <b>formicines</b> evolved from the Aneuretinae instead. Currently, scientists agree that Nothomyrmecia most likely evolved from ancestors to the Ponerinae. Nothomyrmecia and other primitive ant genera such as Amblyopone and Myrmecia exhibit behaviour similar to a clade of soil-dwelling families of vespoid wasps. The following cladogram generated by Canadian entomologist S. B. Archibald and his colleagues shows the possible phylogenetic position of Nothomyrmecia among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae. They suggest that Nothomyrmecia may be closely related to extinct Myrmeciinae ants such as Avitomyrmex, Macabeemyrma, Prionomyrmex, and Ypresiomyrma.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of six well-established coconut plantations to {{the conservation of}} biodiversity, specifically of ants, was investigated using soil sifting, timed hand collection and honey baiting along five, 100 m transects established in each plantation. Twenty honey-baited pitfall traps were set throughout each sampling area of each plantation. Collected worker ants were preserved in 70 % ethanol and sorted and identified to the furthest possible taxonomic levels under a low-power stereo-microscope. The ant species observed at the five transects in each plantation were tabulated and species richness and proportional abundance of each species at each plantation were recorded. The Shannon-Wiener Diversity index for the ant assemblage at each plantation was calculated. Air and soil temperature, soil humidity and soil pH at each locality were also measured. A diverse ant assemblage occurred at each plantation, where between 19 and 29 species in 4 or 5 subfamilies were recorded; the Shannon-Wiener diversity index values were determined. Higher proportions of <b>formicines</b> and myrmicines than those of other subfamilies were observed. Two or more species in higher proportions {{than the rest of}} the ants occurred in each assemblage. Also, the six plantations shared three species and five plantations shared nine species in common. The considerable diversity of ants indicated a healthy environment and provided insight into the presence of other animals in the well-established coconut plantations...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of ants as elements in cave ecology has been mostly unrecognized. A global list of ant species recorded from caves, compiled from {{a review of}} existing literature, is presented. This paper also reviews what is currently known about ants occurring in Arizona (USA) caves. The diversity and distribution represented in these records suggests ants are relatively common cave visitors (trogloxenes). A general utilization of caves by ants within both temperate and tropical latitudes may be inferred from this combined evidence. Observations of ant behavior in Arizona caves demonstrate a low level and sporadic, but persistent, use of these habitats and their contained resources by individual ant colonies. Documentation of Neivamyrmex sp. preying on cave-inhabiting arthropods is reported here for the first time. Observations of hypogeic army ants in caves suggests they may not penetrate to great vertical depth in search of prey, but can be persistent occupants in relatively shallow, horizontal sections of caves where they may prey on endemic cave animals. First cave records for ten ant species are reported from Arizona caves. These include two species of Neivamyrmex (N. nigrescens Cresson and Neivamyrmex sp.; Formicidae: Dorylinae), four myrmicines (Pheidole portalensis Wilson, Pheidole cf. porcula Wheeler, Solenopsis aurea Wheeler and Stenamma sp. Westwood), one dolichoderine (Forelius keiferi Wheeler) and three <b>formicines</b> (Lasius arizonicus Wheeler, L. sitiens Wilson, and Camponotus sp. Mayr) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{workers in}} five ant species and the queens in some ants {{are known to}} {{reproduce}} by parthenogenesis. In Cataglyphis cursor, a European <b>formicine</b> ant, the queens and workers can produce new queens by parthenogenesis. The workers are produced sexually.|$|E
50|$|Workers are {{generally}} monomorphic, although some species are variable in size, {{with a possible}} example of worker polymorphism observed in N. amblyops from Madagascar. Nylanderia workers can generally be easily distinguished from other <b>formicines</b> based {{on the presence of}} six mandibular teeth, erect macrosetae on the scapes and legs, and paired erect macrosetae on the pronotum and mesonotum. These morphological features are considered synapomorphies for the genus, and will effectively separate this genus from other genera. Overall, the body shape for most Nylanderia workers is compact and robust in that the mesosomal regions {{are generally}} short (as measured against the long axis of the body) and relatively high when compared to a species such as Paratrechina longicornis. There are, however, several species where the mesosoma is more elongated, superficially resembling Paratrechina longicornis. Long erect macrosetae are almost never found on the dorsal face of the propodeum, with one known exception. However, species with an elongated mesosoma or short propodeal macrosetae do possess six mandibular teeth, erect macrosetae on the scapes and legs, and paired erect macrosetae on the pronotum and mesonotum which support their placement within Nylanderia based on the definition of the genus proposed above. Additionally, when macrosetae are present on the propodeum, they show a pattern generally similar to that found on the pronotum and mesonotum of Nylanderia, with the macrosetae being numerous and of varying lengths. This is in contrast to related genera, for example Paraparatrechina, where the macrosetae are limited to a single, distinct pair. Given the differences in the patterns of these macrosetae among these genera, and when considering additional characters as outlined above, LaPolla, Brady & Shattuck 2011 (2011) interpreted the presence of macrosetae on the propodeum within Nylanderia as having arisen independently from those observed in other closely related genera.|$|R
50|$|Paraparatrechina {{are small}} (typically around 1-2 mm in total length) <b>formicine</b> ants, which often reflect a {{metallic}} iridescence (blue, purple and pink hues have been observed) under light microscopy. In darker species, the iridescence {{tends to be}} a darker bluish-purple, while lighter colored species either show little iridescence or reflect a more pinkish-purple hue. Paraparatrechina are usually easily distinguishable from other <b>formicine</b> genera by a unique mesosomal setal pattern: two pairs of erect setae on the pronotum, one pair on the mesonotum and one pair on the propodeum. Nylanderia, the genus most likely confused with Paraparatrechina, never possesses a pair of erect setae on the propodeum. The mandibles of Paraparatrechina also possess five teeth, while in Nylanderia six teeth are usually present.|$|E
50|$|O. pumilio {{can also}} {{attribute}} its cutaneous toxicity to its rich diet of <b>formicine</b> ants. Species of the <b>formicine</b> genus Brachymyrmex contain pumiliotoxins which the frogs incorporate and accumulate poison from. There is a variability of alkaloid profiles among populations and individuals of O. pumilio, which {{is indicative of}} varying levels of available prey within their intraspecific habitats. Research and physical analysis reveal that maternally derived alkaloids exist in young tadpoles. During tadpole-rearing, mother frogs feed their young an unfertilized egg from their ovaries after dropping each individual tadpole into a repository of water usually found in a bromeliad. Tadpoles lacking the obligate nutritive egg diet do not contain the alkaloid. This step is crucial for the tadpoles to sequester the alkaloid from their mother; without such, young tadpoles become susceptible to predation by arthropods and other frogs.|$|E
50|$|Polyrhachis is a genus of <b>formicine</b> ants {{found in}} the Old World {{with a large number}} of species (over 600). The genus is yet to be {{comprehensively}} resolved and contains many varied species including nest weavers (e.g. Polyrhachis dives), swimming workers (e.g. Polyrhachis sokolova), soil (e.g. Polyrhachis proxima) and tree dwellers (e.g. Polyrhachis bicolor).|$|E
50|$|Formica rufibarbis is a European <b>formicine</b> ant of the Formica fusca group. In the {{classification}} by Auguste Forel, it is {{treated in the}} subgenus Serviformica.

50|$|This ant has {{the small}} eyes, compact body and yellowish-brown {{colouration}} {{typical of many}} ants that live underground.

5000|$|... 58 Myrmelachista {{species have}} been described, with a few {{recognized}} subspecies; the diversity of this genus has most likely been underestimated due to the limited taxonomic knowledge available regarding Myrmelachista. In the most recent molecular databased phylogenetic proposals for ants, Myrmelachista is a sister group of Brachymyrmex, and these groups constitute the most basal and closely related <b>formicine</b> groups.|$|E
50|$|Solenopsis spp. ants can be {{identified}} by three body features—a pedicel with two nodes, an unarmed propodeum, and antennae with 10 segments plus a two-segmented club. Many ants bite, and <b>formicine</b> ants can cause irritation by spraying formic acid; myrmecine ants like fire ants have a dedicated venom-injecting sting, which injects an alkaloid venom, as well as mandibles for biting.|$|E

50|$|Ophiocordyceps myrmecophila {{has been}} noted {{as one of the}} more {{dominant}} entomopathogenic fungi of <b>formicine</b> ants in the tropical rainforests of Thailand. This species and others like it can parasitize multiple arthropod hosts. Although entomopathogenic fungi have been identified as a widespread organism, tending obviously to be found in similar habitats to that of their arthropod host; ubiquity of the host, as well as evolutionary cospeciation are key factors of host specificity and therefore location.|$|E
50|$|Acropyga is a genus {{of small}} <b>formicine</b> ants. Some species can be {{indirect}} pests. A. acutiventris, which is found from India to Australia, tends subterranean, root-feeding mealybugs {{of the species}} Xenococcus annandalei. Living, gravid females are carried in the jaws of A. acutiventris queens during their nuptial flight, to establish the symbiotic association in founding colonies. Other Acropyga species have relationships with different species of mealybugs, {{and it could be}} a trait common to the whole genus.|$|E
50|$|When attacked, these ant, {{like other}} <b>formicine</b> ants, can bite but not sting, and excrete formic acid through a hairy circle or acidopore {{on the end}} of the abdomen, using it as a venom, which causes a minute pain that quickly fades. Formic acid was named after the Latin word formica (ant), because it was first {{distilled}} from ants in the 17th century. Uniquely, the tawny ant also uses formic acid as an antidote against the venom of the fire ant.|$|E
50|$|Ants {{attack and}} defend {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of <b>formicine</b> ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
50|$|Their {{colouration}} is variable; black {{combined with}} red and yellow is a common pattern, and many species have golden-coloured pubescence (hair). Many other species are brightly coloured, which warns predators to avoid them. The <b>formicine</b> ant Camponotus bendigensis is similar in appearance to M. fulvipes, and data suggest C. bengdigensis is a batesian mimic of M. fulvipes. The number of malpighian tubules differs between castes; in M. dispar, males have 16 tubules, queens range from 23 to 26, and workers have 21 to 29.|$|E
5000|$|Lasius is a genus of <b>formicine</b> ants. [...] The type {{species for}} this genus {{is the black}} garden ant, Lasius niger. Other major members, which live in drier heathland, are the cornfield ant, L. neoniger, and L. alienus. Other species include the {{temporary}} social parasites of the L. mixtus group and the hyper-social parasite Lasius fuliginosus. Lasius flavus is also a commonly seen species, building grassy hillocks in undisturbed pasture. In the Alps, these mounds - always aligned east to catch the first rays of the rising sun - have been traditionally used by goatherds as natural compasses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Formicine</b> ants have {{a single}} node-like or scale-like petiole (postpetiole entirely lacking) and {{the apex of the}} abdomen has a {{circular}} or U-shaped opening (the acidopore), usually fringed with hairs. A functional sting is absent, and defense is provided by the ejection of formic acid through the acidopore. If the acidopore is concealed by the pygidium and difficult to discern, then the antennal sockets are located well behind the posterior margin of the clypeus (cf. Dolichoderinae). In most formicines, the eyes are well developed (ocelli may also be present), the antennal insertions are not concealed by the frontal carinae, and the promesonotal suture is present and flexible.|$|E
50|$|Many Diptera are mimetic. An {{instance}} is Syrphidae {{often are}} brightly coloured, with spots, stripes, and bands of yellow or brown covering their bodies. Due to this colouring,and sometimes behaviour patterns, {{they are often}} mistaken for wasps or bees; they exhibit Batesian mimicry. The wing pattern of the sciomyzidTrypetoptera punctulata {{is very similar to}} some Tephritidae, and might, in fact, mimic the colour pattern of some spidersThere are several fly species that look like an ant.At least one species from the little studied Richardiidae genus Sepsisoma mimic ants, particularly the <b>formicine</b> ant Camponotus crassus.Several species of Micropezidae (stilt-legged flies) resemble ants (especially the wingless, haltere-less Badisis ambulans), as do species in the genus Strongylophthalmyia and Syringogaster..Mydidae are mimics of stingingHymenoptera.|$|E
50|$|Nest {{relocation}} {{is possibly}} aided by trail laying behavior, which is highly unusual for solitary foraging desert ants. The founding stage of an ant colony is usually {{characterized by the}} same sequence of events. Reproduction occurs in synchronized mating flights, which are probably triggered by rain. The virgin queen leaves the nest in a mating flight and is inseminated by one or several males, and there is circumstantial evidence that males are chemically attracted to queens. She then looks for a new nest site and starts excavating a small nest, where she lays eggs and rears a small brood. The queens found new colonies independently and {{without the help of}} other queens or workers; this mode of colony founding is common in <b>formicine</b> ants. However, nothing is known about the number of queens in later colony stages or other populations of M. bagoti.|$|E
50|$|The {{mandible}} is {{the insect}} organ for biting and crushing, {{analogous to the}} jaw in mammals. In the genus Polistes, the lateral mandibular groove is smaller in size than in other genera of social wasps. A common misconception is that the mandibular gland is the anatomical portion shaped like a sac. In actuality, the sac formation is the gland reservoir that feeds into the gland itself. The actual gland is pressed up against the sac surface. Gland cells are shaped like polygons. Like poisonous structures in <b>formicine</b> ants, gland cells are continuous with the gland reservoir, but no filaments extend from the gland or sac {{as they do in}} the ants. The sac is closest to mandible’s medial portion. A duct exits the sac. The duct opening is encircled by a sphincter muscle controlling the gland’s secretions. The duct is opened by sclerotized bars in conjunction with the hypopharynx. When the hypopharynx moves, pressure forms on the opening of the duct via the bars. When the bars dissipate this pressure, the duct closes.|$|E
