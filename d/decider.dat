5|$|Going {{into the}} final match, City were level on points with {{neighbours}} Manchester United, with City holding the advantage in goal average – the first <b>decider</b> if teams finished level on points – but needing to win {{to be sure of}} staying above their cross-city rivals. Liverpool were three points behind, but had a game in hand, so could still win the title if both City and United faltered. City faced tenth-placed Newcastle United at St James' Park; United were at home to bottom-half Sunderland. Bookmakers made United slight favourites for the title.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the <b>decider,</b> Woodfull {{ran into}} form. In {{consecutive}} innings, he scored 131 and 228 not out against Gloucestershire and Glamorgan respectively. However controversy followed in a match against Nottinghamshire. In the first innings, Woodfull scored 81 as Australia batted first and made 237. Bill Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline practitioners of 1932–33, employed it with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the 1988–89 Football League season was contested at Anfield between Liverpool and Arsenal, {{the top two}} teams in the First Division, on 26 May 1989.

Midfielder Michael Thomas scored the second goal in the final seconds of the match, ending Arsenal's 18-year wait to be crowned champions.|$|E
40|$|Candidate {{personality}} traits {{have long been}} recognized as influential in the determination of voting choice. However, little is understood of how the perception of candidates’ traits influences different categories of voters. Based on a large-scale electoral panel survey (ITANES, ITAlian National Election Studies), {{the present study investigated}} whether the voting choice of early and late <b>deciders</b> differentially relied on candidate traits. Results showed that after considering the influence of ideology and economy assessment, candidate traits influenced the voting choice of early <b>deciders</b> and, even more, of late <b>deciders.</b> However, while early <b>deciders</b> took into account both incumbent and challenger traits, late <b>deciders</b> mainly relied on incumbent traits. Political sophistication moderated this effect, with high-sophisticated early <b>deciders</b> relying even more on the challenger, and low-sophisticated late <b>deciders</b> relying even more on the incumbent. The distinction between incumbent and challenger is discussed as a key variable in explaining the role of candidate traits in the choice of voters differing as to voting decision time and political sophistication...|$|R

40|$|Previous voting studies {{classified}} voters {{into three}} groups - pre-campaign <b>deciders,</b> campaign <b>deciders,</b> and last-minute <b>deciders</b> - according their vote decision timing and suggested a linear relationship between time-of-voting decision and political/nonpolitical characteristics, predicting that the earlier voters make their decisions, the more inclined {{they are to be}} politically involved, interested and attentive. This study re-examines the linear relationship suggested by past studies, treating time-of-voting decision as a dependent variable. Furthermore, it explores the roles of interpersonal communications, specifically heterogeneity within interpersonal communication networks, in individuals 2 ̆ 7 voting behaviors with the expectation that heterogeneity is a primary determinant of the time-of-voting decision. Data for the study came from the 2000 American National Election Studies, and the same variables as previous studies were used in analysis. Results showed {{there were no significant differences}} between campaign <b>deciders</b> and last-minute <b>deciders,</b> while pre-campaign <b>deciders</b> significantly differed from the other two groups. Further analysis with non-voters included found that both campaign <b>deciders</b> and last-minute <b>deciders</b> showed significantly higher levels of political participation and interests than non-voters. These results do not support the findings of previous studies. Heterogeneity was found to be an important predictor for time-of-voting decision. Supporting the 2 ̆ 2 cross-pressure 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis, it was found that as heterogeneity increased, opinion formation was delayed. Also, it was revealed that heterogeneity was negatively correlated with political participation and media use and attention. The results suggest that heterogeneity should be reconsidered as an important factor to fully understand the process by which electoral preferences are formed and affected by campaign messages...|$|R
5|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most dramatic conclusions to a league season in the history of the English game. It is also regarded as the starting point of a renaissance in English football; the ban on English clubs playing in European football was lifted a year later and a new top-flight division – the Premier League, was formed in 1992 which generated more revenue for clubs. The title <b>decider</b> also formed the centrepiece of Nick Hornby's book Fever Pitch.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal, {{the match}} favourites and holders of the Football League Cup, were making their fourth final {{appearance}} in the competition. They had won the League Cup once before, in 1987, and lost two consecutive finals in 1968 and 1969. By contrast Luton Town were making their first League Cup final appearance. The club enjoyed relative success in the cups during the 1987–88 season, reaching the last four of the FA Cup and final of the Full Members Cup. Arsenal and Luton had only played each other once in the League Cup; George Graham the present-day manager of Arsenal, scored the <b>decider</b> in a third-round tie on 6 October 1970.
