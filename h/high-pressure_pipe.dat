40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermoplastic pipes {{are often}} {{manufactured}} with profiled walls to max-imize the flexural stiffness {{of the pipe}} for a given amount of polymer. Thin elements in the profile can buckle {{under the influence of}} large earth pressures associated with deep burial or other extreme loading conditions. Earth load tests have been conducted on high density polyethylene pipes with a number of different wall profiles. Two <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> test cells have been used to conduct these tests. Observations of local buckling in the internal liners of these products have been examined and compared to stability assessments based on the conventional equation for buckling in stiffened plate structures (following modification of that equation to an equation that defines critical strain instead of critical stress). The strain levels that develop in the liner are, however, dependent on three-dimensional bending within the pipe profile. Provided the effects of three-dimensional bending in the pipe profile are considered, the modified Bryan equa-tion appears to be a useful tool for quantifying liner stability and should be considere...|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} hydraulic layout for Common Rail (C. R.) {{fuel injection}} systems was proposed and realized. The rail {{was replaced by a}} <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> junction in order to obtain faster dynamic system response during engine transients, smaller pressure induced stresses and sensibly reduced production costs. Compared to a commercial accumulator, whose internal volume ranges from 20 to 40 cm 3, such a junction provided a hydraulic capacitance of about 2 cm 3 and had the main function of connecting the pump delivery to the electroinjector feeding pipes. In the design of the novel FIS layout, the choice of the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> dimensions was critical for system performance optimization. Injector supplying pipes with length and inner diameter not in the actual production range were selected and applied, so as to stabilize the system pressure level during an injection event and reduce pressure wave oscillations. The new injection system was realized and subjected to experimentation on a high performance test bench Moehwald-Bosch MEP 2000 -CA 4000 under engine-like conditions. For single injections, the performance of the proposed apparatus was shown to be similar to those of commercial-type C. R. systems. On the other hand, with reference to multiple injections, the dynamics of the innovative system resulted to be consistently improved because of a significantly reduced dependence of the overall injected fuel amount on dwell-time in sequential injection shots. Furthermore, fluid dynamic interaction between injectors was minimized by the adoption of hydraulic circuit design solutions such as to prevent the occurrence of resonance phenomena among injectors. The results proved that the rail capacitance was not an essential parameter in the attenuation of pressure wave disturbance, whereas injector inlet-pipe sizes did have a large effect on these and therefore substantiated the feasibility of a new-generation electronically controlled diesel FIS without accumulator. In addition, a modification of latest solenoid-generation commercial Multijet electroinjector was realized so as to sensibly reduce the dwell time bound for fusion-free sequential injection shots, enhancing such component at HCCI combustion application level. The new injector design, based on an integrated experimental-theoretical analysis of system dynamics, was carried out by a pre¬viously developed C. R. numerical model.

40|$|An {{innovative}} hydraulic layout for Common Rail (CR) {{fuel injection}} systems (FIS) without accumulator was further developed and assessed.

In order to meet the ever more stringent emission standards, significant efforts have been devoted to the research and development of internal combustion engines. The requirements for more efficient and responsive diesel engines have led to the introduction and implementation of multiple injection strategies. However, the effects of such injection modes on the hydraulic systems, such as the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> and fuel injectors, must be thoroughly examined and compensated for since the combustion and the formation of pollutants in direct-injection engines are directly influenced by the spatial and temporal distribution of the injected fuel within the combustion chamber. This study investigated the hydraulic effects of two-stage fuel injection on diesel combustion and emissions. The fuel-injection system was characterised for all the tested strategies through the measurement of the fuel-injection rate and quantity. In particular, the interaction between the two injection events was identified. The effects of two-stage injection, dwell angle and the interactions between two consecutive injection events on the combustion process and the emissions were investigated in a high-speed direct-injection single-cylinder optical diesel engine using heat-release analysis and high-speed fuel spray and combustion visualisation techniques. The results indicated that the two-stage injection strategy has the potential for simultaneous reduction of nitrogen oxide, soot and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. The results suggested that an optimum fuel quantity in the first injection exists, 0 ??? 30 %, with which simultaneous reduction of nitrogen oxide, soot and unburned hydrocarbon emissions can be achieved with the added benefits of improved engine performance, fuel economy and combustion noise. However, higher soot emissions were produced, mainly due to the interaction between the two consecutive fuel-injection events whereby the fuel sprays during the second injection were injected into burning regions, as well as reduced soot oxidation due to the continuation of the combustion into the expansion stroke...|$|R

This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. Thresher could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the <b>high-pressure</b> air <b>pipes,</b> and so it sank.

The study covers a wide range of engine load and speed operating conditions, comprising measurements of cylinder pressure diagrams, <b>high-pressure</b> fuel <b>pipe</b> pressures, exhaust gas temperatures, fuel consumptions, exhaust smokiness and exhaust gas emissions (nitrogen oxides, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide). Processing of the measurements provides important performance parameters such as maximum combustion pressure, dynamic injection timing, ignition delay, combustion irregularity and knocking tendency. The differences in the measured performance and exhaust emission parameters are determined for engine operation with JP- 8 fuel, against baseline engine operation using diesel fuel. The study shows that the exhaust emission levels are not much different for operation with the two fuels. On the contrary, operation with JP- 8 fuel increases combustion pressures, combustion intensity and irregularity. This is caused mainly by high pressure fluctuations present in the fuel injection system due to the different physical properties of JP- 8 fuel (compared to diesel fuel), which totally change the injection characteristics. Retardation of the static injection timing is one means of improving this situation, while using the same fuel injection equipment. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

Onedimensional flow equations in conservation form were used to simulate wave propagation phenomena throughout the <b>high-pressure</b> connecting <b>pipes,</b> including the feeding pipe of the injector nozzle. In order to simulate the temperature variations due to the fuel compressibility, the energy equation was used in addition to mass conservation and momentum balance equations. Besides, the possible cavitation phenomena effects on the mass flow rate through the injector bleed orifice and the nozzle holes were taken into account. A simple model of the electromagnetic driving circuit was used to predict the temporal distribution of the force acting on the pilot-valve anchor.

The process of &# 145;direct steam generation&# 146; in very long pipes, up to 300 m in a straight run, has not previously been performed at this scale; other systems use shorter pipe runs, or use other fluids such as non-boiling oil.

Beam solar radiation at the prototype site is estimated from available data including satellite-derived and ground-based measurements. Existing correlations for the beam component of global radiation do not apply well to Australian conditions so a new correlation is proposed. Computational fluid dynamics simulations establish radiative heat-loss as the dominant mode for the thermal absorber. Results are gathered for a range of sizes and shapes, and heat-loss correlations are derived for use in subsequent simulation. Two-phase flow in the absorber direct-steam-generation process is examined, and a detailed model including, pipe-friction pressure drops, flow-boiling heat transfer and cavity heat loss is presented, with validation against the experimental results of other workers.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} of the natural gas industry, gas transmission pipelines have been developed rapidly in terms of safety, economy and efficiency. Our recent studies have shown that an important factor of main pipelines serviceability loss under their long-term service is the in-bulk metal degradation of the pipe wall. This leads to the loss of the initial mechanical properties, primarily, resistance to brittle fracture, which were set in engineering calculations at the pipeline design stage. At the same time stress corrosion cracking has been identified as one of the predominant failures in pipeline steels in humid environments, which causes rupture of <b>high-pressure</b> gas transmission <b>pipes</b> as well as serious economic losses and disasters. In the present work the low-carbon pipeline steels with different strength levels {{from the point of view}} of their susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking in the as-received state and after in-laboratory accelerated degradation under environmental conditions similar to those of an acidic soil were investigated. The main objectives of this study were to determine whether {{the development}} of higher strength materials led to greater susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking and whether degraded pipeline steels became more susceptible to stress corrosion cracking than in the as-received state. The procedure of accelerated degradation of pipeline steels was developed and introduced in laboratory under the combined action of axial loading and hydrogen charging. It proved to be reliable and useful to performed laboratory simulation of in-service degradation of pipeline steels with different strength. The in-laboratory degraded 17 H 1 S and X 60 pipeline steels tested in the NS 4 solution saturated with CO 2 under open circuit potential revealed the susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking, reflected in the degradation of mechanical properties, and at the same time the degraded X 60 steel showed higher resistance to stress corrosion cracking than the degraded 17 H 1 S steel.

There is therefore,s till a big potential for development work in the subject. Discrepancies between different models which have been developed have mainly centred on the assumptions used in developing the basic partial differential equations of flow, and subsequent simplifications; the thermophysical model used; representation of various terms in the equations such as the friction term; and the numerical method of solution of the basic partial differential equations. A previous model developed by Tiley (1989), overestimated the actual wave speeds and had problems of instability of the solution. A new approach, in which the three basic partial differential equation of flow are derived, based on the assumption of an unsteady quasi-one-dimensional flow of a real gas through a rigid constant cross-section area pipe, and using the Gamma Delta method is used. No further simplification is made on the basic equations. Significant improvements have been made on the type of equation of state, thermodynamic model, heat transfer approximation and friction factor representation. The QUANT software for thermodynamic and transport properties of real gases is used. A flow dependent explicit equation of Chen (1979) is used to calculate the frictional force and heat transfer is calculated using the concept of recovery factor and adiabatic wall temperature. Numerical solution of the basic equations is performed using the third-order Warming- Kutler-Lomax method, the second-order MacCormack method and the method of characteristics. A pc based computer coding with the C language is used. The QUANT software has successfully been incorporated with the programme. The full benefits of the software could not be realised with linebreak problems due to limitation of the range within which it gives output at present, but satisfactory results have nevertheless been attained. An improved and more accurate way of calculating the break boundary condition has been used. A non-uniform grid spacing has been used, which allow fine grid spacing {{in the vicinity of the}} break in order to enable accurate modelling of the rapid transients occurring in that part. Two different models for calculating the heat transfer i. e. one for the case of pipes exposed to the atmosphere and buried pipes have been incorporated with the model. Experimental data from full-scale pipeline tests is used to validate the computer models. Results from the computer model simulations show good agreement with the experimental data. The MacCormack method has been found to be unsuitable for modelling transient flow following linebreak in high-pressure gas pipelines. The method of characteristics has proved to be the method of solution for such applications. A better understanding of the flow following a break in <b>high-pressure</b> gas <b>pipes</b> is achieved, especially the decompression behaviour at the break boundary. Data gathered from feasibility studies conducted in the late 1980 's for a pipeline in Tanzania is used to validate the steady state analysis model and to simulate a linebreak in the pipeline. Results of the computer simulation are discussed and recommendations made on the suitability the pipeline design. Additional work is recommended on refining and further testing of the computer programmes and using the Gamdeleps method which covers all the three phases region i. e. gas, liquid and gas/liqui...|$|R
