40|$|The dynamic {{relationship}} self-efficacy holds with behaviour {{leads us}} to suggest that self-efficacy may be a mediating mechanism for spillover. We tested this proposition by investigating whether engaging in simple and easy pro-environmental behaviour is associated with self-efficacy, which then increases intentions and subsequent actions towards new or more challenging pro-environmental behaviours. We tested this hypothesis in two studies using Australian residents. The first demonstrated spillover from easy water-related behaviours to more difficult water-related behavioural intentions, and the second study used longitudinal data to provide evidence for spillover from easy water conservation behaviours to the more difficult self-reported actions of installing water efficient appliances. Both studies supported our prediction of self-efficacy mediating the relationship between easy and more difficult pro-environmental self-reported behaviour.

Required changes in land use and forestry, however, often imply foregoing returns from locally more attractive resource use strategies. We assess and compare the prospects of mitigating climate change through emission reductions from forestry and agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon. We use official statistics, literature, and case study material from both old and new colonization frontiers to identify the scope for emission reductions, in terms of potential additionality, opportunity costs, technological complexity, transaction costs, and risks of economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>spillover</b> effects. Our findings point to a comparative advantage in the Brazilian Amazon of forest conservation-based over land-use modifying mitigation options, {{especially in terms of}} higher potential additionality in emission reductions. Low-cost mitigation options do exist also in use-modifying agriculture and forestry, but tend to be technologically complex thus requiring more costly intervention schemes.

40|$|Although {{aquaculture}} as been practised {{for many}} centuries, {{it was in}} the past on quite a modest scale and limited to a few species e. g. carp. However, in recent decades, aquaculture has shown very rapid expansion. This is partly because catches of wild fish have expanded at a slower rate than demand and many new scientific and technological advances have been made in aquaculture. Furthermore, by the mid- 1990 s evidence available to scientists indicated that catches of wild fish had either reached, nearly reached or even exceeded their sustainable limits (Williams, 1997). Consequently, according to Meryl Williams (1997, p. 18), Director of ICLARM, now “aquaculture is the major, though not sole hope, for improving the world’s fish production”. Aquaculture, particularly marine aquaculture, has become a new economic frontier. Just as humankind in the past experienced the Agricultural Revolution it seems now to be starting on an Aquaculture Revolution. Naturally, this raises the question of how sustainable it will be. The {{purpose of this article is}} to discuss the sustainability of aquaculture production. If expanded aquaculture production sets into motion forces that make it unsustainable, economic development based on it will be short lived. One should at least be aware how lack of economic sustainability of aquaculture production can arise, and be prepared to adopt policies to curb or prevent undesired trends in this. In this article, it is pointed out that (a) factors endogenous to the productive unit and (b) factors exogenous to individual productive units (such as <b>environmental</b> <b>spillovers</b> or externalities) and result in the unsustainable development of aquaculture. However, most attention in this article is given to adverse <b>environmental</b> <b>spillovers</b> as a contributor to lack of sustainability of aquaculture. This is because lack of sustainability in the endogenous case results from the rational choice of businesses 1 involved in aquaculture whereas the outcome when externalities exist can be inferior from the point of view of all or from a social viewpoint. There is consideration of the relative sustainability of extensive aquaculture systems versus intensive ones, and of the impact of aquaculture on the sustainability of natural fish stocks. Policies for regulating <b>environmental</b> <b>spillovers</b> to achieve a social economic gain, and thereby in most cases promote greater sustainability of aquaculture, are outlined and discussed. By concentrating on a particular sector, it is possible to identify various policy issues raised by the quest for sustainable development that may be overlooked in a macroeconomic context...|$|R

The low investment {{in research and development}} actions in comparison with the industrial sector, together with the relatively recent application of environmental requirements and the heterogeneity of environmental controls within firms have led to important changes in the organisation and management of their productive activity. These features are especially related to the implications that location and clustering factors have on environmental knowledge and innovation diffusion. Taking environmental management practices as knowledge of capital, we propose a specific analysis that evaluates the impacts of both <b>environmental</b> investment and <b>spillover</b> on the production function.

Moreover, the theoretical model does well in explaining FDI in the chemical sector; we tend to find significant effects in the correct direction of variables designed to reflect market demand and production costs. Finally, we consistently find a negative impact of own environmental stringency on inbound FDI in the chemical sector; the impact of neighboring environmental stringency is also statistically significant, but the impact is negative on average, contrary to our initial expectations.
