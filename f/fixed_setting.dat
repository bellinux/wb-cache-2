In Section  4, we introduce the <b>fixed</b> <b>set</b> of derivations and get some interesting properties of them. Especially, using the <b>fixed</b> <b>set</b> of isotone derivations, we establish characterizations for some kinds of lattices. Furthermore, we discuss the relations among derivations, ideals and <b>fixed</b> <b>sets</b> in lattices. Finally, some concluding remarks are made in Section  5.|$|R

It is argued that many previous studies of mobility are limited in the use of data collection methods in that they use the workplace or other <b>fixed</b> <b>setting</b> as the location to study the mobile technology. In this paper, I relate and discuss experiences from three different studies of mobile technologies. These studies differed in several ways; in the technologies studied, the general field approach, methods for collecting data, the research question formulated beforehand, as well as the role of the researcher, and the extent of naturally occurring interaction. The practical implications of these differences during the fieldwork are discussed...|$|E

Autonomic controllers often require that events be correlated across multiple components using rule patterns with timer-based transitions, e. g., to detect denial of service attacks and to warn of staging problems with business critical applications. This short paper discusses automatic adjustment of timer values for event correlation rules, in particular compensating for the variability of event propagation delays due to factors such as contention for network and server resources. We describe a corresponding Management Station architecture and present experimental studies on a testbed system that suggest that this approach can produce results at least as good as an optimal <b>fixed</b> <b>setting</b> of timer values. 1...|$|E

The dominant external magnetic field for driving islands is shown to be localized to the outboard midplane for three ITER equilibria that represent the projected range of operational scenarios. The coupling matrices between the poloidal harmonics of the external magnetic perturbations and the resonant fields on the rational surfaces that drive islands are combined for different equilibria and used to determine an ordered list of the dominant errors in the external magnetic field. It is found that efficient and robust error field correction is possible with a <b>fixed</b> <b>setting</b> of the correction currents relative to the currents in the main coils across the range of ITER operating scenarios that was considered...|$|E

If this measurement and the aperture control {{occur in the}} lens unit using the actual video signal as input, {{it is said to}} be a video (AC) iris lens. Alternatively, when the measurement occurs outside the lens unit, it is called a DC iris and an external signal is used to drive the lens. The iris is an adjustable opening (aperture), that controls the amount of light coming through the lens (i.e., the [...] "exposure"). The more the iris is opened, the more light it lets in and the brighter the image will be. A correct iris control is crucial to obtain the optimum image quality, including a balanced contrast and resolution and minimum noise.|$|E

We should note here that {{the performance of the}} system highly depends on the filters and their correct transmittance values. Moreover, we have to note that the Fujifilm 3 D camera we used has limited control; there is no manual focus and the camera does not support the raw data. It has its own white balancing and interpolation algorithms. Even though we have used the <b>fixed</b> <b>setting</b> of the camera during the whole experiment including the characterization and all image acquisitions, the acquired images are still subject to built-in preprocessing and optical changes. This might also have influenced the results leading to higher estimation errors. We believe that the performance can surely be improved with more controllable camera.|$|E
