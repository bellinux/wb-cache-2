5|$|Meanwhile, in 1996 {{the games}} {{industry}} was rocked {{by the news}} that TSR had run into insoluble financial problems and had been bought by Wizards of the Coast. While WotC was busy refocussing TSR's products, Christopher Clark of <b>Inner</b> <b>City</b> Games Designs approached Gygax in 1997 {{to suggest that they}} produce some adventures to sell in game stores while TSR was otherwise occupied; the result was a pair of fantasy adventures published by <b>Inner</b> <b>City</b> Games: A Challenge of Arms (1998) and The Ritual of the Golden Eyes (1999). Gygax introduced some investors to Clark's publication setup, and although the investors were not willing to fund publication of Legendary Adventures, Clark and Gygax formed a partnership called Hekaforge Productions. Gygax was thus able to return to publish Lejendary Adventures in 1999. The game was published as a three-volume set: The Lejendary Rules for All Players (1999), Lejend Master's Lore (2000) and Beasts of Lejend (2000).|$|E
5|$|St James' Church, {{commonly}} known as St James', King Street, is an Anglican parish church in <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> Sydney, Australia, consecrated in February 1824 and named in honour of St James the Great. It became a parish church in 1835. Designed {{in the style of}} a Georgian town church by the transported convict architect Francis Greenway during the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie, St James' is part of the historical precinct of Macquarie Street which includes other early colonial era buildings such as the Hyde Park Barracks. The church remains historically, socially and architecturally significant. The building is the oldest one extant in Sydney's <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> region. It is listed on the Register of the National Estate, and has been described as one of the world's 80 greatest man-made treasures.|$|E

5|$|The streets Volden (The Rampart) and Graven (The Moat) {{testify to}} the defences of the initial Viking {{settlement}} and Allégaderingen in Midtbyen roughly follows the boundaries of that settlement. The street network in the <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> formed during the Middle Ages with narrow, curved streets and low, dense housing by the river and coast. Vesterport (Westward Gate) still bears {{the name of a}} medieval city gate and the narrow alleyways Posthussmøgen and Telefonsmøgen are remnants of toll stations from that time. The <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> has the oldest preserved buildings, especially the Latin Quarter, with houses dating back to the early 17thcentury in Mejlgade and Skolegade. Medieval merchants' mansions with courtyards can be seen in Klostergade, Studsgade and Skolegade. By far, the largest part of the present day city was built during and after the industrialization of the late 1800s and the most represented architectural styles are historicism and modernism, especially Danish functionalism of which there are many fine examples.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} last quarter of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the <b>inner</b> <b>city</b> since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E
