40|$|Heroin-assisted {{treatment}} is effective for methadone treatment-refractory heroin-dependent patients, but continued comorbid cocaine dependence remains problematic. Sustained-release <b>dexamfetamine</b> is a promising agonist pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence and we aimed to assess its acceptance, efficacy, and safety. In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, {{patients who were}} treatment-refractory, as indicated by at least two earlier failed treatments aimed at reducing or abstaining from cocaine use, and who regularly (≥ 8 days/month) used crack-cocaine were enrolled from four heroin-assisted treatment centres in the Netherlands. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive either 12 weeks of daily, supervised prescription of 60 mg/day oral sustained-release <b>dexamfetamine</b> or placebo in addition to co-prescribed methadone and diacetylmorphine. Randomisation {{was done by the}} collaborating pharmacist, using a computer-generated random number sequence with stratification by treatment centre in blocks of four per stratum. Randomisation was masked to patients, staff, and researchers throughout the study. The primary outcome was the number of self-reported days of cocaine use during study treatment, assessed every 4 weeks. Primary and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The study was registered with the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EUdraCT 2013 - 004024 - 11) and with The Netherlands Trial Register (NTR 2576). Between Aug 8, 2014, and Feb 27, 2015, 111 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 73 were enrolled and randomised; 38 patients were assigned to the sustained-release <b>dexamfetamine</b> group and 35 to the placebo group. Sustained-release <b>dexamfetamine</b> treatment resulted in significantly fewer days of cocaine use than placebo treatment (mean 44 · 9 days [SD 29 · 4] vs 60 · 6 days [24 · 3], respectively [95 % CI of difference 3 · 1 - 28 · 4]; p= 0 · 031; Cohen's standardised effect size d= 0 · 58). One or more adverse events were reported by 28 (74 %) patients in the <b>dexamfetamine</b> group and by 16 (46 %) patients in the placebo group. Most adverse events were transient and well-tolerated. Sustained-release <b>dexamfetamine</b> is a well accepted, effective, and safe agonist pharmacotherapy for comorbid treatment-refractory cocaine dependence in heroin-dependent patients in heroin-assisted treatment. Future research should aim to replicate these findings in chronic cocaine-dependent and other stimulant-dependent patients in more routine treatment settings, including strategies to optimise treatment adherence like medication management interventions and contingency management.

40|$|Crack-cocaine {{dependence}} is {{a serious}} and complex problem with as yet no adequate treatment. The CATCH project was initiated to explore new pharmacological treatment options for crack-cocaine dependence in the Netherlands. In three separate parallel-group, randomised controlled, feasibility trials, three promising medications were investigated for their acceptance, efficacy, and safety {{in the treatment of}} crack-cocaine dependence: (1) topiramate 200 mg/day, (2) modafinil 400 mg/day, and (3) sustained-release (SR) <b>dexamfetamine</b> 60 mg/day. In our first trial, topiramate was safe and well-tolerated in the sample of crack-cocaine dependent patients, but efficacy was not supported, probably due to low acceptance of the treatment. Acceptance and benefits of modafinil were not demonstrated in our second trial, most likely due to low adherence. However, in a post hoc analysis, substantial cocaine use reductions were found in a high modafinil-adherent subgroup. Our third trial showed that SR <b>dexamfetamine</b> is a well-accepted, effective, and safe agonist treatment for comorbid treatment-refractory cocaine dependence in heroin dependent patients in heroin-assisted treatment. To conclude, our study is an important contribution to the addiction research field, with negative findings pertaining to the efficacy of topiramate, ambiguous findings for modafinil, and promising findings for agonist substitution treatment with SR <b>dexamfetamine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS) is {{a widely}} spread environmental contaminant. It accumulates {{in the brain and}} has potential neurotoxic effects. The exposure to PFOS has been associated with higher impulsivity and increased ADHD prevalence. We investigated the effects of developmental exposure to PFOS in zebrafish larvae, focusing on the modulation of activity by the dopaminergic system. We exposed zebrafish embryos to 0. 1 or 1 mg/L PFOS (0. 186 or 1. 858 µM, respectively) and assessed swimming activity at 6 dpf. We analyzed the structure of spontaneous activity, the hyperactivity and the habituation during a brief dark period (visual motor response), and the vibrational startle response. The findings in zebrafish larvae were compared with historical data from 3 months old male mice exposed to 0. 3 or 3 mg/kg/day PFOS throughout gestation. Finally, we investigated the effects of <b>dexamfetamine</b> on the alterations in spontaneous activity and startle response in zebrafish larvae. We found that zebrafish larvae exposed to 0. 1 mg/L PFOS habituate faster than controls during a dark pulse, while the larvae exposed to 1 mg/L PFOS display a disorganized pattern of spontaneous activity and persistent hyperactivity. Similarly, mice exposed to 0. 3 mg/kg/day PFOS habituated faster than controls to a new environment, while mice exposed to 3 mg/kg/day PFOS displayed more intense and disorganized spontaneous activity. <b>Dexamfetamine</b> partly corrected the hyperactive phenotype in zebrafish larvae. In conclusion, developmental exposure to PFOS in zebrafish induces spontaneous hyperactivity mediated by a dopaminergic deficit, which can be partially reversed by <b>dexamfetamine</b> in zebrafish larvae...|$|E
40|$|Background Symptoms of attention-deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) {{are known to}} persist into adulthood {{in the majority of}} cases. Aims To determine the prevalence of methylphenidate, <b>dexamfetamine</b> and atomoxetine prescribing and treatment discontinuation in adolescents and young adults. Method A descriptive cohort study using the UK General Practice Research Database included patients aged 15 - 21 years from 1999 to 2006 with a prescription for a study drug. Results Prevalence of prescribing averaged across all ages increased 6. 23 -fold over the study period. Overall, prevalence decreased with age: in 2006, prevalence in males dropped 95 % from 12. 77 per 1000 in 15 -year-olds to 0. 64 per 1000 in 21 -year-olds. A longitudinal analysis of a cohort of 44 patients aged 15 years in 1999 demonstrated that no patient received treatment after the age of 21 years. Conclusions The prevalence of prescribing by general practitioners to patients with ADHD drops significantly from age 15 to age 21 years. The fall in prescribing is greater than the reported age-related decrease in symptoms, raising the possibility that treatment is prematurely discontinued in some young adults in whom symptoms persist. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is {{a common}} neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} characterised by the symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. ADHD was once perceived {{as a condition of}} childhood only; however increasing evidence has highlighted the existence of ADHD in older adolescents and adults. Estimates for the prevalence of ADHD in adults range from 2. 5 - 4 %. Few data exist on the prescribing trends of the stimulants methylphenidate and <b>dexamfetamine,</b> and the non-stimulant atomoxetine in the UK. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the annual prevalence and incidence of pharmacologically treated ADHD in children, adolescents and adults in UK primary care. METHODS: The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database was used to identify all patients aged over 6 years with a diagnosis of ADHD/hyperkinetic disorder and a prescription for methylphenidate, <b>dexamfetamine</b> or atomoxetine from 2003 - 2008. Annual prevalence and incidence of pharmacologically treated ADHD were calculated by age category and sex. RESULTS: The source population comprised 3, 529, 615 patients (48. 9 % male). A total of 118, 929 prescriptions were recorded for the 4, 530 patients in the pharmacologically treated ADHD cohort during the 6 -year study. Prevalence (per 1000 persons in the mid-year THIN population) increased within each age category from 2003 to 2008 [6 - 12 years: from 4. 8 (95 % CI: 4. 5 - 5. 1) to 9. 2 (95 % CI: 8. 8 - 9. 6); 13 - 17 years: from 3. 6 (95 % CI: 3. 3 - 3. 9) to 7. 4 (95 % CI: 7. 0 - 7. 8); 18 - 24 years: from 0. 3 (95 % CI: 0. 2 - 0. 3) to 1. 1 (95 % CI: 1. 0 - 1. 3); 25 - 45 years: from 0. 02 (95 % CI: 0. 01 - 0. 03) to 0. 08 (95 % CI: 0. 06 - 0. 10); > 45 years: from 0. 01 (95 % CI: 0. 00 - 0. 01) to 0. 02 (95 % CI: 0. 01 - 0. 03). Whilst male patients aged 6 - 12 years had the highest prevalence; the relative increase in prescribing was higher amongst female patients of the same age - the increase in prevalence in females aged 6 - 12 years was 2. 1 fold compared to an increase of 1. 9 fold for their male counterparts. Prevalence of treated ADHD decreased with increasing age. Incidence (per 1000 persons at risk in the mid-year THIN population) was highest for children aged 6 - 12 years. CONCLUSIONS: A trend of increasing prescribing prevalence of ADHD drug treatment was observed over the period 2003 - 2008. Prevalence of prescribing to adult patients increased; however the numbers treated are much lower than published estimates of the prevalence of ADHD.

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) pharmacological treatment, and its demographic and clinical details, and to {{estimate the}} proportion of patients in the target group who stopped ADHD treatment and investigate possible factors for continuation or cessation of treatment. Design: A pharmacoepidemiological study using an automated database and a qualititative study using patient interviews. Part 1 was a pharmacoepidemiological study that provided accurate data on use and cessation of ADHD drugs. Part 2 was an in-depth interview study to investigate the reasons, processes and outcomes of treatment cessation. Setting: Part 1 : primary care using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Part 2 : secondary and tertiary care paediatric clinics, child and adolescent mental health and adult mental health clinics in London, Nottingham, Dundee and Liverpool. Participants: Part 1 : patients were 15 - 21 years old during the study period (1 January 2001 and 31 December 2004), had at least one prescription for methylphenidate, <b>dexamfetamine</b> or atomoxetine and had at least 1 year of research-standard data available in the GPRD. Part 2 : patients fulfilled Part 1 criteria, had a diagnosis of ADHD as detected by a predefined algorithm and had been treated with methylphenidate, <b>dexamfetamine</b> or atomoxetine for at least 1 year. Child and adolescent psychiatrists, adult psychiatrists and paediatricians involved in the treatment of young people with ADHD were also interviewed as part of the study. Results: Part 1 : prevalence of prescribing averaged across all ages increased eightfold, from 0. 26 per 1000 patients in 1999 to 2. 07 per 1000 patients in 2006. The increase in prevalence in the younger patients was less evident in the older patients. Prevalence in 15 -year-old males receiving a study drug prescription increased from 1. 32 per 1000 patients in 1999 to 8. 31 per 1000 patients in 2006, whereas the prevalence in 21 -yearolds rose from 0 per 1000 patients in 1999 to 0. 43 per 1000 patients in 2006. Survival analysis showed that the rate of treatment cessation largely exceeded the estimated rate of persistence of ADHD. The reduction in prescribing was most noticeable between 16 and 17 years of age. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that approximately 18 % of patients restarted treatment if they had stopped treatment after the age of 15. Patients who restarted treatment were more likely to restart within the first year following treatment cessation. Part 2 : the Child Health and Illness Profile (CHIP) was chosen as the quality of life questionnaire for the Part 2 study because the CHIP-CE scale has been validated in children with ADHD in the UK. Because of the age range of participants, the adolescent version (CHIP-AE) was administered to patients after interview. Of the 15, a total of nine patients finished the questionnaire. Interviews showed that although some young people felt able to cope after stopping medication, others felt the need to restart to control symptoms. Some patients had difficulty re-engaging with services and clinicians recognised the lack of services for young adults. Patients continuing on treatment considered cessation as an option for the future, but were concerned about the process of stopping and its impact on behaviour. Conclusions: Part 1 study demonstrated that the prevalence of prescribing by GPs to patients with ADHD dropped significantly from age 15 to 21. The fall in prescribing was greater than the reported age-related decrease in symptoms, raising the possibility that treatment is prematurely discontinued in some young adults where ADHD symptoms persist. Part 2 of the study identified that some young adults had difficulty in obtaining treatment after discharge from paediatric services. Future work should include randomised placebo-controlled trials into long-term treatment with stimulants, particularly methylphenidate. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

40|$|Background: Following {{reports of}} sudden death in {{patients}} taking medicationto treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this study aimed to identify cases {{of death in}} patients prescribed stimulants and atomoxetine and to determine any association between these and sudden death. Method: The UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) was used to identify patients aged 2 - 21 years from 1 January 1993 to 30 June 2006 with a prescription for methylphenidate, <b>dexamfetamine</b> or atomoxetine. Patients were followed from the date of first prescription until whichever came first: date of death, transferred-out date, age > 21 years or {{end of the study}} period. Results: From a cohort of 18 637 patient-years, seven patients died. Cause of death was obtained for six of the patients. None were deemed to be cases of sudden death. Compared with a general population rate of sudden death in the literature, the worst-case scenario of one case of sudden death gave an incident rate ratio of 1. 63 (95 % CI 0. 04, 9. 71). Although it was not the primary outcome of the study, following reports of suicide in the cohort the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was calculated. Due to differences in the definition of suicide used for children and adults, patients were categorized into two age groups: 11 - 14 years and 15 - 21 years. The SMR for suicide for patients aged 11 - 14 years was 161. 91 (95 % CI 19. 61, 584. 88). The SMR for suicide for patients aged 15 - 21 years was 1. 84 (95 % CI 0. 05, 10. 25). Conclusion: This study demonstrated no increase in the risk of sudden death associated with stimulants or atomoxetine. However, an increased risk of suicide was seen. Although we cannot exclude that the medications maycontribute to the increased risk of suicide, there are other factors such as depression and antisocial behaviour that frequently co-exist with ADHD, which can also predispose to teenage suicide. Clinicians should identify patients at increased risk of cardiovascular evens and identify those patients at increased risk of suicide, particularly males with co-morbid conditions, and monitor them appropriately. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{safety of}} {{paediatric}} medications is paramount and contraindications provide clear pragmatic advice. Further advice may be accessed through Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) and relevant national guidelines. The SPC {{can be considered}} the ultimate independent guideline and is regularly updated. In 2008, the authors undertook a systematic review of the SPC contraindications of medications licensed in the United Kingdom (UK) {{for the treatment of}} Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). At that time, there were fewer contraindications reported in the SPC for atomoxetine than methylphenidate and the specific contraindications varied considerably amongst methylphenidate formulations. In 2009, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) mandated harmonisation of methylphenidate SPCs. Between September and November 2011, there were three changes to the atomoxetine SPC that resulted in revised prescribing information. In addition, Clinical Guidance has also been produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (2008), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (2009) and the British National Formulary for Children (BNFC). Methods An updated systematic review of the Contraindications sections of the SPCs of all medications currently licensed for treatment of ADHD in the UK was undertaken and independent statements regarding contraindications and relevant warnings and precautions were then compared with UK national guidance with the aim of assessing any disparity and potential areas of confusion for prescribers. Results As of November 2011, there were seven medications available in the UK for the treatment of ADHD. There are 15 contraindications for most formulations of methylphenidate, 14 for <b>dexamfetamine</b> and 5 for atomoxetine. Significant differences exist between the SPCs and national guidance part due to the ongoing reactive process of amending the former as new information becomes known. In addition, recommendations are made outside UK SPC licensed indications and a significant contraindication for methylphenidate (suicidal behaviours) is missing from both the NICE and SIGN guidelines. Particular disparity exists relating to monitoring for suicidal and psychiatric side effects. The BNFC has not yet been updated in line with the European Union (EU) Directive on methylphenidate; it does not include any contraindications for atomoxetine but describes contraindications for methylphenidate that are no longer in the SPC. Conclusion Clinicians seeking prescribing advice from critical independent sources of data, such as SPCs and national guidelines, may be confused by the disparity that exists. There are major differences between guidelines and SPCs and neither should be referred to in isolation. The SPC represents the most relevant source of safety data to aid prescribing of medications for ADHD as they present the most current safety data in line with increased exposure. National guidelines may need more regular updates. </p...|$|E
