5|$|The rebooted 1975 {{version of}} Philaletheis, as a {{committee}} of the SGA, was governed by the SGA's president. Membership was by application for all positions.

Recently, the Society has accepted proposals for shows {{at the beginning of}} every semester, then the production board has voted on which shows to produce. Each production then holds its own auditions for actors, with no experience required. Directors seeking to produce a full-length show must first direct a shorter directing workshop, usually a scene running 15 minutes or shorter. Directing workshops occur twice a year, early in fall and spring semesters. For the 2015 fiscal year, the group's budget was $12,000.|$|E
