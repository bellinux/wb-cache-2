5000|$|Above and Beyond was {{critically}} {{reviewed by}} Ben Keningsberg for The New York Times.

It explains how the pilots <b>hopscotched</b> countries to evade detection. (According to the film, Americans who helped Israel’s military risked jeopardizing their United States citizenship.) Some of the planes used were manufactured at a factory in Czechoslovakia that only years earlier had served the Germans. The men unabashedly reminisce about how their missions earned them female admirers. These fond recollections of derring-do hail from a different era, and the movie’s one-sided view of history is bound to start arguments. The film is best appreciated as a straightforward testimonial: old war buddies’ hurrah against anti-Semitism." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nothing by Chance had a {{television}} premiere on NBC, but was never widely released as a theatrical version.

It is then that this film needs none of the forgettable narration written by Mr. Bach and delivered with furry smoothness by Hugh Downs to sell the romance of flying the brighly siccolored little 1929 biplanes or the equally impressive glories of the countryside below. But when the participants come to earth and labor, at times painfully, to wrench mystique and profundity out of flying, planes and the Grant Wood people its cameras favor, [...] "Nothing by Chance" [...] lapses into tedium. None of the talk can make it more than what it is—a simple valentine to a bygone era, full of bright color and shallow sentiment." ...|$|R
