5|$|Failing to {{turn the}} Braves into a winning team, Bancroft {{requested}} his release from the team after the 1927 season. He signed with the Brooklyn Robins the same day. Stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> {{no longer have the}} stress of managing, he played for the Robins for the 1928 and 1929 seasons. During his time with the Robins, he was seen as a possible successor to manager Wilbert Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Honoré III was {{a soldier}} who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> leave Monaco to be governed by others, most notably a former tutor. It was on one of Honoré III's rare visits to the palace in 1767 that illness forced Edward, Duke of York, to land at Monaco. The sick duke was {{allocated}} the state bedchamber where he promptly died. Since that date the room has been known as the York Room.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{struggled}} {{under new}} coach Marc Crawford {{early in the}} 2006–07 season, falling to five goals and 16 points in 52 games for the Kings before he was traded back to the Flames on January 29, 2007, in exchange for Jamie Lundmark and two draft picks. An emotional Conroy, who said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> return to Calgary, scored two goals the following night in his second debut with the Flames to defeat his former Kings teammates, 4–1. Conroy finished the season by scoring 21 points in 28 games for Calgary, then scored 34 points in 2007–08.|$|E

5|$|Olmstead was {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985. Olmstead, with his wife Nora, visited the town of Okotoks, Alberta on August 13, 2005, with the Stanley Cup. He had previously declined to spend a day with it, believing that it was being given to much older winners only because of the lockout. Olmstead also noted, {{at the end of the}} day, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have the Stanley Cup again. Olmstead died at his home in High River, Alberta on November 16, 2015, due to complications from a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Air Chief Marshal Burnett had {{recommended}} his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 {{to bring in}} an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond had indicated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{recruitment}} of Tomáš Ujfaluši and Johnny Heitinga pushed Pablo down the pecking order, he finished the 2008–09 season with 21 league appearances. An offer from Real Zaragoza of less than €5m {{was rejected by the}} club as insufficient, but despite the arrival of Juanito adding to the defensive competition, Pablo said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see out the remaining year of his contract. In that final season, he played rarely. He took part in the early rounds of the Copa del Rey and in the group stage of the Champions League as Atlético finished third in their group and dropped into the Europa League, but made his last appearance for the club, as a late substitute, on 20 December 2009.|$|E

5|$|One of Metternich's first tasks was to {{push for}} the {{marriage}} of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise {{rather than to the}} Tsar's youngest sister Anna Pavlovna. Metternich would later seek to distance himself from the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon's own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> claim responsibility at the time. By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by a different route and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich explained, to transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise's activities.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions Marseille. On 14 July, Marseille manager Didier Deschamps {{confirmed}} that the club was negotiating with both Diarra and Bordeaux for a transfer. A week later, Bordeaux president Triaud stated that Marseille had failed to meet the player's €7.75million release clause and that Diarra was likely not going to be leaving the club. Despite Marseille remaining hopeful a deal could go through, on 30 July, a deal was declared dead. Diarra later stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> remain at Bordeaux and see out the rest of his contract. The defensive midfielder opened the new campaign scoring two goals in the first six matches of the season in wins over Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to competition, the 200 m {{remained}} Bolt's primary event, beating Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, {{despite the fact that}} bad weather had impaired his run, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> end the meeting with just the victory. However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal. Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was more keen on competing over longer distances, setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.|$|E

5|$|In 1890 Busoni {{published}} his {{first edition of}} works of J.S. Bach (the two- and three-part Inventions). In the same year he won the prize for composition, with his Konzertstück ("Concert Piece") for piano and orchestra Op.31a (BV 236), at the first Anton Rubinstein Competition, initiated by Anton Rubinstein himself at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. As a consequence {{he was invited to}} visit and teach at the Moscow Conservatoire. Gerda joined him in Moscow where they promptly married. His first concert in Moscow, when he performed Beethoven's Emperor Concerto, was warmly received. But living in Moscow did not suit the Busonis for both financial and professional reasons; he felt excluded by his nationalistically-inclined Russian colleagues. So when he received an approach from William Steinway to teach at New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> take the opportunity, particularly as the conductor at that time of the Boston Symphony Orchestra was Arthur Nikisch, whom he had known since 1876, when they performed together at a concert in Vienna.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E
25|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed in}} December 1918 {{with a view to}} commissioning a war memorial for the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, who lost 6,866 men in the First World War. After settling on a reduced-scale version of the Whitehall cenotaph, the committee commissioned Lutyens to design it. Whereas Lutyens had insisted that his Stone of Remembrance should never be reduced in size, it appears <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> design a two-thirds-scale cenotaph.|$|E

Weidman appeared emotional and said at the post-fight press conference that the doubts and negative comments which he received during his three fight losing streak was tough on him and his family and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be back in the game.|$|E
25|$|Lilly {{received}} {{a warm welcome}} from Gilbert Wright, and worked as his servant until Wright's death in 1627. His biography recounts how, during these seven years, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> perform all manner of menial tasks for his master; how he nursed Gilbert's wife through breast-cancer, until she died of the illness in 1624; how he survived the Great Plague of London in 1625; how his master married again in 1626 (a widow named Ellen Whitehaire), and then settled upon Lilly an annuity of £20 a year, {{before his death in}} May 1627.|$|E

Bullfrog {{employees}} who had joined Lionhead included Healey, Andy Bass (an artist who worked on Theme Hospital), Russell Shaw (composer for various titles), James Leach (Bullfrog's script writer), Paul McLaughlin (who worked on Creation), and Jonty Barnes (a programmer who worked on Dungeon Keeper). Healey stated that, due to his dissatisfaction, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> follow Molyneux, and became Lionhead's first artist.|$|E

25|$|In April 1554 Gerard was {{returned}} as MP for Steyning, Sussex. Steyning {{had belonged to}} Syon Abbey until the Dissolution of the monasteries but now formed part of the royal honour of Petworth. As steward of the honour, the decisive voice in selecting the members belonged to Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, a religious conservative who had supported the Somerset faction under Edward VI and was now a key supporter of Queen Mary and Lord Steward of her household. Significantly, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> support Gerard. Sir Thomas Holcroft, Gerard's uncle {{was returned}} for the neighbouring constituency of Arundel, where almost all the members in the 16th century were nominated by the earls. However, for the 1555 election Gerard returned to Wigan, again being returned as junior to Barlow.|$|E

Epstein played the single and James remarked that it was a number one record. Epstein replied that if James could achieve that then he would be prepared to offer him a long-term publishing deal. James then phoned Philip Jones, producer of ITV television show Thank Your Lucky Stars, played the song down the telephone to him and gained The Beatles a slot on the next edition of the programme. The two then shook hands on a deal that would make them, and the Beatles, extremely wealthy.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 1995, Solana {{became the}} new Secretary-General of NATO, {{replacing}} Willy Claes {{who had been}} forced to resign in a corruption scandal. His appointment created controversy as, in the past, he had been an opponent of NATO. He had written a pamphlet called 50 Reasons to say no to NATO, and had been on a US subversives list. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO. When PSOE came to power later that year, Solana and the party changed their previous anti-NATO positions into an atlanticist, pro-NATO stance. On 12 March 1986 Spain held a referendum on whether to remain in NATO, with the government and Solana successfully campaigning in favour. When criticised about his anti-NATO past, Solana argued that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be its representative as it had become disassociated from its Cold War origins.|$|E
