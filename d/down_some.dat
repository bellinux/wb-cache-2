5|$|The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at Johnson Space Center was {{predicting}} {{less than}} favorable weather for Friday's landing, so managers asked {{the crew to}} power <b>down</b> <b>some</b> non-critical systems to help conserve power, {{in the event that}} the orbiter is not able to land until Saturday.|$|E
5|$|Free-speech advocates {{condemned}} {{the seizure of}} the painting, while the aldermen maintained that the painting was an insult to Washington {{and should have been}} taken <b>down.</b> <b>Some</b> students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies in front of the school and at the Richard J. Daley Plaza, while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially insensitive image.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break <b>down</b> <b>some</b> of the symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning {{of the dangers of}} adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E

5|$|It took Cromwell {{four years}} to {{complete}} the process. In 1539 {{he moved to the}} dissolution of the larger monasteries that had escaped earlier. Many houses gave up voluntarily, though some sought exemption by payment. When their houses were closed <b>down</b> <b>some</b> monks sought to transfer to larger houses. Many became secular priests. A few, including eighteen Carthusians, refused and were killed to the last man.|$|E
5|$|Sandor Clegane tracks <b>down</b> <b>some</b> of the Brotherhood Without Banners men and brutally kills them, {{searching for}} their leader. He then comes across Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, who are {{preparing}} to hang the men responsible for {{the attack on the}} village. Sandor bargains with Beric, who allows him to personally hang two of the men. Beric and Thoros try to recruit Sandor into the Brotherhood, explaining that they intend to head north to fight the White Walkers and need his strength.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical {{remnant of}} Alberto {{produced}} strong winds across the Canadian Maritimes, including gusts of 74mph (119km/h) in the Barrington district of Nova Scotia. Sustained winds reached 51mph (83km/h). Rainfall {{from the storm}} was moderate, with some locations reporting 0.4inches (10mm) per hour; totals exceeded 2inches (50mm) in numerous areas. Due to wet grounds, the winds knocked <b>down</b> <b>some</b> trees and several tree limbs, and also downed some power lines, causing localized power outages. Moderate winds and rainfall affected Newfoundland, as well. According to a press report, the storm left four sailors missing about 230miles (370km) south of Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} <b>down</b> <b>some</b> of the LM's {{systems to}} conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day {{stay on the}} lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, {{the third and final}} moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E
5|$|As {{late as the}} mid-1970s, Doi Mae Salong was {{strictly}} off-limits to outsiders. Since 1994, Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction, with its narrow winding streets lined with inns, noodle shops and teashops. As a result, Santikhiri {{has become one of}} Thailand's top ten destinations among backpackers today. The former soldiers had settled <b>down,</b> <b>some</b> of them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped, and others having married local Thais. The old soldiers carry on their normal lives peacefully now, but still retain their Chinese identity; the main language spoken remains Yunnanese. Among their local-born descendants, some have adopted a Thai identity and no longer identify with their Chinese ancestry. As of 2007, General Lue Ye-tien, aged 90 and Tuan's former right-hand man, {{is the leader of the}} group, after taking over the leadership on Tuan's death in 1980.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s, {{and he may have}} been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face <b>down,</b> <b>some</b> time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{began writing}} the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he {{scribbled}} <b>down</b> <b>some</b> rough ideas for later development, following {{a discussion with}} guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that {{it was he who}} conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.|$|E
5|$|D'Erlon's men {{ascended the}} slope and {{advanced}} on the sunken road, Chemin d'Ohain, that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It was lined {{on both sides}} by thick hedges, with Bylandt's brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying <b>down</b> <b>some</b> 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On {{the right of the}} French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the 45e Régiment de Ligne and followed by the 25e Régiment de Ligne, somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the 21e and 45e regiments. Opposing them {{on the other side of}} the road was Pack's 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the Royal Scots, the 42nd Black Watch, the 92nd Gordons and the 44th Foot totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{regarded}} the second Pittsburgh convention {{as a serious}} threat to the operation of the laws of the federal government. In September 1792, he sent Pennsylvania tax official George Clymer to western Pennsylvania to investigate. Clymer only increased tensions with a clumsy attempt at traveling in disguise and attempting to intimidate local officials. His somewhat exaggerated report greatly influenced the decisions made by the Washington administration. Washington and Hamilton viewed resistance to federal laws in Pennsylvania as particularly embarrassing, since the national capital was then located in the same state. On his own initiative, Hamilton drafted a presidential proclamation denouncing resistance to the excise laws and submitted it to Attorney General Randolph, who toned <b>down</b> <b>some</b> of the language. Washington signed the proclamation on September 15, 1792, and it was published as a broadside and printed in many newspapers.|$|E

The story is set between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers and follows Black Widow as she runs <b>down</b> <b>some</b> loose ends from Iron Man 2. Additionally, the title Avengers Assemble was launched in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley and features the same Avengers line-up as the film battling a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside <b>down.</b> <b>Some</b> hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} {{signed up for}} care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, <b>down</b> <b>some</b> 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, who pulled advertising encouraging people {{to sign up for}} coverage, issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the mandate, and has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of the}} ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that run their own exchanges, which have signed up around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E

When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery (including a piano). Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they are rewarded for each show they do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E
5|$|Power outages were {{reported}} throughout Central and North Florida, with over 93,300customers losing electricity, including about 9,500power outages between Tampa and Temple Terrace. In several counties, such as Alachua, Bradford, Duval, Flagler, Hardee, Martin, Orange, Putnam, and St. Lucie, impact was primarily limited to falling trees, which blocked roads, knocked <b>down</b> <b>some</b> power lines, or left generally minor damage to homes and vehicles. A few tornadoes and waterspouts were spawned during a storm. A waterspout was spotted offshore Lee County near Bonita Springs and Estero. An EF1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale touched down near Jacksonville. The tornado snapped {{a number of}} pine and hardwood trees, while causing roof damage to some homes. At a Publix distribution center, three empty trucks were overturned. A possible tornado in Alachua County {{in the vicinity of}} Hawthorne toppled some trees and damaged a home.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck <b>down</b> <b>some</b> of the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E
