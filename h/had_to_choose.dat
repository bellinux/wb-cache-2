5|$|All of the game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Shogo Sakai. Itoi saw Sakai as competing with Mother 2 composer Keiichi Suzuki for his fans. Itoi <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> a composer from the development team who understood the series and could work full-time on the project, including other development duties. Thus, {{he could not}} choose Suzuki, who was outside the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also understood the game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the World Championship, each {{participating}} nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of 15 skaters and two goaltenders, and a maximum of 20 skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. If a country selected fewer than the maximum allowed, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the remaining players prior to {{the start of}} the tournament. After {{the start of the}} tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players, either skaters or goaltenders, to their roster, for a maximum roster of 25 players. Once a player was registered to the team, he could not be removed from the roster.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his personal role in Parliament, Bute sought to control the votes {{of members of the}} House of Commons, primarily to ensure the passage of legislation affecting his business interests. Initially, the Isle of Bute had only 21 voters who were dominated by his private estate, but it only returned a Member of Parliament in alternate elections, and his estates in Luton were too limited to allow him to influence the electoral process there. The best remaining option for Bute was to control the voting in Cardiff, but even here he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> his candidate carefully and apply careful financial pressure through his control of leases and rents to ensure their election.|$|E

Another example: given a set of commodity bundles in the budget set, a consumer <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> one bundle...|$|R

5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E
5|$|The new prince's {{principal}} {{supporters were}} the noblemen {{who had been}} forced into exile in 1594, but they were impoverished young men, without influence. Instead of them, Andrew <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> his officials from among the Roman Catholic lords: he made István Bodoni ispán (or head) of Kolozs County and Gáspár Sibrik {{the commander of the}} cavalry. Andrew was even unable to get rid of his opponents. For instance, Gáspár Kornis remained a member of the royal council, although he had played a preeminent role in the execution of Andrew's brother in 1594.|$|E

5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought {{the death penalty for}} both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> between the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice {{proved to be more}} popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} series 1 of Red or Black? {{consisted}} of 10 rounds; in each round, the player <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> either red or black, {{with those who}} choose incorrectly being eliminated. The rounds are split into three stages. The first is an arena stage, which is recorded at Wembley Arena. The winning contestants move onto the location stage, where the numbers are eventually reduced down to the final eight. Those eight then go forward to the live studio final, where they are reduced down to the final competitor, who {{has a chance to}} play for the £1m prize. The first series was broadcast over seven nights in September 2011, running {{over the course of a}} week, except for the Tuesday night, from Saturday to the following Saturday. Over 100,000 people applied to compete in the show.|$|E

5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will {{have to choose between}} them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E
5|$|The League {{resolved}} {{a dispute}} between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey {{over control of the}} former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul {{did not want to be}} part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose,</b> they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations' arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admittance.|$|E

5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{ten years}} old, Van Dijk started, {{together}} with her two brothers and Mariëlle Kerste, cross-training on a bike {{during the summer and}} she began competing in regional races. Because Van Dijk performed well, she started competing in national races at the age of 15 in 2002. In the same year, in her first national championship, she finished in fourth place. The following year, she won the Dutch national road championship in the novice category. In 2004, Van Dijk won two more national titles, this time as a junior, in the road race and in the road individual time trial. In the latter, she beat Marianne Vos, though Vos would avenge her defeat in Road World Championships in Verona, Italy. Vos won the junior road race world title, with Van Dijk finishing third. In 2005, Van Dijk again won the Dutch national junior title in the individual time trial but finished second in the road race, again behind Vos. In 2007, when Van Dijk was considered for selection in regional speed skating, she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> between speed skating and cycling– ultimately, she chose cycling.|$|E
