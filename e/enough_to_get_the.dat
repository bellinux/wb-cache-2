The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Two burglars knock the millionaire out and {{take the rest of}} his money. The burglars flee before the arrival of the police, who find the Tramp with the money the millionaire gave him, but because of the knock on his head the millionaire does not remember giving it.

5|$|The Giants {{received}} {{the second half}} kickoff and mounted a record-setting drive. The opening drive ran for over 9 minutes (a Super Bowl record) and culminated in a 1-yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson, giving the Giants a 17–12 lead. The signature play of the drive came on a third down play, when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down. However, Ingram evaded several tacklers, and dragged one defender just <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Giants the first down, and kept the drive alive. By this time, the Giants strategy to handle the Bills offense had become clear: keep them off the field. Indeed, the Giants two touchdown drives consumed over 17 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the two bridge raids took place on 10 August 1941. For this mission, the I-16s were fitted with {{additional}} 95-liter (25 US gal) underwing fuel tanks for an additional 35 minutes of flight time. Of the three Zveno-SPBs, one had to turn back due to mechanical problems. The other two launched their fighters 15km (8 NM, 9mi) from the Romanian coastline. The fighters successfully dive-bombed from the altitude of 1800 m (5,900ft) and returned home with no losses despite heavy anti-aircraft fire. The second raid took place on 13 August 1941. This time, all three Zveno-SPBs reached the target. The six fighters scored five direct hits on the bridge and completely destroyed one of the spans. On the way back, the fighters strafed Romanian infantry near Sulina and returned to Eupatoria with no losses. Following the successful sorties, two additional Zveno-SPB were brought to operational status, bringing the total to five. The main limiting factor {{was the lack of}} high-output Mikulin AM-34FRN engines, as the other versions were not powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> aircraft airborne. On 16 August 1941, Admiral Kuznetsov asked Joseph Stalin for additional AM-34FRN-engined TB-3s from the Air Force so they could be converted to Zveno-SPB carriers, but the request was denied as the Air Force had suffered heavy losses in the opening days of the war. In the meantime, the five aircraft continued flying operational sorties, destroying a dry dock in Constanţa on 17 August and a bridge across the Dnieper River on 28 August, losing one I-16 in the process. During the repeat attack the next day, four Zveno-launched I-16s engaged several Messerschmitt Bf 109s, shooting down two. Despite the high success rate, Zveno missions ended by 1942 due to high vulnerability of the obsolete TB-3s and I-16s in the face of enemy air superiority. It is estimated that Zveno-SPB flew at least 30 combat missions.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, a {{committee}} {{was set up}} to get La Tinta to municipality status but these pioneers confronted serious problems, including death threats and had to desist. A new committee was formed in 1987, {{but it was not until}} 1999 that the group directed by José Gilberto Artola Choc accomplished the new designation. The reasons they argued to get their independent status were the distance that Panzós was from La Tinta -30km, approximately- the increase in economic activity in La Tinta -and the decay in Panzós after the Verapaz Railroad ceased operations in the 1960s-, the population was more than <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> municipality designation and the lack of support that Panzós gave La Tinta.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will be good enough or just <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E

In July 1998, the Fox Broadcast Company announced the purchase of Family Guy for a January 1999 debut. Family Guy was originally intended to be a series of shorts on MADtv, much in the same way The Simpsons had begun on The Tracey Ullman Show a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show's MADtv connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns. At age 24, MacFarlane was television's youngest executive producer.|$|E

[...] Davies enjoyed Morahan's [...] "luminous" [...] performance as Elinor, as well as Williams and Morrissey's turns as Sir John and Colonel Brandon respectively, although she thought the opening scene was [...] "misconceived". Davies' colleague, James Walton, proclaimed, [...] "In the end, this Sense and Sensibility was perhaps brilliantly competent rather than surpassingly brilliant. Nevertheless, it still proved easily good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> costume-drama year off to a hugely enjoyable start." ...|$|E

500|$|Melbourne {{bounced back}} the next week with a win over Carlton, but lost the week after at home to Geelong, despite leading by five goals to one at quarter time. This opened up a two-win {{advantage}} for Essendon {{at the top of}} the ladder. Reviewing the match, Markwell wrote that Wilson had played better games, but that he worked as hard as anyone on the ground and was [...] "singularly unselfish". Melbourne dropped more points with a round 17 draw against South Melbourne and when the Redlegs played another draw two weeks later, this time against St Kilda, The Argus declared the premiership race all but over. Wilson recovered from a form slump to kick both of Melbourne's goals in the St Kilda match, but it was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Redlegs over the line. He was again in the best players in Melbourne's round 20 win over Carlton. The Reds closed out the season with two more wins, but it was not enough to catch Essendon who remained undefeated and Melbourne finished runners-up. In his appraisal of the season, Markwell named Wilson in his best dozen Melbourne players.|$|E
