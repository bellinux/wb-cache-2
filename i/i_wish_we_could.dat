500|$|Despite reusing some scripts {{from other}} sources, Perrin {{said that he}} and Sheekman [...] "had [...] hands full turning out a script each week". They found help from Tom McKnight and George Oppenheimer, whose names were passed along to Groucho. Perrin explained, [...] " [...] was in the men's room during a break, and he was {{complaining}} to the guy standing next to him, 'Geez, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find another writer or two to make life easier.' Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the guys for you!' Having Tom and George did make life easier, although Arthur and I went over their scripts for a light polishing." ...|$|E
500|$|As of December 2013, Oppong is a {{full-time}} student at the University of Windsor teacher's college. Prior to 2013, he notified the Oshawa Power front office about his plans {{to pursue a career}} in education, leading to his trade to the Windsor Express. In the case that Windsor had to play out of their division, his basketball career forced him to miss a few days of school. Oppong has experience as a student-teacher at Catholic Central High School in Windsor, Ontario. In late 2013, he said, [...] "It's been challenging. It's a matter of juggling things and time management. I'm really grateful the Windsor Express have worked with me and supported me." [...] Express head coach Bill Jones commented, [...] "I really like Papa and respect what he's doing. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have the kid with us every day because I'm sure he'd have a bigger role with us but he's doing what he can and playing 22 minutes a game and playing them hard." [...] Oppong became the third member of his family to attend the University of Windsor, following his sister. He plans to become either a physical education or history teacher once he gets his teaching certificate. While at Eastern Kentucky University, he intentionally majored in general studies so that he could attend teacher's college for one year.|$|E

500|$|Director Michael Lange {{said that}} he [...] "liked the script very much, and I think I stayed fairly close to the {{original}} draft. I liked it because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, Romney {{said that}} the U.S. Supreme Court had made the right {{decision}} in its 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, but that he did not like some of the consequences of it: [...] "I'm not wild about the idea of corporations making political contributions as a concept. I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{find a way to get}} money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E

2500|$|After {{taking over}} command in mid-1862, Lee began {{preparing}} {{to lead the}} Army of Northern Virginia for the first time. However, his aggressiveness to attack the Union led {{to the loss of}} many troops especially at the Battle of Antietam, which ended up being {{a turning point in the}} war for the Union. After the costly victories during the Seven Days Battles and at Second Manassas in August 1862, Lee had now lost a total of 30,000 of his approximately 92,000 troops within three months of becoming the Confederate's top general. Lee then planned to take his troops north into Maryland to destroy a critical railroad bridge across the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg in a letter written to President Davis. Lee even questioned his own plan, as he wrote, [...] "I am aware that the movement is attended with much risk, yet I do not consider success impossible..." [...] In addition, historians question Lee's aggressiveness to move his army to Maryland. [...] "There can be no sort of doubt that Lee underestimated the exhaustion of his army after Second Manassas. That is, in reality, the major criticism of the Maryland operation: he carried worn-out men across the Potomac." [...] His men were also underarmed and underfed, so the journey to Maryland added to the overall exhaustion. Once Lee arrived in Maryland and was preparing for Antietam, he made another controversial decision. Against the advice from General Longstreet and Jackson, Lee split his troops into four parts to attack the Union from different fronts. Clearly outnumbered and opposed to Lee's plan, Longstreet stated, [...] "General, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> stand still and let the damned Yankees come to us!" [...] As the fighting played out on September 17, 1862, known as the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, the battles at Dunker Church and Burnside's Bridge proved to be too much for Lee and his Confederate army. Luckily for Lee, the arrival of A.P. Hill's troops and the mixture of McClellan's and Burnside's sluggishness, saved Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and allowed them to barely hold off the Union in Maryland.|$|E
