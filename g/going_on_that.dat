Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is something <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E

It was the twenty-second most watched show in Canada {{for the week}} of broadcast, with 1.39million viewers. In the UK, the episode was watched by 1.804million viewers (1.397million on E4, and 407,000 on timeshift), becoming the most-watched show on E4 and E4+1 for the week, and the most-watched show on cable for the week, {{as well as the}} most watched episode of the series at the time. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times reviewed the episode positively, praising the football team's performance of the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] dance and Kurt coming out to his father. Malcom also commented positively on the show's fast pacing; however, Mike Hale of the New York Post was less favorable, deeming the episode [...] "overstuffed with story lines". He felt that key characters did not receive enough screentime, and that: [...] "There was so much exposition <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> there didn’t seem to be much room for laughs." ...|$|E

500|$|Charlene's new romantic style {{wedding dress}} was {{designed}} and made by Isis of Melbourne, a local bridal salon. The dress was made from ivory silk, organza and chantilly lace. A writer for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery's website observed that it was [...] "in keeping with Charlene's character as the suburban girl-next-door." [...] While the show's costume designer, Nicholas Wakerley, called it [...] "perfect for the time". Wakerley described the dress as being [...] "young and cool" [...] for the time, just like Charlene. He also revealed that the dress fitted Watson's desire for a fairy-tale wedding. When asked what made the dress memorable, fashion designer Alex Perry, stated [...] "There {{are so many things}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> it's hard not to remember it! The see-through sleeves with a hint of lace, the romantic era-style shoulders, the high neckline and hem." [...] Knowing how popular Minogue and Charlene were at the time, Perry was sure that the dress would have been copied by viewers. Charlene's bridesmaids wore peach taffeta dresses, while the groom and his ushers wore charcoal grey tails.|$|E
500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come in and be a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>that</b> there's more of a history between them.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing... {{there was so much}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in The Times, writing that it [...] "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.|$|E

500|$|Ebert and Roeper {{gave the}} film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta [...] "almost always has {{something}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> is actually interesting, inviting us to decode {{the character and}} plot and apply the message where we will". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a [...] "woeful, depressing failure" [...] and stating that the [...] "cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid {{the wreckage of the}} Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue." [...] Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being [...] "fairly dim, adolescent stuff," [...] as well as expressing dislike for the [...] "barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult." [...] On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says [...] "it's not hard to see why," [...] as well as criticising Portman's performance: [...] "Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance." [...] Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film [...] "works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three". He added that the film will become [...] "a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age." [...] Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is [...] "a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story." ...|$|E

2500|$|The subject {{material}} for Game Theory follows {{the more serious}} tone of the album, with topics ranging {{from the war in}} Iraq to violence in music. Questlove was quoted as saying [...] "There was too much <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> we couldn’t just sit back and not speak on it."

2500|$|On the album's jazz elements, {{music critic}} Vince Aletti wrote, [...] "the songs have a loose, unanchored quality that sets {{them apart from}} both R and rock work. Scott-Heron sings straight-out, with an ache in his voice that conveys pain, {{bitterness}} and tenderness with equal grace and, in most cases, subtlety. Frequently {{the nature of the}} jazz backing is so free that the vocals take on an independent, almost a cappella feeling which Scott-Heron carries off surprisingly well." [...] Uncut writes that [...] "Heron adopts his trademark jazz-funk sound, underpinned by the great Ron Carter on bass, with Hubert Laws' flute fluttering about like an elusive bird of paradise". Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler notes its latter eight songs as [...] "in line with the soul of the very early '70s - think a Curtis that replaces an orchestra with a chamber band, or a What's <b>Going</b> <b>On</b> <b>that</b> replaces head-in-the-clouds wistfulness with earthy indignation, or a There's A Riot Goin' On without the drugs".|$|E

Here we run out of even [...] "blue yonder" [...] explanations that might be tenable, and, we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers.” On December 2, 1952 [...] CIA Assistant Director Chadwell noted, “Recent reports reaching CIA indicated that further action was desirable and another briefing by the cognizant A-2 and ATIC personnel was held on 25 November. At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> must have immediate attention. The details of some of these incidents have been discussed by AD/SI with DDCI.

2500|$|There was a {{widespread}} feeling, {{even while the}} campaign was <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>that</b> it was fundamentally risible. New Statesman columnist Philip French thought its [...] "jingoism and intellectual dishonesty" [...] was offensive and felt that the excessive press coverage defied comment [...] "other than the gesture of laughing at" [...] it. The magazine itself ran a one-off column, to go with its long-established [...] "This England" [...] column, featuring press cuttings highlighting absurd aspects of the campaign. The Communist Morning Star newspaper published a parody of the Maxwell advert, which claimed to be [...] "non-political, non-partisan and nonsensical" [...] and proclaimed the support of nonsense poets Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll. Paul McCartney thought the campaign was ridiculous and it inspired him to write a song called [...] "I'm Backing the UK", which eventually became [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R." [...] on 'The White Album'. At {{the conclusion of the}} film 'Carry On... Up the Khyber', made during the summer and opening in November 1968, the raising of a Union Flag with the [...] "I'm Backing Britain" [...] slogan is greeted by Peter Butterworth turning to camera and saying [...] "Of course, they're all raving mad, you know!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The CIA {{started their}} own {{internal}} scientific review the following day. Some CIA scientists were also seriously considering the ETH. An early memo from August was very skeptical, but also added, [...] "...as {{long as a}} series of reports remains 'unexplainable' (interplanetary aspects and alien origin not being thoroughly excluded from consideration) caution requires that intelligence continue coverage of the subject." [...] A report from later that month was similarly skeptical but nevertheless concluded [...] "...sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, {{at a time when the}} background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even 'blue yonder' explanations that might be tenable, and we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers." [...] A December 1952 memo from the Assistant CIA Director of Scientific Intelligence (O/SI) was much more urgent: [...] "...the reports of incidents convince us that there is something <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of U.S. defense installation are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles." [...] Some of the memos also made it clear that CIA interest in the subject was not to be made public, partly in fear of possible public panic. (Good, 331–335) ...|$|E
2500|$|Morey {{revealed}} {{that she would}} like to see Sonya and Toadie have children together in the future. She told a Press Association reporter, [...] "I would love it. I think there is so much richness in Toadie and Sonya <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> journey together which lends itself to humour, sadness, more drama. Cross fingers they will go down that path." [...] Morey also hoped Sonya could be happy in the future. Morey told the official UK Neighbours website in July 2011 that Sonya and Toadie would start to have some excitement and fun again following all the drama, but they would have to deal with a few issues first. When the subject of marriage comes up, Sonya and Toadie realise that they have different views about it. Morey explained, [...] "At this point Sonya wants to get married for the wrong reasons, and Toadie doesn't want to get married for the wrong reasons. They haven't both independently reached a healthy perspective on it. She wants to do it for security to protect Callum, and he doesn’t want to do it... He feels it will jinx , because his other marriages have gone that way." [...] Morey added that Sonya and Toadie have reached a point in their relationship where they have to make some big decisions, which could change the direction they move in.|$|E
