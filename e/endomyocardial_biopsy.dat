40|$|A {{distinction}} is made between heart muscle diseases with a known cause, or occurring {{as part of}} a systemic disease, and those of unknown cause. The first category is termed "specific heart muscle disease". The term "cardiomyopathy" is then limited to the latter category. Cardiomyopathies are categorized as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The pathology of dilated cardiomyopathy depends on the clinical stage of the disease. Basically, the histology shows hypertrophic myocytes, often with degenerative signs, and interstitial fibrosis. Lymphocytes may be observed, particularly in cases studied shortly after the onset of symptoms. Endocardial thickening may occur in time. The role of <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> in the clinical setting is limited and relates mainly to excluding other diseases, such as myocarditis. The pathology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by myocardial wall thickening, either asymmetric or symmetric, and disorganization of the normal myocardial texture. The latter phenomenon should be distinguished from disarray, since it may occur as a natural phenomenon. The differentiation between these two may be extremely difficult on the basis of only small tissue samples, as with <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies.</b> This, therefore, poses serious limitations in the use of <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies.</b> The pathology of restrictive cardiomyopathy also depends on the stage of the disease.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the expression of perforin and T-cell intracellular antigen- 1, two crucial components of lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, in <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Background. Previous reports have demonstrated the presence of myocardial interstitial fibrosis and increased infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the pathogenic significance of these lymphocytic infiltrates remains unclear. Methods. <b>Endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> from 134 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were histologically and immunohistologically analyzed. Monoclonal antibodies against diverse T-lymphocyte antigens, perforin and T-cell intracellular antigen- 1 were used with the highly sensitive avidin–biotin complex technique. Positive cells were counted in at least 10 high power fields. Results. Perforin and T-cell intracellular antigen- 1 were immunohistologically detected in all biopsies. Immunoreactivity was restricted to the cytoplasm and was granular in nature, indicating specific staining of cytoplasmic granules. Correlations were established between the expression of perforin and T-cell intracellular antigen- 1 and the abundance of foci of various T-lymphocyte subpopulations and, most importantly, the degree of interstitial fibrosis on routine histologic examination (p = 0. 015). Conclusions. Cytotoxic activity is clearly present in <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Local activation—that is, focal accumulation of T lymphocytes—seems to be important for the generation of lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. The interstitial fibrosis commonly seen in dilated cardiomyopathy may be caused by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte damage to the myocardium. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 429 – 34...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} diastolic graft {{function}} {{is influenced by}} intragraft interleukin 2 (IL- 2) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in rejecting cardiac allografts. DESIGN: 16 recipients of cardiac allografts were monitored {{during the first three}} months after transplantation. The presence of IL- 2 mRNA in <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> (n = 123) was measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To determine heart function, concurrent M mode and two dimensional Doppler echocardiograms were analysed. RESULTS: Histological signs of acute rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) rejection grade > 2) were strongly associated with IL- 2 mRNA expression (IL- 2 mRNA was present in 12 of 20 <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> (60 %) with acute rejection and in 24 of 103 <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> (23 %) without acute rejection, p = 0. 002). No significant relation was found between either histology or IL- 2 mRNA expression alone and the studied echocardiographic parameters. However, stratification of the echocardiographic data into those of patients with and those without acute rejection showed that during acute rejection IL- 2 mRNA expression was significantly associated with increased left ventricular total wall thickness (mean change in total wall thickness was + 0. 22 cm in patients with IL- 2 mRNA expression versus - 0. 18 cm in patients without IL- 2 mRNA expression, p = 0. 048). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in left ventricular total wall thickness precedes IL- 2 positive acute rejection after heart transplantation. Thus, cardiac allograft rejection accompanied by intragraft IL- 2 mRNA expression may be indicative of more severe rejection episodes...|$|R
40|$|Background—Treatment {{of acute}} {{rejection}} (AR) in heart transplantation relies on histopathological grading of <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> according to International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines. Intragraft gene expression profiling {{may be a}} way to complement histological evaluation. Methods and Results—Transcriptional profiling was performed on 26 <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies,</b> and expression patterns were compared with the 1990 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation AR grades. Importantly, transcriptional profiles from settings with an equivalent AR grade appeared the same. In addition, grade 0 profiles could not be distinguished from 1 A profiles, and grade 3 A profiles could not be distinguished from 3 B profiles. Comparing the AR groupings (01 A, 1 B, and 3 A 3 B), 01 A showed more striking differences from 1 B than from 3 A 3 B. When these findings were extrapolated to the 2005 revised guidelines, the combination of 1 A and 1 B into a single category (1 R) appears to have brought together <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> with different underlying processes that are not evident from histological evaluation. Grade 1 B was associated with upregulated immune response genes, as 1 categorical distinction from grade 1 A. Although grade 1 B was distinct from the clinically relevant AR grades 3 A and 3 B, all of these grades shared a small number of overlapping pathways consistent with common physiological underpinnings.

This study {{compares the}} results of antimyosin {{scintigraphy}} in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis with histologic and immunohistologic findings in the <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Background. In patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, antimyosin scintigraphy often demonstrates myocardial cell damage but histologic evaluation of the <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> often fails to show evidence of myocarditis. Recently developed immunohistologic techniques {{appear to be more}} sensitive for the detection of myocardial inflammation than histologic analysis alone. Studies comparing antimyosin scintigraphy and immunohistologic analysis of the <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis are not yet available. Methods. Sixty-five patients with clinically suspected myocarditis underwent antimyosin scintigraphy. Antimyosin antibody uptake was correlated with histologic and immunohistologic findings in the <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Results. Antimyosin scintigraphy showed evidence of myocardial cell damage in 36 (55 %) of the 65 patients and was negative in 29 (45 %) patients. Histologic analysis of the <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> revealed myocarditis in nine patients: six had a positive and three had a negative antimyosin scan, respectively. Thirty (83 %) of 36 patients with evidence of myocardial cell damage on antimyosin scintigraphy were histologically negative for myocarditis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{studied the}} effect of antirejection therapy on intragraft {{cytokine}} mRNA expression. METHODS: Therapy consisted of three doses of 1 gm of intravenous methylprednisolone. We determined its effect on intragraft mRNA expression of immunoregulatory (interleukin- 2, interleukin- 4) and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin- 1 beta, interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), and the high-affinity interleukin- 2 receptor (p 55 chain) in <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens from cardiac allograft recipients. RESULTS: By reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods, we detected mRNA transcription for interleukin- 2 in 56 % of the pretreatment <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens (n = 16), for interleukin- 4 in 31 %, and for interleukin- 6 in 56 % of the specimens, and interleukin- 2 receptor, interleukin- 1 beta, interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha were constitutively expressed. Individual cytokine mRNA profiles were not helpful in differentiating between rejections {{that proved to be}} methylprednisolone resistant (n = 9) or methylprednisolone sensitive (n = 7). After successful antirejection therapy, the overall intragraft mRNA expression was downregulated. None of the posttreatment <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens taken from six patients with methylprednisolone-sensitive rejections expressed the interleukin- 2 gene, in contrast to 88 % of the <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens obtained from eight patients with methylprednisolone-resistant rejections (p = 0. 005). Moreover, intragraft interleukin- 4 and interleukin- 6 mRNA transcripts were hardly detectable (both 17 %) in methylprednisolone-reversible rejections, but in ongoing rejections interleukin- 4 mRNA expression was found in 62 % (p = 0. 14), and interleukin- 6 was found in 88 % of the <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens (p = 0. 03). Semiquantitative analysis showed that the intragraft interleukin- 2 receptor, interleukin- 1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels were lower in posttreatment <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens from methylprednisolone-reversible rejections than in <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens from methylprednisolone-irreversible rejections (p = 0. 03).

The present report documents {{the correlation between the}} histologic interpretation of <b>endomyocardial</b> <b>biopsies</b> and the corresponding cardiac explants in 13 patients who underwent cardiac transplantation. The biopsy diagnoses in these patients varied from 'compatible with dilated cardiomyopathy' (n = 6) to 'non-conclusive' (n = 4), 'ischaemia' (n = 2) and 'borderline myocarditis' (n = 1). Correlation with the corresponding cardiac explants revealed hypertrophy of myocytes as the leading histologic feature in the majority of cases. Because of the non-specific histopathology of dilated cardiomyopathy, the discrepancy between biopsy diagnoses and the leading explant diagnosis is mostly a matter of semantics. Ischaemia was present at high incidence, but is considered a result of imparied myocardial perfusion rather than the prime mechanism of heart failure. In four cardiac explants myocarditis was encountered, while the corresponding biopsies showed no cellular inflammation. In two, the cellular infiltrates suggested an early state of repair. One heart contained an active and extensive lymphocytic myocarditis. The fourth case showed an eosinophilic myocarditis, most likely acquired after the biopsy was taken. These discrepancies almost certainly relate to the sampling error and the time interval between biopsy and onset of symptoms. The immediate diagnostic yield of the biopsy, in this particular subset of patients, was minimal, particularly with respect to the diagnosis 'myocarditis'. Nevertheless, biopsy diagnoses such as 'compatible with' and 'non-conclusive' do contribute to the final categorization and management of these patients. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
