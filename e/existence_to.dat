5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Portuguese colonial power to the island of Sri Lanka in 1505, and its {{strategic}} location in the Palk Strait connecting all interior Sinhalese kingdoms to South India, created political problems. Many of its kings confronted and ultimately made peace with the Portuguese colonials. In 1617, Cankili II, a usurper to the throne, confronted the Portuguese but was defeated, thus bringing the kingdom’s independent <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> an end in 1619. Although rebels like Migapulle Arachchi with help of Thanjavur Nayak kingdom tried to recover the kingdom, they were eventually defeated. Nallur, a suburb of Jaffna town, served as its capital.|$|E
5|$|Turkey's varied landscapes are {{the product}} of complex earth {{movements}} that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional volcanic eruptions. The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> the fault lines running through Turkey that {{led to the creation of}} the Black Sea. The North Anatolian Fault Line runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took place in history. The latest of those big earthquakes was the 1999 İzmit earthquake.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of William I, Urse became {{involved}} in a dispute with Bishop Wulfstan over {{the rights of the}} sheriff in the lands of the diocese. By the time of Domesday Book in 1086, Urse's powers as sheriff had been excluded from the Oswaldslaw, the area of Worcestershire controlled by the bishops of Worcester. Domesday Book records that the Oswaldslaw was regarded as an immunity, exempt from judicial actions by royal officials. Urse complained that this immunity reduced his income, but this did not affect the outcome of his dispute with Wulfstan, who prevailed. Although Wulfstan claimed that the immunity dated from before the Conquest, it actually owed its <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> the ability of the bishop to fill the shire court with his supporters, and thus influence the findings of the court.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather {{as a result of its}} own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} not all {{indigenous}} units were disbanded {{at the end of}} the civil war period (31BC). Some of the more experienced units were kept in <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> complement the legions, and became the core of the standing auxiliary forces that developed in the Julio-Claudian period. During the early rule of Augustus (27BC onwards), the corps of regular Auxilia was created. It was clearly inspired by the Latin forces of the pre-Social War Republic, as a corps of non-citizen troops parallel to the legions. But there were fundamental differences, the same as between Republican and Augustan legions. The Latin forces of the Republic were made up of part-time conscripts in units that would be raised and disbanded for and after particular campaigns. The Augustan Auxilia were mainly volunteer professionals serving in permanent units.|$|E
5|$|Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure {{are three}} action-adventure games {{produced}} by Philips for the CD-i {{as part of}} Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games owe their <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have Philips create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i third-party developer games. The Faces of Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994. The games were given little funding or time for completion, and Nintendo provided only cursory input.|$|E
5|$|Miyuki is {{considered}} one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed the Yotsuba. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic allows her to freeze a person's consciousness. In addition, half of her magic casting abilities is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to how the other Yotsuba clan members did. She begins to warm up to him and when Tatsuya saves her life, devotes her <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> him. It evolves to the point she disdains the touch of other males and expresses jealousy towards females around Tatsuya. Genetically different from Tatsuya, despite being born from the same parents, Miyuki professes her love to him following their engagement under Maya's orders. She is voiced by Saori Hayami.|$|E

5|$|Regardless {{of whether}} Pope Pius IX had been {{personally}} {{involved in the}} decision to remove Mortara from his parents—whether he had been or not was debated extensively in the press—what is certain is that he was greatly surprised by the international furore that erupted over the matter, and promptly adopted the position that to return the baptised child to his non-Christian family would be totally incompatible with Church doctrine. As foreign governments and the various branches of the Rothschild family one by one condemned his actions, Pius IX stood firm on what he saw as a matter of principle. Those angered included Emperor Napoleon III of France, who found the situation particularly vexing as the pontifical government owed its very <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> the French garrison in Rome. Napoleon III had indifferently supported the Pope's temporal rule because it enjoyed widespread support among French Catholics; the scandal over Mortara weakened this considerably and, according to the historian Roger Aubert, provided the final straw that changed French policy. In February 1859 Napoleon III concluded a secret pact with the Kingdom of Sardinia pledging French military support for a campaign to drive the Austrians out and unify Italy—most of the pontifical domain would be absorbed along with the Two Sicilies and other minor states.|$|E
5|$|Southsea is {{dominated}} by Southsea Common, a grassland covering an area of , which was first created by draining the marshland alongside {{the construction of the}} vapour baths in 1820. The common owes its <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> the demands of the military in the early 19th century for a clear range of fire. The present day common lies parallel to the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle. Today, the common is a popular recreation ground, and also a venue for a number of annual events, which includes carnivals, Christmas markets, and Victorian festivals. The common also has a large collection of mature elm trees, believed to be the oldest and largest surviving in Hampshire, which have escaped Dutch elm disease owing to their isolation. Other plants include the Canary Island date palms Phoenix canariensis, which are some of the largest in Britain and have produced viable seed in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The Independent State of Croatia (NDH) {{was founded}} on 10 April 1941, during the {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers. The NDH consisted of most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with some parts of modern-day Serbia. It was essentially an Italo-German quasi-protectorate, as it owed its <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> the Axis powers, who maintained occupation forces within the puppet state throughout its existence. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the Yugoslav surrender on 17 April, former Royal Yugoslav Army troops returned to their homes in eastern Herzegovina with their weapons. This was a significant security concern for the fledgling NDH government due to the proximity of the border with Montenegro, the close relationship between the people of eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, and widespread banditry in the region. On the day after the surrender, the commander of the NDH armed forces, Vojskovođa (Marshal) Slavko Kvaternik issued a proclamation demanding the surrender of all weapons to NDH authorities by 24 April.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} Raziel, a disfigured and ghostly vampire. The game {{is normally}} shown from a third-person perspective behind Raziel, but players can rotate the viewpoint around him. Gameplay relies largely on shifting between {{the material and}} spectral planes of <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> progress through areas. Although interaction with objects is limited in the spectral realm, this can be advantageous, because Raziel can phase through otherwise impassable gates there, and water is insubstantial, allowing him to walk on lakebeds; however, blocks, doors, and switches can be manipulated only in the physical realm. Many puzzles {{are based on the}} differences between the two realms; for example, platforms and environment features in one realm may change form to open new paths in the other. Block puzzles are also common and require the rotation, flipping, and moving of large blocks to progress, often with a time limit and while avoiding enemies.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, wolves began recolonising central Sweden after a twelve-year absence, {{and have}} since {{expanded}} into southern Norway. As of 2005, {{the total number}} of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be at least one hundred, including eleven breeding pairs. The gray wolf is fully protected in Sweden and partially controlled in Norway. The Scandinavian wolf populations owe their continued <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> neighbouring Finland's contiguity with the Republic of Karelia, which houses a large population of wolves. Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country, and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons, though poaching remains common, with 90% of young wolf deaths being due to human predation, and the number of wolves killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses, in some areas by a factor of two. Furthermore, the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf's food supply. Since 2011, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries. In 2016, a female wolf tracked 550 kilometers from a region southwest of Berlin to settle in Jutland, Denmark where male wolves had been reported in 2012 {{for the first time in}} 200 years. Wolves have also commenced breeding in Lower Austria's Waldviertel region for the first time in over 130 years.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen years, Grannvale expands to hold {{dominion}} {{over the whole}} of Judgral, and Arvis turns Grannvale into an empire and styles himself emperor. He and Deirdre have twin children: Julius, the scion of Loptyr, and Julia, the scion of Naga. Manfroy uses the Loptyr tome to corrupt Julius and turn him into Loptyr's vessel, and Deirdre sacrifices herself to send Julia into hiding. Julius overthrows his father and turns the Empire into a tyrannical regime. At this point, Seliph comes out of hiding to protect a nearby village, revealing his long-hidden <b>existence</b> <b>to</b> Grannvale. Traveling across the lands of Jugdral, Seliph reunites with the long-hidden children of Sigurd's companions, including Julia. Making {{his way through the}} countries of Jugdral, he gains support from the surviving powers, and gradually frees Grannvale's conquered territories. Arvis is powerless to subvert his son's rule, and is killed in battle against Seliph. During the course of these battles, Julia is captured and Manfroy and Julius attempt to sacrifice her as her powers could banish Loptyr for good. Seliph manages to save her, and after defeating Manfroy and Julius in battle, Julia successfully banishes Loptyr, ending his rule for good and allowing Jugdral to recover from the recent conflicts. Seliph takes his rightful place on the throne as the emperor of Grannvale, and restores power to the surrounding countries with their respective heirs.|$|E
