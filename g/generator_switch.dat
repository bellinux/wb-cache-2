40|$|Abstract only availableClass E {{amplifiers}} are {{a special}} class of electronic amplifiers which are highly efficient at delivering power at high frequencies. Class E amplifiers {{consist of a}} signal <b>generator,</b> <b>switch,</b> and two LC resonant circuits. The resonant circuits are tuned to a specific frequency, which requires the amplifier to be designed to a particular frequency. This amplifier is being developed to power the Ferroelectric Plasma Thruster (FEPT) which creates plasma when excited by a high voltage, high frequency signal. The FEPT has a piezoelectric resonance near 400 kHz, so an operating frequency of 375 kHz was selected for optimal performance. The goal of this project {{is to reduce the}} size and amount of equipment to operate the FEPT. Design goals require volume, weight, and electrical inputs to be kept to a minimum so that the amplifier and FEPT can be merged together into a small package...|$|E

A Software Call Generator module (CG) has been developed for easy and thorough testing of software developers ’ program code. Until now, developers had to use external testing equipment. There are not enough test machines for every developer to use, due to their high cost. They {{are in the hands}} of validation and testing personnel most of the time. One of the objectives was also geographical independence of CG users. CG can be used from any place in the world. The only requirement is Ethernet connectivity with the switch node that we want to test. This enables testing of already installed switch nodes in Russia, Turkey, etc. We are not limited to testing areas in the company. CG can be also successfully used by the service department. Any WWW browser can be used for the user interface. This way operating system independence is guaranteed. The paper presents planning and development of CG and a practical illustration of its use.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the analog subscriber Call Generator (CG) for the SI 2000 V 5 switch node. It provides developers with the test environment without the use of external testing units. The proposed architecture assures effective tests of program layers above the driver of analog subscriber circuits. This was accomplished with minimal changes of the existing program code and application of the existing communication procedures. Compared to external testing units, the software Call Generator possesses some limitations. Because of the software nature of its operation, electrical interfaces on analog subscriber line circuits are not tested for proper operation. Also, usual audio checks of the connection are not performed. The call generator can be extended with this functionality, but this would demand greater changes of the existing program code and an additional use of digital signal processing resources. This would impose unnatural performance of the switch node under test. Testing without using external testing units represents the main achievement for the developer. For the CG operation, only an IP connection between the developer’s workstation and the tested switch node is required. Developers can control and monitor the execution of tests from their development workstation with any WWW (World Wide Web) browser.

This highly complex project marked {{the year as}} one of the most important ship repair projects. It occupied a large part of the shipyard resources most of 2015. The works commenced in January 2015 and were completed in August 2015.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the design and control of {{a new class of}} brushless machine known as the flux switching machine for high speed and high power application. This machine is a hybrid of the inductor alternator and the switched reluctance machine. The characteristic of this machine determined from an experimental generator shows that the power delivery capability of the machine is limited by the synchronous inductance of the machine especially at high speeds. Various power factor control techniques are proposed and evaluated as possible solutions to the attendant problems with the uncontrolled flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator.</b> This involves the use of series compensation and shunt compensation techniques. For the series compensator technique, a new class of series line compensation delivering controlled power factor using pulse width modulation is identified and tested on an experimental flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system. The shunt compensation technique for the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system is a controlled rectifier, which uses phase angle pulse width modulation to deliver controlled power factor. The power factor control of the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system shows that significant improvement in power delivery for the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system can be achieved. Matlab/Simulink models are developed for each of the proposed technique and the results compared with experimental data shows reasonable agreement. These Matlab/Simulink models can now be effectively used for rapid design and prototyping of the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system. Closed loop control of the output voltage of the flux <b>switching</b> <b>generator</b> system can be achieved. This is done using field current control and/or armature current control. The increased controllability of the FSG compared to other reluctance machines makes it a viable alternative for high speed, high power applications especially in mechanically harsh environment...|$|R

50|$|When {{all four}} main {{generators}} shut off {{due to the}} failure of all the engines, a momentary power interruption occurs when the flight instruments transfer to standby power. Standby power on the 747-400 is provided by two batteries and inverters. The captain performed the engine restart procedure, which failed on the first few attempts, and repeated it until restart was achieved. On some of the attempts, as one or more (but not all) engines started to operate, the main <b>generator</b> <b>switched</b> back on. This switching on and off caused repeated power transfer interruptions to the flight instruments. The temporary blanking of the instruments gave the appearance that standby power had failed. These power transfers were later verified from the flight data recorder.|$|R

50|$|Hot standby {{may have}} a {{slightly}} different connotation of being active but not productive to hot spare, that is it is a state rather than object.

To allow for load balancing, generator turbines may be kept running with the <b>generators</b> <b>switched</b> off so as peaks of demand occur, the generators can rapidly be switched on to balance the load. Being {{in the state of}} being ready to run is known as hot standby.

30|$|The “normal-mode” and “outage-mode” {{operations}} {{are the two}} usual operating strategies of a microgrid. During the normal-mode operation, a microgrid runs {{as a part of}} the local utility and coordinates its internal DERs i.e. solar photovoltaic and loads for the most optimal operation. Microgrid can be designed to isolate itself from the main grid and operate autonomously to secure critical loads in the case of the outage-mode operation [3]. In such a situation, a microgrid activates its internal generation and controls loads based on a pre-defined prioritized list to secure critical loads as needed. The functioning microgrid should be “intelligent”, “distributed” and “autonomous”, which hereafter will be mentioned to as a distributed autonomous power system (an IDAPS microgrid). Devices in an IDAPS micro-grid namely loads, <b>generators,</b> <b>switches,</b> etc. can interconnect among each others through a multi-agent system.

Seen from the network operator's perspective {{as little more}} than negative load, the commissioning of such generators is subject to compliance with the Fit and Forget connection requirements of ENA Engineering Recommendation G 83 / 1. This thesis has sought to quantify the electromagnetic switching transient implications of integrating very large volumes of embedded generation into the UK's low-voltage supply networks. Laboratory testing of a converter-interfaced PV source has been undertaken to characterise typical switching transient waveshapes, and equivalent representative source models have been constructed in EMTP-ATP. A detailed frequency-dependent travelling wave equivalent of the DNO-approved Generic UK LV Distribution network model has been developed and, by means of extensive statistical simulation studies, used to quantify the cumulative impact of geographically localised <b>generators</b> <b>switching</b> in response to common network conditions. It is found that the magnitude of generator-induced voltage and current transients is dependent on the number of concurrently <b>switched</b> <b>generators,</b> and on their relative locations within the network. A theoretical maximum overvoltage of 1. 72 pu is predicted at customer nodes remote from the LV transformer terminals, for a scenario in which all households have installed embedded generation. Latent diversity in switch pole closing and inrush inception times is found to reduce predicted peak transient voltages to around 25 - 40 % of their theoretical maxima.
