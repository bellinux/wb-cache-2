5|$|The tarot {{readings}} of fortunetellers Sofie {{and her mother}} Apollonia advance the plot significantly. Sofie's readings in the pilot episode induce visions in Ben that give insight into his healing powers of his childhood. Season 2 shows Sofie's attempts to leave her former job, which is repeatedly interrupted by tarot cards reappearing. Another of her readings sets Ben on a journey to Scudder, the man he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> for {{since the beginning of}} the series.|$|E
5|$|As {{a market}} town, Wellingborough has major high street chains mainly {{located in the}} town centre. The only {{shopping}} centre, Swansgate, previously known as the Arndale Centre, {{was built in the}} 1970s. Since 2009 the Borough Council <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> at rebuilding the centre and major stores want bigger floor-spaces. The Britannica Fund, which owns Swansgate shopping centre is currently in administration, and decision {{on the future of the}} centre is expected in early 2013. Supplementing the town centre shops are several out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets including a Sainsbury's, four Tesco stores, an Aldi store and a Morrisons store in the town centre. The town has a market three times a week and a weekly privately organised market.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{has been}} reopened for other {{purposes}} since it closed its doors as a planetarium in 1995. On March 5, 1998, an initial three-year agreement was signed that brought the Children's Own Museum {{to the second floor}} of the planetarium, where the Astrocentre used to be. Due to impending construction at the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum, the contract was not renewed in late 2002, and the Children's Own Museum <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> for a new location ever since. During its three-year tenure in that building, it hosted nearly a half-million visitors. The institution still exists, though it currently (as of 2009) has no physical home. It is currently seeking suitable space to use in future endeavours. In the meantime the organization has participated in various children's events around the city.|$|E

5|$|George {{returns to}} Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, a {{colleague}} of Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a location in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt to steal the tripod from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who {{claim to be the}} Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in Syria: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as a crystal ball. He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, Baphomet; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, but George manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, the city <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 {{is an example of}} cooperation between the public and private sectors, with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E
5|$|Teena Mulder (Rebecca Toolan) and The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) visit Mulder, who is paralyzed in a hospital. After {{administering}} a {{drug that}} cures his paralysis, The Smoking Man reveals himself to be Mulder's father and takes him from the hospital. Meanwhile, Kritschgau visits Scully and claims that Mulder's contact with the shard of an alien spaceship has reawakened the extraterrestrial black oil with which he was infected three years previously; because he is infected with the virus, Mulder is proof of alien life. Skinner, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> for Mulder, tells Scully that Mulder's mother signed {{him out of the}} hospital. The Smoking Man takes Mulder to an unfamiliar neighborhood; inside a new home, he finds his former informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin). Deep Throat claims to have faked his own death to escape the burden he was under by being a part of the Syndicate, and he suggests that Mulder can now do the same. Mulder meets Fowley, and the two become intimate.|$|E

With global awareness of mental disorders and increasing understanding of neuroscience, auditory processing is more in the public and academic consciousness than ever before.|$|E
25|$|Detroit's economy fell {{greatly to}} the Great Recession, causing {{airlines}} such as British Airways to drop flights to London–Heathrow and other airlines such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Virgin Atlantic to utilize codeshare flights through Delta Air Lines. While the city has lost population, Detroit Airport has since re-grown, and airlines are looking to expand or begin service once again. JetBlue Airways began flights to Boston, which have been so successful that the airline began a Fort Lauderdale service on April 30, 2015, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> to expand service to Orlando, and New York–JFK. United Airlines has announced the return of nonstop flights to San Francisco in June 2017 in efforts to boost competition in Detroit. Spirit Airlines has also grown in the Detroit market, adding service to more East and West Coast cities.|$|E

In order to make everything right about the future, Peter and Brian decide to sneak into the prom through a vent. While inside it, Peter recites {{a line from the}} 1988 action film Die Hard. The sequence that follows is a parody of the 1985 film Back to the Future. After crashing through the vent to the stage, the band begins playing [...] "Earth Angel" [...] by The Penguins, and, after Peter kisses Lois, Brian sings the 1987 single [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] by musician Rick Astley. While Brian sings [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up", Rick Astley's cousin Marvin calls him to say he's found the [...] "mediocre, generic sound" [...] that Astley <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> for, a reference to Back to the Future.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Alek Keshishian, was filmed in June 1992 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and Malibu Beach. It premiered on MTV on June 30, 1992, {{a day before}} the release of A League of Their Own. The video shows a man viewing a photo album, as Madonna sings in different settings from within the various pictures. Scenes from A League of Their Own also appear on the album during the song's instrumental break. As the video ends, the man having {{reached the end of}} the album, then scrolls backwards through the previous pages. The video was commercially released in 2004 as a bonus feature on the 2-disc special edition DVD of A League of Their Own. According to Rettenmund, unlike most music videos related to film soundtracks, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] did not give emphasis on having shots from the film in the video itself. Instead Keshishian and Madonna chose introspection as the theme, with simple images to portray them. Rettenmund notes, [...] "At the end, the man who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>looking</b> back at his scrapbook of Madonna lays his head down, sealing the video with the perfect bit of sadness to resonate with Madonna's ennui." ...|$|E
500|$|In Season 2, the occurrences {{are found}} to be in {{conjunction}} with activities of a parallel universe, which is plagued by singularities occurring at weakened points of the fabric between worlds; over there, scientists have developed an amber-like substance that isolates these singularities as well as any innocent people caught in the area on its release. The Fringe team deals with more cases that are leading to a [...] "great storm" [...] as the parallel universe appears to be at war with the prime one, engineered by human-machine hybrid shapeshifters from the parallel universe. Walter is forced to tell Peter that he is from the parallel universe, a replacement for his own Peter, who died from a genetic disease. Walter had crossed over on the frozen ice of Reiden Lake in 1985 to administer the cure for the alternate version of Peter, but, after accidentally destroying a dose of the cure upon transport, he instead brought the boy across. On return, they fell through the ice but were saved by the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), who told Walter of the importance of [...] "the boy", which Walter took to mean Peter. Walter's crossing is what caused the singularities in the parallel universe, with Reiden Lake at their epicenter.
