When Will keeps {{ignoring}} her advances and is continuously hostile, he reveals that she was <b>horrible</b> <b>to</b> him in high school. Will also eventually reveals that during high school, he and Ross initiated the episode's titular rumor: that Rachel is a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school, and {{even went so far as}} to reach Chandler's high school. Rachel reacts tearfully, claiming she never hurt Ross in high school, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though Ross shockingly reveals that this is in fact true, much to everyone's amusement and disgust. Monica comforts Rachel, saying that despite the rumor, she was still the most popular girl in their high school and reminds Ross that due to his rumor, he was 'put on the map' in the school. She then reminds Ross and Rachel that they are having a baby together and that some things are more important than high school.

"an execrable army, more atrocious {{than the}} pagans, neither fearing God nor {{regarding}} man, spread desolation {{over the whole}} province and slaughtered everywhere people of either sex, of every age and rank, destroying, pillaging and burning towns, churches and houses". [...] Monastic chroniclers often deplore depredations made by foreign armies and sometimes even those of their own rulers but some Scots forces were going beyond normal Norman 'harrying' by systematically carrying off women and children as slaves. Walter Espec's speech before the Battle of the Standard Ailred of Rievaulx: Historical Works p 254 In the contemporary Celtic world this was [...] regarded as a useful source of revenue, like (and not significantly more reprehensible than) cattle-raiding. [...] "Then (<b>horrible</b> <b>to</b> relate) they carried off, like so much booty, the noble matrons and chaste virgins, together with other women. These naked, fettered, herded together; by whips and thongs they drove before them, goading them with their spears and other weapons.
