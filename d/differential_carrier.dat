Some automatic locking differential designs ensure that engine power is always transmitted to both wheels, regardless of traction conditions, and will [...] "unlock" [...] only when one wheel is required to spin faster than the other during cornering. These would be more correctly termed [...] "automatic unlocking" [...] differentials, because their at-rest position is locked. They will never allow either wheel to spin slower than the <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> or axle as a whole, but will permit a wheel to be over-driven faster than the carrier speed. The most common example of this type would be the famous [...] "Detroit Locker," [...] made by Eaton Corporation, {{also known as the}} [...] "Detroit No-Spin," [...] which replaces the entire <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> assembly.

Both types of automatic lockers will allow for a degree of differential wheel speed while turning corners in conditions of equal traction, but will otherwise lock both axle shafts together when traction conditions demand it.|$|E

Often, the lunchbox locker can be installed without removing the carrier from the differential, depending on whether the carrier pin can slide past the ring gear.|$|E

50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the <b>differential</b> <b>carrier,</b> pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|E
5000|$|This style limited-slip {{differential}} {{works by}} using a gerotor pump to hydraulically compress a clutch to transfer torque to the wheel that is rotating slower. The gerotor pump uses the <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> or cage to drive the outer rotor of the pump and one axle shaft to drive the inner rotor. When {{there is a difference}} between the left and right wheels' speed, the pump pressurizes the hydraulic fluid causing the clutch to compress. thereby causing the torque to be transferred to the wheel that is rotating slower. These pump-based systems have lower and upper limits on applied pressure which allows the differential to work like a conventional or open differential until there is a significant speed difference between the right and left wheel, and internal damping to avoid hysteresis. The newest gerotor pump based system has computer regulated output for more versatility and no oscillation.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{areas of}} failure on this {{transmission}} include damage to plastic internals due to fluid over-temperature conditions, internal fluid pressure leaks from torn piston diaphragms, worn piston bores for solenoids in aluminum valve body, {{and the resulting}} worn clutches and bands. Occasionally, the plastic speedometer drive gear will break and fall off of the <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> and the speedometer will stop working. To repair this, the transmission must be removed and the differential disassembled far enough to replace the plastic gear. With age, the resistance in the wiring and/or electrical terminals between the valve body and transmission controller can increase. The additional resistance may prevent the computer from reading the faint pulses from the transmission speed sensors. Any missing sensor signal causes the transmission to go to [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "limp" [...] mode. This mode keeps the transmission in Third gear and the gear indicator in the instrument panel indicates all gears are selected simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|The viscous type is {{generally}} simpler because {{it relies on}} hydrodynamic friction from fluids with high viscosity. Silicone-based oils are often used. Here, a cylindrical chamber of fluid filled {{with a stack of}} perforated discs rotates with the normal motion of the output shafts. The inside surface of the chamber is coupled to one of the driveshafts, and the outside coupled to the <b>differential</b> <b>carrier.</b> Half of the discs are connected to the inner, the other half to the outer, alternating inner/outer in the stack. Differential motion forces the interleaved discs to move through the fluid against each other. In some viscous couplings when speed is maintained the fluid will accumulate heat due to friction. This heat will cause the fluid to expand, and expand the coupler causing the discs to be pulled together resulting in a non-viscous plate to plate friction and a dramatic drop in speed difference. This is known as the hump phenomenon and it allows the side of the coupler to gently lock. In contrast to the mechanical type, the limiting action is much softer and more proportional to the slip, and so is easier to cope with for the average driver. New Process Gear used a viscous coupling of the Ferguson style in several of their transfer cases including those used in the AMC Eagle.|$|E

40|$|The free {{electrons}} in the earth's ionosphere can retard {{the time of}} reception of GPS signals received at a ground station, compared to their time in free space, by many tens of nanoseconds, thus limiting the accuracy of time transfer by GPS. The amount of the ionospheric time delay {{is proportional to the}} total number of electrons encountered by the wave on its path from each GPS satellite to a receiver. This integrated number of electrons is called Total Electron Content, or TEC. Dual frequency GPS receivers designed by Allen Osborne Associates, Inc. (AOA) directly measure both the ionospheric differential group delay and the <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> phase advance for the two GPS frequencies and derive from this the TEC between the receiver and each GPS satellite in track. The group delay information is mainly used to provide an absolute calibration to the relative <b>differential</b> <b>carrier</b> phase, which is an extremely precise measure of relative TEC. The AOA Mini-Rogue ICS- 4 Z and the AOA TurboRogue ICS- 4000 Z receivers normally operate using the GPS P code, when available, and switch to cross-correlation signal processing when the GPS satellites are in the Anti-Spoofing (A-S) mode and the P code is encrypted. An AOA ICS-Z receiver has been operated continuously for over a year at Hanscom AFB, MA to determine the statistics of the variability of the TEC parameter using signals from up to four different directions simultaneously. The 4 -channel ICS- 4 Z and the 8 -channel ICS- 4000 Z, have proven capabilities to make precise, well calibrated, measurements of the ionosphere in several directions simultaneously.

The geo-referencing of the laser data results from processing <b>differential</b> GPS <b>carrier</b> phase data and integrating the GPS-determined trajectory with incremental velocity and angular rate data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). So far, the GPS/IMU integration utilises a commercial software package based on a Kalman filter processing of the GPS trajectory and the IMU measurements. Such a filter calculates the best estimates {{for a set of}} parameters from all data collected up to the processing epoch; and it also can predict the subsequent progress of the process; it is designed for real time applications and in this context it provides an optimal solution. In contrast, the geo-referencing of the laser data (and of data acquired by other measurement methods) typically takes place post mission in the office; there is no requirement for real time results, and the accuracy requirements of better than 10 cm in position can presently only be satisfied in post processing GPS carrier phase data. Additionally, the typical flight characteristics for airborne data acquisition (few hours flying time, straight flight lines, small banking angles) allows for uninterrupted GPS data reception and a clean uninterrupted GPS-determined trajectory. For these particular flight characteristics and GPS data characteristics we have developed a post mission alternative integration method for GPS and IMU data. In this approach the GPS observations get a higher weight compared to conventional integration algorithms and the IMU data primarily serves for the computation of the attitude parameters and for the temporal interpolation of positions.
