40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an ongoing effort to define the {{security}} architecture for the Joint Simulation System (JSIMS), a joint military modeling and simulation system. It also describes {{the use of the}} security architecture to support the accreditation of the system. The JSIMS security architecture must coordinate not only enclaves at different classifications, but also the independent configurations of the multiple stakeholders. These include the various military branches and their separate <b>designated</b> <b>approving</b> <b>authorities.</b> It has therefore been necessary to develop the security architecture with sufficient breadth and flexibility to describe a variety of JSIMS instantiations, allowing an integrated accreditation by the multiple authorities without necessitating entirely independent accreditations. We have addressed the objective of flexibility by establishing a base, logical architecture along with customized versions of the architecture to meet the joint security objectives. 1.

The research includes any portion of computer security, physical security, personnel security, and communication security that may be applicable to the overall security of both the. mil and. edu domains. The goal of the research was to ensure that the campus network is operating with the proper amount of security safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity adequately from both insider and outsider threats. Risk analysis was performed by assessing all of the possible threat and vulnerability combinations to determine the likelihood of exploitation and the potential impact the exploitation could have on the system, the information, and the mission of the Naval Postgraduate School. The results of the risk assessment performed on the network are to be used by the <b>Designated</b> <b>Approving</b> <b>Authority</b> of the Naval Postgraduate School Gigabit network when deciding whether to accredit the system.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe certification {{process can be}} defined as a comprehensive evaluation of all security features, both technical and nontechnical, of an information system. This process ensures that the system design and implementation meets a distinct set of prescribed security requirements. The accreditation of a system ensures that networks, applications, and operating systems that make up the system are running at an acceptable level of risk. The <b>Designated</b> <b>Approving</b> <b>Authority</b> (DAA) is responsible for deciding what systems to approve for accreditation, and assumes the responsibility for running the accredited system at an accepted level of risk. This analysis of the certification and accreditation process stresses the vital aspects of the process that are of special concern to the DAA. The mission drives the process, and influences the ultimate accreditation decision. The DAA must understand the fundamental aspects of the certification effort, and be able to weigh factors such as the funding, time, and other resources available for the effort, as well as understand the scope of the system as a whole. This thesis covers the vital aspects of certification and accreditation, and provides the new DAA with a guide to the process. Naval Postgraduate School author (civilian) ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In South Africa the {{assessment}} of exposure to occupational hygiene stressors or environmental factors in workplaces covered by the Occupational Health & Safety Act, Act No. 85 of 1993 must be performed or at least verified by an <b>Approved</b> Inspection <b>Authority</b> for occupational hygiene. However, no formal system is in place to effectively audit and score operational work of <b>Approved</b> Inspection <b>Authorities</b> for occupational hygiene. Formal auditing is a requirement of internationally accepted and implemented management systems such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO) 9001 : 2000, Quality Management System – Requirements, the British Standards Institution - Occupational Health and Safety Series (OHSAS) 18001 : 1999, {{as well as the}} International Standard - ISO 14000 : 2004 : Environmental Management System. To develop an audit system for <b>Approved</b> Inspection <b>Authorities</b> for occupational hygiene, a descriptive research project that gathered relevant data through electronic questionnaires was conducted with the objective of identifying audit elements and a general scoring system as well as the development of an audit tool that can be applied by regulatory authorities, professional bodies and even competent persons to audit operational work of <b>Approved</b> Inspection <b>Authorities</b> for occupational hygiene. 5 This study had a sample population of 40 <b>Approved</b> Inspection <b>Authorities</b> for occupational hygiene, all based in the Gauteng Province, the province which had the largest number of <b>Approved</b> Inspection <b>Authorities</b> for occupational hygiene. A questionnaire was compiled from local and international audit elements and emailed to the study population for electronic completion. The cover letter and study questionnaire is appended as ANNEXURE A and ANNEXURE B respectively. The Ethics Committee – Clearance Certificate is appended as ANNEXURE C. The questionnaire listed the proposed audit elements and a number of questions relating to the registration of the <b>Approved</b> Inspection <b>Authority</b> for occupational hygiene. A scoring mechanism was also suggested. Questions asked in the questionnaire applied the equivalent-form approach whereby as far as reasonably practicable each question was rephrased so that it “appeared different”, but effectively asked the same question. The study had a response rate of 65...|$|R
