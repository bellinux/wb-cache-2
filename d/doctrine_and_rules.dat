But reasoning, even in {{the widest}} sense of which the word is susceptible, {{does not seem to}} {{comprehend}} all that is included, either in the best, or {{even in the}} most current, conception of the scope and province of our science. The employment of the word Logic to denote the theory of Argumentation, is derived from the Aristotelian, or, as they are commonly termed, the scholastic, logicians. Yet even with them, in their systematic treatises, Argumentation was the subject only of the third part: the two former treated of Terms, and of Propositions; under one or other of which heads were also included Definition and Division. By some, indeed, these previous topics were professedly introduced only on account of their connection with reasoning, and as a preparation for the <b>doctrine</b> <b>and</b> <b>rules</b> of the syllogism. Yet they were treated with greater minuteness, and dwelt on at greater length, than was required for that purpose alone. More recent writers on logic have generally understood the term as it was employed by the able author of the Port Royal Logic; viz., as equivalent to the Art of Thinking. Nor is this acceptation confined to books, and scientific inquiries. Even in ordinary conversation, the ideas connected with the word Logic include at least precision of language, and accuracy of classification: and we perhaps oftener hear persons speak of a logical arrangement, or of expressions logically defined, than of conclusions logically deduced from premises. Again, a man is often called a great logician, or a man of powerful logic, not for the accuracy of his deductions, but for the extent of his command over premises; because the general propositions required for explaining a difficulty or refuting a sophism, copiously and promptly occur to him: because, in short, his knowledge, besides being ample, is well under his command for argumentative use. Whether, therefore, we conform to the practice of those who have made the subject their particular study, or to that of popular writers and common discourse, the province of logic will include several operations of the intellect not usually considered to fall within the meaning of the terms Reasoning and Argumentation.|$|E

The purpose of this paper have been to investigate how three modern Islamic theorists view {{the limitations of}} the public free will of choice based upon their interpretation of the Islamic theology <b>and</b> <b>doctrine.</b> The paper focuses to highlight how all three chosen Islamic theorist interpret the Islamic doctrine based upon my elected theses and more specifically pinpoint were the free will of choice ends, and Islam as a religion starts to take hegemony. The paper’s aim is to further an understanding that in the modern world and as a effect of increased literacy, Islam has been somewhat inclined to split into several Islamisms, based upon the variety of fatwa’s on the Islamic doctrine that is available online. Therefore it remains to the modern day Muslim, to individually decide whether they choose to follow the message of the Holy revelation in the Quran or trust a mufti’s fatwa in their everyday life as a Muslim. The material used and analyzed in this paper is prime source material. That has been written by my chosen theorists themselves and this prime source material, form the core of their interpretation of Islamic theology which I have used trying answer my theses. The conclusions drawn from this paper is that all three theorists share three concepts of the Islamic <b>doctrine</b> <b>and</b> that is the need for tawhid, idjtihad, theology and the umma to form a ample and righteous life in modern day Islam. During the course of the paper it has become evident that the theorist Qutb and Mawdudi do share the doctrine of Islam as the natural religion of the world and that violence can be justified to bring the believers together under Muslim <b>doctrine</b> <b>and</b> <b>rule,</b> therefore limiting the public will of choice based upon their interpretation of Islamic theology. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{institution}} of property serves an important management function for society, guiding {{the use of}} resources among its members by delegating to the owner the power to decde {{how and when to}} use a resource. Under the dominant American approach, this delegation involves recognizing broad decision-making powers in the individual property owner. Grounded in an exclusion-based view of property, the dominant approach recognizes each property owner as a gatekeeper, with important in rem rights that bind all others—even those not in a direct relationship with the owner. Over time, courts and other lawmakers have developed <b>doctrines</b> <b>and</b> <b>rules</b> of law to guide and sometimes constrain the exercise of gatekeeping powers. Developed through democratic institutions, these principles <b>and</b> <b>rules</b> provide an important counterweight to the self-interests driving the decisions of individual right holders. The exclusion-based approach to the management function works well much of the time. It is a low-cost approach that relies on the incentives of the marketplace to reward the productive gatekeeper or replace the wasteful one. With a simple delegation, ownership rights and powers are placed in the gatekeeper and protected from encroachment or interference through the power to exclude. In certain more complex settings, however, property’s owner-centric exclusion strategy poses serious problems by ignoring the true scales and relational dimensions of property use. These problems include resource hoarding, excessive fragmentation, overcapitalization, and serious, sometimes irreversible degradation of the environment. It is time to rethink the management function of property to recognize that management occurs both through individual and collective action. In a democratic society, neither is sufficient by itself. Both are necessary to promote individual freedoms, social cohesion, and the integrity of political, economic, and natural systems...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} works that {{speculate}} about National Socialism and occultism, {{the most prominent}} being The Morning of the Magicians (1960) and The Spear of Destiny (1972). From the perspective of academic history, however, most of these works are [...] "cryptohistory". Notable exceptions are Der Mann, der Hitler die Ideen gab (The man who gave Hitler the ideas) by Wilfried Daim (1957), Urania's children by Ellic Howe (1967) and The Occult Establishment by James Webb (1976). Aside from these works, historians did not consider the question until the 1980s. Due to the popular literature on the topic, [...] "Nazi 'black magic' {{was regarded as a}} topic for sensational authors in pursuit of strong sales." [...] In the 1980s, two Ph.D. theses were written about the topic. Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke published The Occult Roots of Nazism (1985) based on his thesis, and the German librarian and historian Ulrich Hunger's thesis on rune-lore in Nazi Germany (Die Runenkunde im Dritten Reich) was published in the series Europäische Hochschulschriften (also 1985). [...] Goodrick-Clarke's book The Occult Roots... is not only considered [...] "without exception" [...] to be the pioneering work on Ariosophy, but also the [...] "definitive book" [...] on the topic. The term 'Ariosophy' refers to an esoteric movement in Germany and Austria of the 1900s to 1930s. It clearly falls under Goodrick-Clarke's definition of occultism, as it obviously drew on the western esoteric tradition. Ideologically, it was remarkably similar to Nazism. According to Goodrick-Clarke, the Ariosophists wove occult ideas into the völkisch ideology that existed in Germany and Austria at the time. Ariosophy shared the racial awareness of völkisch ideology, but also drew upon a notion of root races, postulating locations such as Atlantis, Thule and Hyperborea as the original homeland of the Aryan race (and its [...] "purest" [...] branch, the Teutons or Germanic peoples).The Ariosophic writings described a glorious ancient Germanic past, in which an elitist priesthood [...] "expounded occult-racist <b>doctrines</b> <b>and</b> <b>ruled</b> over a superior and racially pure society." [...] The downfall of this imaginary golden age was explained {{as the result of the}} interbreeding between the master race and the untermenschen (lesser races).The [...] "abstruse ideas and weird cults Ariosophy anticipated the political <b>doctrines</b> <b>and</b> institutions of the Third Reich" [...] writes Goodrick-Clarke in the introduction to his book, motivating the phrase [...] "occult roots of Nazism"; direct influences, however, are sparse. With the exception of Karl Maria Wiligut, Goodrick-Clarke has not found evidence that prominent Ariosophists directly influenced Nazism.|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} characteristic of real property law, {{one that is}} definitional in nature, is that its subject matter consists of land parcels. A land parcel, in contrast to an ownership interest such as a fee simple estate, is not an abstraction. Each land parcel has a physical reality, and virtually all land parcels abut other parcels. Each parcel has one particular location, defined by its proximity to other pieces of property. The value of a land parcel depends heavily upon its location, {{and the nature of}} neighboring parcels has a major impact in determining that value. Owners of neighboring parcels have sets of rights, privileges, and duties that define their legal relationships with neighbors. In Anglo-American law, those rights, privileges, and duties are components of real property law, but they are not a recognized category of real property law. Rather, they represent the application of general <b>doctrines</b> <b>and</b> <b>rules</b> to neighbors, instead of a distinct and cohesive body of law of its own. Other legal systems have developed distinct bodies of law to govern relations among neighbors. The law of neighbors or “neighborhood law” is not presently a recognized type of law practice in the United States, and it will not likely become one anytime in the near future. In part this is the case because neighbor law disputes typically do not involve high financial stakes and resulting incentives for lawyers to market themselves as experts in the area. This Article suggests that if the field of neighbor law develops in the United States, academics will have to lead the way. This Article does three things. First, it introduces the “stranger model” and the “friend model” of neighbors law, using these models as a frame for describing three components of existing U. S. law applicable to neighboring landowners. Second, it briefly describes the extent to which South Africa and Scotland have come to describe neighbors law as a discrete legal category, which correlates to the stranger model and friend model. Third, it concludes by making several suggestions on how the models may help in the construction of a coherent law of neighbors...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{various aspects}} of English and Canadian charity law {{in terms of their}} relationship with the contested categories of ‘public law’ and ‘private law’. It argues that the law of charities can be regarded as a hybrid legal discipline in both a general or categorical sense, and in the context-specific or functional sense that both the conditions for obtaining charitable status, and the regulation of the conduct of charities and their trustees, are continually being adjusted {{in such a way as}} to maintain in a broad sense a functional equilibrium between individual project pursuit and collective project pursuit; that is to say, an equilibrium between the protection of the autonomy of property-owning individuals to control and direct their own wealth, and the furtherance of competing public interests or visions of the good. After sketching out the history and nature of the common law charities tradition and the contemporary English and Canadian regulatory regimes, the thesis pursues its analytical and comparative hypotheses by examining two important features of English and Canadian charity law, the public benefit <b>doctrine</b> <b>and</b> the <b>rules</b> of locus standi that determine who may seek relief for misapplications of charity property. It then addresses the comparatively modern issue of the governmental co-optation of charitable resources, considering to what extent modern pressures associated with the retrenchment of welfare states threaten to destabilize charity law’s hybrid equilibrium in EW and Canada. The thesis then turns to the emerging phenomenon of social enterprise, arguing that shifts to charity law’s functional equilibrium may explain the emergence of this ‘post-charitable’ legal form. The thesis concludes with some observations on the hybrid nature of the law of charities, and on the different functional equilibriums between individual project pursuit and collective project pursuit that have been reached by English and Canadian charity law.
