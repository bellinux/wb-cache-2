25|$|KDE Brasil is {{composed}} by several local groups in Brazil, like KDE–MG, Live Blue, KDE Piauí, and KDE–RS. The main goals of local groups are regional promotion {{and direction of}} contributions of members, and still maintaining harmony with the KDE Brazil community. KDE–MG is a local group in Minas Gerais. The idea of structuring the group has arisen during the FISL (Fórum Internacional Software Livre) 10. Live Blue is a KDE working group in Bahia. KDE Piauí is a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and contributors of KDE in the Piauí. The idea was born during the Software Freedom Day Teresina 2009 and has concretized during the Akademy–Br 2010, where the group was officially created. KDE–RS {{is a group of}} KDE users from Rio Grande do Sul. KDE Lovelace is a Brazilian female <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and contributors in KDE.|$|E

25|$|A user persona is a {{representation}} of the goals and behavior of a hypothesized <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> In most cases, personas are synthesized from data collected from interviews with users. They are captured in 1–2-page descriptions that include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and the environment, with a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character. For each product, more than one persona is usually created, but one persona should always be the primary focus for the design.|$|E
25|$|Terminal Server is {{the server}} {{component}} of Terminal services. It handles {{the job of}} authenticating clients, as well as making the applications available remotely. It is also entrusted with the job of restricting the clients according {{to the level of}} access they have. The Terminal Server respects the configured software restriction policies, so as to restrict the availability of certain software to only a certain <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> The remote session information is stored in specialized directories, called Session Directory which is stored at the server. Session directories are used to store state information about a session, and can be used to resume interrupted sessions. The terminal server also has to manage these directories. Terminal Servers {{can be used in a}} cluster as well.|$|E

In August 2012, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> released an unofficial port of a later version of Android, 4.1 [...] "Jelly Bean", for the Dream as a proof of concept.

Mason thought that there must be some way to leverage large number of people's collective bargaining power. In 2007 Mason launched The Point, a web platform based on the [...] "tipping point" [...] principle that would utilize social media to get people together to accomplish a goal. The Point was intended to organize people around some sort of cause or goal. It gained only modest traction in Chicago, until a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> decided their cause would be saving money. They wanted to round up people to buy the same product in order to receive a group discount. Founder Eric Lefkofsky wanted the company to pivot in order to focus entirely on group buying.

2500|$|Social {{media is}} an {{essential}} tool for Venezuelans to show the news in the streets, which contradicts most official news {{from the government and}} most stories have to be compiled together from cell phone videos on small websites.

According to Mashable, Twitter is very popular in Venezuela and according to an opposition figure, [...] "Venezuela is a dictatorship, and the only free media is Twitter," [...] Protesters use Twitter since [...] "traditional media" [...] has been unable to cover the protests and so that, [...] "the international community can notice what's happening and help us spread the word in every corner," [...] However, the government has been accused of using Twitter as a propaganda tool when it allegedly [...] "purchased followers, created fake accounts to boost pro-government hashtags, and hired a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> to harass critics" [...] and claiming protesters were [...] "fascists" [...] that were trying to commit a [...] "coup d'état".|$|E

[...] Developers in over 150 locations can distribute apps on Google Play, though not every location supports merchant registration. To distribute apps, developers {{have to pay a}} one-time $25 registration fee for a Google Play Developer Console account. App developers can control which countries an app is distributed to, as well as the pricing for the app and in-app purchases in each country. Developers receive 70% of the application price, while the remaining 30% goes to the distribution partner and operating fees. Developers can set up sales, with the original price striked out and a banner underneath informing users when the sale ends. Google Play allows developers to release early versions of apps to a select <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>users,</b> as alpha or beta tests. Developers can also release apps through staged rollouts, in which [...] "your update reaches only a percentage of your users, which you can increase over time." [...] Users can pre-order select apps (as well as movies, music, books, and games) to have the items delivered as soon as they are available. Some network carriers offer billing for Google Play purchases, allowing users to opt for charges in the monthly phone bill rather than on credit cards. Users can request refunds within 48 hours after a purchase if [...] "something you bought isn't working, isn't what you expected, was bought by accident, or you changed your mind about the purchase".
