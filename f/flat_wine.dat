5000|$|The word {{derives from}} the Spanish guapo, meaning bold, elegant, an ostentatious person, and which {{eventually}} {{derives from the}} Latin vappa, meaning <b>flat</b> <b>wine</b> or scoundrel. The noun guappar√≠a, which is sometimes also used to indicate the Camorra, means arrogance, domineering, braggart. The verb guappia means to behave like a guappo (Camorrista), to be domineering and derives from the Spanish guapear (to feign courage, to flaunt elegance).|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} Turkey <b>Flat</b> <b>wines</b> began in 1847 when Johann Frederick August Fiedler planted Shiraz vines near Bethany Creek. The vines planted in 1847 {{are some of}} the oldest vines used for {{commercial}} wine production today and believed to be the world's oldest vines that have been authenticated. However, another Barossa winery, Langmeil, and a Victoria winery, Tahbilk, also claim to have vines just as old, or even older than Turkey Flat.|$|R
5000|$|The Adelaide Plains {{is one of}} {{the hottest}} and <b>flattest</b> <b>wine</b> regions in South Australia. The area's Magill {{vineyards}} located {{on the edge of the}} foothills: [...] "The Grange", pioneered by Christopher Rawson Penfold, and [...] "Auldana", pioneered by W. P. Auld, once provided the grapes for the production of Penfolds' Grange. There were once a number of vineyards on the Plains to the south of the Adelaide city centre, but these areas are now covered with Adelaide's suburban sprawl.|$|R
50|$|Flat: In {{relation}} to sparkling <b>wines,</b> <b>flat</b> {{refers to a}} wine that has lost its effervescence. In all other wines the term is used interchangeably with flabby to denote a wine that is lacking acidity, particularly on the finish.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} {{creating}} a construction documentation for a guest house with a wine cellar. The guest house is a three-storey building. A lounge, which is also meant to serve for ceremonious social gatherings, staff facilities and two accessible rooms are located on the ground floor. First floor consists of several two-bed rooms, one common kitchen and a smaller lounge for guests. Accommodation units for larger groups of guests {{can be found on}} the top floor. Vertical supports are made of Porotherm system, ceilings are made of filigree-like reinforced concrete slabs. Roofing of the building is designed as a saddle roof with clay tiles and load-bearing nailed timber trusses. The building is situated in moderate, almost <b>flat</b> terrain. The <b>wine</b> cellar building consists of an underground cellar and a ground floor with a lounge, sanitary facilities and a staircase hall. External walls of the upper part of the cellar are made of CSB framework, partitions are made of Porotherm system, ceiling is made of reinforced concrete slabs. Roofing of the building is designed as a green roof. External walls of other parts of the building are also made of CBS framework, ceiling is a vault-like one supported by prefabricated beams and covered with Miako ceiling panels. The structure is situated in moderate, almost flat terrain, its cellar is sunk under ground level and covered with soil...|$|R
50|$|Regarding {{metabolism}} (MR) in the formula; Females {{demonstrated a}} higher {{average rate of}} elimination (mean, 0.017; range, 0.014-0.021 g/210 L) than males (mean, 0.015; range, 0.013-0.017 g/210 L). Female subjects on average had {{a higher percentage of}} body fat (mean, 26.0; range, 16.7-36.8%) than males (mean, 18.0; range, 10.2-25.3%). Additionally, men are, on average, heavier than women but it is not strictly accurate to say that the water content of a person alone is responsible for the dissolution of alcohol within the body, because alcohol does dissolve in fatty tissue as well. When it does, a certain amount of alcohol is temporarily taken out of the blood and briefly stored in the fat. For this reason, most calculations of alcohol to body mass simply use the weight of the individual, and not specifically his/her water content. Finally, it is speculated that the bubbles in sparkling wine may speed up alcohol intoxication by helping the alcohol to reach the bloodstream faster. A study conducted at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom gave subjects equal amounts of <b>flat</b> and sparkling <b>wines</b> which contained the same levels of alcohol. After 5 minutes following consumption, the group that had the sparkling wine had 54 milligrams of alcohol in their blood while the group that had the same sparkling <b>wine,</b> only <b>flat,</b> had 39 milligrams.|$|R
60|$|September 7th.--I {{walked into}} town {{yesterday}} morning, {{by way of}} the Porta San Frediano. The gate of a city might be a good locality for a chapter in a novel, or for a little sketch by itself, whether by painter or writer. The great arch of the gateway, piercing through the depth and height of the massive masonry beneath the battlemented summit; the shadow brooding below, in the immense thickness of the wall and beyond it, the vista of the street, sunny and swarming with life; outside of the gate, a throng of carts, laden with fruits, vegetables, small <b>flat</b> barrels of <b>wine,</b> waiting to be examined by the custom-house officers; carriages too, and foot-passengers entering, and others swarming outward. Under the shadowy arch are the offices of the police and customs, and probably the guard-room of the soldiers, all hollowed out in the mass of the gateway. Civil officers loll on chairs in the shade, perhaps with an awning over their heads. Where the sun falls aslantwise under the arch a sentinel, with musket and bayonet, paces to and fro in the entrance, and other soldiers lounge close by. The life of the city seems to be compressed and made more intense by this barrier; and on passing within it you do not breathe quite so freely, yet are sensible of an enjoyment in the close elbowing throng, the clamor of high voices from side to side of the street, and the million of petty sights, actions, traffics, and personalities, all so squeezed together as to become a great whole.|$|R
