2500|$|In December 2011, Fisker Automotive {{recalled}} the first 239 Karmas {{delivered to the}} U.S. due to a risk of battery fire caused by coolant leak. Of the 239 cars, less than fifty have been delivered to customers, the rest were in dealerships. In the report filed by Fisker Automotive with the NHTSA, the carmaker said some <b>hose</b> <b>clamps</b> were not properly positioned, which could allow a coolant leak and an electrical short could possibly occur if coolant enters the battery compartment, causing a thermal event within the battery, including a possible fire. In May 2012 a Fisker Karma {{was involved in a}} home fire that also burnt two other cars in Fort Bend County, Texas. The chief fire investigator said the Karma was the origin of the fire that spread to the house, but the exact cause is still unknown. The plug-in hybrid electric car was not plugged in at the time the fire started and it was reported that the Karma's battery was intact. The carmaker release a public statement saying that [...] "...there are conflicting reports and uncertainty surrounding this particular incident.

5000|$|In many countries, Jubilee Clips tend to {{be known}} almost {{exclusively}} by their brand name, but elsewhere (where the brand is not so well known for example), they are known by generic names such as worm-drive hose clip or <b>hose</b> <b>clamp</b> or <b>hose</b> clip.

It remains the term used in everyday speech in the UK and Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The other {{goal of a}} <b>hose</b> <b>clamp</b> is {{to provide}} {{mechanical}} attachment keeping the hose attached to a barb, hose nipple, or tube. To do this the clamp is typically placed on the hose behind the first ramp of the barb or behind the raised area {{near the end of}} and completely around the circumference of the hose nipple or tube called a bead. If the hose were to slide the clamp would have to expand to fit over the barb or raised bead. This keeps the hose attached to the barb, hose nipple, or beaded tube.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hose</b> <b>clamps</b> are {{typically}} limited to moderate pressures, {{such as those}} found in automotive and home applications. At high pressures, especially with large hose sizes, the clamp {{would have to be}} unwieldy to be able to withstand the forces expanding it without allowing the hose to slide off the barb or a leak to form. For these high pressure applications, compression fittings, thick crimp fittings, or other designs are normally used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hose</b> <b>clamps</b> are {{frequently}} used for {{things other than}} their intended use, and are often used as a more permanent version of duct tape wherever a tightening band around something would be useful. The screw band type in particular is very strong, and is used for non-plumbing purposes {{far more than the}} other types. These clamps can be found doing everything from mounting signs to holding together emergency (or otherwise) home repairs.|$|E
5000|$|Constrictor knots can be {{used for}} {{temporarily}} binding the fibres of a rope (or strand ends) together while splicing, or when cutting to length and before properly whipping the ends. Constrictor knots can also be quite effective as improvised <b>hose</b> <b>clamps</b> or cable ties. The knot has also been recommended for ligatures in human and veterinary surgery, where it {{has been shown to be}} far superior to any of the knots commonly used for ligation.

50|$|Many {{other methods}} {{can be used}} to attach hoses or tubing, such as {{compression}} fittings (where a nylon or soft metal ferrule is compressed onto the hose by the tightening of the fitting), push-fit fittings (where the hose is inserted inside of a compression sleeve, designed such that force against the hose causes the sleeve to tighten), swage fittings (where a stiff collar is compressed onto the hose), clamp fittings (where two blocks are tightened onto the sides of the hose, often found on garden hoses), crimp banding (similar to worm gear banding but a crimp is used instead of a screw/thread), and a multitude of others. However, these devices are not typically referred to as <b>hose</b> <b>clamps.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The DIR {{requirement}} for stage and decompression cylinders for the dive {{is that they}} should be aluminium, for reasons of near-neutral buoyancy. The cylinders should be rigged with stainless steel bolt snaps of a size to allow easy operation. If gloves are worn in cold water, a large snap is needed. The snaps must be attached to a line clamped about halfway along the cylinder. The upper snap is attached to the line near the neck and close to the tank, and the lower snap to the line that extends beyond the clamp. ¼" [...] braided line and stainless steel <b>hose</b> <b>clamps</b> are standard. The distance between the snaps should be about 16" [...] to match the distance between the D-rings from which it will be suspended.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} goals of most <b>hose</b> <b>clamps</b> is to ensure a tight seal between the hose and the barb, preventing the working fluid from escaping. To this goal, {{they are designed to}} provide even pressure on all sides, with no gaps. An example of this would be wire clamps. An obvious design would seem to be simply having a wire around the hose, one end attached to a nut, and the other end to the screw, and when tightened, pulling the ends of the wire towards each other. However, this will leave a gap where no pressure is applied (underneath the screw), and cause a leak. To combat this, the more complicated and weaker design of having the ends overlap and then be pushed apart from each other is used, as this ensures pressure around the entire circumference of the hose.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{the structure and}} working principle of {{a new type of}} automatic medicine renewing and final alarming intravenous infusion device. The control system and the choosing of stepping motor are also discussed.

50|$|The process {{involves}} {{moving the}} strip past precision-profiled slotted tools made to an exact shape, or past plain cutting tools. The tools are all usually made of tungsten carbide-based compounds. In early machines, {{it was necessary}} to precisely position the strip relative to the cutting tools, but newer machines use a floating suspension technology which enables tools to locate by material contact. This allows mutual initial positioning differences up to approximately 12 mm followed by resilient automatic engagement. Products using this technology directly are automotive seatbelt springs, large power transformer winding strip, rotogravure plates, cable and <b>hose</b> <b>clamps,</b> gas tank straps, and window counterbalance springs. Products using the process indirectly are tubes and pipe mills where the edge of the strip is accurately beveled prior to being folded into tubular form and seam welded.

5000|$|On a boat {{having an}} inboard motor that turns a shaft {{attached}} to an external propeller, the shaft passes though a stuffing box, also termed a 'stern gland' in this application. The stuffing box prevents sea water {{from entering the}} boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the stuffing box is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The [...] "box" [...] is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the stuffing box to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty <b>hose</b> <b>clamps</b> secure the hose to the stern tube and the stuffing box. A sound stuffing box installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.|$|E
50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure bleed valve. The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air <b>hose</b> to <b>clamp</b> firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual bleed valve is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual bleed valve allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) for the Cal Poly dairy milk barn, which will help prepare students to be more efficient at milking in the newly renovated milking parlor. A double 10 parallel parlor is {{to be put into}} place to update the current milk barn. The current milking parlor is a double 8 herringbone barn which holds eight cows per side that are positioned at an angle. The double 8 herringbone parlor is to be remodeled into a double 10 parallel parlor. In addition, a double 10 parallel barn has ten cows on each side and are being milked between the hind legs. Information was gathered from the Cal Poly dairy’s herd manager, Rich Silacci, to develop a new SOP poster for the new milking parlor. Proper milking procedures were discussed and a poster was developed. The poster is to be placed in the milk barn near the pit where students are milking. The SOP poster is to be used as an easy way to answer any questions that they may have about proper milking procedures. The poster that was created contains 6 different steps to insure that students are consistent in their milking procedures. The first step in this SOP poster is to Pre-dip. It is important to apply the Pre-dip to the first five cows, cover the whole bottom 2 / 3 of each teat and allow the Pre-dip to sit for 30 seconds. Step number 2 calls for stripping the milk from the teats of the five cows and remove 2 - 3 squirts from each quarter. Step number 3 calls for wiping all five cows teats clean and to use as many towels as needed, but making sure not to transfer dirty towels to the next cow. Step number 4 calls for attaching the milking unit to the five cows and to make sure the milk hose and pulsation hose are parallel with the cows body pointing directly back towards the parlor pit. The milk hose will rest on the <b>hose</b> <b>clamp</b> located on the curb. Step number 5 is when the automatic take-off removes the milking unit when the cow is done being milked. Finally, step number 6 calls for the five cow’s four teats to be post-dipped. In addition, the SOP poster will contain extra information such as attending to liner slips, also known as squawking, as soon as possible to decrease chance of mastitis. In addition, it is important to make sure cows are completely milked out to decrease the chance of mastitis. The use of this SOP poster will aid students in learning how to milk the cows properly and provide for their success in the work place...|$|R
