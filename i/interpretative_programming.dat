Recent literature has shown that the majority of plantation museums and historic sites, which historically enslaved African-Americans, are currently ignoring the institution of slavery. Very few interpretive programs are available which discuss the enslaved and the contributions of African Americans to modern society. This paper will examine the available literature concerning the interpretation of the enslaved and the institution of slavery. For a site to develop a successful interpretive program it is crucial that it is familiar with and cognizant of the principles of interpretation. Cable and Beck's principles of interpretation will be explained and discussed. These principles will assist interpreters in designing a successful and effective <b>interpretative</b> <b>program</b> on slavery. Because most historic sites are lacking an interpretive program on slavery, the paper will conclude by outlining several guidelines and suggestions for designing such a program. Currently there is no literature available to assist interpreters in interpreting such controversial issues such as slavery.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{introduce}} transformation plans that can stimulate responsible ecotourism by using systems thinking to solve ecotourism problems in Korea. Systems thinking is a research method used to understand the operating mechanisms of the variables that influence an entire system, in order to identify its problems. The four types of ecotourism systems are classified as follows: low-infrastructure and resident-initiated, high-infrastructure and resident-initiated, high-infrastructure and government-initiated and low-infrastructure and government-initiated. These systems vary based on the need for tourism facilities and the form of governance. Each type of system is analyzed using the systems thinking process (dynamic thinking, causal thinking, feedback thinking, strategic thinking) at representative ecotourism sites in Jeollanam-do and the following transformation plans are proposed to improve the responsibility at the tourism sites: First, local residents will develop a system to manage and operate ecotourism ventures and establish cooperative governance structures to strengthen the local capacity. Second, ecotourism operators will improve the quality of their educational and <b>interpretative</b> <b>programs</b> and tourist information platforms in order to raise awareness of the responsibilities of ecotourists. Third, ecotourism systems that are improved through ecotourists’ and tour operators' heightened senses of responsibility can sustain ecotourism independently. These transformation plans can be applied to policy proposals for revitalizing ecotourism, to guidelines for improving community resilience and to biological habitat protection plans. This study is meaningful in that it discusses the role of stakeholders in ecotourism planning and promoting responsible tourism and their role in utilizing and conserving natural resources accordingly...|$|R

The West Hill Dam Project {{was completed in}} 1960. It {{is located on the}} West River, one of the branches of the Blackstone River which flows from Worcester, MA to Providence, RI. The West River originates in Grafton, Massachusetts, at Cider Mill Pond and Silver Lake, near Upton, Massachusetts, and the Upton State Forest. The dam is unusual in that it isn't filled unless there is a flood.West Hill Dam was built after devastating floods during the 1950s; it is intended to protect the Blackstone Valley from future destructive flooding. The cities and towns downriver from Uxbridge, including Millville, Blackstone, Woonsocket, North Smithfield, Cumberland, Lincoln, Central Falls, Pawtucket and Providence, Rhode Island, suffered extensive flooding from the Blackstone during Hurricane Diane in 1955. Hurricane Donna tested this new dam in 1960 as the eyewall passed over. The West Hill Dam is located in the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor near the Blackstone River and Canal Heritage State Park. Park rangers provide visitor assistance and offer scheduled <b>interpretative</b> <b>programs.</b> Fishing, hunting, and wildlife viewing opportunities are available year-round. The park has a recreation area, 34 picnic sites, one playground, a swimming area and five miles of hiking trails.West Hill Dam (where the Army Corps project is based) is also the field office for the Charles River Natural Valley Storage Area. It consists of scattered wetlands in the upper and middle Charles River watershed, between the towns of Bellingham and Needham.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THESIS: Interpretation {{is a form}} of {{education}} that encourages the public to appreciate cultural resources and commit to preserving them for future generations. Although there are laws, regulations, guidelines and policies that mandate or recommend public interpretation on cultural resources management work, outreach projects rarely transpire as technical reports, funding and construction take precedence. Still, by marketing innovative ideas and consulting with agencies and communities, cultural resources management (CRM) practitioners working for a state agency, private firm or university are improving {{the quantity and quality of}} outreach programs to build public support and retain cultural heritage. Sonoma County Regional Parks is an example of an agency influenced by these issues. Using the spirit of the legal mandates and taking inspiration from their mission statement, Regional Parks has developed a variety of public interpretation products since the agencis founding in 1968. Their recent acquisition of 335 acres of uplands that adjoin Hood Mountain Regional Park, Sonoma County, impelled plans for park development, which includes generating public interpretation materials on the historic-period site Hendrickson Homestead. This domestic site is recognized for having both important cultural, historical and archaeological features and values. Now a part of Hood Mountain Regional Park, an immensely popular recreational destination for the local community, Hendrickson Homestead will be accessible to the public through hiking trails, including the Bay Area Ridge Trail. Through the process of creating a public interpretation product for Sonoma County Regional Parks of Hendrickson Homestead located in Hood Mountain Regional Park, the purpose of this thesis is to illustrate theimportant role that public interpretation plays in the cultural resources management industry, how public interpretation is incorporated into the cultural resource management process and how historical and CRM-driven research, archaeological features and landscape observation can be used to create public interpretation materials. METHODS: Interviews with CRM educators and practitioners were conducted and literature was reviewed to understand the concepts, definitions and theories of public interpretation within the framework of the National Park Service and the cultural resources management field. Primary and secondary documents relating to Hendrickson Homestead and the surrounding area during the historic period and existing cultural resource studies for Hood Mountain Regional Park were reviewed in order to develop a comprehensive historical overview. Analysis of historical documents and archaeological site records and the author's observations of Hendrickson Homestead configuration were used to create a description of the site's features and landscape development during the historic period. FINDINGS: Hendrickson Homestead's history of extensive land use and landscape modification during the historic period suggests that the site is a signi'ficant example of California land acquisition that reflects the influences of agriculture, mining and recreation. Historical interpretations, CRM-driven research and landscape observations applied through public interpretation concepts provide sufficient methods for developing content for public interpretation materials. When it comes to generating such public outreach efforts within the cultural resources management field, entrepreneurial inventiveness is at the core of what will make future public interpretation products possible. CONCLUSIONS: Sonoma County Regional Park managers should adopt an <b>interpretative</b> <b>program</b> based on the recognition that public participation and outreach are recommended actions through the legal mandates. An <b>interpretative</b> <b>program</b> can be guided by interpretation concepts as they have been integrated into the National Park Service and California Department of Parks and Recreation. The management of plJblic lands and public interpretation drives many research projects in historical archaeology. Still, it's crucial for interpreters to make a connection between archeological resources and property types. Domestic sites such as Hendrickson Homestead benefit from evaluating the inside of their social and economic contexts to make connections within local and regional settlement systems. A combined approach of integrating archaeology, history and ethnography as an interpretive tool provides a full understanding of the site not as an isolate, but as elements of larger communities...|$|R

Recently, this pathology was connected to ovarian cancer, in particular with endometrioid ovarian cancer. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of RNA transcripts ~ 19 – 22 nucleotides in length, the altered miRNA pattern being connected to pathological status. miRNAs are highly stable transcripts, and these can be assessed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples leading to the identification of miRNAs that could be developed as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, in particular those involved in malignant transformation. The aim of our study was to evaluate miRNA expression pattern in FFPE samples from endometriosis and ovarian cancer patients using PCR-array technology and also to compare the differential expression pattern in ovarian cancer versus endometriosis. For the PCR-array study, we have used nine macrodissected FFPE samples from endometriosis tissue, eight samples of ovarian cancers and five normal ovarian tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used for data validation in a new patient cohort of 17 normal samples, 33 endometriosis samples and 28 ovarian cancer macrodissected FFPE samples. Considering 1. 5 -fold expression difference as a cut-off level and a P-value < 0. 05, we have identified four miRNAs being overexpressed in endometrial tissue, while in ovarian cancer 15 were differentially expressed (nine overexpressed and six downregulated). The expression level was confirmed by qRT-PCR for miR- 93, miR- 141, miR- 155, miR- 429, miR- 200 c, miR- 205 and miR- 492. Using the <b>interpretative</b> <b>program</b> Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed several deregulated pathways due to abnormal miRNA expression in endometriosis and ovarian cancer, which in turn is responsible for pathogenesis; this differential expression of miRNAs can be exploited as a therapeutic target.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four independent but thematically interrelated papers, plus an addendum {{to one of these}} papers. Chapter 1 defends the view that Leibniz subscribed to generalism, or the view that the world is fundamentally purely qualitative in character. In particular, I respond to Cover & O'Leary-Hawthorneâs (1999) claim that Leibnizâs use of symmetry considerations in the correspondence with Clarke reveals that he was not a generalist. In addition, I claim that what reveals Leibnizâs generalism is notâas many scholars seem to believeâhis mere commitment to his theory of truth, theory of complete individual substances and Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles (PII). Rather, I argue, it is the fact that Leibniz claimed to derive the PII from his theories of truth and complete individual substances which ultimately demonstrates his commitment to generalism. Chapter 2 examines the putative relationship between two notions: symmetry and qualitativity. I argue that, on the standard metaphysical construal of the notion of qualitativity, a widely-held view about the relationship between these two notions is mistaken. However, I also argue that on a nonstandard construal of the notion of qualitativity due to Ismael & van Fraassen (2003), the alleged relationship between the two notions holds much more promise. I finish by expanding upon Ismael & van Fraassen's own account of the notion of qualitativity relevant to the notion of symmetry, and in doing so I attempt to elucidate the methodology of symmetry reasoning in physics more generally. This chapter is followed by a brief addendum. Here, I discuss two recent independent proposals â due to Adam Caulton (forthcoming) and Shamik Dasgupta (forthcoming, a) âfor understanding the methodology of symmetry reasoning that are prima facie very similar to the view that I defend at the end of Chapter 2. I argue that both proposals differ from my own, and each other, in subtle but nevertheless highly non-trivial respects. Chapter 3 argues that the focus of much contemporary discussion concerning the proper role and philosophical significance of a modern-day version of the PII is misplaced. More specifically, I argue that metaphysicians' criticism of the notion of weak discernibility {{on the basis of its}} alleged inability to ground objects' numerical diversity is orthogonal to Saunders' (2003 a) main concern in his original paper, which is to use the notion of weak discernibility as part of a broader program for interpreting physical theories. I subsequently assess this <b>interpretative</b> <b>program,</b> and suggest some reasons for thinking it implausible. Chapter 4 discusses a variety of recent objections to generalism. The objections are related by the fact that all of them appeal, at some stage in the relevant line of argument, to the possibility of worlds containing qualitatively indisii cernible individuals. I argue that none of these objections ultimately succeed. Thus, I claim that a significant class of difficulties for the view is obviated. Lightly-edited versions of some of these chapters have already been accepted for publication. At the time of writing, Chapter 1 is forthcoming in Studia Leibnitiana; Chapter 2 (without the addendum) has appeared in Tomasz Bigaj and Christian Wüthrich's edited collection Metaphysics in Contemporary Physics (Amsterdam/New York, NY: Rodopi, 2015); and Chapter 3 is forthcoming in Ergo.

The main purpose {{of this research was}} to examine whether exercise intensity modulates a range of physiological and psychological outcomes for breast and prostate cancer survivors. The primary outcomes were related to peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak) and quality of life (QOL). VO 2 peak is a highly sensitive measure that indicates overall health. QOL references the general wellbeing of individuals, and is an outcome of great importance in cancer rehabilitation research.

Although so-called high-level, abstracted graphical libraries which have been delivered by third parties based on industrial standard like OpenGL speed up the VE development to certain extent, the involved engineering process which largely relies on the system computing approach is by all means not developer-oriented but application-specific, thus it remains technically difficult and expensive to create VE application from scratch. This research attempts to propose an ultimate solution for VE rapid development by exploring the boundary between system <b>programming,</b> <b>interpretative</b> computing, interfaces wrapping, abstracted scene-graph libraries, grouping and database technology. The convergence of ideas from these technological fields has formed a systematic approach by which developers are encouraged to design and implement 3 D interactive graphics via making necessary reconfiguration to both graphical content and rendering context take place at system runtime. The whole development cycle of VE application can be further accelerated by using similar existing drawings from the database as reconfigurable VE templates.

40|$|Social phobia is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} and debilitating anxiety disorder that can significantly impact {{quality of life and}} produce extreme distress in social situations. Cognitive models of social phobia suggest that information-processing biases are involved in the maintenance of social anxiety. Treatment typically involves a course of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Recent advancements in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying social anxiety have led to specific adjunctive treatments that target processing biases. The current literature review explores the efficacy of training programs designed to modify <b>interpretative</b> biases. Training <b>programs</b> typically involve repeated exposure to positive resolutions of ambiguous lexical social stimuli. Results suggest that current techniques are able to modify interpretative biases in non-anxious, socially anxious and clinical samples of social phobia. Multi-session programs have also been shown to reduce trait anxiety and social anxiety symptoms. Evidence for the generalisability of training to subsequent socially stressful situations remains mixed and requires further research. In the present study, the validity of a novel cognitive bias modification of interpretation (CBM-I) technique using ambiguous facial stimuli was examined in an unselected sample of 65 undergraduate students. Participants were randomly allocated to receive CBM-I-threat (n= 31) or CBM-I-non-threat (n= 34) training. The number of angry responses in a forced alternative (angry, neutral) choice was compared at pre and post assessment to determine the efficacy of training. Participants completed a subsequent social stressor task (impromptu speech). Measures of state anxiety, physiological measures of arousal, and judgements of speech performance were taken {{to examine the effects of}} training on emotional vulnerability. Results showed that the training program successfully induced a bias towards threat in the CBM-I-threat trained group. There was also some evidence that it was able to reduce the number of threat interpretations in CBM-I-non-threat trained individuals, however this was only when facial expressions were ambiguous. Early results suggest CBM-I training may also effect anticipated and retrospective negative evaluations of social performance...|$|R
