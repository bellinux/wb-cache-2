5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{represented}} in the <b>Dodecanese</b> Campaign of September–November 1943 by the Long Range Desert Group, which was withdrawn from the North African front in March 1943. After retraining for mountain operations in Lebanon, the LRDG moved in late September to the <b>Dodecanese</b> island of Kalymnos, north-west of Kos and south-east of Leros, {{off the coast of}} south-west Turkey. In the fall-out from the armistice between Italy and the Allies, which had been concluded {{in the first week of}} September, the Allies were attempting to capture the <b>Dodecanese</b> so the islands could be used as bases against the German-occupied Balkans. Most of the Italian forces had changed sides; the LRDG found itself in an infantry role, acting as a mobile reserve for Italian troops.|$|E
5|$|They later {{operated}} {{among the}} <b>Dodecanese</b> and Cyclades groups of {{islands in the}} <b>Dodecanese</b> Campaign and {{took part in the}} Battle of Leros and the Battle of Kos. They with Greek Sacred Band took part in the successful Raid on Symi in July 1944 in which the entire German garrison was either killed or captured. In August 1944, they joined with the Long Range Desert Group in operations in the Adriatic, on the Peloponnese, in Albania, and, finally, Istria. So effective were they that, by 1944, 200–300 SBS men held down six German divisions.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943 the LRDG {{was sent}} to Lebanon to retrain in {{mountain}} warfare. However, following the Italian armistice in 1943, they were sent to Leros, one of the <b>Dodecanese</b> islands, to serve as normal infantry. They later {{took part in the}} Battle of Leros, where the commanding officer John Richard Easonsmith was killed and replaced by David Lloyd Owen. After the battle the last New Zealanders, two officers and approximately 46 men, were withdrawn from the LRDG and returned to their division.|$|E
5|$|Napoli saw {{action in}} the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 and 1912; she {{took part in the}} attack on Derna, Libya, and the amphibious assaults on the islands of Rhodes and the <b>Dodecanese</b> in the Aegean Sea. Napoli {{remained}} in service during World War I in 191518, but saw no action {{as a result of the}} cautious policies of both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. She remained in the Italian inventory until she was stricken from the naval register in August 1926 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The four {{ships of}} the Regina Elena class {{served in the}} active duty {{squadron}} after their commissioning through 1911 and participated in the peacetime routine of fleet training. On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, starting the Italo-Turkish War. The four ships saw action {{during the war in}} the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron. They participated in the operations off North Africa in the first months of the war, including escorting the crossing of the Italian expeditionary army sent to conquer Cyrenaica. Later in the war, they took part in the seizure of Rhodes and the <b>Dodecanese.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vittorio Emmaneule saw {{action in}} the Italo-Turkish War as the {{flagship}} of the 1st Division. During the war, she participated in operations in Cyrenaica and the eastern Mediterranean Sea, including the seizure of the islands of Rhodes and the <b>Dodecanese.</b> She served during the First World War, but saw no combat during the war due to the hesitance of both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies to risk their capital ships in pitched battle. She remained in service as a training ship until 1923, when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Between 8 and 20 May, Napoli was {{involved}} in the seizure of several islands in the <b>Dodecanese</b> between Crete, Rhodes, and Samos. In June, Napoli {{and the rest of the}} 1st Division was stationed at Rhodes. Over the next two months, the ships cruised in the Aegean to prevent the Turks from attempting to launch their own amphibious operations to retake the islands Italy had seized in May. The 1st Division returned to Italy in late August for repairs and refitting, and were replaced by the battleships of the 2nd Squadron. The 1st Division left port on 14 October, but was recalled later that day, when the Ottomans had agreed to sign a peace treaty to end the war.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{departed}} Istanbul on 9 April {{and entered}} Phaleron Bay, Piraeus, Greece, {{the following day}} for an overwhelming welcome by Greek government officials and anti-communist citizens. Greece had become {{the scene of a}} civil war between the communist World War II resistance movement and the returning Greek government-in-exile. The United States saw this as an important test case for its new doctrine of containment of the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pushing for concessions in the <b>Dodecanese</b> {{to be included in the}} peace treaty with Italy and for access through the Dardanelles strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The voyage of Missouri to the eastern Mediterranean symbolized America's strategic commitment to the region. News media proclaimed her a symbol of U.S. interest in preserving both nations' independence.|$|E
5|$|The Italian cruiser Pisa was {{the name}} ship of her class of two armored cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. The ship participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12, during which she {{supported}} the occupations of Tobruk, Libya and several islands in the <b>Dodecanese</b> and bombarded the fortifications defending the entrance to the Dardanelles. During World War I, Pisas activities were limited by the threat of Austro-Hungarian submarines, although the ship did participate in the bombardment of Durazzo, Albania in late 1918. After the war she became a training ship and was stricken from the Navy List in 1937 before being scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Brindisi hosted King Victor Emmanuel III aboard {{during the}} ceremonies that {{transferred}} Fiume to Italian control {{in accordance with}} the Treaty of Rome in February–March 1924. The ship was then transferred to Libya where she spent the next year. Brindisi returned to Italy the following year and was briefly assigned to the Scout Squadron on 1 April 1926 before she was placed in reserve on 26 July. The ship was reactivated on 1 June 1927 when she was assigned as the flagship of the 1st Destroyer Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Enrico Cuturi. Six months later, she was relieved as flagship and was transferred to the Special Squadron where she became flagship of Rear Admiral Antonio Foschini on 6 June 1928. In May–June 1929, Brindisi made a cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean where she visited ports in Greece and the <b>Dodecanese</b> Islands. Rear Admiral Salvatore Denti relieved Foschini on 15 October and the ship was disarmed on 26 November. She was used as a depot ship at Ancona, Pula, and Trieste until she was stricken from the Navy List on 11 March 1937.|$|E
5|$|Fury {{was briefly}} {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean in August 1942 to participate in Operation Pedestal but returned to the Home Fleet immediately afterwards to resume her role screening convoys to Russia. She continued in this role until March 1943 when she began escorting convoys in the North Atlantic for several months. The ship was {{transferred to the}} Mediterranean Fleet a few months later as the Allies began making landings in Italian territory in mid-1943. Later in the year, she participated in the <b>Dodecanese</b> Campaign in the Aegean where she helped to sink a German troop convoy. Fury returned to the Home Fleet in mid-1944 in preparation for Operation Neptune, the Allied invasion of France. The ship provided naval gunfire support during the landings until she struck a mine during a storm on 21 June and was then blown ashore. She was deemed uneconomical to repair and scrapping began in September.|$|E
5|$|On 17February 1941, the 6th Infantry Division was {{reformed}} in Egypt. It {{was initially}} {{made up of}} the 16th and the 22nd Guards Brigade, who were based in Egypt, but lacked artillery or other supporting arms. The 22nd Guards Brigade was soon withdrawn, and the division was assigned the 14th and 23rd Infantry Brigade. Here, the division trained for amphibious operations in the <b>Dodecanese.</b> The deteriorating situation in North Africa, which saw General Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps retake the territory lost by the Italians during Operation Compass, resulted in the 6th Infantry Division being reassigned to defend Egypt. The division had been earmarked to deploy to Crete, where the 14th Brigade had been based since November, but instead took up defensive positions at Mersa Matruh. The 14th Brigade later defended the airfield at Heraklion during the Battle of Crete when 2,000 German paratroopers landed in the area on 20May. The Germans were able to penetrate into Heraklion, before Anglo-Greek forces cleared the town following heavy fighting. Despite many losses, the paratroopers were able to dig-in on ridges around the brigade's positions. Due to the deteriorating situation on Crete, the 14th Brigade was evacuated by Royal Navy ships on 29 May. En route to Egypt, they were repeatedly bombed by the Luftwaffe, suffering 800 casualties.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Dodecanese</b> {{campaign}} of World War II {{was an attempt}} by Allied forces to capture the Italian-held <b>Dodecanese</b> islands in the Aegean Sea following the surrender of Italy in September 1943, and use them as bases against the German-controlled Balkans. Operating without air cover, the Allied effort failed, with {{the whole of the}} <b>Dodecanese</b> falling to the Germans within two months, and the Allies suffering heavy losses in men and ships. The <b>Dodecanese</b> campaign, lasting from 8 September to 22 November 1943, resulted in one of the last big German victories in the war.|$|E
25|$|In September–October 1943, {{during the}} <b>Dodecanese</b> Campaign the Germans ousted the British from the Italian-held <b>Dodecanese</b> islands. In {{the course of}} these operations, on 12 October 1943 the island of Symi was {{occupied}} by German troops.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Dodecanese</b> Campaign was {{an attempt}} by the British to {{liberate}} the Italian held <b>Dodecanese</b> islands in the Aegean Sea following the surrender of Italy, and use them as bases against the German controlled Balkans. The effort failed, with the whole of the <b>Dodecanese</b> falling to the Germans within two months, and the Allies suffering heavy losses in men and ships. (see Battle of Kos and Battle of Leros for further details).|$|E
25|$|In the 1936 Italian {{census of}} the <b>Dodecanese</b> islands, the total {{population}} was 129,135, of which 7,015 were Italians. Nearly 80% of the Italian colonists lived in the island of Rhodes. Approximately 40,000 Italian soldiers and sailors were on military duty in the <b>Dodecanese</b> islands in 1940.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dodecanese</b> from 11 June 1943 to 8 May 1945.|$|E
25|$|The British {{failure to}} capture the <b>Dodecanese</b> sealed the fate of Jews living there. Although Italy had passed the anti-Jewish law of the Manifesto of Race in 1938, Jews living on the <b>Dodecanese</b> islands (and Italian-occupied Greece) {{experienced}} much less antisemitism than in the German and Bulgarian occupied zones of Greece, where harsher and harsher policies were implemented, culminating in March 1943 with deportations to the death camps in occupied Poland. The Italian surrender, the German takeover {{and the failure of}} the Allied offensive meant that the haven disappeared. Most of the <b>Dodecanese</b> Jews were murdered by the Germans; 1,700 members of the ancient Jewish community of Rhodes (of a population of about 2,000) were rounded up by the Gestapo in July 1944 and only some 160 of them survived the camps. Out of 6,000 Ladino-speaking Jews in the <b>Dodecanese,</b> about 1,200 people survived by escaping to the nearby coast of Turkey.|$|E

25|$|The Kingdom of Italy {{occupied}} the <b>Dodecanese</b> Islands in the Aegean sea during the Italian-Turkish war of 1911. In the 1919 Venizelos-Tittoni Agreement, Italy promised to cede the overwhelmingly Greek-inhabited islands, except Rhodes, to Greece, but this treaty was never implemented {{due to the}} Greek catastrophe in Asia Minor. With the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, the <b>Dodecanese</b> was formally annexed by Italy, as the Possedimenti Italiani dell'Egeo.|$|E
25|$|During the conflict, Italian forces also {{occupied}} the <b>Dodecanese</b> {{islands in the}} Aegean Sea. Italy had agreed to return the <b>Dodecanese</b> to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Ouchy in 1912 (also known as the First (1912) Treaty of Lausanne). However, the vagueness of the text allowed a provisional Italian administration of the islands, and Turkey eventually renounced all claims on these islands in Article 15 of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Italy {{joined the}} Axis Powers, {{and used the}} <b>Dodecanese</b> as a naval staging area for its {{invasion}} of Crete in 1940. After the surrender of Italy in September 1943, the islands briefly became a battleground between the Germans, British and the Italians (the <b>Dodecanese</b> Campaign). The Germans prevailed, and although they were driven out of mainland Greece in 1944, the <b>Dodecanese</b> remained occupied {{until the end of}} the war in 1945, during which time nearly the entire Jewish population of 6,000 was deported and killed. Only 1200 of these Ladino-speaking Jews survived, thanks to their lucky escape to the nearby coast of Turkey with some help from the Italian colonists of Rhodes. In the Treaty of Paris in 1947, the islands were ceded to Greece.|$|E
25|$|On the {{announcement}} of the Armistice (surrender), the Italian garrisons on most of the <b>Dodecanese</b> Islands either wanted to change sides and fight with the Allies or go home. Anticipating the Italian surrender, German forces, based largely in mainland Greece, had been rushed to many of the islands to gain control. The German forces were part of Army Group E commanded by Luftwaffe General Alexander Löhr. The most important German force in the <b>Dodecanese</b> was the 7,500-strong Sturm-Division Rhodos (Assault Division Rhodes, Generalleutnant Ulrich Kleemann). This division had been formed during the summer in the island of Rhodes, which was the administrative center of the <b>Dodecanese</b> Islands and possessed three military airfields. Because of this, Rhodes was the principal military objective for both the Allies and the Germans.|$|E

25|$|In July 1919, Venizelos {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the Italians on the cession of the <b>Dodecanese,</b> and secured an extension of the Greek area in the periphery of Smyrna. The Treaty of Neuilly with Bulgaria on 27 November 1919, and the Treaty of Sèvres with the Ottoman Empire on 10 August 1920, were triumphs both for Venizelos and for Greece. As the result of these treaties, Greece acquired Western Thrace, Eastern Thrace, Smyrna, the Aegean islands Imvros, Tenedos and the <b>Dodecanese</b> except Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|During the conflict, Italian forces also {{occupied}} the <b>Dodecanese</b> {{islands in the}} Aegean Sea. Italy had agreed to return the <b>Dodecanese</b> to the Ottoman Empire according to the Treaty of Ouchy in 1912 (also known as the First Treaty of Lausanne (1912), as it was signed at the Château d'Ouchy in Lausanne, Switzerland.) However, the vagueness of the text allowed a provisional Italian administration of the islands, and Turkey eventually renounced all claims on these islands in Article 15 of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.|$|E
25|$|With the {{capitulation}} of Italy in September 1943, German {{forces in}} the Balkans and the Mediterranean moved {{to take over the}} Italian-held areas. At the same time, the Allies, under the instigation of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, endeavoured to occupy the <b>Dodecanese</b> island chain. The <b>Dodecanese</b> islands, under Italian control since 1912, were strategically located in the southeastern Aegean Sea, and Churchill hoped to use them as a base against German positions in the Balkans, and as a means to pressure neutral Turkey into the war on the Allied side.|$|E
25|$|De Vecchi {{effected}} {{the first}} step towards an Italia Imperiale (or Grande Italia) when in 1936, as Italian Governor of the <b>Dodecanese</b> islands, he imposed official use of the Italian language and created a colony of 7,000 Italians in Rhodes and surrounding islands. In 1940 he {{was appointed to the}} Grand Council of Fascism where later, during the Italian occupation of Greece, he proposed that the Kingdom of Italy annex the <b>Dodecanese</b> and Ionian islands, with the island of Chios, which had once belonged to the Republic of Genoa.|$|E

25|$|Italian colonists {{were settled}} in the <b>Dodecanese</b> Islands of the Aegean Sea in the 1930s by the Fascist Italian {{government}} of Benito Mussolini, Italy having been in occupation of the Islands since the Italian-Turkish War of 1911.|$|E
25|$|In addition, it {{stated that}} the islets of Imia/Kardak belongs to <b>Dodecanese</b> group of islands {{pursuant}} to the 1923, 1932 and 1947 treaties and whereas even on Turkish maps from the 1960s, these islets are shown as Greek territory.|$|E
25|$|After 1936 {{and during}} World War II, the Greek <b>Dodecanese</b> islands were also {{included}} in the project (with the Ionian islands of Zante, Ithaca, etc.) and the fascist regime soon promoted a process of forced Italianization of these Greek islands.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 300 Turks {{remain on}} the island of Rhodes and 200 {{on the island of}} Kos, as the islands were part of the Italian <b>Dodecanese</b> when the {{population}} exchange between Turkey and Greece happened (and so were not included in it).|$|E
