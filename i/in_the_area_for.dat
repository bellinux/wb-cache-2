5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>for</b> generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|By the {{day after}} Hurricane Lane made landfall, most of the {{evacuated}} people returned to their homes to begin the cleanup process.

A few years before both highways were removed from the highway system, M-135 was moved to use M-98's terminus with M-28. Since the 1970s, M-135 {{has been a part of}} the county-designated highway system and assigned the number H-33, a moniker it has borne since.|$|E

On 10 August, the Marines picked up the advance, inadvertently encountering the North Korean 83rd Motorized Regiment of the 105th Armored Division, which was caught off-guard and attempted to withdraw. F4U Corsairs from the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing strafed the retreating column repeatedly, inflicting 200 casualties and destroying about 100 of the regiment's equipment vehicles, but 1st Provisional Marine Brigade forces {{were not able to}} follow up the attack, as they were redeployed elsewhere on the perimeter on 12 August.

5|$|On August 14, 1862, Cox {{began moving}} his Kanawha Division toward Washington as {{reinforcement}} for Major General John Pope's Army of Virginia. Exceptions to Cox's orders were the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry and two regiments of Ohio infantry, which remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>for</b> defensive purposes. The three regiments moved to Kanawha Falls {{in what is}} now south central West Virginia, {{at the beginning of the}} Kanawha River—which flows to the Ohio River. They were put under the command of Colonel Joseph Andrew Jackson Lightburn. Thus, the two battalions of 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry were reunited, with Colonel John C.
