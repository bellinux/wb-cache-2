5000|$|During 2002 the duo caused {{considerable}} drama at the Conservatorium, which Speltervasser accounted to his {{disenchantment with}} the rigid and uncreative {{structures of the}} institution. Immediately before the annual enrollment, Burstein changed his name by <b>deed-poll</b> from Hans Rinehold Burstein to Megatrön, with the specific intention of irritating the college staff who by law were forced to print the Annual Vienna Orchestral Roll with Burstein's new legal name. When asked by the Konservatorium's Dean about the <b>deed-poll</b> incident, Burstein claimed {{that he had been}} [...] "..inspired by Megatron's example of fortitude and leadership in the quest of the Decepticons for the Creation Matrix," [...] and that the gratuitous heavy metal umlaut was the [...] "sign of the beast." [...] When the Konservatorium demanded that he change the registered name, Burstein refused and consulted a friend engaged in legal studies and successfully petitioned the authorities to allow him to register his new legal name in the Tutonic Blackletter of the Mötley Crüe Logo, thus becoming the only person in Austrian history to have legal name in a specific font. After his expulsion from the Konservatorium, Burstein changed his name back to that of his birth.|$|E

His mother was Jane Veale, {{daughter}} of James Veale (who following an inheritance had changed his name by <b>deed-poll</b> from [...] "Mallet"). His youngest brother was Col.

5000|$|... c.1917-1919/20 William Badco (1864-1921) of Cardiff, tramp-ship owner. He was a {{stranger}} to Exmoor, and was on holiday in Minehead when he heard of the problems which were starting to arise due {{to the absence of}} deer control due to the death of the last master. At this time of war sporting considerations were secondary. He offered to undertake the mastership at his own expense without any funding guaranteed, and continued until the 1919-20 season when he retired to Badminton. MacDermot wrote of him: [...] "Staghunters and the country in general owe a very deep debt of gratitude to his memory for keeping the hunt going, largely at his own expense, through a most difficult time". He was a shipowner and changed his name from [...] "Badcock" [...] to [...] "Badco" [...] by <b>deed-poll</b> dated 11 March 1916, who lived [...] "formerly" [...] at St Ives, Cornwall, but who was living in 1916 at Cathedral Street, Cardiff. He was from St Ives and started his career as a clerk with a Mr Haines. In 1900 he floated the Polurrian Steamship Co. Ltd., to raise funds for the purchase of the steamer of that name then being built at Blumen's yard in Sunderland. He similarly floated the Poldhu Steamship Co. Ltd., the following year to acquire the Poldhu from the same yard. He moved from St Ives in 1909 to Cardiff and took delivery of his third new vessell the Polvarth. The Pol- prefix of his ships was a Cornish reference. Between 1910 -13 he bought three second-hand ships, the Polmanter, Polcarne and Polperro, to meet the improving market. However before the end of WW I he had sold 5 of his ships, having lost one to a U-boat attack. The average tonnage of his vessels was about 3,000 tons.|$|E
5000|$|Born not Drake, but Ethel McGlinchy, the actress's Irish father, a caterer, was {{an actor}} manqué, whose great love was the theatre {{and who was}} given to quoting Shakespeare. She passed an {{entrance}} test to the Academy of Dramatic Art (later to become RADA), in December 1913 - a small class existed at that time for {{children between the ages}} of ten and sixteen who attended only in the afternoons but who had an identical adult curriculum with that of senior students. (It was the high-ups at the ADA who decided McGlinchy was too difficult to pronounce and too hard to remember for a stage name so she changed it, ultimately by <b>deed-poll,</b> to Drake which was the second of her father's Christian names and to Fabia which was the second of her baptismal names, chosen because she was born on St Fabian's Day). Founded by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, her contemporaries at the Academy of Dramatic Art included the actress Meggie Albanesi, Eva Le Gallienne, and Miles Malleson - a senior student who wrote plays for her. She was small, was called the Shrimp, and played a very wide range of parts - Richard II, Macbeth, Cardinal Richelieu in Bulwer Lytton's play, the Shaughraun in Dion Boucicault's The Shaughraun. Her teachers included Norman Page, whom she admired and to whose teaching she responded [...] - [...] "he gave you confidence, he inspired you with his enthusiasm', and Helen Haye, to whom she did not respond and who was not, according to Drake, a great teacher.She made her first professional appearance on a stage at the Court Theatre, Sloane Square, in a Children's Theatre production called The Cockjolly Bird, as a hermit land-crab [...] - [...] "in a shell of immense weight and unparalleled discomfort." [...] Her first paid work came when she was cast in a production of The Happy Family. Also in the cast was a young man who [...] "had rather 'stick-out' ears, and his name was Noël Coward." [...] It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. In the same year, 1916, she met a heroine, Ellen Terry, when she played Robin, Falstaff's diminutive page in scenes from The Merry Wives of Windsor, for a week, at the Palace Pier Theatre in Brighton.|$|E
