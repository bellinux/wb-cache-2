500|$|Despite the {{production}} from Sayers, the Bears {{as a whole}} struggled to find success; in games that Sayers played, the team compiled a record of 29 wins, 36 losses, and 3 ties, and failed to reach the postseason. Because of this, Sayers' main focus each postseason was on the Pro Bowl, where he excelled. Showcasing his breakaway talents, throughout his Pro Bowl career he achieved runs of 74, 52, 51, 48, and 42 yards. In the Pro Bowl following his rookie season, he had kickoff returns of 51 and 48 yards, despite limited opportunities due to the East's attempts to punt and kick away from him. In the next season's game, his 10 yards-per-carry average set a Pro Bowl record. He was named the [...] "back of the game", an honor he received again in 1968 and 1969, joining Johnny Unitas as the only players to win three Pro Bowl MVP awards. [...] "The Pro Bowl {{is the time to}} prove <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>you</b> are, playing against the best of your peers," [...] recalled Sayers. [...] "I took it as a challenge. I came into the game in shape, came to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bush {{was also}} one of the {{shortest}} players in the Major Leagues at five feet, six inches (1.7 meters) and weighed between 130 and 140 pounds. [...] Bush once said, [...] "I used to tell 'em it ain't how big you are, it's <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>you</b> are. But whenever another team had an uncommonly small player, I'd slip up and compare heights. Always turned out he was an inch taller than me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aside from {{teaching}} and film-making, Khouri devotes time to feminist organizations. [...] "Don’t you think {{talking about it}} is important, making the next generation understand that things are still not right for women?" [...] says Khouri. “I feel like I owe aspiring writers at least the warning that they are picking maybe the hardest thing there is {{to do in the}} business,” she says. “It doesn’t matter any more <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>you</b> are. In some ways, it never really did. Bad movies get made as often as good ones, but so few movies get made now, period. If you write for a studio, you may be one of eight writers, so it’s not like you can have an artistic vision of your own and achieve it solely through screenwriting. I was very lucky because Ridley really wanted to tell Thelma & Louise. He wanted to make the movie I wanted to make. But often times that’s not the case at all. They think your script is a good idea and that’s all. So they buy it and then they hire two or three other people to take a whack at it and it can be a very disappointing thing." ...|$|E
