5|$|In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, {{leaving the}} party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had {{defeated}} for the nomination, {{refused to be}} the Democratic candidate, perhaps because he had already <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields {{as a replacement for}} Cantrill.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> president, {{but to have}} a {{realistic}} chance of attaining that goal, he needed to regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate—he planned to challenge Sherman in the legislative election {{to be held in}} January 1892—and he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell had <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory {{along with the}} President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he {{was one of only}} a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E

5|$|Driehaus {{had been}} {{the choice of the}} Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) to run in Ohio's 1st congressional {{district}} for the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, but he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> re-election in his Ohio House of Representatives seat. He had been elected as the Minority Whip of the Ohio House of Representatives, replacing Dale Miller for the beginning of the 2005 session, in a November 2004 vote after being reelected to his third term. Driehaus survived his own challenge from Scott Gehring with a 2:1 victory margin in the 2006 election for his state house seat.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Hogg <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> {{a seat on}} the Houston School Board so {{that the}} board would include two female members. Hogg won with 4,350votes, more than 1,000 ahead of the runner-up. During her term, she worked to remove gender and race as {{criteria}} for determining pay. She championed a visiting teacher program for children with emotional problems and began art education programs in the schools for black students. Hogg declined to run for a second term.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2009, Paul {{said that}} if Bunning, whose {{fundraising}} in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him, and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising {{to stay out of}} the race if Bunning ultimately <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.|$|E

5|$|Ryan {{graduated}} from Nebraska's Creighton University with a B.A. in 1949 and an M.S. in 1951. He {{served as a}} teacher, school administrator and South San Francisco city councilman from 1956 to 1962. He taught English at Capuchino High School, and chaperoned the marching band in 1961 to Washington, D.C., to participate in President John F. Kennedy's inaugural parade. Ryan was inspired by Kennedy's call to service in his inaugural address, and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> higher office.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{was elected}} to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1990. After redistricting, Cordray <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the United States House of Representatives in 1992 but was defeated. The {{following}} year he was appointed by the Ohio Attorney General as the first Solicitor General of Ohio. His experience as Solicitor led to his appearance before the United States Supreme Court to argue six cases, where he had previously clerked. Following Republican victories in Ohio statewide elections in 1994, Cordray left his appointed position and entered the private practice of law. While in private practice he unsuccessfully ran for Ohio Attorney General in 1998 and the United States Senate in 2000. He was elected Franklin County treasurer in 2002 and re-elected in 2004 before being elected Ohio State Treasurer in 2006.|$|E
5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt {{out of touch with}} the country and in some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> president again.|$|E

5|$|Peterle conceded immediately. In {{his first}} statements, Peterle said his defeat was a {{vote against the}} ruling Janša government, {{and that he had}} {{expected}} a better result. He added, however, that he would have regretted it if he had not <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the office. By midnight, unofficial results from the Electoral Commission gave Türk a lead of 68% vs. 32%. Türk won in all eight electoral units, with Peterle narrowly winning in only four of 88 electoral districts. Together with {{the second round of the}} election, a referendum on a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company was held as well. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{was born}} in what would soon become the {{province}} of Ontario in 1867. After briefly teaching school, he entered the business industry, as a druggist. After initially gaining experience in politics on the council of Eastnor Township, he relocated west {{to the city of}} Edmonton, Alberta. In Edmonton, he established his pharmaceutical business once again and worked briefly with his brother on real estate and construction projects. In 1907, he ran for election to the Edmonton City Council and was elected to a two-year term. In 1910, he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the mayoralty in the municipal election; uncontested as the only nominated candidate on election day, Armstrong was acclaimed to the mayor's chair for the upcoming year. During his term, several issues were brought up to attention, including the city's need of a new civic building and the possibility of two new gas plants for the city.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale {{announced}} her candidacy for the PC Party leadership on December 30, 2010, and {{was endorsed by}} her entire caucus. While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's credentials committee announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because {{he was unable to}} collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by the credentials committee. With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as leader at the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to politics after the 1929 {{stock market crash}} {{and the beginning of}} the Great Depression. He <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the presidency. He formed the Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He tented the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book The Book, which dealt with the harmful effects of usury by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates could agree on. They nominated Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for vice president. The Liberty Party ended up merging with the Jobless Party, and Harvey ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, and Harvey only drew 800 votes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned {{success in}} arduously {{navigating}} to passage the Western Trolley Act which connected Northampton {{with a dozen}} similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts. Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom, but when the President of the State Senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate {{in the hopes of}} being elected as its presiding officer. Although Greenwood later <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> reelection to the Senate, he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage; Coolidge was in favor of the women's vote, won his own re-election and with Crane's help, assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate. After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled Have Faith in Massachusetts, which summarized his philosophy of government.|$|E
5|$|The Erie County, New York Republicans had drafted Kemp after {{incumbent}} congressman Richard D. McCarthy <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the United States Senate. During {{his inaugural}} campaign, his district was in economic malaise, and The New York Times {{described him as}} a John F. Kennedy throwback who campaigned on family values, patriotism, sports, and defense. Upon his election to the Congress {{in a class of}} sixty-two freshmen, he was one of six newcomers—along with Ronald Dellums, Bella Abzug, Louise Day Hicks, Robert Drinan, and Pete du Pont—discussed in Time. The article described him as a football fan like United States President Richard Nixon and as the recipient of advice from White House adviser Robert Finch and former Kemp boss Herb Klein, Nixon's director of communications. The Nixon aides encouraged Kemp to endorse the Cambodian invasion and to oppose criticism of Nixon's war policies in order to firm up Kemp's support from military hawks.|$|E

5|$|Themistocles {{probably}} turned 30 in 494BC, which qualified him {{to become}} an archon, the highest of the magistracies in Athens. On {{the back of his}} popularity, he evidently <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> this office and was elected Archon Eponymous, the highest government office in the following year (493BC). Themistocles's archonship saw the beginnings of a major theme in his career; the advancement of Athenian sea-power. Under his guidance, the Athenians began the building of a new port at Piraeus, to replace the existing facilities at Phalerum. Although further away from Athens, Piraeus offered three natural harbours, and could be easily fortified. Since Athens was to become an essentially maritime power during the 5th centuryBC, Themistocles's policies were to have huge significance for the future of Athens, and indeed Greece. In advancing naval power, Themistocles was probably advocating a course of action he thought essential for the long-term prospects of Athens. However, as Plutarch implies, since naval power relied on the mass mobilisation of the common citizens (thetes) as rowers, such a policy put more power into the hands of average Atheniansand thus into Themistocles's own hands.|$|E
5|$|Brown and Erie County Democratic Party {{chairman}} Leonard Lenihan were at odds over {{various political}} positions after Lenihan {{played a major}} role in Brown's election to the office of mayor. Brown supported Andrew Cuomo for New York Attorney General in the 2006 general election, David Paterson for Lieutenant Governor of New York in the 2006 general election and Antoine Thompson for 60th District New York Senator in a special election on February 28, 2006. Lenihan disagreed with each of these choices. Thompson had run Brown's last common council campaign, and Brown was upset that he did not get to select his successor in the 60th District. Many supporters considered boycotting the special election due to a perceived racial slight against an African American who seemed to be wrongfully shutout of the process. Lenihan pointed out that neither of the previous state senators turned mayor, Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, was granted the right to pick their successor, and he noted that Thompson had not been timely in entering the special election process. The Erie and Niagara County Democratic committees bypassed Thompson as their nominee in favor of Marc Coppola despite Brown's backing in the February special election. Thompson subsequently <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the New York Senate seat in the November general election.|$|E
