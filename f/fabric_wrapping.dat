40|$|AbstractFiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) as {{an external}} reinforcement is used extensively {{to enhance the}} strength requirement related to flexure and shear in structural systems. But the strengthening of members subjected to torsion {{is yet to be}} explored as Torsion failure is a brittle form of failure. In present experimental study deals with the torsional strengthening of Reinforced Concrete beams using epoxy bonded Fiber- Reinforced Polymer (FRP) fabric. Total Thirty nine rectangular beams of size 150 mm × 300 mm and 1200 in length are casted. Out of which, three beams are control beam and remaining thirty six beams are classified into two groups. One with CFRP <b>fabric</b> <b>wrapping</b> and another with GFRP <b>fabric</b> <b>wrapping.</b> With various wrapping patterns. The applied CFRP and GFRP configurations are U-jacketed, vertical strips with spacing, and edge strips along with vertical strips along its entire length. Torsional capacity of beams of two groups is compared with control specimen with respect to torsional moment, angle of twist and ductility factor and it was observed that CFRP fabric bonded beam shows more torsional strength than the GFRP bonded beam...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this test}} study was to achieve an in-situ {{strengthening}} technique to retrofit the deteriorated tall steel structures using carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP). A total of 20 structural steel channel sections with various retrofitting configurations were tested to arrive at an optimal strengthening technique to improve the buckling mode of failure of structural steel channel section under flexural loading. An approach of transforming the open cross section to closed cross section was used to increase the torsional resistance of channel sections. The various parameters such as type of CFRP <b>fabric,</b> <b>wrapping</b> configuration (skin and closed wrap) and number of CFRP layers were also included in this study. The {{results indicate that the}} closed wrapped configuration with an additional (final) layer of bi-directional CFRP fabric provides the higher strength and stiffness compared to control and skin wrapped specimen due to the confinement of hoop directional fibers. This study also proves that the lateral torsional buckling (LTB) mode of failure of open cross section specimens can be improved by appropriate CFRP strengthening techniques...|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of food quality and safety during {{short-term}} transport and storage in developing or rural areas, low-energy consumption and environmental-friendly methods are needed for use in cooling systems and related applications. In prior research, a new evaporative cooling system model using absorbent <b>fabric</b> <b>wrapping</b> in curtain structure on a scaffold for short-term transport and storage was built in a laboratory scale, {{and a series of}} laboratory scale experiments to statistically verify the basic concept of the new model were performed. Three kinds of absorbent fabric materials in common use were evaluated based on their water absorbent characteristic to decrease temperature and then to increase humidity, which contribute to keeping food and other products that require low temperature and high humidity to stay fresh longer. To gain an understanding of the mechanics for the fiber-based absorbent evaporative cooling, an in-depth study that results in the mathematical modeling of the heat and mass transfer that takes place during cooling for both single-scaffold structure and multi-scaffold structure was built. From that model we can calculate the heat transfer coefficient based on the fiber material, airflow speed and scaffold characteristics, to develop a methodology to predict the water consumption during cooling. To validate the fbaEC's cooling effects in a transport scenario, a series of experiments in a real transport environment was designed and conducted. The driving testing transport experiments were conducted in a moving vehicle at 15 mph, 30 mph and 45 mph, respectively. Cotton was the absorbent fiber material based on its cooling performance in prior laboratory experiments. Statistical analysis of the results showed a promising cooling performance for the fbaEC in a transport environment, with the lowest temperature generated at 17. 6 degrees Celcius while the environment temperature was 31. 9 degrees Celcius. The cooling efficiency was at 44. 48 percent without resorting to electricity, but only wind power. The contribution of this study is summarized, and the future study direction is also discussed.

40|$|Carbon FRP has {{recently}} {{being used as}} strengthening elements of reinforced concrete elements such as beams. Two sets of experiments was carried out to study the behaviour beams strengthened with FRP <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> and beams strengthened with FRP plates. The first set consists of 3 beams; a control beam, a beam reinforced with FRP plates, and a pre-cracked beam reinforced with FRP plates. Observations were made on the ultimate load capacity, load-deflection behaviour, crack pattern and propagation of tested beams. Ultimate load capacity of strengthened beams {{increased by more than}} 20 % when compared to control beam. Strengthened beams also exhibited improved load-deflection behaviour and crack pattern and propagation behaviour. The behaviour of the pre-cracked beam was almost the same as the uncracked beam. The second set of 3 beams was designed with no shear reinforcement so that the beams would fail in shear. Two of the beams were <b>wrapped</b> with FRP <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> while one acts as control. One of the wrapped beams was wrapped with one layer 90 o to the horizontal while the other was wrapped with two layers; one at 45 o and the other at â€“ 45 o to the horizontal. Load carrying capacity and load-deflection behaviour of all beams tested were observed. From the results of the experiments {{it can be seen that}} the load carrying capacity of the strengthened beams wrapped at 90 o to the horizontal almost doubled when compared while the other wrapped beam more than double its load carrying capacity. From the experiments, it is shown that both FRP plates and <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> strengthened beams that were misdesigned or damaged which should encourage their use it the repair of structural elements amongst practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) {{has become}} a very popular method of improving the capacity of structural elements. Failure of CFRP strengthening systems when applied to concrete structures is usually typified by de-lamination of the CFRP from the concrete substrate. Research has shown that anchoring {{the ends of the}} CFRP plates or sheets can result in a significantly higher load/stress being reached before de-bonding occurs and that when sufficiently anchored, the CFRP material strain at failure can approach its ultimate strain at rupture. The following is continuation of experimental studies into CFRP anchorage systems used to retrofit concrete structures. It follows from previous investigations conducted by the authors into the bond behaviour of a new anchorage system utilising a mechanically strengthened substrate. The paper presents two alternative anchorages; both utilising uni-directional <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> oriented horizontally across and parallel to the direction of the laminate.

Heavy-duty springs enclosed in a high strength <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> are secured to an anchor point on a wall or other rigid body. A rope connects these springs to a harness on the user via a pulley located above the user. In testing the system, a variety of ground and jumping skills were attempted on a snowboard. The system maintains an upward force on the user, which helps support the user on the ground, provides some lift during the takeoff, cushions the landing of a jump, and prevents the user from falling while attempting to learn new moves. This, in turn, increases the user's confidence and spatial awareness. Multiple applications for this system are discussed and future research directions and design iterations are suggested. These include various placement options for the existing system as well as ideas for making the support system mobile. by Philip Tyler Johnson. Thesis (S. B.)
