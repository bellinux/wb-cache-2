5|$|In {{terms of}} any {{acknowledgement}} of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of the}} other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.|$|E

25|$|The Book {{describes}} how {{after a long}} period of peace and prosperity, carelessness and excesses within the society make people forget self responsibility, and the need to follow or protect dharma. Infighting between good people begins, ultimately leading to the destruction of the Yadava dynasty. The end comes through a senseless but brutal internecine war, described as a drunken fight, which kills all the Yadavas along with Krishna's human form. The last chapter describes Krishna's ascent to Vaikuntha. Book eleven also includes the so-called Uddhava Gita, the last discourse of Krishna which <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> to Uddhava. Book 11 section 7-9 discusses the pastimes and realizations of an Avadhuta.|$|E

25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E

[...] On [...] "Palace", ASAP Rocky demonstrates alliterative lyricism and [...] cadence and flow. His flow patterns have been compared by writers to those of Cleveland-based hip hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times writes that [...] "his reserved, steely delivery owes equal debts to Houston's syrup daze and Dipset's uptown intensity". <b>He</b> <b>addresses</b> his rapping style on [...] "Purple Swag": [...] "I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow".

Gandhi encourages Munna to tell the truth about himself to Janhavi, but Munna resists this advice. With Gandhi's help, Munna succeeds in impressing Jahnavi and cultivates a new lifestyle based upon Gandhism. Munna starts to co-host a radio-show with Janhavi and Gandhi's image, guiding his audience to use Gandhigiri to solve everyday problems.|$|E

After the article appeared, the New York Times wrote that two of its three authors had worked as consultants for Pfizer, which at the time was preparing to launch UK-414,495, known as female Viagra. The journal's editor said that the failure to disclose the relationship with Pfizer was the journal's mistake.|$|E
500|$|The deeply {{political}} album expands on the socio-political musings of Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down. Cooder's forthright lyrics exhibit satire, dark humor, and bitter, apprehensive {{feelings about}} current events, including Guantanamo Bay, the Occupy movement, {{the shooting of}} Trayvon Martin, Barack Obama's plight as US President, and the election of 2012. <b>He</b> <b>addresses</b> these topics through song-form vignettes, which express his anti-Republican party perspective. Cooder's songwriting also reappropriates lyrics from older musical sources, including protest songs, broadside ballads, and country blues. Nick Coleman of The Independent describes it as [...] "heartfelt and unencumbered with musicological pedantry", while the newspaper's Andy Gill comments that Cooder [...] "employs demotic" [...] language and [...] "variations of the blues... to carry his broadsides." [...] Jeff Schwager of PopMatters cites Robert Johnson and Woody Guthrie as influences on Cooder's songcraft for the album.|$|E

500|$|The poem's seventy {{lines of}} blank verse are {{presented}} as a dramatic monologue. Scholars disagree on how Ulysses' speech functions in this format; {{it is not necessarily}} clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a soliloquy to a public address, as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, and then to relocate to the seashore where <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> his mariners. In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the second paragraph (33–43) about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a [...] "revised version [...] for public consumption": a [...] "savage race" [...] is revised to a [...] "rugged people".|$|E
500|$|Eddie escapes by {{transforming}} {{his face}} into that of the booking cop and knocking him out with {{a blow to the}} head. Mulder and Scully visit his father, who still has his tail and is a former circus performer. Mulder and Scully soon realize that he's actually Eddie when <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> Mulder by name without having been introduced. The agents give chase but Eddie escapes. He then transforms into one of the husbands of the women he had previously slept with and goes and hides out in their house. When the real husband comes home early, he next transforms into Mulder and leaves the couple seriously confused. Mulder and Scully meanwhile discover the dried up body of Eddie's actual father hidden up in the attic, thoroughly desiccated. Performing an autopsy on the body, Scully finds that he has an extra sheet of supple muscle under his skin, which Mulder believes Eddie also inherited and can use to transform his appearance.|$|E
500|$|Author Jonathan Gould {{describes}} [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] as [...] "a rueful {{rain check}} {{of a love}} song" [...] and [...] "an exercise in hypothetical romance". He comments that the melody's phrasing on the off-beat and the [...] "drastically arpeggiated" [...] bass line mirror the lyrical theme of [...] "right person at the wrong time". The lyrics reflect the influence of Bob Dylan, in terms of tone and content. Further to {{the message of the}} song title, Harrison offers his love only if he should happen to need [...] "someone", and on the condition that time allows for such a relationship, and he conveys his feelings in matter-of-fact terms. In Fontenot's description, the lyrics [...] "are representative of the change in the Beatles' outlook and also of its era: tender but ambivalent". Harrison invites the woman <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> to [...] "Carve your number on my wall", yet offers only the possibility that he will contact her in the future.|$|E

500|$|Modern productions, {{including}} those in an updated context, have been generally well received. Describing the 2004 Glyndebourne pairing with The Miserly Knight as [...] "flip {{sides of the same}} coin", reviewer Edward Seckerson in The Independent found the Schicchi performance [...] "a triumph of ensemble directing and playing, ... wickedly observed, sharp, focussed and funny". The New York Times gave a positive review to the Woody Allen 2008 production, which is set in a crowded tenement in which the boy Gherardino is practising knife thrusts. However, the critic questioned Allen's altered ending, in which Schicchi is stabbed by Zita as <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> the audience. Los Angeles Times critic Mark Swed deemed Allen's production one of the top ten moments in classical music for 2008, and applauded it for [...] "hilarious wit and engaging musicality". Allen Rich of Variety praised the piece, though he disliked Allen's idea of beginning the opera with a montage of old film clips, with credits featuring mock-Italian names.|$|E
500|$|On [...] "Daughters", Nas is bewildered at the {{responsibilities}} of fatherhood, as <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> his daughter's social networking activity and worries about his past undermining his parental authority. Killian Fox of The Observer writes that Nas' observations on his ex-wife's [...] "hefty childcare payments" [...] and his 18-year-old daughter [...] "dating unsuitable men" [...] are resonated by his [...] "recollections of his early years as a Queensbridge hustler – {{just the kind of}} unsuitable young man he's warning his daughter about these days". [...] "Reach Out" [...] features Mary J. Blige and incorporates the piano loop from Isaac Hayes' 1970 song [...] "Ike's Mood". Its lyrics address Nas' feeling displaced [...] "when you're too hood to be in the Hollywood circles, you're too rich to be in the hood that birthed you". [...] "You Wouldn't Understand" [...] addresses life struggles and features a mellow production and neo soul influences. [...] "Back When" [...] has flickering production and mytholigizing lyrics by Nas: [...] "check out the oracle bred by city housing".|$|E
500|$|Chapter three {{considers}} utilitarianism, {{according to}} which the rightness or wrongness of an action {{is determined by the}} extent to which it promotes utility—a concept equated, by classical utilitarians, with pleasure. As a political theory, then, classical utilitarianism entails that [...] "it is the obligation of political communities to formulate policies and institutions which promote pleasure". Utilitarianism as a whole, Cochrane argues, posed a challenge to the medieval and early modern assumption that animals are owed nothing. Its focus on welfare and sentience, and its egalitarian nature, allow the extension of justice to animals. The ideas of Peter Singer are outlined. Cochrane then defends Singer's account both against those presenting arguments in defence of speciesism, and against critics (such as R. G. Frey) who maintain that animals do not have interests. He then considers utilitarian critics of Singer, who argue that meat-eating maximises utility, even when animal interests are taken into account. This leads to the criticism that judging the best consequences is an extremely difficult task for political communities, but Cochrane concludes that a utilitarian consensus does at least support the abolition of factory farming. Finally, <b>he</b> <b>addresses</b> critics who argue that Singer's position offers insufficient protection for animals. Martha Nussbaum's argument that animals can suffer unfelt harms is considered, as is Tom Regan's criticism that, under Singer's account, animals are protected only insofar as their protection maximises welfare, rather than in their own right.|$|E
