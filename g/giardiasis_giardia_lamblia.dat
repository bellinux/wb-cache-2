40|$|The causative {{agent of}} <b>giardiasis,</b> <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia,</b> is a flagellated {{protozoa}} parasite that inhabits the upper small intestine of ver-tebrate hosts. Neonatal giardiasis is very rare. The {{aim of this}} re-port was to present one such case. A female, 20 -day-old newborn was admitted {{with a history of}} diarrhea with frequent mucous and bloody stools. The diagnosis of giardiasis was established due to the detection of trophozoites and cysts in a stool sample. The patient was treated with metronidazole. The newborn reco-vered quickly and her stool examination was negative on three occasions. Adequate nutrition and hydration are important featu-res in clinical treatment of giardiasis. Early diagnosis, evaluation and treatment can lead to healing without complications...|$|E
40|$|The {{lack of a}} quick, simple, and {{inexpensive}} diagnostic test has limited the ability of public health officials to rapidly assess and control outbreaks of Giardia lamblia in child day-care centers. We evaluated {{the performance of a}} commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of a G. lamblia-associated antigen in stool. Stool specimens were collected from the diapers of 426 children attending 20 day-care centers, fixed in 10 % Formalin and polyvinyl alcohol, and examined by microscopy by Formalin concentration and trichrome staining techniques. Specimens were also tested visually and spectrophotometri-cally by ELISA. Of 99 tests positive by microscopy, 93 were visually positive by ELISA (sensitivity, 93. 9 %). Of 534 tests negative for G. lamblia by microscopy, 32 (6. 0 %) were ELISA positive. However, on the basis of examination of multiple specimens from the same child, none of these could be considered false-positive ELISAs; the specfficity of the ELISA was therefore 100 %. The sensitivity of both microscopy and ELISA improved as the number of specimens per child increased. An optical density value of> 0. 040 was 98. 0 % sensitive and 100 % specific for G. lamblia. This ELISA, which appeared to be more sensitive for G. lamblia than did microscopic examination of stool, should be useful as an epidemiologic tool, particularly in day-care settings, and may also have a role in confirming clinical diagnoses of <b>giardiasis.</b> <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> is endemic in child day-care center...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{identify}} the frequencies (F) of ferredoxin and nitroreductase mutations on Iranian clinical isolates of <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> {{in order to}} predict whether the nitazoxanide can be prescribed as suitable drug for symptomatic to metronidazole-resistant <b>giardiasis.</b> MethodsForty <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> isolates as of 38 symptomatic and two metronidazole-resistant patients were collected from Iran. DNAs were extracted and amplified by targeting ferredoxin and GlNR genes. The amplicons were directly sequenced to determine gene mutations. ResultsThe various amino acid substitutions (F: 20 %, Haplotype diversity: 0. 891, Tajima's D: − 0. 44013) were identified by analyzing ferredoxin gene in four symptomatic and two resistant isolates. Only two haplotypes (F: 5 %, HD: 0. 345; Tajima's D: 0. 77815) characterized in metronidazole-resistant isolates of GlNR, however, no point mutations was found in symptomatic isolates. ConclusionsNon-synonymous mutations of ferredoxin oxidoreductase gene reduce translational regulatory protein's binding affinity which concludes reduction of ferredoxin expression and its activity. This leads to decrease in metronidazole drug delivery into the cells. Mutations in these isolates may lead to their resistance to metronidazole. No to low synonymous mutations of GlNR demonstrates that nitazoxanide can be prescribed as promising alternative treatment for symptomatic to metronidazole-resistant giardiasis in Iranian clinical isolates...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Giardiasis,</b> or <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> infection, is {{the most}} common {{parasitosis}} of the human digestive tract. It is highly contagious and mostly occurs in warm climates. Children are especially susceptible to infection. MICROBIOLOGICAL FEATURES: The infection can sporadically occur anywhere and waterborne outbreaks have been reported in some countries. Hence, the prevention of giardiasis depends on proper sanitation. Once ingested through contaminated water, Giardia cysts adhere to the intestinal surface. The parasite feeds on the mucous secretions of the intestine and may produce severe infections which can interfere with nutrient absorption. Symptoms in affected individuals usually include diarrhoea, dehydration, stomach cramps, gas, and weight loss. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on the detection of cysts in fecal samples. Treatment includes the use of metronidazole and other drugs that are effective in clearing the infection within a few days. CASE REPORT: We report the recent case of a patient with Giardiasis who received dental hygiene procedures and discuss the interventions required in consideration of the patient's concomitant heart condition.

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the prevalence of <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> infection in children < 5 years old and calves. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) has been used for the detection of <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia.</b> A total of 266 children and 15 calves diarrheic fecal samples were tested for <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> during January 2011 to May 2012. The prevalence of <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> infection among children was 3. 8 % while 13. 3 % in calves. <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> was highest in children between 24 and 60 months of age (8. 7 %). <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> infection was higher in male (4. 7 %) than in female (2. 0 %). Male calves (14. 3 %) have slightly higher prevalence than female calves (12. 5 %). The highest prevalence (33. 3 %) of <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> infection in calves was between the ages 6 and 9 months.

40|$|Infections with <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{intestinal}} maladies in the world. These infections can lead to acute diarrhea, cramps, and nausea, although asymptomatic infections are the most common. Although most infections are controlled by an effective immune response, some individuals develop chronic disease. The effects of <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> infection on D-glucose uptake and brush border enzymes was studied in ethanol fed sheep. <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> trophozoite counts were significantly lower in the intestine of ethanol fed sheep than in the controls. Also sodium dependant uptake of D-glucose and brush border enzymes was significantly reduced in the <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> infected sheep intestine. There was no change in sodium dependent D-glucose transporter (SGLT- 1) and brush border lactase was reduced in <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> infected sheep compared with those of controls. However, the mRNA levels encoding these proteins in ethanol fed animals and control animals were in the sheep intestine.

Given the random- effects model, the prevalence of <b>Giardia</b> <b>lamblia</b> in Iran was estimated to be 14. 7 % (95 % reliability distance, 12. 0 %- 16. 6 %).
