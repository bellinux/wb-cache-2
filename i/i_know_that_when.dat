So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
2500|$|Winchester never married, {{although}} {{former student}} Ross E. Price maintains {{that she was}} engaged to Ernest W. Perry, {{the dean of the}} Pentecostal Collegiate Institute (PCI), who drowned on Sunday November 23, 1902 before their engagement had been made public. Price claimed that [...] "I know I am right that she was engaged to the young man. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he drowned she then decided never to marry but to give herself to teaching." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Richard Nixon did not {{publicly}} {{comment about the}} decision. In private conversation later revealed {{as part of the}} Nixon tapes, Nixon said [...] "There are times when an abortion is necessary, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> you have a black and a white" [...] (a reference to interracial pregnancies) [...] "or a rape." [...] However, Nixon was also concerned that greater access to abortions would foster [...] "permissiveness," [...] and said that [...] "it breaks the family." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{she broke}} the silence she would begin with, [...] "Well, my dear!" [...] and this was what she did. She added, [...] "I hope you're {{convinced}} NOW!" ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the request}} of his father Richard Neumann, Trude's son (Herzl's only grandchild), Stephan Theodor Neumann, (1918–1946) was sent for his safety to England in 1935 to the Viennese Zionists and the Zionist Executive in Israel based there [...] The Neumanns deeply feared {{for the safety of}} their only child as violent Austrian {{antisemitism}} expanded. In England he read extensively about his grandfather. [...] Zionism had not been a significant part of his background in Austria, but Stephan became an ardent Zionist, was the only descendant of Theodor Herzl to have become one. Anglicizing his name to Stephen Norman, during World War II, Norman enlisted in the British Army rising to the rank of Captain in the Royal Artillery. [...] In late 1945 and early 1946 he took the opportunity to visit the British Mandate of Palestine [...] "to see what my grandfather had started." [...] He wrote in his diary extensively about his trip. [...] What most impressed him was the [...] "look of freedom" [...] on the faces of the children, which were not like the sallow look of those from the concentration camps of Europe. He wrote upon leaving Israel, [...] "My visit to Israel is over ... It is said that to go away is to die a little. [...] And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I went away from Erez Israel, I died a little. [...] But sure, then, to return is somehow to be reborn. [...] And I will return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> <b>When</b> I was a {{youth in}} a Western village I became {{in some way}} the {{possessor}} of two small photographs of Elsie Melville. She was my ideal till I saw her, fifteen years later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... and perhaps, dear fellow, it was chiefly for my sake that he {{was willing}} to live. At least, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the worst was over, he {{announced}} it by putting those wasted fingers into mine, and saying - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is very eloquent," [...] said Gertrude; [...] "but {{he has no}} {{brilliant}} imagery. I {{have heard}} him talk a great deal. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they saw us they would not come over here." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{will not}} {{hesitate}} to state that I was nearly stunned by Mr. Aaron Woodward's unexpected statement. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he announced <b>that</b> I was a worse villain than my father he meant a good deal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{understand}} you," [...] he said. [...] "And {{believe me}} in this--I would not for worlds encroach on your kindness. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> pressed your hand that night, I pressed {{the hand of}} a friend,--and nothing more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{felt that}} it would not do, Oswald. The thing is too strong for me and, however I might strive, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the temptation came I should break out again; and so, I held my peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are right," [...] Simon agreed. [...] "Your men are {{too good to be}} wasted in {{desultory}} fighting. They shall be kept as a last resource; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> the time comes, they can be relied upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, was it ten guineas a head? I'll guess any sum you please," [...] replied Mr. Eglantine: [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you NOBS are together, {{you don't}} spare your money. I myself, at the [...] "Star and Garter" [...] at Richmond, once paid--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{she used}} to pretend she did not believe you would. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> better. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> she said, over and over again, 'Is my father never coming for me?' she was {{thinking}} of somebody else. And are you come to take her away?" ...|$|R
60|$|And she did {{sleep until}} {{we reached the}} city. It was about seven o'clock in the morning, I think, when we began to steam slowly by the wharves and piers. I now wished the city were twenty miles further on. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we stopped <b>I</b> should have to wake up poor Corny.|$|R
2500|$|.....Terence was {{the best}} player, {{one of only two}} geniuses <b>I</b> have <b>known.</b> The other was Lasker, the chess player. Terence was not a slow player but {{occasionally}} he went into a trance. I didn't mind and could sit there and wait. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he eventually played a card it would be the right one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I know {{something}} about yours, Mr Whittlestaff. I know where you have set your wishes. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a man has {{made up his mind}} in such an affair as this, he shouldn't give way to any young diamond dealer of them all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Dora, {{slowly and}} decisively, {{as if she}} had fully {{considered}} the matter, [...] "that you may as well go on, for I don't suppose it would do to disturb Mr. Haverley now. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> people are making hay, they can't stop for anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} {{soldiers}} nearabout New Orleans, therefore do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> foragers go out they take with them huge wagons {{to bring back}} such as may be found. Those who have just passed are empty-handed, save for muskets, and never one of them carried his full complement of accoutrements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} beg my pardon, Mistress Nellie. No doubt {{you thought it}} churlish on my part to refuse to gratify your curiosity, and I am not {{surprised}} that you took offence. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you learned {{how important it was}} to keep silence over the matter, that you would acquit me of the intention of making a mystery about nothing." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{thing about}} rock'n'roll {{is that for}} me anyway it wasn't enough... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms... but the songs weren't serious or didn't reflect life in a {{realistic}} way. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got into folk music, {{it was more of}} a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks! Now {{we shall}} get on happily. I don't ask or expect the old life--that is impossible. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> lovers came, the friend {{would fall into}} the background; and I am content to be second, where I have so long been first. Do not think you neglect me; be happy with your lover, dear, {{and when you have}} no pleasanter amusement, come and see old Maurice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} would not have grumbled anyhow," [...] Wilfrid laughed; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> one is {{carrying}} anyone the weight at the head is more than double the weight at the feet, and that was divided between them, while you had the heavy end all to yourself. And how is Sampson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm blessed if I do. I {{know how}} it ought to go on. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{large sums of money}} are {{supposed}} to be concerned, the young man should speak to the father before he speaks to the girl. He's a fool if he don't, if he wants to get the father's money. So she has given you a promise?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Major Jones," [...] he said, [...] "you ask me be merciful. You {{appeal to}} my pity. For such as you I have no pity, nor have I ever shown any mercy. You know very well, and <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> once {{the hand of}} the law touches your shoulder, it will not be only a charge o' {{blackmail}} which the police will bring against you!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{day after}} the {{election}} Fleck stated [...] "I am gay. I don't wear it on my sleeve, it doesn't define who I am, and quite frankly it's the least interesting part about me … Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came out this race would be nothing more, nothing less than whether my constituency could wrap their mind around the fact that I was a gay man. People fear that which is different." ...|$|R
6000|$|He bore his own trouble so bravely that {{my heart}} bled for him. I saw the {{manuscript}} in his hand, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{he read it}} he would realize how much <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> so <b>I</b> said to him, [...] "I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You will <b>know</b> later why <b>I</b> speak." ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. Well, all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{told her}} the mine was {{probably}} a frost she went for me like steam.|$|R
60|$|I cannot call to mind {{where or}} when, in my childhood, I {{had seen a}} stained glass window in a church. Nor do I {{recollect}} its subject. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I saw her turn round, in the grave light of the old staircase, and wait for us, above, I thought of that window; and I associated something of its tranquil brightness with Agnes Wickfield ever afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|Upon hearing {{these words}} the dwarf skipped quickly out, and the Dryad entered {{the tree and}} pulled the door shut after her. [...] "Now, then," [...] she said to herself, [...] "he can break off the key if he likes. It does not matter to me. Another will grow out next spring. And {{although}} the good piper made me no promise, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the warm days arrive next year he will come and let me out again." ...|$|E
60|$|England enjoys {{every one}} of these {{advantages}} for enriching a Nation, which I have above enumerated, and into the bargain, a good million returned to them every year without labour or hazard, or one farthing value received on our side. But how long we shall be able to continue the payment, I am not under the least concern. One thing <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the hen is starved to death, {{there will be no more}} golden eggs.|$|E
6000|$|... "So had I, sir," [...] {{the mate}} replied. [...] "I was praying {{all the time}} that the wind would keep a bit to the west of north, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> it began our {{position}} was, as near as may be, due north of them. I guessed what you were thinking of when you told the man at the wheel to edge away to the east as much as he dared, though that was mighty little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Barker, with {{an eager}} smile, [...] "but you SOLD at his figures, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found <b>that</b> YOU, my old partner, was in it; don't you see, I {{preferred}} {{to buy it}} through your bank, and did at 110. Of course, you wouldn't have sold it at that figure if it wasn't worth it then, and neither I nor you are to blame if it dropped the next week to 60, don't you see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she mocked. [...] "You can {{remember}} my name, then? Douglas, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{you were a}} bad man. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you told me how you meant to cheat your creditors, how you meant to escape over here on the pretext of business, and bring all the money you could scrape together. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> and yet <b>I</b> was willing to come with you, and I should have come. But {{there was one thing}} I didn't reckon upon. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you had the heart or the courage to be a murderer!" ...|$|R
