On 2 January 1806 {{she and the}} brig-sloop , (or Wolfe), Captain George Charles Mackenzie, {{captured}} the French privateer schooners Régulateur and Napoléon in Port Azarades, Cuba. The port was protected by a double reef of rocks so Hall sent the master of Malabar in a boat to find a passage. Once a passage was found, rather than <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> capture the vessels, Wolfe came in, but stopped {{about a quarter of}} a mile away. She then engaged the privateers for almost two hours until their crews abandoned their ships, landed and escaped into the woods. Then Wolfe and Malabar sent in their boats to take possession.|$|E
25|$|Hard {{times and}} new ideas have hit Elyria as the 2000s and 2010s rolled on, as {{industries}} such as Bendix, Riddell, and 3M are taking their business elsewhere, outside the city. To prepare for this hit, in March 2016, voters passed Issue 6, which was a 0.5% increase on the city's income tax, which was passed to pay for police expenses, {{as well as other}} things such as parks and Fiberoptic Internet throughout the city. With the Reconstruction of State Route 57 on the city's Northwest Side by Midway Mall, traffic flow has been greatly improved and there are minor revivals in the area such as new hotels and even hopes that a buyer will revitalize the area, with plans having even been presented. Revitalization efforts for Downtown Elyria continue through the efforts of groups such as Invest Elyria, Main Street Elyria, and in general the citizens. The historic Lorain County Courthouse is also being renovated to suit it for use once again, and a few buildings are even being reconstructed, and a few new ones also being constructed. There are plans for multiple small businesses and restaurants to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the downtown area {{over the next few years}} as of April 2017, and the city is showing signs of hope and revival, as its residents give the effort to restore the city to its peak days of the early to mid-1900's. In 2017, Elyria will celebrate its 200th Birthday, and many events and plans have been put forward in light of the city's Bicentennial Celebration.|$|E
500|$|As it {{approaches}} Earth, the Enterprise receives {{no response from}} Starfleet Command. Eventually, a transmission is received from a trio of Starfleet admirals: Savar (Henry Darrow), Arron (Ray Reinhardt) and Quinn (Ward Costello), {{an old friend of}} Picard's who recently made an inspection of the Enterprise (in [...] ""). They are surprised by the Enterprises presence, but invite Captain Picard and Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) to dinner. Quinn requests to beam aboard the Enterprise for a tour. Captain Picard recalls being warned by Quinn about some kind of threat to Starfleet when the admiral was last aboard. Upon Quinn's arrival, Picard discusses matters with him and Quinn seems strangely evasive; Picard comes to believe that he is an impostor, or under some sort of alien influence. After warning Riker of his concerns and asking him to watch Quinn, the captain beams down to Starfleet headquarters to attend the dinner. On arrival, Picard is greeted by the other two Admirals who are accompanied by Quinn's assistant, Lt. Commander Remmick (Robert Schenkkan). Meanwhile, Riker visits Quinn's quarters on the Enterprise and questions him about what he has in the small box he brought with him. Quinn tells Riker of a superior life form within the box. Riker attempts to leave but Quinn throws Riker across the room. A security team arrives to subdue Quinn, who is able to withstand a great amount of phaser-fire before he collapses. The ship's chief medical officer, Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), finds a small protrusion {{on the back of his}} neck. She discovers that a bug-like parasite has latched itself onto Quinn's brain and is controlling him. Dr. Crusher warns Picard of this incident when he contacts the ship in private. He is advised that the infected person can only be stopped by a phaser set to 'kill': the captain points out that he is unarmed. He then has no choice but to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> dinner with his three superiors.|$|E

500|$|Marceline is {{voiced by}} Olivia Olson. Olivia's father Martin Olson was an {{acquaintance}} of Ward, and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted [...] "her as a voice" [...] on his show. She had originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Princess Bubblegum. After her initial audition, she was asked to read for the role of Marceline, and was [...] "definitely impressed by the character" [...] after seeing design drawings. Martin Olson later noted that Olivia's audition was a [...] "sham" [...] to please the network executives because Ward had already wanted her to be a voice on the show. In order to get into character, Olson often dresses {{in a manner similar to}} Marceline when she records her lines; she explained, [...] "I always find ... that on the days that I <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> record Marceline, I’ll dress like her, in a weird way ... I’ll throw on some rock n’ roll boots, maybe some red lipstick, and just go in there." [...] Olson also is the character's singing voice. According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez, composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series. Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company. For instance, Rob Sugar—the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar—often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca. Furthermore, Frederator also posted demos, as well as a full version of the popular [...] "Fry Song", sung by Marceline in the episode [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere", on its official blog. In flashback sequences, younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres. In the fifth season episodes [...] "Finn the Human" [...] / [...] "Jake the Dog", an older, alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman. Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline's demonic father Hunson Abadeer. Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was [...] "pretty cool”.|$|E

Mainwaring declared that the new terms of employment were [...] "absolutely preposterous" [...] and threatened to lead a strike. However, after lengthy negotiations, the South Wales miners agreed to work under the new terms [...] "under protest". Communists picketed the Lewis Merthyr colliery at Trehafod in Rhondda, and {{nearly half of the}} men did not <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|E

Every other album has been recorded quite traditionally. We write a bunch of songs, play them live a bunch of times and then <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> studio and bash them out in a few weeks. This time round we had barely played the songs live, we wrote {{a few of them}} in the studio and we really used the studio as an instrument.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the road}} race the {{following}} year, no women's event was held, which led the 2008 Olympic Champion Nicole Cooke to accuse the organisers of sexism. 2010 World Time Trial Champion Emma Pooley was also disappointed, stating [...] "How much extra effort would <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> {{putting on a}} women's race? I'm sorry, {{but we have a}} sport as well, it kind of annoys me every time." [...] To remedy the lack of racing on the course Cooke and Lizzie Armitstead followed the race in the team cars to survey the course.|$|E

In a press release, Hoppus and Barker said, [...] "We were all set to play this festival and record a new album and Tom kept putting it off without reason.

2500|$|The Jerusalem Talmud found {{support in}} [...] for the {{proposition}} in a Baraita that one who dies before age 50 has died a death of karet, of {{being cut off}} from the Jewish people. The Gemara there noted that [...] spoke of what the Kohathites should avoid doing so [...] "that they may live, and not die." [...] And [...] enjoined that [...] "they shall not <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see the holy things as they are being covered, lest they die." [...] And since [...] indicates that the Kohathites ceased working near the holy things at age 50, these deaths of karet would have to have occurred before the age of 50. The Babylonian Talmud reports that Rabbah said that deaths between the ages of 50 and 60 are also deaths by karet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{opinions}} of Socrates {{in any given}} dialog not only often contradict conventional morality, they also contradict his own previous opinions. For example, in the Apology, Socrates praises [...] "the son of Thetis" [...] (Achilles) for making light of death {{because he was so}} obsessed with getting revenge on Hector for killing Patroclus. In this scene, Achilles does not <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> fight, but agrees to his mother's command that he wait until she gets special battle gear made for him. Socrates invocation of Achilles as a model for his own fearlessness is misplaced because Achilles is a coward in the scene. [...] In the Republic Socrates has a different opinion of Achilles. [...] He calls him emotionally overwrought, and greedy (for taking bribes—which, according to Homer, he did not do). [...] Socrates famously argues that the Iliad needs to be rewritten.|$|E

[...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start {{at the top of your}} head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle?

[...] "Not {{only did it}} endanger the lives of divers who would risk going farther than they should," [...] said Sorenson, who was by then even more firmly convinced that their son had not died in the cave, [...] "it put {{all of our lives}} at risk because we have to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> recover the bodies." [...] By that time the McDaniels had also come to believe that, if he had not died in the cave, Ben had been murdered. A phone tip line they set up had not received any calls, and no one who had not yet said anything was likely to be further motivated to do so, they said. (Ben's father elaborated the following year that the family was told to rescind the reward while in the Vortex Spring area for exactly this reason).|$|E

[...] She said those sessions would help the elderly learn how to [...] "decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest or in your family's best interest and cut your life short." [...] As The New York Times mentioned, conservative pundits were comparing the Nazi T4 euthanasia program to Obama’s policies {{as far back as}} November 2008, calling them [...] "America's T4 program—trivialization of abortion, acceptance of euthanasia, and the normalization of physician assisted suicide." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} [...] , and [...] say that Levites [...] "30 {{years old and}} upward" [...] did service in the tent of meeting, while [...] says, [...] "from 25 years old and upward they shall <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> perform the service {{in the work of}} the tent of meeting." [...] The Midrash deduced that the {{difference}} teaches that all those five years, from the age of 25 to the age of 30, Levites served apprenticeships, and from that time onward they were allowed to draw near to do service. The Midrash concluded that a Levite could not enter the Temple courtyard to do service unless he had served an apprenticeship of five years. And the Midrash inferred from this that students who see no sign of success in their studies within a period of five years will never see any. Rabbi Jose said that students had to see success within three years, basing his position on the words [...] "that they should be nourished three years" [...] in ...|$|E
