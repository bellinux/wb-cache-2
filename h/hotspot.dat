5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the <b>hotspot</b> {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the <b>hotspot.</b> The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the <b>hotspot,</b> particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the <b>hotspot</b> strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea {{has been}} created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian <b>hotspot</b> in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle.

5|$|Mauna Loa has {{probably}} been erupting for at least 700,000years, and may have emerged above sea level about 400,000years ago. The oldest-known dated rocks are not older than 200,000years. The volcano's magma comes from the Hawaii <b>hotspot,</b> which {{has been responsible for}} the creation of the Hawaiian island chain over tens of millions of years. The slow drift of the Pacific Plate will eventually carry Mauna Loa away from the <b>hotspot</b> within 500,000 to one million years from now, at which point it will become extinct.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaii <b>hotspot</b> is a {{volcanic}} <b>hotspot</b> {{located near the}} namesake Hawaiian Islands, in the northern Pacific Ocean. One of the most well-known and heavily studied hotspots in the world, the Hawaii plume {{is responsible for the}} creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of volcanoes over 5,800 kilometres (3,600mi) long. Four of these volcanoes are active, two are dormant, and more than 123 are extinct, many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls. The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii {{to the edge of the}} Aleutian Trench, near the eastern edge of Russia. While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Hawaii <b>hotspot</b> is located far from plate boundaries. The classic <b>hotspot</b> theory, first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson, proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years. According to this theory, the nearly 60° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate. In 2003, fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile <b>hotspot</b> theory, suggesting that hotspots are mobile, not fixed, and that the 47-million-year-old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot's motion rather than the plate's.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to rescue the history of <b>hotspots</b> in the state of Minas Gerais during the years of 1999 to 2009 for an {{exploratory}} data analysis. Through temporal analysis, we proceeded an analysis of the months and years where foci have been more frequent and of the critical period of occurrence of <b>hotspots.</b> The analysis considered the spatial frequency and the density of <b>hotspots</b> in the State Forestry Institute (IEF) nuclei. In the case of conservation units, it was also analyzed the annual recurrence. In total, 67, 334 <b>hotspots</b> were detected in MG during the period from 1999 to 2009. Temporal analysis revealed that the year 2003 had the highest frequency, totaling 10, 929 hotspots; the year 2009, in turn, had only 2, 378 spots. October was the month with the largest frequency, with 24, 149 of <b>hotspots</b> recorded. Nuclei with higher frequency, higher density and higher recurrence of <b>hotspots</b> in the case of conservation units, present the worst scenario, being considered as the most critical <b>hotspots.</b> However, low frequency of <b>hotspots</b> and high density are also indicatives of critical areas. In areas of high frequency of <b>hotspots</b> and low density, the size of the area directly influenced the high incidence of active <b>hotspots.</b> In these areas it is suggested an analysis of spatial distribution to check if <b>hotspots</b> are concentrated or sparse. The best scenario presented here is low frequency and low density of <b>hotspots...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{existence}} of an Anahim <b>hotspot</b> was supported in a detailed Bulletin of Volcanology report by Kuehn et al. (2015). This included new geochemical and geochronometric data for the Baldface Mountain and Satah Mountain volcanic fields, {{as well as for}} Nazko Cone. The data obtained indicated that volcanism in the two volcanic fields were contemporaneous with the Itcha Range shield volcano and that both fields agree with the vector of the North American Plate motion over a <b>hotspot</b> in the British Columbia Interior. It was also noted that the trace and rare-earth element patterns of mafic lavas in the Anahim Volcanic Belt are similar to ocean island basalts, providing more evidence for a <b>hotspot.</b>|$|E

We apply the method to data from 89 genes sequenced in African American and European American populations.

Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000years ago, and is currently dormant. Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit.

40|$|Abstract The {{regulatory}} mechanism of recombination {{is a fundamental}} problem in genomics, with wide applications in genome-wide association studies, birth-defect diseases, molecular evolution, cancer research, etc. In mammalian genomes, recombination events cluster into short genomic regions called "recombination hotspots". Recently, a 13 -mer motif enriched in <b>hotspots</b> is identified as a candidate cis-regulatory element of human recombination hotspots; moreover, a zinc finger protein, PRDM 9, binds to this motif and is associated with variation of recombination phenotype in human and mouse genomes, thus is a trans-acting regulator of recombination <b>hotspots.</b> However, this pair of cis and trans-regulators covers {{only a fraction of}} <b>hotspots,</b> thus other regulators of recombination <b>hotspots</b> remain to be discovered. In this paper, we propose an approach to predicting additional trans-regulators from DNA-binding proteins by comparing their enrichment of binding sites in <b>hotspots.</b> Applying this approach on newly mapped mouse <b>hotspots</b> genome-wide, we confirmed that PRDM 9 is a major trans-regulator of <b>hotspots.</b> In addition, a list of top candidate trans-regulators of mouse <b>hotspots</b> is reported. Using GO analysis we observed that the top genes are enriched with function of histone modification, highlighting the epigenetic {{regulatory mechanism}}s of recombination <b>hotspots.</b> </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of mutational <b>hotspots</b> within the genome {{gives rise to}} recurrent evolution. <b>Hotspots</b> can arise at certain nucleotide sequences because of interactions between the DNA and DNA repair, replication, and modification enzymes.

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>hotspots</b> in Sumatra {{continued}} to decrease on 27 June, with 42 <b>hotspots</b> recorded at 4pm. At {{the same time}} on 28 June, only 15 <b>hotspots</b> were detected by satellites. Singapore's National Environment Agency said {{that this could be}} the reason for the improving haze conditions in Singapore and Malaysia over the past week. The number of <b>hotspots</b> decreased further to just 7 on 29 June.|$|R
5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim <b>hotspot</b> is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E

40|$|Meiotic {{recombination}} is {{initiated by}} DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) made by Spo 11 (Rec 12 in fission yeast), which becomes covalently {{linked to the}} DSB ends. Like recombination events, DSBs occur at <b>hotspots</b> in the genome, but the genetic factors responsible for most <b>hotspots</b> have remained elusive. Here we describe in fission yeast the genome-wide distribution of meiosis-specific Rec 12 -DNA linkages, which closely parallel DSBs measured by conventional Southern blot hybridization. Prominent DSB <b>hotspots</b> are located ∼ 65 kb apart, separated by intervals {{with little or no}} detectable breakage. Most <b>hotspots</b> lie within exceptionally large intergenic regions. Thus, the chromosomal architecture responsible for <b>hotspots</b> in fission yeast is markedly different from that of budding yeast, in which DSB <b>hotspots</b> are much more closely spaced and, in many regions of the genome, occur at each promoter. Our analysis in fission yeast reveals a clearly identifiable chromosomal feature that can predict the majority of recombination <b>hotspots</b> across a whole genome and provides a basis for searching for the chromosomal features that dictate <b>hotspots</b> of meiotic recombination in other organisms, including humans...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMutation <b>hotspots</b> and showers occur across {{phylogeny}} and profoundly influence genome evolution, yet {{the mechanisms}} that produce <b>hotspots</b> remain obscure. We report that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) provoke mutation <b>hotspots</b> via stress-induced mutation in Escherichia coli. With tet reporters placed 2 kb to 2 Mb (half the genome) {{away from an}} I-SceI site, RpoS/DinB-dependent mutations occur maximally within the first 2 kb and decrease logarithmically to ∼ 60 kb. A weak mutation tail extends to 1 Mb. <b>Hotspotting</b> occurs independently of I-site/tet-reporter-pair position in the genome, upstream and downstream in the replication path. RecD, which allows RecBCD DSB-exonuclease activity, is required for strong local but not long-distance <b>hotspotting,</b> indicating that double-strand resection and gap-filling synthesis underlie local <b>hotspotting,</b> and newly illuminating DSB resection in vivo. <b>Hotspotting</b> near DSBs opens the possibility that specific genomic regions could be targeted for mutagenesis, and could also promote concerted evolution (coincident mutations) within genes/gene clusters, an important issue {{in the evolution of}} protein functions...|$|R
5|$|Hume has {{suggested}} that the Mascarene parrots have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean.

5|$|In 1987, Canadian {{volcanologist}} Catherine Hickson {{revealed that}} the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field {{is not part of}} the Anahim Volcanic Belt, but rather a separate centre that most likely represents an area of lithospheric decompression melting caused by rifting along pre-existing crustal fractures.

40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} often demonstrate {{heterogeneity of}} transmission among host populations. This heterogeneity reduces {{the efficacy of}} control strategies, but also implies that focusing control strategies on "hotspots" of transmission could be highly effective. In order to identify <b>hotspots</b> of malaria transmission, we analysed longitudinal data on febrile malaria episodes, asymptomatic parasitaemia, and antibody titres over 12 y from 256 homesteads in three study areas in Kilifi District on the Kenyan coast. We examined heterogeneity by homestead, and identified groups of homesteads that formed <b>hotspots</b> using a spatial scan statistic. Two types of statistically significant <b>hotspots</b> were detected; stable <b>hotspots</b> of asymptomatic parasitaemia and unstable <b>hotspots</b> of febrile malaria. The stable <b>hotspots</b> were associated with higher average AMA- 1 antibody titres than the unstable clusters (optical density [OD] = 1. 24, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02 - 1. 47 versus OD = 1. 1, 95 % CI 0. 88 - 1. 33) and lower mean ages of febrile malaria episodes (5. 8 y, 95 % CI 5. 6 - 6. 0 versus 5. 91 y, 95 % CI 5. 7 - 6. 1). A falling gradient of febrile malaria incidence was identified in the penumbrae of both <b>hotspots.</b> <b>Hotspots</b> were associated with AMA- 1 titres, but not seroconversion rates. In order to target control measures, homesteads at risk of febrile malaria could be predicted by identifying the 20 % of homesteads that experienced an episode of febrile malaria during one month in the dry season. That 20 % subsequently experienced 65 % of all febrile malaria episodes during the following year. A definition based on remote sensing data was 81 % sensitive and 63 % specific for the stable <b>hotspots</b> of asymptomatic malaria. <b>Hotspots</b> of asymptomatic parasitaemia are stable over time, but <b>hotspots</b> of febrile malaria are unstable. This finding may be because immunity offsets {{the high rate of}} febrile malaria that might otherwise result in stable <b>hotspots,</b> whereas unstable <b>hotspots</b> necessarily affect a population with less prior exposure to malaria...|$|R
