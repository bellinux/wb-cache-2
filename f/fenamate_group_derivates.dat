40|$|N-(p-amylcinnamoyl) {{anthranilic acid}} (ACA), a {{phospholipase}} A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibitor, is structurally-related to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of the <b>fenamate</b> <b>group</b> {{and may also}} modulate various ion channels. We used the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique at room temperature to investigate the effects of ACA on the Ca(2 +) -activated chloride current (I(Cl(Ca))) and other chloride currents in isolated pig cardiac ventricular myocytes. ACA reversibly inhibited I(Cl(Ca)) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 4. 2 μM, n(Hill) = 1. 1), without affecting the L-type Ca(2 +) current. Unlike ACA, the non-selective PLA(2) inhibitor bromophenacyl bromide (BPB; 50 μM) {{had no effect on}} I(Cl(Ca)). In addition, the analgesic NSAID structurally-related to ACA, diclofenac (50 μM) also had no effect on I(Cl(Ca)), whereas the current in the same cells could be suppressed by chloride channel blockers flufenamic acid (FFA; 100 μM) or 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid (DIDS; 100 μM). Besides I(Cl(Ca)), ACA (50 μM) also suppressed the cAMP-activated chloride current, but to a lesser extent. It is proposed that the inhibitory effects of ACA on I(Cl(Ca)) are PLA(2) -independent and that the drug may serve as a useful tool in understanding the nature and function of cardiac anion channels. status: publishe...|$|R

Tolfenamic Acid is an orally and parenterally administered Non – steroidal anti-inflammatory drug belonging to the <b>fenamate</b> <b>group.</b> As per the British pharmacopoeia, uniformity of dispersion and fineness of dispersion is the basic requirement of Orodispersible tablets.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Given {{the crucial}} role of the {{skeletal}} muscle chloride conductance (gCl), supported by the voltage-gated chloride channel CLC- 1, in controlling muscle excitability, the availability of ligands modulating CLC- 1 are of potential medical as well as toxicological importance. Here, we focused our attention on niflumic acid (NFA), a molecule belonging to the <b>fenamates</b> <b>group</b> of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rat muscle Cl(-) conductance (gCl) and heterologously expressed CLC- 1 currents were evaluated by means of current-clamp (using two-microelectrodes) and patch-clamp techniques, respectively. Fura- 2 fluorescence {{was used to determine}} intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca(2 +) ](i), in native muscle fibres. KEY RESULTS: NFA inhibited native gCl with an IC(50) of 42 muM and blocked CLC- 1 by interacting with an intracellular binding site. Additionally, NFA increased basal [Ca(2 +) ](i) in myofibres by promoting a mitochondrial calcium efflux that was not dependent on cyclooxygenase or CLC- 1. A structure-activity study revealed that the molecular conditions that mediate the two effects are different. Pretreatment with the Ca-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine partially inhibited the NFA effect. Therefore, in addition to direct channel block, NFA also inhibits gCl indirectly by promoting PKC activation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These cellular effects of NFA on skeletal muscle demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} modify CLC- 1 and consequently gCl directly by interacting with channel proteins and indirectly by interfering with the calcium-dependent regulation of the channel. The effect of NFA on mitochondrial calcium stores suggests that NSAIDs, widely used drugs, could have potentially dangerous side-effects...|$|R

40|$|At the {{cardiovascular}} level, nitric oxide (NO) controls smooth muscle functions, maintains vascular integrity, and exerts an antihypertensive effect. Metal-nonoates are a recently discovered class of NO donors, with NO release modulated through the complexation of the N-aminoethylpiperazine N-diazeniumdiolate ligand to metal ions, and thus representing a significant innovation {{with respect to}} the drugs traditionally used. In this study, we characterized the vascular protective effects of the most effective compound of this class, Ni(PipNONO) Cl, compared with the commercial N-diazeniumdiolate <b>group</b> <b>derivate,</b> diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide (DETA/NO). Ni(PipNONO) Cl induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of precontracted rat aortic rings. The ED 50 was 0. 67 µM, compared with 4. 3 µM obtained with DETA/NO. When tested on cultured microvascular endothelial cells, Ni(PipNONO) Cl exerted a protective effect on the endothelium, promoting cell proliferation and survival in the picomolar range. The administration of Ni(PipNONO) Cl to vascular smooth muscle cells reduced the cell number, promoting their apoptosis at a high concentration (10 µM). Inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration, a hallmark of atherosclerosis, was accompanied by cytoskeletal rearrangement and loss of lamellipodia. When added to isolated platelets, Ni(PipNONO) Cl significantly reduced ADP-induced aggregation. Since atherosclerosis is accompanied by an inflammatory environment, cultured endothelial cells were exposed to interleukin (IL) - 1 β. In the presence of IL- 1 β, Ni(PipNONO) Cl inhibited cyclooxygenase- 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase upregulation, and reduced endothelial permeability and the platelet and monocyte adhesion markers CD 31 and CD 40 at the plasma membrane. Overall, these data indicate that Ni(PipNONO) Cl exerts vascular protective effects relevant for vascular dysfunction and prevention of atherosclerosis and thrombosi...|$|R

European sea bass with an initial average body weight of 187. 8 ± 1. 4 g, were fed either a FM based (control) diet or a soy replacement isoproteic, isolipidic and isocaloric diet. The treatments consisted replacing FM protein by: 25 % toasted, dehulled and solvent-extracted soybean meal (SE 25); 50 % dehulled and toasted soy seeds subjected to dry extrusion and mechanical oil extraction (ME 50); 50 % enzyme-treated soybean meal (ET 50) and an inclusion of 60 % composed of 30 % toasted, dehulled and solvent-extracted soybean meal and 30 % enzyme-treated soybean meal (SE+ET/ 60). ADCs values of dry matter, crude protein, crude lipid and gross energy did not significantly differ between ME 50 and SE+ET/ 60 but {{both of them were}} inferior to the other treatments (P 0. 05). In order to gain more insight on the effects of the diet on fish growth, activity of the brush border enzymes was measured. No significant differences were found in leucine amino peptidase and maltase activities, between the control group and the other soy <b>derivate</b> <b>groups.</b> The activity of γ- glutamyl transpeptidase was significantly higher in the upper section in fish that consumed the control diet compared with fish that consumed the soy derivate diets. Yet, the main activity of this enzyme was found in the lower intestinal section. In all the soy derivate diets except for the SE 25 diet, the activity of alkaline phosphatase was significantly lower than its activity in the control diet. Feeding diets that include various types and levels of soybean derivatives did not affect the whole body composition and slaughter yield but significantly reduced liver weight. The results show that in methionine supplemented diets, FM can be replaced in terms of protein by 25 % SE, 50 % ET or 60 % soy composed of 30 % SE and 30 % ET without hampering fish performance.

40|$|The {{depolarization}} {{ratios of}} heme protein Raman lines arising from vibrations of the heme group exhibit significant {{dependence on the}} excitation wavelength. From the analysis of this depolarization ratio dispersion, one obtains information about symmetry-lowering distortions δQΓ of the heme group that can be classified {{in terms of the}} symmetry races Γ = A 1 g, B 1 g, B 2 g, and A 2 g in D 4 h symmetry. The heme-protein interaction can be changed by the protonation of distinct amino acid side chains (i. e., for instance the Bohr <b>groups</b> in hemoglobin <b>derivates),</b> which gives rise to specific static heme distortions for each protonation state. From the Raman dispersion data, it is possible to obtain parameters by fitting to a theoretical expression of the Raman tensor, which provide information on these static distortions and also about the pK values of the involved titrable side chains. We have applied this method to the ν 4 (1, 355 cm- 1) and ν 10 (1, 620 cm- 1) lines of deoxygenated hemoglobin of the fourth component of trout and have measured their depolarization ratio dispersion as a function of pH between 6 and 9. From the pH dependence of the thus derived parameters, we obtain pK values identical to those of the Bohr groups, which were earlier derived from the corresponding O 2 -binding isotherms. These are pKα 1 = pKα 2 = 8. 5 for the α and pKβ 1 = 7. 5, pKβ 2 = 7. 4 for the β chains. We also obtain the specific distortion parameters for each protonation state. As shown in earlier studies, the ν 4 mode mainly probes distortions from interactions between the proximal histidine and atoms of the heme core (i. e., the nitrogens and the Cα atoms of the pyrroles). Group theoretical argumentation allows us to relate specific changes of the imidazole geometry as determined by its tilt and azimuthal angle and the iron-out-of-plane displacement to distinct variations of the normal distortions δQΓ derived from the Raman dispersion data. Thus, we found that the pH dependence of the heme distortions δQA 1 g (totally symmetric) and δQB 1 g (asymmetric) is caused by variations of the azimuthal rather than the tilt angle of the Fe-His (F 8) bond. In contrast to this, the ν 10 line mainly monitors changes resulting from the interaction between peripheral substituents of the porphyrin macrocycle (vinyl). From the pH dependence of the parameters, it is possible to separately identify distortions δQΓ affecting the hemes in the α and β chains, respectively. From this, we find that in the α subunit structural changes induced on protonation of the corresponding Bohr groups are mainly transferred via the Fe—Nɛ bond and give rise to changes in the azimuthal angle. In the β subunit, however, in addition, structural changes of the heme pocket arise, which most probably result from protonation of the imidazole of the COOH-terminal His (HC 3 β). This rearranges the net of H bonds between His HC 3 β, Ser (F 9 β), and Glu (F 7 β) ...|$|R
