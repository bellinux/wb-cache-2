5|$|Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are {{originally}} German names, {{which might}} {{indicate that the}} poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime and what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.|$|E
5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E
25|$|Don Eleuterio was {{depicted}} in the early incarnations of the character as a grumpy old man, easily angered by life's minor irritations. Recent incarnations depict him as less irritated (and more tolerant) than before. However, Eleuterio is still prone to fits of anger, and throws things quite loudly whenever he loses an argument and proof is shown to him, or when something personal <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that goes against his political philosophy (such as his son Elpidio joining a PDP campaign rally for a joyride, for example).|$|E

500|$|On {{his role}} in the episode, Jason Dohring, who plays Logan, elaborated, [...] "I think what's funny is that he always gets what's coming to him. Like a terrible thing <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> but he's like that to other people. So it's like in real life…what goes around comes around." [...] The episode {{features}} a guest-starring appearance by Kayla Ewell, who would eventually become most known for her role on The Vampire Diaries. The episode also features a guest appearance by James Jordan, as Lucky, the janitor. In season 3, Jordan would become the first actor to have two different roles on Veronica Mars when he was cast as Tim Foyle, a teaching assistant.|$|E

They initially assigned him to the Rochester Hustlers, a team in the International League with which the Giants had a working relationship. Giants manager John McGraw told Mickey Doolan, {{the manager of the}} Hustlers, [...] "I'm giving you one of the greatest players I've ever seen. Play him in the outfield. If anything <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> I'm holding you responsible." [...] In 140 games with Rochester, Youngs hit [...]356, earning himself a late-season promotion to the big league club. McGraw gave Youngs the nickname [...] "Pep" [...] due to his hustle and soon began to groom Youngs to become his successor as Giants' manager.|$|E

He reunites {{with his family and}} meets Naruto's son, Boruto, who asks Sasuke to take him on as his apprentice in order to surpass his father. Sasuke agrees on the condition that Boruto learns the Rasengan and prepare for the Chunin Exams. When Momoshiki and Kinshiki attack the village during the exam with the intent to kidnap Naruto, Sasuke protects Sarada and Boruto as Naruto travels to another dimension to protect them. Sasuke then allies with Boruto and the four other Kage to rescue Naruto. Boruto uses a giant Rasengan to destroy the enemy, effectively ending Sasuke's mission and allowing him to return home.

500|$|In 352BC, Athenian troops {{successfully}} opposed Philip at Thermopylae,* E. M. Burke, [...] "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 184 (note 92). but the Macedonian {{victory over}} the Phocians at the Battle of Crocus Field shook Demosthenes. In 351BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign policy issue facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip. According to Jacqueline de Romilly, a French philologist {{and member of the}} Académie française, the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'être (reason for existence). Demosthenes saw the king of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities and yet he presented him as a monster of Athens's own creation; in the First Philippic he reprimanded his fellow citizens as follows: [...] "Even if something <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> you will soon raise up a second Philip [...] ".* G. Kennedy, [...] "Oratory", 519–520.|$|E
500|$|Christopher McQuarrie, {{who went}} uncredited {{for his work}} on X-Men, was hired to write the {{screenplay}} for the Wolverine sequel in August 2009. According to Shuler-Donner, the sequel would focus on the relationship between Wolverine and Mariko, the daughter of a Japanese crime lord, and what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in Japan. Wolverine would have a different fighting style due to Mariko's father having [...] "this stick-like weapon. There'll be samurai, ninja, katana blades, different forms of martial arts - mano-a-mano, extreme fighting." [...] She continued: [...] "We want to make it authentic so I think it's very likely we'll be shooting in Japan. I think it's likely the characters will speak English rather than Japanese with subtitles." [...] In January 2010, at the People's Choice Awards, Jackman stated that the film would start shooting sometime in 2011, and in March 2010 McQuarrie declared that the screenplay was finished for production to start in January the following year. Sources indicated Darren Aronofsky was in negotiations to direct the film after Bryan Singer turned down the offer.|$|E
500|$|Jericho Cross (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith): The {{protagonist of}} the game, a jaded American Civil War deserter and drifter {{who became a}} gunslinger and train robber. During his [...] "one last job", he {{releases}} Lazarus Malkoth from his prison in a failed attempt to steal the contents. While dueling with Lazarus, Jericho gets bitten and infected by the vampire curse. His already deadly skills are enhanced by his vampire powers that afford him superhuman strength, increased endurance, enhanced agility, and heightened senses, {{in the form of}} the bioluminescent red orb that regenerated from his empty eye socket. Shadow is Jericho's demonic horse that appears at his beckon. According to the developers, they created [...] "deep psychological profiles of every character in the game" [...] with [...] "hope that Jericho's character arc — as this desperate [...] that's robbing trains with a subconscious death wish — makes a believable transition into this half-vampire hybrid gunslinger and will ultimately envelop the player in his destiny: which is a guy that can be either a hero or a terror. Basically, we just want people to care about this character and what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> — and I can't think of a first-person shooter that's really made us do that yet." ...|$|E

500|$|Kristan Reed of Eurogamer {{said that}} [...] "God of War II sports {{one of the}} most satisfyingly honed game designs we've ever come across." [...] He said that it would not {{overwhelm}} players and that it motivates them to improve their skills. He said that the balance [...] "always feels spot-on," [...] and the [...] "learning curve is just right," [...] adding that the magic attacks are more useful than those in God of War. He also said that God of War IIs gameplay, like the original, [...] "finds a comfortable middle ground" [...] between hardcore and casual players. Alex Navarro of GameSpot praised the pace of the game and the puzzle designs, and said the [...] "scale of some of the levels is unbelievably massive." [...] He also said that the story is interesting because it is more about what happens around Kratos, than what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Matt Leone of 1UP said that the strongest aspect [...] "is how it excels as both a story and an action game," [...] and it is the story that [...] "allows the game to feel like a true sequel." [...] Roper praised the scale of the levels, as well as the variety in environments, in comparison to the original installment, and said the art direction is [...] "once again absolutely outstanding." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bernard, Helmholtz and John are all {{brought before}} Mustapha Mond, the [...] "Resident World Controller for Western Europe", who tells Bernard and Helmholtz {{that they are}} to be exiled to islands for antisocial activity. Bernard pleads for a second chance, but Helmholtz welcomes the {{opportunity}} to be a true individual, and chooses the Falkland Islands as his destination, believing that their bad weather will inspire his writing. Mond says that Bernard does not know that exile is actually a reward. The islands are full of the most interesting people in the world, individuals who did not fit in the World State community. Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control. John rejects Mond's arguments, and Mond sums up John's views by claiming that John demands [...] "the right to be unhappy". John asks if he may go to the islands as well, but Mond refuses and says he wishes to see what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> next.|$|E
