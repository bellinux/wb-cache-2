5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of <b>deep</b> <b>ecology</b> have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the <b>deep</b> <b>ecology</b> advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} hailed as an {{important}} addition to the literature in both environmental ethics and process philosophy. Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims. First, he challenged her linking of process ethics with individualist consequentialism, arguing that it is instead somewhere between individualist consequentialism and <b>deep</b> <b>ecology.</b> Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends. Cobb and Menta, though both welcoming her consideration of process philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne {{on a number of}} points.|$|E

40|$|The {{argument}} {{of this paper}} is that sustainability requires a new worldview-paradigm. It critically evaluates Gore’s liberal-based environmentalism in order to show how “shallow ecologies” are called into question by <b>deeper</b> <b>ecologies.</b> This analysis leads to the notion that global warming is better understood as a symptom indicative of the worldview that is the source for environmental crises. Heidegger’s ontological hermeneutics and its critique of modern technology show that the modern worldview involves an enframing (a totalizing technological ordering) of the natural. Enframing reveals entities as standing reserve (on demand energy suppliers). My thesis maintains that enframing is geographically expressed as automobility. Because of the energy needs used to maintain automobility, reaching the goal of sustainability requires rethinking the spatial organization of life as a function of stored energy technologies.

5|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>ecology</b> is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of life}} rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E

This presents an experimental opportunity to study both community formation and the implications of glacier loss for terrestrial ecosystems. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Rime et al.

The study provides insights into the contrasting structures of microbial communities at different stages of soil development. An important strength of the study is the integration of soil depth into the paradigm of primary succession, a feature which has rarely been considered by other studies. These findings underscore the importance of studying the interactions between microbial communities and glaciers at a time when Earth's glacial systems are experiencing profound change.

25|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>ecology</b> is an {{ecological}} and environmental philosophy promoting the inherent worth of non-human living beings {{regardless of their}} instrumental utility to human needs, plus a radical restructuring of modern human societies in accordance with such ideas. <b>Deep</b> <b>ecology</b> supports the views that the natural world is a harmony of homeostasis due to the complex inter-relationships in which the life of organisms is actively regulated, partially by the existence of other organisms within the biosphere, in order to constantly be conducive to life. These views are scientifically encouraged by living systems theory and the Gaia hypothesis. Human interference with or destruction {{of the natural world}} poses a threat therefore not only to humans but to all organisms of our biosphere.|$|E
25|$|In his {{original}} 1972/73 <b>deep</b> <b>ecology</b> paper, Arne Næss claims the <b>deep</b> <b>ecology</b> movement arose from scientists – ecologists who {{were out in}} the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also doing the work of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were Rachel Carson, David Brower, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range <b>deep</b> <b>ecology</b> movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. Silent Spring helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.|$|E
40|$|Aarne Naess, in {{a seminal}} paper on {{environmental}} philosophy, distin-guished between two streams of environmental philosophy and activ-ism—shallow and deep. The <b>deep,</b> long-range <b>ecology</b> movement has de-veloped {{over the past}} four decades on a variety of fronts. However, in the context of global conferences on development, population, and environ-ment held during the 1990 s, even shallow environmentalism seems to have less priority than demands for worldwide economic growth based on trade liberalization and a free market global economy. “If nature is not a prison and earth a shoddy way-station, we must find the faith and force to affirm its metabolism as our own—or rather, our own as part of it. To do so means nothing less than a shift in our whole frame of reference and our attitude towards life itself, a wider perception of the landscape as a creative, harmonious being where relationships of things are as real as the things. Without losing our sense of a great human destiny and without intellectual surrender, we must affirm that the world is a being, a part of our own body ” (Shepard 1969, 3). When Paul Shepard wrote this passage, he summarized a stream of thought that was developing during the 1960 s in the writings of Gar...|$|R
40|$|Design has {{recently}} taken a decided turn towards social innovation and impact. The agenda of socially responsible design covers both developing and developed countries and builds on human-centred design approaches, sustainability, and social impact. Despite {{the successes of}} these innovations in practice and education, innovation, as taught in design schools, is firmly embedded in a Mainstream Sustainable Development (MSD) discourse of market environmentalism and ecological modernisation, contributing in so doing to exacerbating the existing imbalance of human and natural needs. Beyond Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and eco-design for sustainability are development demands that question economic, social, and environmental common sense, demanding systemic approaches to innovation and change for sustainable livelihoods in Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) contexts. From end-of-pipe pollution control to <b>deep</b> green <b>ecology,</b> the continuum of Sustainable Development (SD) ideologies positions technology innovation relative to human and ecological well-being differently. Taking such an agenda seriously in industrial design will demand integration of industrial ecology, sustainable design, and social innovation frameworks. Building on a critique of current approaches to human-centred and socially responsible design, this paper proposes that sustainable development and not sustainability should be the framework of choice for design's theoretical and practical contribution to development in BoP. This paper suggests what these changes might look like at the postgraduate level...|$|R
