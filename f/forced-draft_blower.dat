5000|$|On 20 October 1983, Detroit {{departed}} for deployment with the 6th Fleet. While in the Mediterranean, Detroit {{was the principal}} combat logistics force ship supporting U.S. and Allied units of the Multi-National Peacekeeping Force, in Beirut, Lebanon. Throughout {{the height of the}} crisis, Detroit provided logistical support to two carrier battle groups, the [...] battle group and the deployed Marine Amphibious Ready Group. On 9 January 1984 Detroit suffered a fuel fire in her <b>forced-draft</b> <b>blower</b> while moored at Souda Bay, Crete. Some crew members were treated for smoke inhalation. When she returned to Norfolk on 2 May 1984, Detroit had completed 301 replenishments, a new shipâ€™s record.|$|E
5000|$|Following a {{diversion}} to Subic Bay on 7 May {{to fix a}} broken <b>forced-draft</b> <b>blower,</b> the guided-missile destroyer rejoined Bon Homme Richard on 16 May for 10 days of planeguard duty. Steaming on her second [...] "Sea Dragon" [...] patrol on 26 May, Benjamin Stoddert came under enemy fire {{for the first time}} later that day. A North Vietnamese coastal battery unexpectedly opened fire, forcing her to shift fire onto the battery, to commence weaving, and to clear the area. During this patrol, Benjamin Stoddert also rescued the pilot who parachuted from a stricken Air Force F4C [...] "Phantom" [...] that crashed at sea on 30 May (the WSO was rescued by the USS Blue (DD-744)) and provided gunfire protection during the helicopter rescue of an Air Force F-105 [...] "Thunderchief" [...] pilot on 4 June. Returning to Bon Homme Richard the next day, the guided-missile destroyer alternated planeguard duties with [...] "Sea Dragon" [...] patrols through 12 July. At one point on 26 June, enemy counterbattery fire fell close enough to spray the ship with shell fragments, but the resulting damage was light and was quickly repaired. Next came a week of PIRAZ duty followed by four days of gunline operations, after which Benjamin Stoddert headed to Hong Kong for a week of rest and recreation. After an upkeep period at Subic Bay, the guided-missile destroyer returned to [...] "Yankee Station" [...] on 9 August. Once again, she alternated between carrier planeguard services and gunline duties {{through the end of the}} month. A boiler tube failure on 4 September, however, forced the warship to proceed to Yokosuka for temporary repairs.|$|E
50|$|To {{provide a}} black start, some power {{stations}} have small diesel generators, normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), {{which can be}} used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler <b>forced-draft</b> combustion air <b>blowers,</b> and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.|$|R
