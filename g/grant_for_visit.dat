25|$|By {{the late}} Middle Ages, {{the abuse of}} indulgences, mainly through commercialization, had become a serious problem which the Church {{recognized}} {{but was unable to}} restrain effectively. Indulgences were {{from the beginning of the}} Protestant Reformation a target of attacks by Martin Luther and all other Protestant theologians. Eventually the Catholic Counter-Reformation curbed the excesses, but indulgences continue to play a role in modern Catholic religious life. Reforms in the 20th century largely abolished the quantification of indulgences, which had been expressed in terms of days or years. These days or years were meant to represent the equivalent of time spent in penance, although it was widely taken to mean time spent in Purgatory. The reforms also greatly reduced the number of indulgences <b>granted</b> <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> particular churches and other locations.|$|R

40|$|We {{carry out}} a {{parametric}} study {{in order to identify}} and quantify the effects of uncertainties on pivotal parameters controlling the dynamics of volcanic plumes. The study builds upon numerical simulations using FPLUME, an integral steady-state model based on the Buoyant Plume Theory generalized in order to account for volcanic processes (particle fallout and re-entrainment, water phase changes, effects of wind, etc). As reference cases for strong and weak plumes, we consider the cases defined during the IAVCEI Commission on tephra hazard modeling inter-comparison study (Costa et al., 2016). The parametric study quantifies the effect of typical uncertainties on total mass eruption rate, column height, mixture exit velocity, temperature and water content, and particle size. Moreover, a sensitivity study investigates the role of wind entrainment and intensity, atmospheric humidity, water phase changes, and particle fallout and re-entrainment. Results show that the leading-order parameters that control plume height are the mass eruption rate and the air entrainment coefficient, especially for weak plumes.

40|$|AbstractToday in {{economic}} and management field it is taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> {{that the reason}} of a tourist service is basically the promotion of experiences. Indeed, tourists travel {{in order to live}} unconventional experiences. Consequently, the competitive advantage of the destinations essentially originates from the ability to meet such a need. And yet, which are the suitable tools to make the experience lived by tourists unforgettable? In this respect, the specialized literature offers a wide and multifaceted array of opinions. This essay highlights the problems and the issues of a specific school of thoughts, which sees the experience basically as a vehicle of spectacular suggestion. In this sense, experience and entertainment are quite the same, whereas in order to reach the optimum in the tourist offer it is necessary the building of artificial scenarios. In these scenarios, which can also be defined “dramatic”, the tourist can feel the extraordinary of situations which otherwise may be taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> (<b>for</b> example <b>visiting</b> the historic part of the city or going to shopping centers). The building of such scenarios surely confers sensationalism to a mere tour. However, how can these scenarios be included in cultural landscapes already established without somehow compromising also their authenticity? This paper arises exactly from this issue. In the attempt of giving an answer, the issue will be looked at from a perspective which takes into consideration philosophic, anthropologic and sociologic reflection. Therefore, this perspective is inter-disciplinary and basically epistemological. The aim of this essay is to develop a theoretical background feasible in defining an optimal experience. On the contrary, the building of an alternative model of experience is up to the future development of the research...|$|R

Subjects and methods: Cross-sectional data from 8, 877 randomly selected patients were assessed during a 1 -year period by 209 GPs in the German federal state of Saxony. The reasons <b>for</b> <b>visits,</b> performed procedures, and results of visits were documented. In this study, the data of patients aged 65  years and older are analyzed and the procedural and nonprocedural reasons <b>for</b> <b>visits</b> are described. Results: In all, 2, 866 patients aged 65  years and older were included. The majority of patients (1, 807) were female. A total of 4, 426 reasons <b>for</b> <b>visits</b> were found, distributed on 363 International Classification of Primary Care- 2 codes. In the mean, there were 1. 5 reasons <b>for</b> a GP <b>visit</b> from each patient. The top five nonprocedural reasons <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> the GP were: cough (1. 8 %), back complaints (1. 6 %), shoulder complaints (1. 3 %), knee complaints (1. 1 %), and dyspnea (1. 0 % of all reasons <b>for</b> <b>visit).</b> The top five procedural reasons <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> the GP included follow-up investigations of cardiovascular or endocrine disorders and immunizations. The top 30 nonprocedural reasons <b>for</b> <b>visits</b> covered 21. 9 % of all reasons <b>for</b> <b>visiting.</b> The top 30 procedural reasons covered 54. 3 % of all reasons <b>for</b> <b>visits.</b> Conclusion: The current work indicates that people aged 65  years and older consult the GP more frequently for procedural than for nonprocedural reasons.

40|$|Multichannel flash {{spectroscopy}} (with microsecond time resolution) {{has been}} applied to carotenoid (Car) -containing and Car-less reaction centers (RC) of Rhodobacter sphaeroides with a view to investigate the interaction between the Car and its neighboring pigments at room temperature. Under neutral redox potential conditions, where the primary quinone acceptor (QA) is oxidized, the light-induced spectral changes in the 350 - 1000 nm region are attributed to the photochemical oxidation of the special pair (denoted here as P 870), the generation of P 870 (+) QA(-), and the attendant electrochromism of adjacent chromophores. A bathochromic shift of < 1 nm in the visible absorption region of Car reveals the sensitivity of Car to the P 870 photooxidation. Under low redox potential conditions, where QA is reduced, P 870 triplets (P 870 (+)) are formed. The time-resolved triplet-minus-singlet (TmS) spectrum of Car-less RC shows a deep bleaching at 870 nm, which belongs to P 870 (+), and additional (but smaller) bleaching at 800 nm; the entire spectrum decays at the same rate (with a lifetime of about 50 micros). The bleaching at 800 nm arises from the pigment interaction between P 870 (+) and the accessory bacteriochlorophylls on A and B branches (BA,B). In Car-containing RC, the TmS spectra of Car are accompanied by two smaller, negative signals [...] a sharp peak at 809 +/- 2 nm and a broad band at 870 nm [...] which decay {{at the same rate as}} the TmS spectrum of Car (ca 10 micros). The former is ascribed to the perturbation, by Car(+), of the absorption spectrum of BB; the latter, to the TmS spectrum of P 870 (+), a species that appears to be in approximate thermal equilibrium with Car(+). These assignments are consistent with the absorption-detected magnetic resonance spectra obtained by other workers at low temperatures.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{potential in}} the timing of recruitment and reproduction may be crucial for the ability of populations to buffer against environmental changes, allowing them to avoid unfavourable breeding conditions. The evolution of a trait in a local population is determined by its heritability and selection. In the present study, we performed pedigree-based quantitative genetic analyses for two life-history traits (recruiting age and laying date) using population data of the storm petrel over an 18 -year period in two adjacent breeding colonies (only 150 m apart) that share the same environmental conditions. In both traits, natal colony effect was {{the main source of}} the phenotypic variation among individuals, and cohort variance for recruitment age and additive genetic variance for laying date were natal colony-specific. We found significant heritability only in laying date and, more specifically, only in birds born in one of the colonies. The difference in genetic variance between the colonies was statistically significant. Interestingly, selection on earlier breeding birds was detected only in the colony in which heritable variation in laying date was found. Therefore, local evolvability for a life-history trait may vary within a unexpectedly small spatial scale, through the diversifying natural selection and insulating gene flow. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.
