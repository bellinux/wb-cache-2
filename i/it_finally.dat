5|$|A failed move by Governor John Connally to {{have the}} school placed into the Texas A University System, as well as {{continued}} disagreement and heated debate over the school's new name, kept the name change from being approved. In spite of objections by many students and faculty, the Board of Directors again submitted the change in 1969. <b>It</b> <b>finally</b> received the legislature's approval on June 6 and the name Texas Tech University went into effect that September. All of the institution's schools, except Law, became colleges.|$|E
5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale <b>it</b> <b>finally</b> does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E

5|$|After {{intersecting}} SR163, {{also known}} as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SR52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SR52, it closely parallels I-5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley, <b>it</b> <b>finally</b> meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21lanes wide. Eastbound SR56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.|$|E
5|$|After the Norse occupation, the {{toponymy}} of Orkney {{became almost}} wholly West Norse. The Norse language changed {{into the local}} Norn, which lingered {{until the end of}} the 18th century, when <b>it</b> <b>finally</b> died out. Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots. This dialect is at a low ebb due to the pervasive influences of television, education, and the large number of incomers. However, attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing-song accent and many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use. The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie, meaning small, which may be derived from the French petit.|$|E
5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Burnham {{branch of the}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, but the tracks continued onto the jetty, where ferry services to South Wales could be boarded. The station opened in 1858 as Burnham, and was renamed Burnham-on-Sea in 1920. It closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951 and stopped being used for excursions in 1962. <b>It</b> <b>finally</b> closed to goods traffic in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Helvellyn Mine or Wythburn Mine {{opened in}} 1839 by the gill between Whelpside and Helvellyn Screes. It was {{operated}} by a succession of different owners, driving five levels through mostly barren rock to explore three mineral veins. <b>It</b> <b>finally</b> closed in 1880 when Manchester Corporation acquired the land for the Thirlmere reservoir. Only a few hundred tons of galena {{came out of the}} mine; probably insufficient to cover its costs.|$|E

The portion of Broad Street between Allen and Main Streets was closed to all traffic in February and was originally scheduled to open on October30. <b>It</b> <b>finally</b> reopened to traffic on December3.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} chapter of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. <b>It</b> <b>finally</b> becomes {{attached}} to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals {{to take care of the}} poor and suffering.|$|E
5|$|Later in the century, {{a series}} of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses broke out between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster and York. After the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Harlech formed a refuge for Queen Margaret of Anjou, and between 1461–68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, {{under the command of}} Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. Thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and {{eventually}} became the last major stronghold still under Lancasterian control. <b>It</b> <b>finally</b> fell after a month's siege, the events credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.|$|E
5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her.

I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

5|$|Subtropical Storm Alpha (also called Alfa) {{was a rare}} {{off-season}} subtropical cyclone {{that hit}} Georgia in May 1972. It developed from a previously non-tropical cyclone in the western Atlantic Ocean, and initially it moved northeastward off the Carolinas. The storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge, and concurrently it intensified to become Subtropical Storm Alpha. It later moved ashore near Savannah, and <b>it</b> <b>finally</b> dissipated in the northeast Gulf of Mexico on May 29. It produced wave action and moderate rainfall along the coast. Damage totaled over $100,000 (1972USD), {{and there were two}} associated deaths.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal <b>it.</b> <b>Finally,</b> they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} these themes was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. <b>It</b> <b>finally</b> disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E

If yes, {{she could not have}} fired <b>it.</b> <b>Finally,</b> did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|This {{fighting}} was so heavy that the NK 8th Division {{was forced to}} hold its ground a week before trying to advance. When <b>it</b> <b>finally</b> broke out, it was only able to advance briefly before it was stalled again by South Korean resistance. The division was forced to halt a second time to wait for reinforcements. However the other two attacks were more successful, catching the UN forces by surprise.
