As such a single insurance company is unable to bear such risk alone. Under German law, the transfer of a nuclear risk of an insurer to a reinsurer is prohibited. In 1998 the Atomic Energy Act established the maximum insurance liability of nuclear insurer at about €2.5 billion; for damages above that cap the Federal Government is liable according to § 34 of the Atomic Energy Act. If the total damage exceeds the stipulated maximum sum of €2.55 billion, the German Federal Government pays the German Nuclear Reactor Insurance Association for the excess losses. The insurance payments include the cost of evacuating people.|$|E

This approach enables the insured to express its view of the relationship between insurable losses and collateral losses as a proportion of the underlying loss recovery.In short, Transurance makes uninsurable losses insurable, in a way that is effective and efficient, and helps insureds deal with the full impact of loss events. By supplementing insurance with Transurance, insurance recoveries will more closely resemble the total economic loss of <b>insured</b> <b>events.</b> Transurance may be substituted for ambiguous policy wording in traditional insurance so as to eliminate coverage disputes.|$|R
