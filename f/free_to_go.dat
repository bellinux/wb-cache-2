5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up to the border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young roguish prince, Fiyero, {{has arrived}} at Shiz. Galinda is charmed when Fiyero shares his life {{philosophy}} ("Dancing Through Life").

Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to invite her to the party, but she convinces him instead to ask Nessarose out of pity, leaving her <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with Fiyero. Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq {{are meant to be}} together and how Galinda helped it happen. When Galinda offers Elphaba a hat to wear to the party, Elphaba begins to wonder if she was wrong about her roommate.|$|E

Some flew their aircraft over to the Partisans, including several light aircraft and some Bf 109s, whilst others, also including Bf 109s, {{as well as at}} least one Dornier Do-17Z, a Messerschmitt Bf 110G-2, a Bristol Blenheim I and a Yugoslav-designed and built Zmaj Fizir FP-2, sought sanctuary in Klagenfurt, Austria.|$|E

He enlists the aid of April, Andy (Chris Pratt), Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Ann (Rashida Jones) to help handle them, while telling Jerry (Jim O'Heir) that he is <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home early. During her first meeting, Leslie learns a historic town monument, the Turnbill mansion, is soon to be altered by its new renter, the former Miss Pawnee beauty pageant winner Jessica Wicks (Susan Yeagley). Leslie and Tom (Aziz Ansari) leave to meet {{with her at the}} mansion, where Jessica is planning a birthday party for her extremely old husband, the wealthy Nick Newport Sr. (Christopher Murray), founder of the Sweetums candy company. Leslie is shocked Jessica has already made several alterations, such as hanging up nude portraits of herself and painting the floor.|$|E
5|$|Sun is at a party, and {{is served}} {{champagne}} by a waiter, Jin. They soon develop a relationship, with Sun wanting {{to run away}} with Jin to America, but Jin insisting they honorably tell her father that they are seeing each other. Sun's father approves of their relationship as long as Jin takes a job working for him. One night after they're married, Jin returns home covered in someone else's blood. Sun is angry that he refuses to explain the blood to her and slaps him. He tells Sun that he does whatever her father tells him to do. A few years later, Sun secretly plots to leave Jin and her father, so she will be <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> wherever she wants. However, she does not go through with her plans after he expresses a loving gesture to her, and boards Flight 815 with her husband.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic concept}} of SaGa Frontier {{is based on}} its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven {{different}} protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, {{each with its own}} culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non-linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> almost anywhere and interact with almost anyone. Travel through most of the Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has his or her own storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters even encounter each other during their quests. The storyline of each character also changes depending on who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who the protagonist has in his or her party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2.|$|E

Reactions that proceed {{in the forward}} direction to approach equilibrium are often described as spontaneous, requiring no input of <b>free</b> energy <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward. Non-spontaneous reactions require input of <b>free</b> energy <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward (examples include charging a battery by applying an external electrical power source, or photosynthesis driven by absorption of electromagnetic radiation {{in the form of}} sunlight).|$|R
5|$|With the French threat by sea eliminated, the Royal Navy was <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the offensive, {{and command}} of the Porto Ferrajo {{garrison}} {{was placed in the}} hands of Lieutenant Colonel George Airey while Warren had returned with his powerful squadron. Plans were then drawn up for a force of seamen, Royal Marines and Tuscan auxiliaries to launch an amphibious operation against the French batteries that overlooked the mouth of the harbour. The British assembled a landing party of 449 Marines and 240 seamen from Renown, HMS Gibraltar, HMS Dragon, HMS Alexander, HMS Genereux, HMS Stately, Pomone, Pearl and the brig HMS Vincejo, all under the command of Captain George Long of Vincejo and Captain John Chambers White of Renown. Approximately 1,000 Tuscan troops joined them. Landings took place on the morning of 14 September. The troops then moved inland against the batteries in two columns while Dragon and Genereux bombarded a fortified tower at Marciana.|$|E

25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E

25|$|Israeli {{authorities}} {{state that}} their reason of these restrictions is fear of his spreading further state secrets {{and that he}} is still bound by his non-disclosure agreement.

Vanunu said his knowledge was outdated and that he had nothing more he could reveal that is not already widely known. Despite the stated restrictions he gave interviews to the foreign press since his release, for which he has been arrested.|$|E

Three new evacuation zones were planned by the government in areas within 11 villages and towns according to radiation levels. The small city of Minamisoma was divided into 3 zones, in the first people were <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in and out, in the second access is limited, the third area all visiting is forbidden. Still scattered with ruins, and with no electricity and running water, the city was a rather uninhabitable place for a population formed by mostly elderly people.

25|$|International {{copyright}} treaties {{such as the}} Berne Convention (BC) or the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) {{work through}} national treatment: signatory countries agree to grant copyright to foreign works under their local laws and by the same rules they grant copyright to domestic works. Whether a work is eligible to copyright, and if so, for how long that copyright exists, is governed {{by the laws of}} the country where copyright on the work is claimed. The Berne Convention and also the UCC define only the minimum requirements for copyrights that all signatory countries must meet, but any country is <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> beyond this minimal common denominator in its legislation. This is most noticeable in the duration for which copyrights are upheld. The Berne Convention lays down a minimal general copyright term of 50 years beyond the death of an author (50 years p.m.a.). But many countries have a longer term, such as 70 years p.m.a., or even 100 years p.m.a..|$|E
25|$|A week later, Jake {{leaves to}} go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that {{it looks as if}} a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison.

Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E
25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} was overshadowed by U.S. media criticism of Kỳ and Thiệu's unfair electoral practices and sneaky tricks. All the candidates {{were scheduled to}} attend a rally at Quảng Trị in the far north of the country on 6 August. Owing to the security situation {{and the possibility of}} communist attacks, the politicians were transported to joint campaign events by the military, rather than being <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to separate events as their strategy dictated. However, the Quảng Trị event had to be canceled after the candidates’ plane landed 23km away at an air base in Đông Hà. Believing that the mishap was a deliberate attempt to make them look chaotic and disorganized—Thiệu and Kỳ had decided not to attend rallies—the candidates boycotted the event and flew back to Saigon. There they denounced the government bitterly. The leading opposition candidate, Trần Văn Hương, claimed that Thiệu and Kỳ “purposefully arranged the trip to humiliate us and make clowns out of us.” As air force chief, Kỳ had previously stranded opposition politicians on a trip to the Central Highlands. Kỳ and Thiệu maintained that no malice was involved, but their opponents did not believe it. None of the candidates made good on their threat to withdraw, but their strident attacks over the alleged dirty tricks dominated the media coverage of the election for a period.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} first {{shown at the}} E3 event in May 2004, when a playable demo was made {{available}} for all three consoles. The demo featured gameplay from Moria, and included a fight against two trolls and the battle against the Balrog, {{as well as some}} footage from the film. EA announced the game would be about five times as long as the Return of the King game. They also explained that although the game would be linear, and the player would not be <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> wherever they wished in Middle-earth, at most times during the game, optional sidequests would be available. The game would be divided into smaller chapters comprising three main story arcs; the journey from Rivendell through Moria to Lothlórien; the journey across Rohan to Helm's Deep, and the subsequent Battle of the Hornburg; and the journey from Helm's Deep to Minas Tirith, and the subsequent Battle of the Pelennor Fields. EA explained players would be given already developed characters, but customization and attributes would not be tied to character classes, so players would be free to have any character specialize in any mode of combat they wished. Each of the characters in the game was based upon a minor character or extra who appeared {{at some point in the}} films, and who was named by the production crew but never named on-screen.|$|E
