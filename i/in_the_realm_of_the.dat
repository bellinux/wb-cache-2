5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality {{parallel to the}} living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, only {{to come back and}} report their experiences.|$|E

25|$|One final film in {{this period}} was an {{original}} work scripted by Daniella Carmi. The Woman Who Stopped Eating (1991) {{is the story of}} a troubled scriptwriter who wants to write a feature film about a woman who stops eating. She turns to a film director who is also going through a crisis in his life, and together they begin to weave a story about this imaginary woman. The tension soon erupts, however, because the screenwriter wants to keep her story <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imaginary, while the director struggles to adopt a more realistic approach to the storyline. In some way, the story reflected the tensions marking Loevy's own career as both a documentarian and a dramatist.|$|E

25|$|Several of Gotland's image stones show {{scenes that}} allude {{to death and}} eroticism, and the stones are two to three metres tall phallic {{memorial}} stones in remembrance of the dead. The stones have richly decorated surfaces and they often have a certain motif in the upper field: a welcoming scene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead {{between a man and}} a lady. The lady offers a drinking horn to the man who arrives on Sleipnir. It is the man's phallic shape, among other things, which allows us to connect the images to the literary sources. The scene may depict the deceased who is united with Hel or with Rán. It is primarily kings and chieftains who are portrayed with an erotic death, but also the death of a hero can be portrayed in the same way.|$|E

25|$|Mochizuki's 2005 {{film for}} the Toei Company studio, Wet Red Thread {{concerned}} two former prostitutes played by Saki Takaoka and Rei Yoshii looking {{to start a}} new life. After a gap of three years, Mochizuki directed another film for Toei, the erotic feature Johnen: Love of Sada, an alternate look at Sada Abe, whose story had been previously treated in the pink film A Woman Called Sada Abe and more famously in Nagisa Oshima's <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senses. In Mochizuki's version, a young photographer becomes obsessed with the married Sada (played by actress-dancer-singer Aya Sugimoto) and his affair with her brings back memories of a former life together with her. Sugimoto had created a scandal by her unfettered sexuality when starring in the 2004 S cult film Flower and Snake and critic Mark Schilling compliments Mochizuki's style and casting for this film.|$|E
25|$|The social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{is an important}} source of interpersonal interaction, social integration, and forming positive and durable relationships. In fact, many people engage in sharing behaviors in order to have such social interactions and strengthen their relationships (as described above). However, this might not result from the sharing of certain emotional events. When asked why they would keep an emotional event a secret, the most frequent reasons cited were: wanting to avoid hurting someone, preserving one’s image in the eyes of others, protecting one’s private life, and protecting one’s self. Such reasons, which together constituted the responses of over 75% of participants, all concern one thing: protection. According to Baumeister and Leary, this idea of protection pertains to protection from undesirable consequences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social sphere, namely that the revelation of such secrets would be harmful to social relationships. Therefore, instead of social integration and the strengthening of relationships, the revelation of certain emotional events could be harmful to a relationship and could thus result in social disintegration and deterioration of relationships.|$|E
25|$|Kumashiro {{also took}} breaks from the Roman Porno genre to direct {{mainstream}} films, beginning with Bitterness of Youth (1974), {{a story of}} student radicalism with similarities to Dreiser's An American Tragedy (1925). Other such films include Light of Africa (1975) for Toho and Jigoku (1979), a remake of Nobuo Nakagawa's 1960 film Jigoku, for Toei. For the German-Japanese co-production, The Woman with the Red Hat (1982), Kumashiro worked with Pink Film producer-director Kōji Wakamatsu. The production was an unsuccessful attempt on Wakamatsu's part to emulate the success he had had in collaborating with the French in Nagisa Ōshima's <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Realm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senses (1976). The story, dealing with a Japanese man in Germany and his obsessive sexual relationship with a German woman during Hitler's rise to power, also seemed to echo Ōshima's film. Jasper Sharp notes with surprise that Kumashiro, who had long been an opponent of Japanese censorship, did {{not take advantage of}} the more liberal European laws. Instead he followed the Japanese practice of obscuring genital areas with props.|$|E
