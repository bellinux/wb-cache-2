5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble <b>dryers</b> and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and <b>dryers</b> meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of the}} populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E
40|$|In this diploma work a {{model of}} an {{integrated}} pulp and paper mill has been evaluated and analysed. The pulp mill is a reference model mill, defined in the research program “The Ecocyclic Pulp Mill”, and it consists of the best technology built and run in the Nordic pulp and paper industry. The paper mill however, is modelled in this study. The heat demand of the mill has been analysed using Pinch Technology. The paper mill in the reference model mill is a conventional paper mill, and consists of wire and press section with a white water system, and a cylinder <b>dryer</b> followed by a soft calender. Since the <b>dryer</b> is the most energy demanding section of the paper mill, mainly different {{ways to improve the}} drying section have been studied. Three different ways to change the <b>dryer</b> section have been studied, higher dry solids content before the cylinder <b>dryer</b> and a combination of the cylinder <b>dryer</b> with either an impulse <b>dryer</b> or a superheated steam <b>dryer.</b> Apart from the mill’s energy demand, changes in fuel costs and emissions of carbon dioxide with the different <b>dryer</b> models have been studied. When part of the cylinder <b>dryer</b> is replaced with an impulse <b>dryer</b> or a superheated steam <b>dryer</b> the live steam demand decreases, while the electricity or natural gas demand increases. A reduction in steam consumption, i. e. reduction in steam production, also leads to a decrease of the electricity production in the mill. To compensate this the mill has to buy externally produced electricity. The bark, which has been made available through the reduced production of steam, can be used to decrease the deficit of bark in the mill. In the base case the reference model mill has a heat demand of 9, 46 GJ/t paper, while the cylinder <b>dryer</b> has a heat demand of 3, 77 GJ/t paper. If the dry solids content increases with five percentage units, the heat demand in the cylinder <b>dryer</b> decreases with 15 %. When part of the cylinder <b>dryer</b> is replaced with an impulse <b>dryer</b> drying the paper to a dryness of 65 % the steam demand decreases in the cylinder <b>dryer</b> section with 42 %. At the same time the electricity or natural gas demand increases with 290 or 326 kWh/t paper respectively. When using a combination of a superheated steam <b>dryer</b> and cylinder <b>dryer,</b> where 50 % of the drying is carried out in each of the <b>dryer,</b> the live steam demand decreases with roughly 50 %, while the natural gas demand increases with 622 kWh/t paper. The reduced steam demand and the raised electricity and natural gas demand leads to decreased emissions of carbon dioxide in the mill, if it can be assumed that the bark that is made available is used to replace oil elsewhere. The emissions decreases with 111 and 148 kg/t paper for the combination of a cylinder <b>dryer</b> and an impulse <b>dryer</b> heated with electricity or natural gas respectively, and with 197 kg/t paper when using the combination of a superheated steam <b>dryer</b> and a cylinder <b>dryer.</b> The fuel cost increases when using a combination of a cylinder <b>dryer</b> and an impulse <b>dryer</b> or a superheated steam <b>dryer,</b> compared to only using a cylinder <b>dryer.</b> The cost increases with 48 SEK/t paper for the impulse <b>dryer</b> when heated by electricity, and 26 SEK/t paper when heated by natural gas. For the superheated steam <b>dryer</b> the fuel cost increases with 51 SEK/t paper. The cylinder <b>dryer</b> is therefore a better alternative regarding fuel cost...|$|R

The <b>dryer</b> is an integral or direct mode type made from locally available material such as plywood, Perspex® glass, angle iron, paints, and wire-mesh. The dimensions of the <b>dryer</b> is 100 cm x 50 cm x 84 cm / 72 cm (length width x height). The optimum temperature of the <b>dryer</b> is 67. 00 c with a corresponding ambient temperature of 31. 00 c. The <b>dryer</b> was used to dry agricultural products (pepper and groundnuts). It took a maximum of five and eight days, respectively, to dry pepper and groundnuts respectively at average <b>dryer</b> relative humidity of 43 % and average temperature of 63. 0 oC.

30|$|All results {{except those}} on stain removal {{showed that there}} were no {{significant}} differences between the specimens dried in the conventional <b>dryer</b> and those dried in the HE <b>dryer</b> when all the specimens were washed in the HE washer. A significant interaction was found in stain removal between the combination of washer and <b>dryer</b> used and the use of softener. When a softener was not used, the conventional <b>dryer</b> removed more stains from the specimens than the HE <b>dryer.</b> However, when a softener was used, among the specimens washed in the HE washer, the stains on the specimens dried in the conventional <b>dryer</b> were more difficult to remove than the specimens dried in the HE <b>dryer.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ibn Batuta, {{during his}} visit in 1344, {{observed}} that the kingdom of Jaffna was a major trading kingdom with extensive overseas contacts. The Kingdom's trades were oriented towards maritime South India, with which it developed a commercial interdependence. The non-agriculture tradition of the kingdom became strong {{as a result of}} large coastal fishing and boating population and growing opportunities for seaborne commerce. Influential commercial groups, drawn mainly from south Indian mercantile groups as well as other, resided in the royal capital, port, and market centers. Artisan settlements were also established and groups of skilled tradesmen—carpenters, stonemasons, wavers, <b>dryers,</b> gold and silver smiths—resided in urban centers. Thus, a pluralistic socio-economic tradition of agriculture marine activities, commerce and handicraft production was well established.|$|E

5|$|Course {{officials}} resumed work by drilling shafts {{into the}} surface to form a well and installed a cap on it {{in an attempt to}} reduce the drainage problem before the start of Friday's scheduled sessions. It was mooted by some British press publications that the race would be moved to the track's infield road course but this could not be achieved because the circuit did not hold a licence from motorsport's world governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, to hold an event on this section, and the teams did not bring a suitable aerodynamic package. Drainage problems continued to affect the track leading to the cancellation of the qualifying session, and the starting order was determined by the drivers order in the points' standings. The pole position was awarded to Bräck, his sixth of the season. He was joined on the grid's front row by de Ferran. Andretti was third, Castroneves fourth and Dixon fifth. Dario Franchitti, Patrick Carpentier, Cristiano da Matta, Roberto Moreno and Tony Kanaan rounded out the top ten. Drying efforts continued overnight with additional equipment and extra workers from across England brought in to help improve the track's drainage. Five jet <b>dryers</b> were taken onto the track with additional fuel transported from Sywell Aerodrome to help the vehicles carry out their operation. Additionally, thousands of small holes were created in the track's surface to release moisture.|$|E
