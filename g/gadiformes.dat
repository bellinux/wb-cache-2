40|$|Great genetic {{variability}} among teleost immunomes, with gene {{losses and}} expansions of central adaptive and innate components, {{has been discovered}} through genome sequencing {{over the last few}} years. Here, we demonstrate that the innate Myxovirus resistance gene (Mx) is lost from the ancestor of <b>Gadiformes</b> and the closely related Stylephorus chordatus, thus predating the loss of Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHCII) in <b>Gadiformes.</b> Although the functional implication of Mx loss is still unknown, we demonstrate that this loss is one of several ancient events appearing in successive order throughout the evolution of teleost immunity. In particular, we find that the loss of Toll-like receptor 5 predates the loss of Mx involving the entire Paracanthopterygii lineage. Using a time-calibrated phylogeny, we show that loss of MHCII and Mx overlap with major paleoclimatic and geological events indicating thatthese genetic changes were adaptive responses to the changing environment at the time...|$|E

Lengths were 16, 569 and 16, 585 bases for whiting and haddock respectively, lengths which lie {{within the range}} of previously reported gadiform sequences from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua, 16, 696 bases) and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma, 16, 570 bases). Gene arrangement in both species conformed to the order seen in most vertebrate mitochondrial genomes. We identified a long intergenic spacer located between the tRNAThr and tRNAPro genes (of 100 and 70  bp long for whiting and haddock, respectively), as previously described for other species of the order <b>Gadiformes.</b> Using nucleotide and amino acid divergence data of four complete gadoid mitogenomes (M. merlangius, M. aeglefinus, G. morhua and T. chalcogramma), we examined in detail the relative mtDNA mutation patterns across genes and among Gadidae species and tested for the performance of each protein-coding, transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA gene in depicting the expected phylogeny among the four species, as compared with the whole genome dataset.

40|$|During {{the last}} 20 years, genome {{sequencing}} and assembly projects have changed from requiring large international collaborations to {{a task that}} {{a handful of people}} can plan and conduct. This has been driven by improvements in sequencing technology and computational methods. More and more sequencing and assembly projects are being conducted, with older assemblies being updated and improved, resulting in deeper understanding of the biology of a large and steadily growing number of species. The projects described in this thesis focus on genome assemblies created from species of the order <b>Gadiformes,</b> an order containing commercially and ecologically important fishes. Here, these assemblies are investigated in detail and compared to other teleost genome assemblies, with special attention to immune genes and short tandem repeats. We have updated and substantially improved the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) genome assembly with the use of different sequencing technologies and computational approaches. A major finding was that the presence of short tandem repeats (STRs) is the main factor that led to the fragmentation of the previous assembly. STRs are hypermutating loci that occur at high frequency (loci/Mbp) and high density (bp/Mbp) in the cod genome, surpassing that of other published genome assemblies. The STRs likely contribute to substantial genetic variation in natural cod populations. The Atlantic cod lacks genes involved in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II pathway, which is the pathway that normally detects and initiates a response against bacterial pathogens and thus is a crucial part of the adaptive immune system. To infer when in the ancestry of cod these genes were lost, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of 66 teleost species. We found that the loss is shared by all species in the order <b>Gadiformes,</b> and that there is an expanded repertoire of MHCI genes in the <b>Gadiformes,</b> which is likely connected with the large number of species in this order. Since the 66 new teleost (including gadiform) genome assemblies are fragmented, the properties of STRs and multi-copy immune genes are not easily investigated. To further elucidate their role in <b>Gadiformes,</b> we sequenced and assembled the genome of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), a relative of cod. Our result shows that the high density and frequency of STRs is a feature likely shared by all codfishes (a family inside <b>Gadiformes),</b> and possibly all <b>Gadiformes.</b> Cod and haddock share a similar repertoire of the innate immune Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes, with both losses and expansions. The expansions might be part of a compensatory mechanism for the absence of MHCII. Another class of genes, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) has been reported in large numbers in species without an adaptive immune system. We find that cod and haddock as well as most other teleosts generally have a high number of NLRs, with a likely expansion at the root of this clade. Thus, a high number of NLRs in teleosts {{does not seem to be}} connected with the presence or absence of MHCII. This thesis shows what kind of questions genome assemblies created for different purposes can answer. Ideally, genome assemblies for all kinds of species should be created, upgraded and updated based on the best available technologies. But this is costly. With the right planning and set-up, assemblies based on low-coverage sequencing can be very powerful with regards to topics such as the presence/absence of genes and for phylogeny. Also, even with moderate amounts of long-read PacBio sequencing, it is possible to create highly contiguous genome assemblies addressing issues that are impossible to elucidate with fragmented assemblies, such as the amount of multi-copy immune genes...|$|E
40|$|A methodological {{approach}} based on fish ecomorphology {{was chosen to}} predict potential fish diet. This study tests a method used in earlier research on a marine ecosystem containing phylogenetically diverse organisms: the North Sea. Fish feeding morphology imposes constraints on feeding options. A bottom-up perspective was {{used to describe the}} demands that food makes on fish feeding morphology. A set of quantitative morphological variables were measured on fish and compared to the demands made by different food-categories. Common North Sea <b>Gadiformes</b> and Pleuronectiformes were analysed. The results of the measurements were used as a basis for predictions of potential diet. Five ‘morphotypes’ were identified: Large-mouthed flatfish, small-mouthed flatfish, soles, ling/rockling/haddock and other <b>Gadiformes.</b> The predictions on diet were checked by stomach content data from literature. The main conclusions were that morphology differed significantly among fish species indicating detailed morphological adaptations to specific food types. Furthermore the utilization of fast, relatively large prey were predicted better than the utilization of slow or sessile prey that is well hidden, hard to crack or otherwise ‘tough to handle’. Also the method failed to clearly separate different food types within this group of fast/large prey. Moreover, no clear distinction in stomach contents were found between Large-mouthed flatfish (being predicted as eating mostly shrimp) and <b>Gadiformes</b> (being predicted as eating mostly fish) within the group of fast prey hunters. Overall predictions succeed in separating different feeding guilds, but in some cases do not succeed in distinguishing between species. Knowledge on feeding behaviour on slow and sedentary benthic prey is a limiting factor. Also limiting the usefulness of the study is the incomplete knowledge and/or implementation of this knowledge on the distribution of both benthic fish and benthic prey items...|$|E

Using genomic data we characterized the full hemoglobin (Hb) gene repertoire for subset of species within this lineage. We discovered a correlation between expanded numbers of Hb genes and ocean depth, with the highest numbers in species occupying shallower, epipelagic regions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Hb genes have functionally diverged through diversifying selection.
