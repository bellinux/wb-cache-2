25|$|Thus Lienhard’s text may be {{read from}} various perspectives. It fascinates as a {{detailed}} and captivating account of landscapes, fauna, and flora {{as well as}} of peoples and events. <b>Far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> story of adventure, it is a complex report of a racial conquest. The white intruders’ destruction of the environment, of animals, of indigenous peoples, and of their millennia-old communities as well as their infliction of forced servitude on the Indians, sexual exploitation of the indigenous women, of expulsion and death emerges with merciless clarity. Heinrich Lienhard’s account is thus a factual part-description of the Anglo-American conquest of the northern Western Hemisphere with its Janus-face of environmental destruction, racial annihilation, and of a simultaneous build-up of a vibrant Anglo-American variation of Western culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort the reality of what Minuit was trying to do. Both the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> mere 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly would have thought the trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nations—a 'good' that could not be valued in currency alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E

He points to some beautiful poetic passages, and concludes that [...] "the graceful winding up of this play [...] is one of the happiest instances of Shakespear's knowledge of the principles of the drama".|$|E

Inclusive language honors that each individual has a right to determine for themselves what self-referencing term is comfortable and best reflects their personal identity.|$|R
500|$|A good {{relationship}} quickly developed between Ramsey {{and his new}} manager, finding that they shared similar personalities and views on tactics. Like Ramsey, Rowe believed in a progressive, fast-moving style of play. These ideas evolved into [...] "push-and-run", a playing style unlike anything previously attempted in British football, based around quick passing. Tottenham pioneered the style to good effect—a Spurs player moving forward would lay the ball off to a teammate, then run past the opposing defender to receive an immediate return pass. [...] "Under Rowe, Alf became <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> defender," [...] comments McKinstry. Rowe tasked him with instigating attacks and based much of the Tottenham game plan around Ramsey's accurate passing.|$|E

But just as Push achieves an eloquence that makes it <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> fictional diary of extreme dysfunction, so too does Precious avoid the traps of well-meaning, preachy lower-depths realism.

At its plainest and most persuasive, her story is that of a writer discovering a voice.

500|$|The {{story is}} divided into 21 chapters, with each chapter {{switching}} between the points-of-view of the supervillain Dr. Impossible and the superhero Fatale. The narrative is written in the first person, like a memoir, describing the inner monologues of the two protagonists. The dual narrative foils and [...] "blur the distinction" [...] between the superheroes and the supervillain. The language was described as having a [...] "sincere tone of glory" [...] and [...] "boyish indulgence" [...] with [...] "an undercurrent of sadness and a surprisingly human universality". While the story uses standard comic book story elements, like superheroes fighting supervillains, the book is written entirely in prose. The story combines a satire of superhero archetypes and comic book clichés, {{such as the use}} of many superlatives, with realist elements that portray the sometimes mundane lives and everyday challenges of its characters, like coping with cybernetic body parts that weigh <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> natural body and that react before the brain registers what is happening. Common social situations and psychological issues, like loneliness and trying to connect with a group, are also portrayed. Reviewers identified numerous themes, such as power, greed, fame, ego, loneliness, belonging, and identity.|$|E
500|$|Ed Greenwood {{began writing}} {{stories about the}} Forgotten Realms as a child, {{starting}} around 1967; they were his [...] "dream space for swords and sorcery stories". Greenwood {{came up with the}} Forgotten Realms name from the notion of a multiverse of parallel worlds; Earth is one such world, and the Realms another. In Greenwood's original conception, the fantastic legends of Earth derive from a fantasy world, the way to which has been lost. Greenwood discovered the Dungeons & Dragons game in 1975, and became a serious role-playing enthusiast with the first AD game releases in 1978. The setting became the home of Greenwood's personal campaign. Greenwood began a Realms campaign in the city of Waterdeep, then started another group known as the Knights of Myth Drannor in Shadowdale. Greenwood felt that his players' thirst for detail made the Realms what it is: [...] "They want it to seem real, and work on ‘honest jobs’ and personal activities, until the whole thing grows into <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> casual campaign. Roleplaying always governs over rules, and the adventures seem to develop themselves." [...] Greenwood has stated that his own version of the Forgotten Realms, as run in his personal campaign, is much darker than published versions.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld's Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for Children were a {{revolution}} in children's literature. For the first time, {{the needs of the}} child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them and, even more important, she developed a style of [...] "informal dialogue between parent and child" [...] that would dominate children's literature for a generation. In Lessons for Children, a four-volume, age-adapted reading primer, Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son. More than likely, many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld's experience of teaching her own son, Charles. This series is <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> way to acquire literacy—it also introduces the reader to [...] "elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility." [...] Moreover, it exposes the child to the principles of [...] "botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry ... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [...] astronomy." [...] The series was relatively popular and Maria Edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co-authored with her father, Practical Education (1798), that it is [...] "one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared." ...|$|E
