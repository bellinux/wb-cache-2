5|$|At Goerdeler's insistence, Stauffenberg {{is ordered}} to assassinate both Hitler and SS head Himmler at the Führer's command bunker, the Wolf's Lair. At a final briefing, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim instructs the {{committee}} {{members in the}} use of pencil detonators. Stauffenberg also persuades General Fellgiebel, who controls all communications at Wolf's Lair, to cut off communications after the bomb blast. On July15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf's Lair with the bomb in his briefcase, but with Himmler not present at the meeting, Stauffenberg does not get the go-ahead from the committee leaders, and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to do it anyway, the meeting is over. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht, unbeknownst to Fromm, to stand by. With no action taken, Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker, and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down, believing that the mobilization was a drill. Back in Berlin, Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> to control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler, who has been selected to be chancellor after the coup. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.|$|E
25|$|The {{theme of}} the 2009 horror film The Human Centipede (First Sequence) {{is that of a}} sadistic, psychopathic retired surgeon torturing three people by surgically {{connecting}} them mouth to rectum, forcing the last two to swallow the excrement of the person {{in front of them and}} physically beating all three of them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> to rebel or escape.|$|E
25|$|Hardcore wrestlers get {{momentum}} {{bonuses for}} using weapons. They can also perform grapple moves while holding a weapon. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> {{to use a}} steel chair with full momentum, they automatically perform the Steel Chair DDT. If they are caused to bleed, they instantly get full momentum. Their special move can only be performed with a steel chair in hand. They strike themselves in the face repeated until they bleed. While this causes full momentum, it also causes critical head damage.|$|E

25|$|The live {{rock with}} mantis shrimp burrows are {{actually}} considered useful by {{some in the}} marine aquarium trade and are often collected. It {{is not uncommon for}} a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> to make a home within it.|$|E
25|$|A bowler may {{attempt to}} run out a batsman who leaves his ground before he {{delivers}} the ball, but must do so before he reaches the point in his action when he would normally release the ball. It is unfair for batsmen to attempt to steal runs during the bowler's run-up. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> the umpires will allow the bowler to attempt a run out. Should the bowler not attempt a run out then the umpires will call dead ball, return the batsmen to their previous ends and award a 5 run penalty to the fielding side.|$|E
25|$|Progressive Jargon Aphasia is a fluent or {{receptive}} aphasia {{in which the}} patient's speech is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact syntax and grammar, but the patient has problems with the selection of nouns. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with sounds. As such, patients with jargon aphasia often use neologisms, and may perseverate <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> to replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).|$|E

25|$|Waste {{material}} is removed continuously and deposited in refuse piles as above (or even by some Atta ants into streams). The {{division of labour}} in Acromyrmex echinatior leafcutter ants includes individuals who work almost exclusively in waste management: waste material (excreta, food refuse, etc.) frequently harbours Escovopsis (a microfungus that is parasitic on the fungus that A. echinatior tends) {{as well as other}} parasites, so spatial separation of waste material from the fungal garden and wider nest environment is of paramount importance. This is achieved by depositing waste material on downhill and downwind piles or in special deep underground refuse chambers. Distinct waste management workers also exist in Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica. The risk of waste-worker ants contaminating the fungal garden/nest is lowered by other ants attacking them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> to enter the nest, whilst attacks are more frequent in species with internal refuse chambers (this also reinforces the division of labour). On the other hand, some species retain excreta and/or anal exudates within the nest to utilize it for antiparasite purposes: C. formosanus employs its faces as building material for the nest carton, the use of faceal material promotes the growth of Actinobacteria with natural antimicrobial activity (e.g. Streptomyces), combating fungal parasites like M. anisopliae. Colony members of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) defend themselves against the virulent Crithidia bombi parasite by consuming beneficial gut bacteria from the faces of conspecific after eclosing.|$|E

500|$|... "Turn Up the Music" [...] is an uptempo {{electronic}} dance, {{and house}} song, which {{last for a}} duration of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. Instrumentation is provided by pulsating beats, synthesizers and percussion. Rap-Up described the production as [...] "synth-heavy". The song opens with Brown singing [...] "Turn up the music cause the sun just came up / Turn up the music <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> to turn us down / Turn up the music cause I'm trying to hear the speakers blow / Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down". It is then followed by repeated chants of [...] "If you're sexy {{and you know it}} put your hands up in the air". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the chanting was a reference to LMFAO's [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] (2011). Andy Kellman of Allmusic likened the song to Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Junpei wakes up in a cabin inside a cruise liner, wearing a {{bracelet}} displaying the number [...] "5". He escapes the room, and encounters eight people, including June. Zero announces over a loudspeaker that all nine are participants in the Nonary Game. Zero explains the rules, and states each carry an explosive in their stomach that will go off <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>try</b> to bypass the digital root door locks. The 9th Man still goes through a door by himself, and is killed. Fearing what harm might come to them, the group adopts code names, and splits up to explore the ship. The player has the option to select which group that Junpei travels with, which affects the story; several choices lead to Junpei's death. Through various choices, Junpei learns of a previous Nonary Game, played nine years earlier, and the connections of the other characters through that, as well as studies about morphic resonance and stories of the Egyptian priestess Alice, who is frozen in ice-9.|$|E

[...] Some are naive, as in Pandora by Holly Hollander or The Knight; others are not particularly intelligent (There Are Doors); Severian, from The Book of the New Sun, is not always truthful; and Latro of the Soldier series suffers from recurrent amnesia.|$|E
2500|$|Clubs from smaller {{countries}} {{also have}} problems with this issue. Due to their smaller population base they receive less money from television rights.

Some clubs have managed to buck the trend by training players through their youth academies, as well as making wise investments.
