[...] The Guardians Alexis Petridis commented that the song [...] "lurches along on 's patent half-speed rhythm." [...] While Keith Caufield of Billboard considered [...] "Inside Out" [...] "easily a natural pick for 'Femme's' third single", Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said that [...] "in general the song failed to hold my attention. If I heard <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio,</b> I probably would change the station." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the song a negative review, considering it a [...] "weak mid-tempo fare", along with [...] "Criminal".
