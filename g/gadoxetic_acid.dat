Methods: A total of 176 patients with 252 liver lesions were analyzed. There were 104 malignant and 148 benign lesions. High-field strength (1. 0 T or 1. 5 T) MR systems with T 1 -and T 2 -weighted sequences were used with and without fat suppression. After <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> disodium injection, dynamic imaging and hepatocyte phase MR imaging were performed. Biphasic with 150 mg I/kg of body weight (100 - 200 mL) spiral CT was also performed. Image reading consisted of on-site (by study investigators) and fully blinded off-site (by E. S. P; C. R; and A.

MR imaging was performed before and immediately after injection, and in the delayed phase at approved time points (20 min after injection of <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> and 40 min after injection of gadobenate dimeglumine). The relative liver enhancement for the overall population and a cirrhotic subgroup was compared in T 1 -weighted GRE sequences. An independent radiologist performed signal intensity measurements.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: In {{the current}} era of {{emerging}} molecular targeted drugs, {{it is necessary}} to identify before treatment the specific subclass to which a tumour belongs. <b>Gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> is a liver-specific contrast agent that is preferentially taken up by hepatocytes. Therefore, gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) should provide precise molecular information about hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the transporters of <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> in HCC comprehensively and to analyse the molecular regulatory mechanism of such transporters. METHODS : Expression levels of transporters, transcriptional factors and Wnt target genes in clinical samples were examined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. LiCl treatment of the HCC cell line KYN- 2 was conducted in vitro to assess the effects of Wnt signalling activity. RESULTS: Comprehensive analyses of transporter mRNAs and protein expressions revealed that the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 B 3 (OATP 1 B 3) had the strongest correlation with tumour enhancement in hepatobiliary-phase images of EOB-MRI. Association analysis with OATP 1 B 3 expression revealed significant correlation with the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Further, LiCl treatment induced OATP 1 B 3 mRNA expression in KYN- 2 cells, indicating a strong association between OATP 1 B 3 expression and Wnt/β-catenin signalling. The sensitivity and specificity to predict Wnt/β-catenin-activated HCC using tumour enhancement in EOB-MRI were 78. 9 % and 81. 7 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: OATP 1 B 3 was confirmed as the most important transporter mediating HCC enhancement in EOB-MRI. OATP 1 B 3 expression showed a strong association with the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes, therefore, OATP 1 B 3 -upregulated HCC likely represents a specific subclass of Wnt/β-catenin-activated HCC...|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic performance of imaging features of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to differentiate among hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) subtypes {{by using the}} histopathologic results of the new immunophenotype and genotype classification and to correlate the enhancement pattern on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) with the degrees of expression of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP 1 B 1 / 3), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP) (MRP 2), and MRP 3 (MRP 3) transporters. Materials and Methods This retrospective study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent waived. MR imaging findings of 29 patients with 43 HCAs were assessed by two radiologists independently then compared with the histopathologic analysis as the standard of reference. Receiver operating characteristic curves and Spearman rank correlation coefficient were used to test the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging features, which included the retention or washout at HBP and degree of transporter expression. Interreader agreement was assessed by using the κ statistic with 95 % confidence interval. Results The area under the curve for the diagnosis of inflammatory HCA was 0. 79 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 64, 0. 90); for the steatotic type, it was 0. 90 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 77, 0. 97); and for the β-catenin type, it was 0. 87 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 74, 0. 95). There were no imaging features that showed a significant statistical correlation for the diagnosis of unclassified HCAs. On immunohistochemical staining, OATP 1 B 1 / 3 expression was the main determinant for the retention, whereas MRP 3 was the key determinant for washout of <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> at HBP (P <. 001). MRP 2 appeared to have no role. Conclusion Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging features may suggest the subtype of HCA.

Ten of Sprague-Dawley rats receiving TAA (200 mg/kg of body weight) intraperitoneal injection were divided into three groups: Group 1 (TAA only, n = 3), Group 2 (TAA + 0. 25 g/kg SST, n = 4) and Group 3 (TAA+ 1 g/kg SST, n = 3). Core needle liver biopsy at week 2 and liver specimens after sacrifice at week 6 confirmed liver fibrosis using histological examinations, including Sirius red staining, Ishak and Metavir scoring systems. Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and shear-wave sonoelastography were employed to evaluate liver fibrosis. The expression of hepatic transporter organic anion transporter 1 (Oatp 1), multidrug-resistant protein 2 (Mrp 2) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-Sma) were also analyzed in each group by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot. According to histological grading by Sirius red staining, Ishak scores of liver fibrosis in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were 3, 2 and 1, respectively. As shown in gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, the ratio of relative enhancement was significantly lower in Group 1 (1. 87 ± 0. 21) than in Group 2 of low-dose (2. 82 ± 0. 25) and Group 3 of high-dose (2. 72 ± 0. 12) SST treatment at 10 minutes after <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> intravenous injection (p < 0. 05). Sonoelastography showed that the mean difference before and after experiments in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were 4. 66 ± 0. 1, 4. 4 ± 0. 57 and 3 ± 0. 4 KPa (p < 0. 1), respectively. Chemopreventive effects of SST reduced the Mrp 2 protein level (p < 0. 01) but not Oatp 1 and α-Sma levels. Sonoelastography and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI could monitor the treatment effect of SST in an animal model of early hepatic fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the potency of}} Gd-EOB-DTPA to support hepatic catheter placement in laser ablation procedures by quantifying time-dependent delineation effects for instrumentation and target tumor within liver parenchyma. Monitoring potential influence on online MR thermometry during the ablation procedure is a secondary aim. Materials and Methods: 30 cases of MR-guided laser ablation were performed after i. v. bolus injection of <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 025 mmol/Kg Gd-EOB-DTPA; Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany). T 1 -weighted GRE sequences were used for applicator guidance (FLASH 3 D) in the catheter placement phase and for therapy monitoring (FLASH 2 D) in the therapy phase. SNR and consecutive CNR values were measured for elements of interest plotted over time both for catheter placement and therapy phase and compared with a non-contrast control group of 19 earlier cases. Statistical analysis was realized using the paired Wilcoxon test. Results: Sustainable signal elevation of liver parenchyma in the contrast-enhance...|$|E
40|$|Objective <b>Gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{disodium}} (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is {{a magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent to target the liver cells with normal function. In clinical practice, the Gd-EOB-DTPA produces high quality hepatocyte specific image 20 minutes after intravenous injection, so DWI sequence is often performed after the conventional dynamic scanning. However, {{there are still some}} disputes about whether DWI sequence will provide more effective diagnostic information in clinical practice. This study aimed to explore the diagnostic value of combin-ing Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and DWI in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed and Cochrane library data-base up to March 2015. The quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Heterogeneous test on the included literature was performed by using the software Review Manager 5. 3. The MetaDiSc 1. 4 software wa...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} whether <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gd-EOB-DTPA) -enhanced MR images of tumors {{taken during the}} hepatocyte-specific phase can aid in the differentiation between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and dysplastic nodules (DNs) in patients with atypical cirrhotic nodules detected on dynamic CT images. Materials and Methods: Seventy-one patients with 112 nodules showing atypical dynamic enhancement on CT images underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging (MRI) studies. Using a reference standard, we determined that 33 of the nodules were DNs and that 79 were true HCCs. Tumor size, signal intensity on precontrast T 1 -weighted images (T 1 WI) and T 2 WI, and the pattern of dynamic enhancement on MR images taken in the hepatocyte-phase were determined. Results: There were significant differences in tumor size, hyperintensity on T 2 WI, hypointensity on T 1 WI, typical HCC enhancement pattern on dynamic MR images, or hypointensity on hepatocyte-phase images between DNs and HCC.

40|$|Abstract: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging, MRI {{has more}} advantages than ultrasound, computed tomography, CT, positron emission tomography, PET, {{or any other}} imaging modality in diagnosing focal hepatic masses. With a combination of ba-sic T 1 and T 2 weighted sequences, diffusion weighted imaging, DWI, and hepatobiliary gadolinium contrast agents, that is gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) and <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gd-EOB), most liver lesions can be adequately diagnosed. Benign lesions, as cyst, hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, FNH or adenoma, can be distinguished from malignant lesions. In a non-cirrhotic liver, the most common malignant lesions are metastases which may be hypovascular or hyper-vascular. In the cirrhotic liver hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC, is of considerable importance. Besides, intrahepatic cho-langiocarcinoma and other less common malignancies has to be assessed. In this review, the techniques and typical MRI features are presented {{as well as the}} new algorithm issued by American Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases (AASLD) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} the competitive {{potential of a}} new lipophilic paramagnetic complex, Gd-Bz-TTDA [4 -benzyl- 3, 6, 10 -tri (carboxymethyl) - 3, 6, 10 -triazado-decanedioic acid] compared with two other commercially available MR hepatobiliary contrast agents, gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) and <b>gadoxetic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gd-EOB-DTPA), dynamic MR imaging studies were performed on normal and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rat models using a 1. 5 -Tesla MR scanner. The results indicate that normal rats that were injected with 0. 1  mmol/kg Gd-Bz-TTDA showed significantly more intense and persistent liver enhancement than those that were injected with the same dose of Gd-EOB-DTPA or Gd-BOPTA. All of these agents showed similar enhancement patterns in the implanted HCC. The liver-lesion contrast-to-noise ratios were higher and more persistent in rats that were injected with Gd-Bz-TTDA. These results indicate that Gd-Bz-TTDA is comparable with the commercially available hepatobiliary agents, Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA, and can result in more intense and prolonged liver enhancement while still providing better liver-lesion discrimination. These results warrant further large-scale studies...|$|E
