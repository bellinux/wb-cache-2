Ubuntu is {{installed}} within a file in the Windows file system (c:\ubuntu\disks\root.disk), {{as opposed to being}} installed within its own partition. This file is seen by Linux as a real hard disk. Wubi also creates a swap file in the Windows file system (c:\ubuntu\disks\swap.disk), in addition to the memory of the <b>host</b> <b>machine.</b> This file is seen by Ubuntu as additional RAM.|$|E
500|$|Most Spectrum {{software}} {{has been}} converted to current media and is available for download. One popular program for converting Spectrum files from tape is Taper; it allows connecting a cassette tape player to the line in port of a sound card, or—through a simple home-built device—to the parallel port of a PC. Once in files on a <b>host</b> <b>machine,</b> the software can be executed on an emulator.|$|E

50|$|Fast {{access is}} also useful for interpreters. Most {{register}} interpreters specify their registers by number. But a <b>host</b> <b>machine's</b> registers can't be accessed in an indexed array, so a memory array is allotted for virtual registers. Therefore, the instructions of a register interpreter must use memory for passing generated {{data to the}} next instruction. This forces register interpreters to be much slower on microprocessors made with a fine process rule (i.e. faster transistors without improving circuit speeds, such as the Haswell x86). These require several clocks for memory access, but only one clock for register access. In {{the case of a}} stack machine with a data forwarding circuit instead of a register file, stack interpreters can allot the <b>host</b> <b>machine's</b> registers for the top several operands of the stack instead of the <b>host</b> <b>machine's</b> memory.|$|R

2500|$|In June 2010, Google {{software}} engineer Gary Kačmarčík wrote that Chrome OS will access remote applications through a technology unofficially called [...] "Chromoting", which would resemble Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection. The name {{has since been}} changed to [...] "Chrome Remote Desktop", and is [...] "probably closer to running an application via Remote Desktop Services or by first connecting to a <b>host</b> <b>machine</b> by using RDP or VNC". [...] Initial roll-outs of Chrome OS laptops (Chromebooks) indicate an interest in enabling users to access virtual desktops.|$|E
2500|$|Optical drives virtualized in {{the guest}} VM are read-only. Officially Hyper-V {{does not support the}} host/root {{operating}} system's optical drives to pass-through in guest VMs. As a result, burning to discs, audio CDs, video CD/DVD-Video playback are not supported; however, a workaround exists using the iSCSI protocol. [...] Setting up an iSCSI target on the <b>host</b> <b>machine</b> with the optical drive can then be talked to by the standard Microsoft iSCSI initiator. [...] Microsoft produces their own iSCSI Target software or alternative third party products can be used.|$|E
2500|$|Community Memory {{allowed the}} user to type {{messages}} into a computer terminal after inserting a coin, and offered a [...] "pure" [...] bulletin board experience with public messages only (no email or other features). It did offer the ability to tag messages with keywords, which the user could use in searches. The system acted primarily {{in the form of}} a buy and sell system with the tags taking the place of the more traditional classifications. But users found ways to express themselves outside these bounds, and the system spontaneously created stories, poetry and other forms of communications. Unfortunately, the system was expensive to operate, and when their <b>host</b> <b>machine</b> became unavailable and a new one could not be found, the system closed in January 1975.|$|E
50|$|In some {{interpreter}}s, {{the interpreter}} must execute a N-way switch jump to decode the next opcode and branch to its steps {{for that particular}} opcode. Another method for selecting opcodes is threaded code. The <b>host</b> <b>machine's</b> prefetch mechanisms are unable to predict and fetch the target of that indexed or indirect jump. So the <b>host</b> <b>machine's</b> execution pipeline must restart each time the hosted interpreter decodes another virtual instruction. This happens more often for virtual stack machines than for other styles of virtual machine.|$|R
50|$|Virtual {{machines}} running proprietary {{operating systems}} require licensing, {{regardless of the}} <b>host</b> <b>machine's</b> operating system. For example, installing Microsoft Windows into a VM guest requires its licensing requirements to be satisfied.|$|R

This paper proposes a trackback model for identifying attackers and locating their distributed sources in real time. Attackers are identified by monitoring violations of malicious end users on their bandwidth shares predefined in the service level agreement. Then, active connections of the malicious users are investigated to locate the <b>host</b> <b>machines</b> used as distributed sources of attack traffic. Mathematical model and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can reduce the required time for identifying malicious users and locating <b>host</b> <b>machines</b> used as the actual sources of attack packet...|$|R

When this type of attack takes place the victim and the attacker must be on the same network. Another form of TCP/IP hijacking is RST hijacking, which involves injecting a fake reset packet.|$|E
