[...] In 1902, Cyclax began to sell cosmetics generally and by 1910 there were over 40 preparations in the Cyclax range including skin care products, hair care products, face powders, <b>eye</b> <b>lotions,</b> lip lotions and soap.

40|$|Present study {{deals with}} {{a brief review of}} the quality control tests for the eye {{preparations}} as per the different pharmacopoeias. The quality control tests for eye preparations are different in the different pharmacopoeias like IP, BP, and USP. Eye preparations are sterile liquid, semi-solid or solid preparations intended for administration upon the eyeball and/or to the conjunctiva, or for insertion in the conjunctival sac. It is necessary to know the quality requirements of the different pharmacopoeias for the eye preparations as it is required and important to guarantee the quality product and their supply in different markets of the world. The main aim of the study is to compare the quality control tests for eye preparations as per the IP, BP and USP. The formulations which are taken in to consideration are eye drops, eye ointments, powders for eye drops and <b>eye</b> <b>lotions,</b> semi-solid eye preparations, ophthalmic inserts and <b>eye</b> <b>lotions</b> (or) eye solutions. The types of tests/parameters, procedures and the pharmacopoeial limits/specifications for eye preparations were compared. The quality control tests for different eye preparations are more elaborately given in IP and BP in comparison to USP. The available tests and limits supplement each other and one pharmacopoeia gives more details on a specific test than the other. For eg: Powders for eye drops and eyelotions, semi-solid eye preparations, ophthalmic insertswere specifically given in BP...|$|E
50|$|The legend is {{that the}} pub is named for a herbalist had lived {{on the site of}} the pub, due to the nearby spring which had {{curative}} properties.

50|$|The dried corollas and stamens of Sambucus nigra L. (Sambucus, British Pharmaceutical Codex, 1949) {{have been}} used as a vehicle for <b>eye</b> and skin <b>lotions,</b> while the fruits are to promote urination.|$|R
50|$|The fruits {{are applied}} on cuts and ulcers; are {{employed}} in pulmonary ailments and fevers; and, mixed with salt and chili peppers, are given in indigestion and biliousness. The dried ripe fruit is a mild laxative. The seeds are sedative and are taken, sometimes with buttermilk, to halt nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pains in pregnancy. They check diarrhea, and are poulticed on wounds. Mixed with oil, they are rubbed on rheumatic areas. The leaves are applied as poultices and are helpful in liver troubles, asthma and fever and, together with catechu, are administered when an astringent is needed, as on wounds. The bitter, astringent bark decoction is taken to halt diarrhea and dysentery and relieve gingivitis. The bark paste is applied on sores. The root is purgative. A root decoction is given as a febrifuge, taenicide and emmenagogue, and the powdered root is dusted on wounds. Juice of the root bark is said to alleviate gout and rheumatism. Strong doses of the bark or root may be toxic. An infusion of the flowers serves as an <b>eye</b> <b>lotion.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) mature fruit (commonly {{known as}} seeds) and {{essential}} oil of fennel {{are widely used}} as flavoring agents in food products such as liqueurs, bread, cheese, and an ingredient of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Moreover fennel infusions are the classical decoction for nursing babies to prevent flatulence and colic spasm. Traditionally in Europe and Mediterranean areas fennel {{is used as a}}ntispasmodic, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, secretomotor, secretolytic, galactagogue, <b>eye</b> <b>lotion,</b> and antioxidant remedy and integrator. Topically, fennel powder is used as a poultice for snake bites. In Asian cultures fennel was ingested to speed the elimination of poisons.

Crushed with lemon they are effective for worms in children. With Alchornea leaves and lemon a gargle is made from the leaves. They are crushed to obtain the juice. A decoction of pounded leaves is used as an <b>eye</b> <b>lotion</b> and the juice pressed from young, warm leaves is given to children for stomach troubles. The young leaves are used as an infusion taken internally or as a warm astringent lotion by women in confinement in Sierra Leone. In the Congo the young leaves pounded to a frothy pulp are used as a bed for paralytics, who are then massaged with them to the accompaninent of incantations.In Suriname's traditional medicine, the infusion of the leaves is used as a treatment of eye inflammation, diarrhea and venereal diseases.|$|R
50|$|Various ear {{diseases}} and infections {{are treated with}} eardrops containing triethanolamine polypeptide oleate-condensate, such as Cerumenex in the United States. In pharmaceutics, triethanolamine is the active ingredient of some eardrops used to treat impacted earwax. It {{also serves as a}} pH balancer in many different cosmetic products, ranging from cleansing creams and milks, skin <b>lotions,</b> <b>eye</b> gels, moisturizers, shampoos, shaving foams, and so on. TEA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10, whereas the pH of skin is less than pH 7, approximately 5.5−6.0. Cleansing milk-cream emulsions based on TEA are particularly good at removing makeup. (HOCH2)3N was used in the synthesis of amustaline.|$|R
5000|$|Cowin's One Night Stand, her 1977-1978 {{suite of}} about 38 images that convey both {{conceptual}} and narrative elements, anticipated the formal rigor and emotional depth {{that have become}} her oeuvre's hallmark. Writing in her mid-career survey catalog, Mark Alice Durant remarked how the “tone and color of the photographs are flat and unaffected, a strategy {{in keeping with the}} minimalist and non-theatrical aesthetic of the time. Yet even these distancing mechanisms do not obscure Cowin’s playfulness and interest in the structures of intimacy. … a humble piece of furniture,… it asks little back for its services. A nightstand may hold a water glass, <b>eye</b> glasses, skin <b>lotion,</b> birth control devices, family pictures, prescriptions, bedside reading, and may also bear silent witness to a one night stand with an inappropriate but fabulous lover. …Instant photographic prints {{of men and women in}} various stages of disrobing peak out from behind phone cords and alarm clocks, betraying what might have occurred in these rooms, just moments before.” ...|$|R
