5|$|Iron {{reacts with}} fluorine, chlorine, and bromine {{to give the}} {{corresponding}} <b>ferric</b> halides, <b>ferric</b> chloride being the most common.|$|E
5|$|The binary ferrous and <b>ferric</b> halides are well-known, {{with the}} {{exception}} of <b>ferric</b> iodide. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding hydrohalic acid to give the corresponding hydrated salts.|$|E
5|$|A further {{point to}} note is that drinking-water {{treatment}} commonly involves {{the addition of}} treatment chemicals such as aluminium sulfate or <b>ferric</b> chloride as flocculants, lime for pH adjustment, chlorine for disinfection and fluoride compounds for dental health.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans are rare, ingestion of <b>ferric</b> chloride {{can result in}} serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{milligram}} {{amounts of}} <b>ferric</b> iodide, a black solid, {{may still be}} prepared through the reaction of iron pentacarbonyl with iodine and carbon monoxide {{in the presence of}} hexane and light at the temperature of −20°C, making sure that the system is well sealed off from air and water.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} ash {{has been found to}} be approximately 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminium oxide, 5% <b>ferric</b> oxide, 4% each calcium oxide and sodium oxide and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05–0.09% chlorine, 0.02–0.03% fluorine, and 0.09–0.3% sulphur.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} <b>ferric</b> iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
5|$|Another line of {{research}} involved the biochemistry of the hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin system. Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation and reduction, {{following in the footsteps}} of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a <b>ferric</b> (FeIII) centre, unlike the ferrous (FeII) centre found in normal hemoglobin, and this difference in oxidation state is the cause of methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|Gallium has {{no known}} natural role in biology. Gallium(III) behaves {{in a similar}} manner to <b>ferric</b> salts in {{biological}} systems, and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals. Gallium is used in thermometers as a non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury.|$|E
5|$|Gallium maltolate, an oral, highly {{absorbable}} form of gallium(III) ion, is an anti-proliferative to pathologically proliferating cells, particularly {{cancer cells}} and some bacteria that accept {{it in place}} of <b>ferric</b> iron (Fe3+). Researchers are conducting clinical and preclinical trials on this compound as a potential treatment {{for a number of}} cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases.|$|E
5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} <b>ferric</b> chloride, is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air. It is rarely observed in its natural form, the mineral molysite, known mainly from some fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ferric</b> {{chloride}} test is {{a traditional}} colorimetric test for phenols, which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The mixture is filtered before use. The organic substance is dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised iron(III) chloride solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates {{the presence of a}} phenol or enol.|$|E
5|$|The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H2 {{increases}} with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H2 contains {{large quantities of}} the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as <b>ferric</b> oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E
5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from <b>ferric</b> to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan celadon wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic <b>ferric</b> chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, kaolinite, prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and <b>ferric</b> minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of carbon}} dioxide and oxygen is {{approximately}} 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, <b>ferric</b> ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, <b>ferric</b> oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E
25|$|Iron oxide {{adsorption}} filters {{the water}} through a granular medium containing <b>ferric</b> oxide. <b>Ferric</b> oxide {{has a high}} affinity for adsorbing dissolved metals such as arsenic. The iron oxide medium eventually becomes saturated, and must be replaced. The sludge disposal is a problem here too.|$|E
25|$|Alum and <b>ferric</b> {{chloride}} {{are other}} chemical flocculants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ferric</b> {{chloride}} {{is added}} to destroy any byproduct.|$|E
25|$|Today, however, most {{trichloroethylene}} {{is produced}} from ethylene. First, ethylene is chlorinated over a <b>ferric</b> chloride catalyst to produce 1,2-dichloroethane.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, <b>ferric</b> oxides in {{the form}} of {{crystalline}} grey hematite that probably required water for its formation have been found.|$|E
25|$|In {{anaerobic}} environments, different electron acceptors are used, including nitrate, nitrite, <b>ferric</b> iron, sulfate, carbon dioxide, {{and small}} organic molecules such as fumarate.|$|E
25|$|The {{net effect}} of these {{reactions}} is to release H+, which lowers the pH and maintains the solubility of the <b>ferric</b> ion.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} {{is used in}} a chemical test {{for the detection of}} aldehydes in combination with <b>ferric</b> chloride. In this test a few drops of aldehyde containing specimen is dissolved in ethanol, the sulfonamide is added together with some sodium hydroxide solution and then the solution is acidified to Congo red. An added drop of <b>ferric</b> chloride will turn the solution an intense red when aldehyde is present. The sulfonamide can be prepared by reaction of hydroxylamine and benzenesulfonyl chloride in ethanol with potassium metal.|$|E
25|$|Most {{pre-recorded}} chrome cassettes require 120 µs equalisation and {{are treated}} as Type I (with notches as Type I <b>ferric</b> cassettes), to ensure compatibility with budget equipment.|$|E
25|$|Escherichia coli secrets many iron-siderophore transports, but produce {{only one}} siderophore—enterobactin. The <b>ferric</b> enterobactin {{receptor}} FepA recognises the catecholate part of <b>ferric</b> enterobactin (FeEnt), and transports {{it across the}} outer membrane from the extracellular space into the periplasm. The binding {{is thought to be}} in two phases, a fast step which recognises FeEnt, and a slower step which may be the first step in translocation—preparing the complex for translocation. Both steps occur independently of the TonB–ExbB–ExbD complex and the proton motive force it provides.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemistry}} of oxidation of pyrites, {{the production of}} ferrous ions and subsequently <b>ferric</b> ions, is very complex, and this complexity has considerably inhibited the design of effective treatment options.|$|E
25|$|Phosphoric acid {{may be used}} {{to remove}} rust by direct {{application}} to rusted iron, steel tools, or other surfaces. The phosphoric acid changes the reddish-brown iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3 (rust), to <b>ferric</b> phosphate, FePO4.|$|E
25|$|Coyote {{appears as}} an animal in The Book of Sorrows by Walter Wangerin, Jr., wherein scrawny <b>Ferric</b> accidentally sets {{in motion a}} chain of events that bring Heaven and Hell {{crashing}} down upon the land.|$|E
25|$|Like most mineral nutrients, the {{majority}} of the iron absorbed from digested food or supplements is absorbed in the duodenum by enterocytes of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body. To be absorbed, dietary iron can be absorbed as part of a protein such as heme protein or iron must be in its ferrous Fe2+ form. A <b>ferric</b> reductase enzyme on the enterocytes’ brush border, duodenal cytochrome B (Dcytb), reduces <b>ferric</b> Fe3+ to Fe2+. A protein called divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), which can transport several divalent metals across the plasma membrane, then transports iron across the enterocyte’s cell membrane into the cell.|$|E
25|$|Friedel–Crafts {{alkylation}} {{involves the}} alkylation of an aromatic ring with an alkyl halide using a strong Lewis acid catalyst. With anhydrous <b>ferric</b> chloride as a catalyst, the alkyl group attaches {{at the former}} site of the chloride ion. The general mechanism is shown below.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for medium active wastes in the nuclear {{industry}} {{to be treated with}} ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a <b>ferric</b> hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the <b>ferric</b> hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or blast furnace slag, and Portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).|$|E
25|$|Many {{bacteria}} secrete small iron-binding molecules called siderophores, which bind {{strongly to}} <b>ferric</b> ions. FepA {{is an integral}} bacterial outer membrane porin protein, which {{is involved in the}} active transport of iron bound by the siderophore enterobactin from the extracellular space, into the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Oxalic acid's main {{applications}} include cleaning or bleaching, {{especially for}} the removal of rust (iron complexing agent). Bar Keepers Friend {{is an example of a}} household cleaner containing oxalic acid. Its utility in rust removal agents is due to its forming a stable, water-soluble salt with <b>ferric</b> iron, ferrioxalate ion.|$|E
