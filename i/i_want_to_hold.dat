Singles, [...] "Yellow Pansy Street", [...] "Tsubusa ni Koi", [...] "My Home" [...] serve as breaks in-between the album originals before the album closes with the ballad, [...] "wander", a lyrically heavy song that is filled emotional encouragement. [...] " [...] Give me the reason, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> on to it/As I stand in a field I trust/I breath out as I continue on this path/Holding my head up proudly/As beautiful flowers bloom from my footprints/Where to wonder?

[...] "I {{had a sudden}} realization of how great he was and how great life was, and how timid and mean and sordid were all our genteel, professional lives.

Do you like etchings? Yes? So glad we have another taste in common. The portfolio with the red back, Louis. Don't drop it! You have no idea of the tortures I should suffer, Mr. Hartright, if Louis dropped that portfolio. Is it safe on the chair? Do YOU think it safe, Mr. Hartright? Yes? So glad. Will you oblige me by looking at the drawings, if you really think they are quite safe. Louis, go away. What an ass you are. Don't you see me holding the tablettes? Do you suppose <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> them? Then why not relieve me of the tablettes without being told? A thousand pardons, Mr. Hartright; servants are such asses, are they not?

Then at last looking up: [...] "You're a very good-natured man, sir, and you'll never persuade me you don't come of a kindly race. Say what you please about a chance; when a man's fifty--degraded, penniless, a husband and father--a chance to get on his legs again is not to be despised. Something tells me that my luck may be in your country--which has brought luck to so many. I can come on the parish here of course, but I don't want to come on the parish. Hang it, sir, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> up my head. I see thirty years of life before me yet. If only by God's help I could have a real change of air! It's a fixed idea of mine. I've had it for the last ten years. It's not that I'm a low radical. Oh I've no vulgar opinions. Old England's good enough for me, but I'm not good enough for old England. I'm a shabby man that wants {{to get out of a}} room full of staring gentlefolk. I'm for ever put to the blush. It's a perfect agony of spirit; {{everything}} reminds me of my younger and better self. The thing for me would be a cooling cleansing plunge into the unknowing and the unknown!

The others asked for beer. I said I'd take ginger ale. The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny. Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me. I had offended the barkeeper. A bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer; and it was up <b>to</b> me, if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> my job, <b>to</b> drink beer.|$|R
