5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc Venezuelan <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on the starting line. In the second round at the Spanish <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> Roberts was leading the race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> Roberts crashed during practice for the 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, he could do no better than seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the Venezuelan round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E
5|$|Driven by {{team founder}} Bruce McLaren, the M2B {{had a short}} <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> career, {{entering}} six races and starting only four. It scored the team's first point at the British <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> and two more points at the United States <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix.</b>|$|E
5|$|He sported one-off helmet designs four times. For the 1998 Japanese <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> a title decider with Mika Häkkinen, he {{replaced}} the German flag with a chequered flag motif and reflective silver replacing the white areas. At the 2004 Italian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> the German flag design {{was replaced with}} an Italian flag in honour of his team's home race. For the Brazilian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> race of 2006 (at the time intended to be his final <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix),</b> he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> victories. For the 2011 Belgian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet. The helmet, very similar to his current helmet, included the year of his début to the present, and the years of his seven World titles. For the 2012 Belgian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> Schumacher's 300th <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> appearance, he wore a special platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.|$|E

5|$|Renault's victory {{contributed to}} an {{increase}} in sales for the French manufacturer in the years following the race. Despite being the second to carry the title, the race has become known as the first <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix.</b> The success of the 1906 French <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> prompted the ACF to run the <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> again the following year, and the German automobile industry to organise the Kaiserpreis, the forerunner to the German <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Senna was {{the last}} driver for twenty years {{to die in a}} Formula One accident, until the death of Jules Bianchi in 2015 from {{injuries}} sustained at the 2014 Japanese <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix.</b> However, three trackside marshals were killed during those years {{as a direct result of}} such crashes: Paolo Gislimberti at the 2000 Italian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> Graham Beveridge at the 2001 Australian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> and Mark Robinson at the 2013 Canadian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} <b>Grands</b> <b>Prix</b> {{held in a}} season has varied over the years. The inaugural [...] world {{championship}} season comprised only seven races, while the [...] season contained twenty-one races. Although throughout {{the first decades of}} the world championship there were no more than eleven <b>Grands</b> <b>Prix</b> a season, a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of <b>Grands</b> <b>Prix</b> increased to an average of sixteen/seventeen by the late 1970s; simultaneously non-championship events ended by 1983.

5|$|Alfa Romeo {{dominated}} {{the rest of}} the <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> season. Nuvolari and Campari drove the newly introduced Alfa Romeo P3 at the Italian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> while Borzacchini and Caracciola drove much heavier 8Cs. Caracciola was forced to retired when his car broke down, but he took over Borzacchini's car when the Italian was hit by a stone, and came third, behind Nuvolari and Fagioli. In the French <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> Caracciola, now driving a P3, battled Nuvolari for the lead early on. Alfa Romeo's dominance was so great and their cars so far ahead the team could choose the top three finishing positions, thus Nuvolari won from Borzacchini and Caracciola, with the two Italians ahead of the German. The order was different at the 1932 German <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> where Caracciola won from Nuvolari and Borzacchini.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his first}} {{hospital}} visitors {{immediately after the}} <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> were Marussia's CEO Graeme Lowdon and team principal John Booth (the latter staying by Bianchi's side even after the inaugural Russian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix),</b> as well as Ferrari's team principal Marco Mattiacci and Formula One driver, Felipe Massa.|$|E
5|$|Andretti drove {{sporadically}} in Formula One {{over the}} next four years for Lotus, March, and Ferrari, while continuing to focus on his racing career in America.

5|$|Caracciola {{regained his}} German <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with Christian Werner, {{who took over}} Caracciola's car when the latter {{collapsed}} with heat exhaustion at a pit stop. The German <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> like many other races at the time, ignored the official <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> racing rules set by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a Formula Libre, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> cars and more on sports cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the SSK, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own record on the course by half a second.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 season, Prost and Senna {{continued}} their on-track rivalry. Prost was escorted by police to the Interlagos circuit for the 1993 Brazilian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix</b> {{due to the}} hostility of Brazilians towards him. The two {{continued their}} on-track battles at Silverstone where Senna aggressively defended his position against Prost. At Prost's last <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> the 1993 Australian <b>Grand</b> <b>Prix,</b> he was pulled up by Senna onto the top step of the podium for an embrace.|$|E
