40|$|A {{series of}} {{lignocellulosic}} fungi, capable of cellulase and/or xylanase production, were isolated from soil {{to be used}} for cellulose degradation and nitrate removal from nitrate-rich wastewater in simple one-stage anaerobic bioreactors containing <b>grass</b> <b>cuttings</b> as source of cellulose. The fungal consortium, consisting of six hyphomycetous isolates, some of which belong to the genera Fusarium, Mucor and Penicillium, was able to remove {{a significant portion of the}} nitrate from the treated water. The results were obtained for three bioreactors, i. e. FR, FRp and AFRp, differing in volume and mode of grass addition. Bioreactor AFRp received autoclaved grass, instead of non-autoclaved grass containing natural microbial consortia, as supplied to FR and FRp. Nitrate removal in FR amounted to 89 % removal efficiency, while this was 65 % and 67 % in FRp and AFRp, respectively. The residual chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration in FR was higher than 600 mg/l, while it was 355 and 379 mg/l in FRp and AFRp, respectively. The similar nitrate removal results for AFRp and FRp indicated that the micro-organisms attached to <b>grass</b> <b>cuttings</b> did not seem to affect the nitrate removal in the reactor. This observation has led to the conclusion that the fungal consortium was, except for being able to degrade cellulose within the <b>grass</b> <b>cuttings,</b> also responsible for nitrate removal from the synthetic nitrate-rich wastewater.

40|$|The {{study focused}} {{on the use of}} compost {{bacteria}} to degrade cellulose from <b>grass</b> <b>cuttings</b> as energy and carbon sources for sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in a biological reactor. The fermentation of <b>grass</b> <b>cuttings</b> was carried out by anaerobic bacteria isolated from compost, thereby producing volatile fatty acids (VFA) and other intermediates, which were used as carbon and energy sources for sulphate reduction by SRB. Grass was added daily to the reactor in order to obtain maximum production of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and VFA. The results indicated that daily addition of grass is essential for the efficient VFA production, sulphate reduction and for the cell growth of the microbial biomass. Sulphate reduction of 38 % was achieved with an average reactor chemical oxygen demand/sulphate (COD/SO 4) ratio of 0. 56 mg/ℓ.

Two studies were conducted: 1) Four stirred batch-test reactors (2 ℓ) were operated, fed with artificial SO 4 rich (1700 mg/ℓ) feed water and tap water (controls). The reactors received sulphate reducing bacteria, compost bacteria and <b>grass</b> <b>cuttings.</b> The experimental period was 25 days, the operating temperature was 20 to 22 ˚C. 2) Two anaerobic reactors (2. 5 ℓ) were operated at 37 - 39 ˚C and at pH of 6. 7 - 6. 9 to accommodate the rumen organisms. The test reactor contained SO 4 rich water and the control reactor tap water, as well as SRB, rumen bacteria and <b>grass</b> <b>cuttings.</b> The duration of study 2 was 32 days. In both studies SO 4 reduction could be observed (from ≈ 2000 to 0 mg/ℓ over 8 days). The Volatile Fatty Acids results showed that both butyrate and propionate were produced and subsequently utilised for the sulphate reduction and that a clear relationship existed between the organic acids concentration and sulphate reduction.

The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether rumen bacteria can degrade cellulytic material to produce the fermentation products, such as Volatile Fatty Acids and other intermediates), which can be used by sulphate reducing bacteria as the carbon and energy source for biological sulphate reduction, operating a one stage reactor system. A 20 ℓ reactor was used, which was operated as a “hybrid ” reactor at temperature of 39 °C. The fermentation products of cellulose degradation, using rumen fluid as source of the fermentation organisms, were utilised as electron donor when sulphate, as the electron acceptor, is converted to sulphide.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. com 1. The leaching rates of filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from five leaf litter types commonly occurring in urban environments in Mediterranean regions of Southern Australia were compared. The relative composition, bioavailability and oxygen demand of this DOC were also assessed. Four tree species were assessed, including the native river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and three introduced deciduous species, the English elm (Ulmus procera), London plane (Platanus acerifolia) and white poplar (Populus alba). <b>Grass</b> <b>cuttings</b> (mixed species) were selected as a common garden waste. 2. Except for English elm, the majority of FRP and DOC was released within the first 48 h. <b>Grass</b> <b>cuttings</b> released the highest amount of FRP with white poplar releasing the most DOC. Species that released relatively high amounts of DOC (white poplar, English elm, river red gum) released relatively low amounts of FRP. Conversely, species that released relatively low amounts of DOC (<b>grass</b> <b>cuttings</b> and London plane) tended to release relatively high amounts of FRP. 3. Analysis of DOC composition, combined with the differing oxygen demand and DOC depletion curves, demonstrated that there were substantial differences in the DOC leached from the leaf litter of the different species. Biochemical oxygen demand and the biodegradability of the DOC {{was positively correlated with}} the proportion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic acids present in the leachate. 4. These results demonstrate that simple measurements of nutrient release per gram of leaf litter would be insufficient to predict the ecological impact on receiving waters resulting from changes in dominant vegetation. Furthermore, the use of traps to prevent particulate leaf material from entering streams may have limited potential for reducing the load of dissolved nutrients. We conclude that any changes to vegetation type which substantially alter the timing of leaf fall or the composition of leaf leachates should be avoided. Todd A. Wallace, George G. Ganf and Justin D.
