5|$|Seats in the Circus were <b>free</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor, who by {{the time}} of the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E

It leads westwards to Clevedon, {{where the}} motorway network {{can be accessed}} at Junction 20 of the M5; eastwards it links with the A370 (for Bristol) and the A38 (for Bristol Airport). Another link to the A370 at Backwell offers a route south and west for traffic to other local towns such as Weston-super-Mare. Nailsea’s main car parks are in Clevedon Road, Station Road and Link Road, {{all of which are}} <b>free</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first three hours.

5|$|While the {{previous}} game {{had a large}} amount of downloadable content in the form of character costumes, extra story episodes and battles in the game's fighting arena, the reaction to these was mixed. The costumes were liked by fans, despite some complaints of them being purely cosmetic, but the presence of story DLC caused many to criticize the original game as incomplete. In reaction to this, the developers decided to package the game's entire story with the retail edition. However, they did create pre-order DLC for the game in the form of outfits Lightning could use in battle. One of these featured the clothing, weapon and equipment of Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII, available with the game's limited edition Pre-Order Bonus Pack, while another featured a collection of Samurai-inspired outfits. In addition to this, as part of a cross-game promotional campaign, Square Enix of Japan also made Yuna's costume from Final Fantasy X a playable garb for those who had purchased the Japanese HD Remaster of the game on either PS3 or Vita. The garb was later made available as a pre-order exclusive from Amazon.com. After the game's release, an additional set of DLC costumes was released, among them a moogle outfit. In the Western release of the game scheduled on February 11, 2014, a free DLC pack was released that enabled players to play the localized version of the game with Japanese voice acting and lip-synching. The DLC was <b>free</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first two weeks, and then became paid DLC.|$|E

25|$|The Buccaneers played without linebacker Dave Lewis, who was benched for {{arriving}} late {{to a team}} meeting. New placekicker Bill Capece provided a pair of field goals, the Buccaneers' only offense through the first three quarters. A tripping penalty on Calvin Favron erased a fourth-quarter Neil O'Donoghue field goal and forced the Cardinals to punt. The Buccaneers scored the winning points on a James Owens touchdown run on the ensuing possession, and scored again on a Jerry Eckwood run shortly thereafter. Owens {{appeared to have been}} wrapped up by Favron on the touchdown run, but was able to break <b>free</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> score on what was to date his only carry of the season. James Wilder led Buccaneer rushers with 15 carries for 76 yards, and caught 9 passes for 72 yards. Doug Williams completed 17 of 30 passes for 162 yards. Ottis Anderson led Cardinals running backs with 20 carries for 97 yards, and Jim Hart completed 11 of 18 passes for 91 yards.|$|E
25|$|Early in 58 BC Clodius {{proposed}} four laws. One re-established {{the legitimacy}} of the collegia; one distributed the grain dole provided by the state for the poor completely <b>free</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time (previously it was at subsidised prices); one limited the remit of bans on the gatherings of the popular assemblies; and one limited the power of the censors to censor citizens who had not been tried and convicted before this. Cassius Dio thought that the aim of these laws was to gain the favour of the people, the equites and the senate before moving to crush Cicero because it was difficult to defeat him as he was highly influential. Then he proposed a law that banned officials from performing augury (the divination of the omens of the gods) {{on the day of the}} vote by the popular assemblies. The aim was to prevent votes from being delayed. Officials often announced that they would perform augury on the day of the vote because during this voting was not allowed and this forced its postponement. In Cassius Dio’s opinion Clodius wanted to bring Cicero to trial and did not want the voting for the verdict delayed.|$|E
25|$|Harry Johnston was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} Commissioner of the British Central Africa Protectorate in July 1891. Johnston did not consider that the Crown had a general claim to sovereignty over any land unless it had been expressly transferred by cession. Without sovereignty, the Crown {{had no right to}} alienate that land. However, some treaties made after July 1891 did cede sovereignty over land, but granted the communities involved the right to retain any land that they actually occupied as Crown tenants, leaving any vacant land <b>free</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Crown to alienate. He also accepted that the treaties and agreements made {{before the start of the}} protectorate might be evidence of sales of land. Even though he accepted that the land belonged to its African communities, not the chiefs, Johnston proposed the legal fiction that the people had given their chiefs the right to sell it. This interpretation validated the chiefs’ sales and grants of unused land to Europeans. He also claimed that he was entitled to investigate whether these sales were valid and, if they were, to issue Certificates of Claim (in effect a registration of freehold title over the land to the new owners.|$|E
