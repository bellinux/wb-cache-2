A simplified method for conservation of the lift coefficient, which greatly influences on ship’s performance, is obtained from consideration of the factors defining the lift.

40|$|We {{present a}} CFD {{characterization}} {{of a new}} type of super-cavitating hydrofoil section designed to have optimal performance both in super-cavitating conditions and in sub-cavitating conditions (including transitional regime). The basic concepts of the new profile family are first introduced. Lift, drag and cavity shapes at different cavitation numbers are calculated for a new foil and compared with those of conventional sub-cavitating and super-cavitating profiles. Numerical calculations confirm the superior characteristics of the new hydrofoil family, which is able to attain high lift and efficiency both in sub-cavitating and super-cavitating conditions. Numerical calculations are based on a multi-phase fully turbulent URANSE solver with a bubble dynamic cavitation model to follow the generation and evaporation of the vapor phase.

40|$|At {{the present}} time several hundred hydrofoilcraft are in service {{throughout}} the world. The upsurge {{in the use of}} these craft did not really begin until the late 1950 s, although fascination with the idea of supporting small boats with underwater wings dates well back into the nineteenth century. About the turn of the century, hydrofoil flight was achieved, to be followed in a few years by Bell and Baldwin who, at the close of World War I, achieved the modern hydrofoil speed of 60 knots in a very novel craft. Progress and interest in this form of transportation then waned for many years. There were some interesting developments just prior to and through World War II in Europe, and after the war interest quickened in several countries. Current thinking at this time may be judged by Gabdelli & von Karman (1950), who note that the drag of surface vessels may be decreased by lifting the floating structure with hydrofoils. But they go on to add that they " [...] . do not attempt to estimate the effect of such a radical innovation; whether the trials until now appear promising is a question of individual judgment. " As subsequent events have proven, the trials were indeed promising. The many <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>craft</b> now in service are of several different types and a number of more advanced concepts are being developed swiftly. Greater speed in all forms of transportation has always been sought, provided the price is not too great. The air-sea surface is a particularly inhospitable environment for major advances in operating speed, yet it is partly this advance that is the stimulus for <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>craft</b> as well as that for conventional marine craft and the newer hover craft. Silverleaf (1970) and Silverleaf & Cook (1970) review all these recent developments from technical and economic standpoints. High speeds at sea are now possible, they observe, but may not be attained for lack of naval or commercial demands. The successful achievements of <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>craft</b> to date and the possibility of high speeds at sea are due to the greatly increased understanding in recent years of the flow past hydrofoils and also to the development of foil configurations and control systems for coping with the roughness of the sea surface. It seems appropriate, therefore, in this review to link the discussion of hydrofoils with that of progress in the craft, for the two are very interdependent. This interaction has been the source of a great deal of research in applied fluid mechanics in recent years. The methods of analysis, experiment, and design in this field follow closely those in aeronautics, yet there are some important differences because of the medium itself. These include the phenomena due to the free surface (an ever-present boundary in naval hydrodynamics) and the possibility of a phase change through cavitation or ventilation with consequent important modification of the flow; because the liquid density is so much greater than in equivalent aeronautical applications, the dynamic response to motions must be treated very carefully. Hydrofoils, in addition, find application as control surfaces and structural members in marine craft generally, and serve also as elements of propulsion devices. In what follows, the general characteristics of <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>craft</b> are briefly reviewed together with some representative modern examples. Some physical aspects of the flow past hydrofoils are then described, followed by a resume of some of the recent methods used in design and analysis of hydrofoils. In this short account several important topics have of necessity been omitted; these include propulsion, hydroelastic problems, and ship motions, each of which could serve as the topic of a separate article...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} cavity flows {{received}} attention {{early in the}} development of hydrodynamics because of its occurrence in high speed motion of solid bodies in water. Many previous works in this field were mainly concerned with the calculation of drag in a cavitating flow. The lifting problem with a cavity (or wake) arose later in the applications of water pumps, marine propellers, stalling airfoils, and <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>crafts.</b> Although several formulations of the problem of lift in cavity flows have been pointed out before, these theories have not yet been developed to yield general results in explicit form so that a unified discussion can be made. The problems of cavitating flow with finite cavity demand an extension of the classical Helmholtz free boundary theory for which the cavity is infinite in extent. For this purpose, several self-consistent models have been introduced, all aiming to account for the cavity base pressure which is in general always less than the free stream pressure. In the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff flow these two pressures are assumed equal. Of all these existing models, three significant ones may be mentioned here. The first representation of a finite cavity was proposed by Riabouchinsky in in which the finite cavity is obtained by introducing an "image" obstacle downstream of the real body. A different representation in which a reentrant jet is postulated was suggested by Prandtl, Wagner, and was later considered by Kreisel and was further extended by Gilbarg and Serrin. Another representation of a free streamline flow with the base pressure different from the free stream pressure, was proposed recently by Roshko. In this model the base pressure in the wake (or cavity) near the body can take any assigned value. From a certain point in the wake, which can be determined from the theory, the flow downstream is supposed to be dissipated {{in such a way that}} the pressure increases gradually from the assigned value to that of the free stream in a strip parallel to the free stream. Apparently this model was also considered independently by Eppler in some generality. Other alternatives to these models have also been proposed, but they do not differ so basically from the above three models that they need to be mentioned here specifically. The mathematical solutions to the problem of flow past a flat plate set normal to the stream have been carried out for these three models. All the theories are found to give essentially the same results over the practical range of the wake underpressure. That such agreement is to be expected can be indicated, without the detailed solutions for the various models, from consideration of their underlying physical significance, as will be discussed in the next section. In the present work the free streamline theory is extended and applied to the lifting problem for two-dimensional hydrofoils with a fully cavitating wake. The analysis is carried out by using the Roshko model to approximate the wake far downstream. The reason for using this model is mainly because of its mathematical simplicity as compared with the Riabouchinsky model, or the reentrant jet model. In fact, it can be verified that these different models all yield practically the same result, as in the pure drag case; the deviation from the results of one model to another is not appreciable up to second order small quantities. The mathematical considerations here, as in the classical theory, depend on the conformal mapping of the complex velocity plane into the plane of complex potential. By using a generalization of Levi-Civita's method for curved barriers in cavity flows, the flow problem for curved hydrofoils is finally reduced to a nonlinear boundary value problem for an analytic function defined in the upper half of a unit circle to which the Schwarz's principle of reflection can be applied. The problem is then solved by using the expansion of this analytic function inside the unit circle together with the boundary conditions in the physical plane. In order to avoid the difficulty in determining the separation point of the free streamline from a hydrofoil with blunt nose, the hydrofoils investigated here are those with sharp leading and trailing edges which are assumed to be the separation points. Except for this limitation, the present nonlinear theory is applicable to hydrofoils of any geometric profile, operating at any cavitation number, and for almost all angles of attack as long as the wake has a fully cavitating configuration. As two typical examples, the problem is solved in explicit form for the circular arc and the flat plate for which the various flow quantities are expressed by simple formulas. From the final result the various effects, such as that of cavitation number, camber of the profile and the attack angle, are discussed in detail. It is also shown that the present theory is in good agreement with the experiment...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{conventional}} propellers, flapping wings may generate large amplitude oscillating forces, {{which can}} make them difficult to incorporate into a craft design. This is particularly true for a single, vertically oscillating hydrofoil, {{as part of a}} surface water craft where the cyclic lift of the <b>hydrofoil</b> disrupts the <b>craft</b> stability. This thesis begins by reviewing the history of human-powered watercraft with a focus on those having flapping foil propellers. This review combined with {{a review of the literature}} provides a balanced overview on how flapping wing propellers are currently designed. Current literature shows that although the mean performance of an oscillating foil has been determined in terms of the Strouhal number and the angle of attack, relatively little describes performance directly in terms of the foil motion. Hence, predicting temporal hydrodynamic forces acting on an oscillating foil is difficult. This provides motivation for research investigating the temporal performance of an oscillating foil directly in terms of its motion. In this thesis, experimental equipment designed to measure the hydrodynamic forces on a heaving object is presented. Key features of the equipment are analysed to show how measurement accuracy is maintained. Experimental measurements of unsteady hydrodynamic forces acting on a heaving cylinder, flat plate, symmetrical foil, and an asymmetrical foil are analysed with respect to the heaving motion. Firstly, the object motion is limited to one degree of freedom; pure heaving with zero forward velocity, to investigate the start-up conditions of the oscillating hydrofoil propeller. Secondly, these results are expanded on by adding a steady forward velocity component to the object motion to investigate how the hydrodynamic forces on the object are affected by the cross-flow. Experimental temporal hydrodynamic force measurements presented in this thesis show how the relative composition of hydrodynamic drag and inertia forces change with oscillating frequency, and forward velocity, affecting the phase, magnitude, and profile of the force cycles. This composition is also influenced by the cross-section of the oscillating object and the presence of a free surface. Current marine engineering equations for unsteady hydrodynamic forces on an object in an oscillating flow are validated for a cylinder. However, they are found to contain significant error when predicting the unsteady hydrodynamic forces on an oscillating hydrofoil. Contributions of this thesis link oscillating foil propulsion research to common marine engineering equations with the intent of making flapping wing propeller design more accessible to the general engineering community...|$|R
40|$|A human-powered, hydrofoil-supported, racing boat {{has been}} designed, built, tested and developed. At {{relatively}} high speeds ([greater, approximate] 4 ms- 1), this craft {{provides a more}} energy efficient means of transport than a conventional displacement hull.

Due to employing an inappropriate propeller (of only ~ 57 % efficiency) and at least 16 % excess weight for the boat plus chosen human driver, he could power the craft only to 3 Â· 5 ms- 1, at which speed the hull had risen so that all but the lowest 5 cm depth of it was above the water.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{high-speed}} craft, called a Gliding-Hydrofoil Craft (GHC), has recently been developed in Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, China. This craft {{is similar to a}} planing hull but with a hydrofoil in the front part of its body. The fixed hydrofoil improves the seakeeping properties and stability of the craft compared with a conventional planing hull. In addition, the GHC has a more simple structure and higher stability when compared to a <b>hydrofoil</b> <b>craft.</b> Unlike conventional planing hulls and hydrofoil crafts, the study of hydrodynamics of GHC has been overlooked. The present work aims to advance our understanding on hydrodynamics of GHC, both model tests and numerical investigations are presented. To study its hydrodynamic characteristics, model tests are carried out in a towing tank, and the total resistance, trim angle and wetted area of the craft in the cases with different Froude numbers are measured. For the purpose of comparison, model tests have also been carried out for the hull without the hydrofoil. This thesis presents analysis on the experimental data and discusses the effects of the submerged depth and initial attack angle of the hydrofoil on the hydrodynamic features of the GHC. On this basis, the FLUENT software is then adopted to numerically investigate the hydrodynamics of the GHC. The accuracy of the FLUENT addressing this problem is validated by comparing the numerical solutions with the experimental data. The validation cases include 2 D hydrofoil in current, Wigley hull with steady forward speed. Good agreement between numerical results and experimental data was obtained. Considering the significance of the turbulence involved in the problem, especially near the hydrofoil, a numerical investigation aiming to find a suitable turbulence model has been carried out. After being validated, 3 D numerical simulations on both the planing craft and the GHC in steady flow are considered. The resistance coefficient, pressure coefficient and wave pattern with different Froude number are investigated. Some results are compared with experiment data obtained in the model tests. The wave pattern, velocity field and pressure distribution near the hulls are discussed in detail as well as the influence of the hydrofoil. Finally, the hydrodynamic performance of GHC in unsteady flow is investigated. Three cases were considered: ship berthing, leaving the harbour and turning navigation direction; which are very commonly seen unsteady examples in reality. The preliminary results presented in this thesis have confirmed the significant effects due to the unsteady procedure and imply the need of carrying out unsteady simulations in the future...|$|E
