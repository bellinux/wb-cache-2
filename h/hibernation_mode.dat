On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began. On January 15, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Rosetta made a Mars {{gravity assist}} (flyby) {{on its way}} to Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko. The {{spacecraft}} also performed two asteroid flybys. The craft completed its flyby of asteroid 2867 Šteins in September 2008 and of 21 Lutetia in July 2010. Later, on 20 January 2014, Rosetta was taken out of a 31-month <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode</b> as it approached Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko.|$|E
25|$|Coelacanths are {{opportunistic}} feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, {{and other}} fish {{found in their}} deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements {{in a sort of}} <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper is an {{investigation}} and evaluation of energy efficient solutions in IP over WDM core networks using as a foundation, a hierarchy of <b>hibernation</b> <b>modes</b> implementing different degrees of node groupings and fibre links establishment that support a sleep state. It seeks to embed this groups-nodes strategy into an intelligent control plane implementing routing schemes targeting energy consumption, adaptive signalling and traffic engineering. A Group-Nodes mechanism is proposed {{as a function of}} topology and node distribution based on a fixed (or geographical) and random (or ownership) principle. The impact of the proposed technique on energy saving and network performance is assessed; results are presented and evaluated for various scenarios. Evaluation of this methodology indicates potential reduction in power consumption from 7 % up to 15 % at the expense of reduced network performance...|$|R
40|$|The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) {{completed}} {{a pilot project}} within its Central Office spaces to test the utilization of computer power management (CPM) technologies to implement power saving settings on state-owned, network-connected computer equipment. Currently, the State of Tennessee has no clear protocol regarding energy-conserving power settings on state-owned machines. Activation of monitor sleep modes and system standby and <b>hibernation</b> <b>modes</b> on 615 Central Office computers over an 18 -month period reduced energy consumption by an estimated 8093 kWh and $ 526 per month, amounting to approximately $ 6312 in cost savings for Tennessee annually. If implemented throughout State of Tennessee executive agencies across the state, energy cost savings could amount to an estimated $ 323, 341 annually. The research endeavored to understand {{both positive and negative}} impacts that strategic power management approaches can have on energy consumption, worker productivity, network security, and state budgets. Nearly all impacts discussed were positive. Based on successful results within TDEC Central Office spaces in Tennessee Tower, and considering the potential cost savings that could be achieved, expansion of the implementation of computer power management policies to machines in offices across the state was recommended...|$|R
5000|$|Sleep <b>mode</b> and <b>hibernation</b> can be combined: the {{contents}} of RAM are first copied to non-volatile storage like for regular hibernation, but then, instead of powering down, the computer enters sleep mode. This approach combines the benefits of sleep mode and hibernation: The machine can resume instantaneously, {{but it can also}} be powered down completely (e.g. due to loss of power) without loss of data, because it is already effectively in a state of <b>hibernation.</b> This <b>mode</b> is called [...] "hybrid sleep" [...] in Microsoft Windows other than Windows XP.|$|R
25|$|While in <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode</b> in July 2012, New Horizons started {{gathering}} {{scientific data}} with SWAP, PEPSSI and VBSDC. Although {{it was originally}} planned to activate just the VBSDC, other instruments were powered on the initiative of principal investigator Alan Stern who decided they could use the opportunity to collect valuable heliospheric data. Before activating the other two instruments, ground tests were conducted {{to make sure that}} the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy, memory and fuel in the future and that all systems are functioning during the flyby. The first set of data was transmitted in January 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation. The command and data handling software was updated to address the problem of computer resets.|$|E

The Dodgers offense went back into <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode</b> on the 29th as the Marlins picked up a 6-1 victory. he Dodgers picked up their first series win in more than a month on the 29th, thanks to a dominant performance from Clayton Kershaw. He pitched his second complete game shutout of his career, recording 10 strikeouts and also picking up two hits, the same amount the Marlins managed in the game. The Dodgers offense also came alive, for an 8-0 victory.|$|E

25|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} a new Hybrid Sleep power-saving <b>mode</b> that combines <b>hibernation</b> and sleep <b>mode</b> functionality. When active, Hybrid Sleep saves {{information from a}} computer's memory to a hibernation file on disk, but instead of turning off the computer, it initiates sleep mode. Traditionally, systems that lose power while in sleep mode will also lose all data resident in memory. However, since systems that resume from Hybrid Sleep do so by retrieving information from a hibernation file on disk, they offer the benefits of quickly resuming when in sleep mode and improved reliability {{in the event of}} power loss.|$|R
2500|$|After passing Jupiter, New Horizons {{spent most}} of its journey towards Pluto in {{hibernation}} mode: redundant components as well as guidance and control systems were shut down to extend their life cycle, decrease operation costs and free the Deep Space Network for other missions.

By May 2014, IKAROS was on a ten-month orbit around the Sun, spending seven months of each orbit in <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode</b> due to insufficient power. By 23 April 2015, the spacecraft woke up from <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode</b> for the 4th time and was flying {{at a distance of}} about 120 million kilometers from the Earth. On 21 May 2015, JAXA could not receive a signal from IKAROS and concluded that the spacecraft had shifted to the <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode</b> for the fifth time, as expected. Based on May 2015 data the position of the IKAROS at the time was about 110 million kilometers away from the Earth, and about 130 million kilometers from the sun. Data showed no anomaly in the IKAROS spacecraft. JAXA expects the 5th wake up of IKAROS in the northern hemisphere winter of 2016.|$|E

50|$|The {{project was}} {{reactivated}} on 20 June 2013 in {{the expectation that}} the satellite would wake up from a hibernation state as more power from the solar panels became available. The team was able to receive telemetry from the IKAROS between 20 June and 12 September 2013, after which contact was again lost. The loss of contact was around the predicted time of the spacecraft again entering a low-power <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode</b> as power from the solar panels decreased. Available communication time through the Usuda Deep Space Center antenna was limited, so data was gathered only intermittently to estimate the speed, trajectory and rotation of the satellite.

Schiaparelli came out of hibernation several hours before its entry, at a speed of 21000 km/h and an altitude of 122.5 km above the surface of Mars.

50|$|Two-factor authentication, {{such as a}} pre-boot PIN or a {{removable}} USB device containing a startup key together with a TPM, {{can be used to}} work around this vulnerability in the default Bitlocker implementation. In this mode, a PIN or startup key is required when turning the machine on or when waking from <b>hibernation</b> <b>mode</b> (a power off mode). The result is that once the computer has been turned off for a few minutes, the data in RAM will no longer be accessible without a secret key; the attack can only be completed if the device is obtained while still powered on. No additional protection is offered during sleep mode (a low power mode) as the key typically remains in memory with full disk encryption products and {{does not have to be}} re-entered when the machine is resumed.|$|E

He was sealed inside of one of the school's stone pillars until Hikari accidentally released him during a routine fire drill. The entire school was subsequently demolished after the blast following Ioneos's release. Jennifer nicknamed him [...] "Oniita," [...] (or [...] "Neo" [...] in the English dub) saying that his original name was too long.
