40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with theoretical calculations of the properties of electronic bound states in semiconductor heterostructures. The complex band structure empirical pseudopotential method (EPM) is used {{as the foundation of}} the work. Spin orbit coupling and strain effects (due to lattice mismatch) are included in familiar ways, as is the transfer matrix method, allowing the study of arbitrarily configured heterostructures. These techniques are used to investigate the unusually deep InAs/AlSb conduction band well. The strong possibility of intraband transitions at electro magnetic wavelengths around 1. 55 µm is predicted, with corresponding enhanced momentum matrix elements and joint density of states over interband transitions. An InAs/GaSb/AlSb asymmetric well is investigated, paying particular attention to the bound states {{in the vicinity of the}} InAs/GaSb band overlap. The electron-like states are found to cross with heavy hole and anti-cross with light hole-like states, as a function of heterostructure dimension or applied electrostatic field. This is analogous to the <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> states in the in-plane band structure, except that for zero in-plane wave vector there can be no appreciable <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>electron</b> and heavy hole states. A technique is described that has been developed to extract envelope functions from heterostructure wavefunctions calculated using the realistic complex band structure EPM approach. These envelope functions conform to Burt’s theory (M. G. Burt, J. Phys. : Condens. Matt. 4, 6651 (1992)) in that they are uniquely defined, continuous and smooth over all space. Comparisons with traditional effective mass envelope functions are made. The extracted envelope functions are used to demonstrate conclusively Burt's predictions (M. G. Burt, Superlatt. Mi- crostruct. 17, 335 (1995)) concerning the inadequacy of certain approximations for the calculation of interband dipole matrix elements and charge oscillation. Finally, the issue of k • p operator ordering is convincingly settled, in favour of 'ordered' over 'symmetrised' Hamiltonians, by comparison to EPM calculations, and using EPM derived k • p parameters...|$|R

40|$|Two transuranium metal boron carbides, NpB 2 C and PuB 2 C {{have been}} {{synthesized}} by argon arc melting. The crystal {{structures of the}} {Np,Pu}B 2 C compounds were determined from single crystal X-ray data to be isotypic with the ThB 2 C-type (space group R 3 m, a = 0. 6532 (2) nm; c = 1. 0769 (3) nm for NpB 2 C and a = 0. 6509 (2) nm; c = 1. 0818 (3) nm for PuB 2 C; Z= 9). Physical properties have been derived from polycrystalline bulk material in the temperature range from 2 K to 300 K and in magnetic fields up to 9 T. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity data indicate the occurrence of antiferromagnetic ordering for NpB 2 C with a Neel temperature T_N = 68 K. PuB 2 C is a Pauli paramagnet most likely due to a strong <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> s(p,d) <b>electrons</b> with the Pu- 5 f states.

40|$|Far-infrared {{cyclotron}} resonance {{is used to}} study the magneto-optical properties of semimetallic InAs/GaSb heterostructures. Spatially separated two-dimensional electron and hole gases coexist in this 'broken-gap' type-ll system due to charge transfer across the interfaces. <b>Hybridisations</b> <b>of</b> the overlapping <b>electron</b> and hole wavefunctions are investigated experimentally in samples of varying growth parameters. A self-consistent 8 -band k centre dot p model is used {{to assist in the}} interpretation of experimental results. In samples subjected to varying magnetic field, hybridisations result in oscillations of {{cyclotron resonance}} mass, amplitude and linewidth, accompanied by transition splittings in the vicinity of Landau level anticrossings. Asymmetries introduced by InSb interface biasing enhance these effects. Comparison of samples with varying confinement energies (at specified magnetic field) shows effective mass enhancement greater than the standard nonparabolicity effect. The mass enhancement increases with hybridisation strength. A simple two-band minigap model gives good agreement with experimental results. Tilled field measurements show that hybridisation suppresses electron cyclotron resonance transitions. Increased resonance amplitudes at higher temperatures are therefore ascribed to reduced hybridisation strength. Strong evidence of Coulomb interactions between different single particle transitions shows the interactions increasing with temperature, leading to a single motion-averaged transition at sufficiently high temperature. High magnetic field measurements near the quantum limit show transition features generally consistent with electron-hole Landau level hybridisation. Multiple splittings in this field range (14 - 27 T) are ascribed to spin splitting and subband coupling effects. Breaking of selection rules is suggested to be due to inherent band asymmetries in the samples. For narrow well samples, some transition features remain unexplained, possib...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{method for}} the future {{development}} of label-free DNA sensors is proposed here. The approach {{is based on the}} displacement of a labelled suboptimum mutated oligonucleotide hybridised with the immobilised biotin-capture probe. The target fully complementary to the biotin-capture probe can displace the labelled oligonucleotide causing a subsequent decrease of the signal that verifies the presence of the target. The decrease of signal was demonstrated to be proportional to the target concentration. A study <b>of</b> the <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> mutated and complementary labelled oligonucleotides with an immobilised biotin-capture probe was carried out.

40|$|The labelfree {{detection}} of {{nucleic acid sequences}} {{is one of the}} modern attempts to develop quick, cheap and miniaturised hand-held devices for the future genetic testing in biotechnology and medical diagnostics. We present an approach to detect the <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> DNA sequences using electrolyte-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (EOSFETs) with micrometer dimensions. These semiconductor devices are sensitive to electrical charge variations that occur at the surface/electrolyte interface, i. e. upon <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> oligonucleotides with complementary single-stranded (ss) oligonucleotides, which are immobilised on the oxide surface of the transistor gate. This method allows direct, time-resolved and in situ {{detection of}} specific nucleic acid binding events without any labelling. We focus on the detection mechanism of our sensors by using oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PAH and PSS) subsequently attached to the transistor structures. Our results indicate that the sensor output is charge sensitive and distance dependent from the gate surface, which pinpoints the need for very defined surface chemistry at the device surface. The <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> natural 19 base-pair sequences has been successfully detected with the sensors.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a metal complex formation on the <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> oligodeoxynucleotides was investigated. Incorporation of the metal-binding domains had {{a positive influence on}} the hybrid. Addition of copper(I) or copper(II) ions results in the formation of metal complexes and leads to substantial further stabilization. The placement of the metal-free ligands had no influence on the extent of the stabilization. The stabilizing effect obtained by metalcoordination was found to be distance-dependent. This study showed that <b>hybridisation</b> <b>of</b> relatively short (13 - and 8 -mer) oligonucleotides modified with bpy or phen metal-binding domains to a complementary target DNA is assisted by formation of metallonucleotides containing Cu(bpy) 2, Cu(phen) 2 or Cu(bpy) (phen) domains.

Arrays of this type should allow the direct detection and quantification of nucleotic acids (DNA).
