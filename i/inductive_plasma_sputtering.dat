40|$|In {{contemporary}} sub-stellar model atmospheres, dust growth occurs through neutral gas-phase surface chemistry. Recently, {{there has}} been a growing body of theoretical and observational evidence suggesting that ionisation processes can also occur. As a result, atmospheres are populated by regions composed of plasma, gas and dust, and the consequent influence of plasma processes on dust evolution is enhanced. This paper aims to introduce a new model of dust growth and destruction in sub-stellar atmospheres via plasma deposition and <b>plasma</b> <b>sputtering.</b> Using example sub-stellar atmospheres from Drift-Phoenix, we have compared <b>plasma</b> deposition and <b>sputtering</b> timescales to those from neutral gas-phase surface chemistry to ascertain their regimes of influence. We calculated the <b>plasma</b> <b>sputtering</b> yield and discuss the circumstances where <b>plasma</b> <b>sputtering</b> dominates over deposition. Within the highest dust density cloud regions, <b>plasma</b> deposition and <b>sputtering</b> dominates over neutral gas-phase surface chemistry if the degree of ionisation is ≳ 10 ^- 4. Loosely bound grains with surface binding energies of the order of 0. 1 - 1 eV are susceptible to destruction through <b>plasma</b> <b>sputtering</b> for feasible degrees of ionisation and electron temperatures; whereas, strong crystalline grains with binding energies of the order 10 eV are resistant to sputtering. The mathematical framework outlined sets the foundation for the inclusion of plasma deposition and <b>plasma</b> <b>sputtering</b> in global dust cloud formation models of sub-stellar atmospheres.

This facility will serve as an experimental means of testing thermal protection systems installed on space vehicles to protect them during the atmospheric (re-) entry phase of their flight. Numerical models are being developed to cover design and fundamental theoretical issues. As a first step in the development, the flow inside the plasma wind tunnel is assumed to be in a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This assumption is valid only at near the atmospheric pressure. The thermodynamic properties of a chemically reacting mixture of gases under LTE are determined by means of statistical mechanics. The transport coefficients of an ionised mixture of gases in the collision-dominated regime are computed through the Chapman-Enskog spectral Sonine solution of the Boltzmann equation. Mixture rules suited for <b>inductive</b> <b>plasma</b> conditions are referred to.

The solution to Maxwell’s equations was verified accurate and then coupled computations with propellant plasma were conducted. These coupled computations showed good order of magnitude accuracy with a simple onedimensional model however failed when the plasma began to accelerate due to the Lorentz force. The electric field, magnetic field, current density, and Lorentz force were all aligned in the proper vector directions. The computational failure occurred due to rapid, fictitious increases in the induced electric field in the vacuum created between the accelerating plasma and drive coil. Possible solutions to this problem are to decrease the time step and refine the grid density. Although complete acceleration of propellant plasma has yet to be computationally computed, this study has shown successful coupled computations with Maxwell and Navier-Stokes equations for a pulsed <b>inductive</b> <b>plasma</b> accelerator. ...|$|R

These energetic electrons can induce many processes that would otherwise be very improbable at low temperatures, such as dissociation of precursor molecules and the creation of large quantities of free radicals.|$|R

40|$|Storable {{propellants}} (for example water, ammonia, and hydrazine) {{are attractive}} for deep space propulsion {{due to their}} naturally high density at ambient interplanetary conditions, which obviates {{the need for a}} cryogenic/venting system. Water in particular is attractive due to its ease of handling and availability both terrestrially and extra-terrestrially. While many storable propellants are reactive and corrosive, a propulsion scheme where the propellant is insulated from vulnerable (e. g. metallic) sections of the assembly would be well-suited to process these otherwise incompatible propellants. Pulsed <b>inductive</b> <b>plasma</b> thrusters meet this criterion because they can be operated without direct propellant-electrode interaction. During operation of these devices, electrical energy is capacitively stored and then discharged through an inductive coil creating a time-varying current in the coil that interacts with a plasma covering the face of the coil to induce a plasma current. Propellant is accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity (O(10 - 100 km/s)) by the Lorentz body force arising from the interaction of the magnetic field and the induced plasma current. While this class of thruster mitigates the life-limiting issues associated with electrode erosion, many pulsed <b>inductive</b> <b>plasma</b> thrusters require high pulse energies to inductively ionize propellant. The Microwave Assisted Discharge <b>Inductive</b> <b>Plasma</b> Accelerator (MAD-IPA) is a pulsed <b>inductive</b> <b>plasma</b> thruster that addressees this issue by partially ionizing propellant inside a conical inductive coil before the main current pulse via an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) discharge.

40|$|Contrary to {{the claims}} of {{numerous}} reports {{over the last two}} decades, there does not yet exist a viable <b>plasma</b> <b>sputtering</b> method for complex oxides such as the lead- and bismuth-containing perovskites. In fact, the lack of reproducibility in any vapor deposition means for such materials is the primary reason why the promise of nonvolatile ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM) has delivered so little over the last two decades, with only low-density devices being provided, instead, by solution and mist techniques (via both sol-gel and MOD). In part, the present work provides the first comprehensive treatment of the challenges present in the <b>plasma</b> <b>sputter</b> deposition of ferroelectric strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT), with SBT thin films fabricated under a wide variety of deposition approaches. As such, ferroelectric SBT was successfully formed by the primary <b>plasma</b> <b>sputtering</b> methods used for ferroelectric materials in the past; namely, R. F. sputtering of ceramic targets and D. C. reactive sputtering of metal targets. Capacitors were fabricated to establish the ferroelectric properties of the SBT films. The approach allows for new insights into phase formation in the SBT system. The inadequacies of the previous sputtering approaches used for ferroelectrics (as well as High Tc superconductors) are highlighted {{in the context of their}} inherent run-to-run instability. Subsequently, there is developed a new and rather fundamental vapor deposition technique, termed Electron-Assisted Deposition (EAD), which provides uniquely non-equilibrium growth conditions. This terminology is founded in the direct contradistinction of the presently developed process with previously developed Ion-Assisted Deposition (IAD) processes. The developed EAD process provides the first means by which metallic-mode reactive sputtering, wherein the desired compound is formed by surface reactions at the film's growth interface, can be implemented for a ferroelectric or, in fact, the multicomponent perovskites, in general.
