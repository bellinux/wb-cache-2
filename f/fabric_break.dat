50|$|Wrinkles form {{in cotton}} fabrics {{due to the}} free {{hydroxyl}} groups. Cotton {{is a form of}} cellulose chains linked to form firm three-dimensional structures that offer both tensile strength and flexibility due to their carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bond based backbone. Since cellulose is composed of glucose units, cyclic carbohydrate molecules, cellulose has free hydroxyl groups (-OH) projecting from each monomeric subunit. These hydroxyl groups tend form hydrogen-bonds to neighboring hydroxyl groups. When the fabric is stressed either by heat or pressure, the original hydrogen bonds in the cotton <b>fabric</b> <b>break</b> and reform with nearby atoms at random. This re-forming of the hydrogen bonds, known as cross linking, is the reason for wrinkles, or creases, in the fabric. DMEU works to prevent these wrinkles by covalently bonding to two free hydroxyl groups in the fabric through a dehydration reaction that is not as easily broken as the hydrogen bond before treatment.|$|E

In this study the dependencies of tensile {{properties of}} the fabric on yarn air texturing parameters and fabric structure were investigated. It was found, that breaking force and elongation at break depends more on yarn structure, than on air pressure in the texturing jet. The difference of <b>fabric</b> elongation at <b>break</b> does not exceed 2  % and difference of <b>fabric</b> <b>breaking</b> force does not exceed 5  % when yarns of the same structure but produced with different air pressure in the texturing jet were used in weft. In the case when different structure yarn produced with same pressure in the texturing jet were used in weft, there were difference of breaking force and elongation at break up to 25  % stated. There were also investigated tendencies of tensile properties of fabric dependencies on fabric structure itself. It was stated that weave of the fabric influences elongation at break and breaking force of the fabric. [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 With the {{increased}} variety {{and use of}} lining fabrics, consumers have become concerned over choices for lining fabrics which have good serviceability properties. The major {{purpose of this study}} was to secure some information on the physical properties of lining fabrics to help consumers in the selection of lining fabrics which will give good serviceability. Eight lining fabrics made of one fiber [...] two fabrics each of cotton, rayon, acetate and polyester [...] were examined for their serviceability properties such as resistance to abrasion, breaking load and elongation of yarn and fabric, tearing strength, resistance to yarn slippage, dimensional stability and resistance to wrinkling. They were all white, plain weave, light-weight and commonly-sold lining fabrics. The experimental fabrics were analyzed for their basic characteristics such as fabric count, weight, thickness, twist and yarn number to find out the possible relationship which existed between these characteristics and the serviceability properties. Standard test methods of the American Society for Testing Materials and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists were conducted under the standard atmospheric conditions. Analysis of variance and correlation coefficients were calculated for data obtained from all tests. Lining fabrics were ranked in terms of fiber content for each fabric performance test. Polyester showed great resistance to abrasion, high yarn and <b>fabric</b> <b>breaking</b> strength and little dimensional change. Rayon showed great resistance to tearing and good yarn and <b>fabric</b> <b>breaking</b> strength. Cotton had good resistance to abrasion and the least yarn slippage at the seams. Acetate consistently ranked the lowest in the majority of serviceability tests. Since linings with different fiber components did not always rank in the same order in all tests, it would be desirable for the consumer to determine what serviceability qualities she desires most...|$|R

We have already arrived at the fourteenth century without finding record of any effort made by the clergy of St. Mary's to maintain their influence by restoring or beautifying their basilica; {{which is the only}} point at present of importance to us. That great alterations were made in it {{at the time of the}} acquisition of the body of St. Donato is however highly probable, the mosaic pavement of the interior, which bears its date inscribed, 1140, being probably the last of the additions. I believe that no part of the ancient church can be shown to be of more recent date than this; and I shall not occupy the reader's time by any inquiry respecting the epochs or authors of the destructive modern restorations; the wreck of the old <b>fabric,</b> <b>breaking</b> out beneath them here and there, is generally distinguishable from them at a glance; and it is enough for the reader to know that none of these truly ancient fragments can be assigned to a more recent date than 1140, and that some of them may with probability be looked upon as remains of the shell of the first church, erected in the course of the latter half of the tenth century. We shall perhaps obtain some further reason for this belief as we examine these remains themselves.|$|R
5000|$|All fabrics pill to some extent, {{although}} fibers such as {{linen and}} silk pill less than most. [...] The primary drivers of pilling are the physical {{characteristics of the}} textile (including both the initial fibre, {{and the way in}} which it is processed during manufacturing), the personal habits of the textile's wearer, and the environment in which the textile is used. Fibers such as wool, cotton, polyester, nylon and acrylic have a tendency to pill the most, but wool pilling diminishes over time as non-tenacious wool fibers work themselves free of the <b>fabric</b> and <b>break</b> away, whereas pilling of synthetic textiles is a more serious problem, because the stronger fibers hold on to the pills preventing them from falling off.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} widely used kinds of complex {{structure}} yarns are fancy yarns. Fancy yarns enable to obtain various, often distinctive, textile effects providing exclusivity to fabric. For these reasons, the majority of fancy yarns are used in the clothing industry and high fashion. However, these yarns are also used in the production of other textiles, in particular, in technical textiles. The aim of this work is to weave fabrics with fancy yarns in the weft, and to analyse the impact of the fatigue process on mechanical properties of fabrics. The object of research are 14 variants of fabrics with fancy yarns of different structure in the weft. Designed fabrics may be used in the manufacture of car seat upholstery. Fabrics were stressed in different fatigue cycles, i. e. 500 000 and 1 000 000 cycles. In addition, fabrics were stressed at the temperature of - 25 °C to maximize the stressing environment, and to mimic conditions in the use of fabric. The next stage of this work the mechanical properties of <b>fabrics</b> (<b>breaking</b> force, elongation and breaking work) were determined before and after fatigue with different number of cycles. Also, the impact of the fatigue process on mechanical properties of the analysed fabrics was evaluated. In addition, the impact of overfeed used during the manufacturer of fancy yarns to mechanical properties of fabrics of these yarns was determined. It was found in the study that the fatigue and the different number of cycles of fatigue affect mechanical properties of tested fabrics with fancy yarns in the weft. It was found that there is no correlation between overfeed used in the manufacture of fancy yarns, and mechanical properties of fabrics with these yarns...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comparatively}} examines {{a selection}} of twenty-first century sheikh romances and Middle English romances from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that imagine an erotic relationship occurring between east and west. They do so {{against a background of}} conflict, articulated in military confrontation and binary religious and ethnic division. The thesis explores the strategies used to facilitate the cross-cultural relationship across such a gulf of difference and considers what a comparison of medieval and modern romance can reveal about attitudes towards otherness in popular romance. In Chapter 1, I analyse the construction of the east in each genre, investigating how the homogenisation of the romance east in sheikh romance distances it from the geopolitical reality of those parts of the Middle East seen, by the west, to be "other". Chapter 2 examines the articulation of gender identity {{and the ways in which}} these romances subvert and reassert binary gender difference to uphold normative heterosexual relations. Chapter 3 considers how ethnic and religious difference is nuanced, in particular through the use of <b>fabric,</b> <b>breaking</b> down the disjunction between east and west. Chapter 4 investigates the way ethnicity, religion and gender affect hierarchies of power in the abduction motif, enabling undesirable aspects of the east to be recast. The key finding of this thesis is that both romance genres facilitate the cross-cultural erotic relationship by rewriting apparently binary differences of religion and ethnicity to create sameness. While the east is figured differently in Middle English and modern sheikh romance, the strategies they use to facilitate the cross-cultural erotic relationship are similar. The thesis concludes that the constancy of certain attitudes towards the east in both medieval and modern romance reveals a persistence of conservative values in representations of the east in romance...|$|R

40|$|Tearing {{resistance}} {{is an important}} parameter for evalu-ating the reliability of textile structures, {{especially in the case}} of protective materials. In order to better under-stand the individual contribution of the different mecha-nisms involved in the tearing process, a study of the relation between the fabric and yarn properties charac-terizing these mechanisms and the tearing energy has been carried out. For that purpose, polyester fabrics with two types of weave patterns and various values of filling yarn density and linear density were character-ized in terms of tongue tear energy, yarn and <b>fabric</b> modulus, <b>breaking</b> force and elongation at break, yarn slippage, and yarn jamming. Data for all tested fabrics relied on a unique master curve when the tearing energy was expressed as a function of the transverse yarn slippage force. This demonstrates the strong con-tribution of transverse yarn slippage to the tearing pro-cess, a mechanism which has generally been over-looked in previous works on tearing. Relationships between the tearing energy and the other properties characteristics of the mechanisms involved in tearing of woven textiles were also observed. These results build the path toward the development of models for the tearing energy of textile structures. POLYM. COMPOS. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the issue}} {{related to the}} influence of finishing on fabrics, made of yarn of different raw material, by research of mechanical and end-use properties. The issue is relevant to textile companies that manufacture fabrics from various natural fibres and its blends. During the manufacturing process, it has been noticed that finishing has a negative effect on end-use properties, such as abrasion resistance and pilling. Moreover, finishing has an impact on mechanical properties of fibres, such as breaking force and elongation at break. Therefore, this work analyses the abovementioned mechanical (breaking force and elongation at break) properties of yarn and fabrics made of it and end-use (abrasion resistance and pilling) properties of grey fabrics and finished fabrics. It has been determined that the strength and tension rates of used yarn have an impact on <b>fabrics</b> and its <b>breaking</b> force and elongation at <b>break.</b> The <b>fabric</b> finishing affects the properties of the mentioned <b>fabrics,</b> i. e. <b>breaking</b> force decreases after finishing, while the elongation at break increases. During finishing, fabrics undergo various chemical and mechanical impacts which might decrease the quality of fabrics. On the other hand, fabrics become denser, its threads crimp, and thus fabrics become more tensile. Finishing affects end-use fabric properties as well (resistance to abrasion and pilling). These properties of fabrics worsen. Dependencies are described by linear equations. During the abrasion resistance analysis, almost all of the dependencies were strong. Abrasion resistance of grey fabrics was higher than those after finishing. Pilling resistance of grey fabrics is also better than of fabrics after finishing. Pilling resistance dependencies on the number of abrasion cycles were mostly of medium strength. It might be concluded that finishing and the raw material of used yarn influences the mechanical (breaking force, elongation at break) and end-use (abrasion resistance and pilling) properties of fabrics...|$|R
50|$|Moisture-wicking fabrics are a {{class of}} hi-tech fabrics that provide {{moisture}} control for an athlete's skin. They move perspiration {{away from the body}} to the fabric's outer surface where it can evaporate. These fabrics typically are soft, lightweight, and stretchy—in other words, they are perfectly suited for making activewear. Moisture-wicking means that the fabric is absorbent and this can leave a barrier of wet fabric on your skin. Drywicking is the newest variation of moisture wicking. It is a smart two tier <b>fabric</b> that <b>breaks</b> the surface tension of sweat and propels it through the hydrophobic layer into a natural wicking outer layer like cotton where it is assisted by evaporative cooling leaving your skin absolutely dry. Besides the fact that your body can perform better, it will chemically free prevent odors because a bacteria microclimate cannot grow on dry skin. This broad category of fabrics is used to make garments like T-shirts, sports bras, running and cycling jerseys, socks, tracksuits, and polo-style shirts for any physical activity where the goal is to keep your skin as cool and dry as possible. Moisture-wicking fabrics are used to make apparel for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, mountain biking, snow skiing, and mountain climbing. Due to the popularity of garments made from these fabrics, more variations are being introduced to the market.|$|R

It differs from the wild type in having stouter, somewhat recurved spines on the seed heads. The dried flower heads were attached to spindles, wheels, or cylinders, sometimes called teasel frames, to raise the nap on fabrics (that is, to tease the fibres). By the 20th century, teasels had been largely replaced by metal cards, which can be made uniformly and do not require constant replacement as the teasel heads wear. However, some people who weave wool still prefer to use teasels for raising the nap, claiming that the result is better; in particular, if a teasel meets serious resistance in the <b>fabric,</b> it will <b>break,</b> whereas a metal tool will rip the cloth.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the time}} that early African-American {{quilting}} became a tradition in and of itself, it was already a combination of textile traditions from four civilizations of Central and West Africa: the Mande-speaking peoples, the Yoruba and Fon peoples, the Ejagham peoples, and the Kongo peoples. As textiles were traded heavily throughout the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern United States, the traditions of each distinct region became intermixed. Originally, most of the textiles were made by men. Yet when slaves {{were brought to the}} United States, their work was divided according to Western patriarchal standards and women took over the tradition. However, this strong tradition of weaving left a visible mark on African-American quilting. The use of strips, reminiscent of the strips of reed and fabric used in men's traditional weaving, are used in <b>fabric</b> quilting. A <b>break</b> in a pattern symbolized a rebirth in the ancestral power of the creator or wearer. It also helped keep evil spirits away; evil is believed to travel in straight lines and a break in a pattern or line confuses the spirits and slows them down. This tradition is highly recognizable in African-American improvisations on European-American patterns. The traditions of improvisation and multiple patterning also protect the quilter from anyone copying their quilts. These traditions allow for a strong sense of ownership and creativity.In the 1980s, concurrent with the boom in art quilting in America, new attention was brought to African-American traditions and innovations. This attention came from two opposing points of view, one validating the practices of rural Southern African-American quilters and another asserting that there was no one style but rather the same individualization found among white quilters. John Vlach, in a 1976 exhibition, and Maude Wahlman, co-organizing a 1979 exhibition, both cited the use of strips, high-contrast colors, large design elements, and multiple patterns as characteristic and compared them to rhythms in black music. Building on the relationship between quilting and musical performance, African-American quilter Gwendolyn Ann Magee created a twelve-piece exhibition based on the lyrics of James Weldon Johnson's [...] "Lift Every Voice and Sing," [...] commonly known as the [...] "Negro National Anthem." [...] Cuesta Benberry, a quilt historian with a special interest in African-American works, published Always There: The African-American Presence in American Quilts in 1992 and organized an exhibition documenting the contributions of black quilters to mainstream American quilting. Eli Leon, a collector of African-American quilts, organized a traveling exhibition in 1987 that introduced both historic and current quilters, some loosely following patterns and others improvising, such as Rosie Lee Tompkins. He argued for the creativity of the irregular quilt, saying that these quilters saw the quilt block as [...] "an invitation to variation" [...] and felt that measuring [...] "takes the heart outa things." [...] At the same time, the Williams College Museum of Art was circulating Stitching Memories: African-American Story Quilts, an exhibition featuring a different approach to quilts, including most prominently the quilts of Faith Ringgold. However, it was not until 2002, when the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, organized The Quilts of Gee's Bend, an exhibition that appeared in major museums around the country, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, that art critics unknowingly adopted Leon's assertions.|$|R
