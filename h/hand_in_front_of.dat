25|$|Soon afterward, Călinescu, {{acting on}} {{indications}} from the monarch, arrested Codreanu and prosecuted him in two successive trials. Antonescu, whose mandate of Defense Minister had been prolonged under the premiership of Miron Cristea, resigned in protest to Codreanu's arrest. He was a celebrity defense witness at the latter's {{first and second}} trials. During the latter, which saw Codreanu's conviction for treason, Antonescu vouched for his friend's honesty while shaking his <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the jury. Upon the end of procedures, the king ordered his former minister interned at Predeal, before assigning him to command the Third Army in the remote eastern region of Bessarabia (and later removing him after Antonescu expressed sympathy for Guardists imprisoned in Chișinău). Attempting to discredit his rival, Carol also ordered Antonescu's wife to be tried for bigamy, based on a false claim that her divorce had not been finalized. Defended by Mihai Antonescu, the officer was able to prove his detractors wrong. Codreanu himself {{was taken into custody}} and discreetly killed by the Gendarmes acting on Carol's orders (November 1938).|$|E

Driven to Cape Town's City Hall through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but {{made it clear that}} the ANC's armed struggle was not over, and would continue as [...] "a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid". He expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations, so that [...] "there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle", and insisted that his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right to vote in national and local elections. Staying at Tutu's home, in the following days Mandela met with friends, activists, and press, giving a speech to an estimated 100,000 people at Johannesburg's Soccer City.|$|E

500|$|Momolo Mortara {{followed}} the Italian Army into Rome hoping to finally reclaim his son. According to some accounts, he {{was preceded by}} his son Riccardo, Edgardo's elder brother, who had entered the kingdom's service as an infantry officer. Riccardo Mortara fought his way to San Pietro in Vincoli and found his brother's convent room. Edgardo covered his eyes, raised his <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him and shouted: [...] "Get back, Satan!" [...] When Riccardo {{said that he was}} his brother, Edgardo replied: [...] "Before you get any closer to me, take off that assassin's uniform." [...] Whatever the truth, what is certain is that Edgardo reacted to the capture of Rome with intense panic. He later wrote: [...] "After the Piedmontese troops entered Rome... they used their force to seize the neophyte Coen from the Collegio degli Scolopi, [...] turned toward San Pietro in Vincoli to try to kidnap me as well." [...] The Roman chief of police asked Edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion, but he refused. He subsequently met the Italian commander, General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished. Edgardo was smuggled out of Rome by train along with a priest on 22 October 1870, late at night and in lay clothes. He made his way north and escaped to Austria.|$|E

Despite these measures, the odor symptom is reported to still offend other people. Example ORS behaviors include: repetitive showering and other grooming behaviors, excessive tooth brushing, or tongue scraping (a treatment for halitosis), repeated smelling of oneself to check for any odor, over-frequent bathroom use, attempts to mask the odor, with excessive use of deodorants, perfumes, mouthwash, mint, chewing gum, scented candles, and soap; changing clothes (e.g. underwear), multiple times per day, frequent washing of clothes, wearing several layers of clothing, wrapping feet in plastic, wearing garments marketed as odor-reducing, eating special diets, dietary supplements (e.g. intended to reduce flatulence odor), repeatedly seeking reassurance from others that there is no odor, although the negative response is usually interpreted instead as politeness rather than truth, and avoidance behaviors such habitually sitting at a distance from others, minimizing movement in an attempt [...] "not to spread the odor", keeping the mouth closed and avoiding talking or talking with a <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Many Japanese {{women are}} embarrassed {{at the thought}} of being heard by others during {{urination}} (see paruresis). To cover the sound of bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously while using them, wasting a large amount of water in the process. As education campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was introduced in the 1980s that, after activation, produces the sound of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand name commonly found is the [...] This device is now routinely placed in most new public women's rooms, and many older public women's rooms have been upgraded. The Otohime may be either a separate battery-operated device attached to the wall of the toilet, or included in an existing washlet. The device is activated by pressing a button, or by the wave of a <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a motion sensor. When activated, the device creates a loud flushing sound similar to a toilet being flushed. This sound either stops after a preset time or can be halted through a second press on the button. It is estimated that this saves up to 20 liters of water per use. However, some women believe that the Otohime sounds artificial and prefer to use a continuous flushing of the toilet instead of the recorded flush of the Otohime.|$|E
