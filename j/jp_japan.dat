40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of seismic precursor electromagnetic investigations, we analyzed the very low frequency (VLF) amplitude signals recorded by the Instrument Champ Electrique (ICE) experiment on board the DEMETER micro-satellite. The sun-synchronous orbits of the micro-satellite allowed us to cover an invariant latitude of between - 65 ° and + 65 ° in a time interval of about 40 min. We considered four transmitter signals emitted by stations in Europe (France, FTU, 18. 3 kHz; Germany, DFY, 16. 58 kHz),Asia (<b>Japan,</b> <b>JP,</b> 17. 8 kHz) and Australia (Australia, NWC, 19. 8 kHz). We studied the variations of these VLF signals, taking into consideration: the signal-to-noise ratio, sunspots, and the geomagnetic activity. We show {{that the degree of}} correlation in periods of high geomagnetic and solar activities is, on average, about 40 %. Such effects can be fully neglected in the period of weak activity. We also find that the solar activity can have a more important effect on the VLF transmitter signal than the geomagnetic activity. Our data are combined with models where the coupling between the lithosphere, atmosphere and ionosphere is essential to explain how ionospheric disturbances scatter the VLF transmitter signal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} {{electric}} field measurements recorded by DEMETER/ICE experiment above {{very low frequency}} (VLF) transmitter stations. The sun-synchronous orbits of the DEMETER satellite lead us to cover an invariant latitude range between- 65 • and + 65 • in a time interval of about 40 minutes. We select three ground-based transmitter stations localised in Australia (NWC, 19. 8 kHz), in Germany (DFY, 16. 58 kHz) and in <b>Japan</b> (<b>JP,</b> 17. 8 kHz). We analyse the complete set of data recorded from August 2004 to December 2010. We distinguish between the VLF signals observed when the satellite was on day-or night-sides of the Earth at about 22 LT and 10 LT, respectively. We characterize the reception condition of the VLF signal taking into consideration the satellite position above the transmitter stations. We find that the signal amplitude is increasing (up to a maximum) and decreasing (down to a minimum) in a time interval of about 12 days. This 'regular' reception of the VLF signal is a signature of quiet ionosphere behaviour above the transmitter stations. We discuss in our contribution about the time intervals where the VLF signals were almost not detected.

40|$|Melon {{yellow spot}} virus (MYSV), a {{tentative}} {{member of the}} genus Tospovirus, is considered a distinct serotype {{due to the lack}} of a serological relationship with other tospoviruses in its nucleocapsid protein (NP). Recently, a virus isolate collected from diseased watermelon in central Taiwan (MYSV-TW) was found to react with a rabbit antiserum (RAs) prepared against the NP of Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV), and a monoclonal antibody (MAb) prepared against the common epitope of the NSs proteins of WSMoV-serogroup tospoviruses, but not with the WSMoV NP-specific MAb, in both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting. In this investigation, both RAs and MAb against MYSV-TW NP were produced. Results of serological tests revealed that the RAs to MYSV-TW NP reacted with the homologous antigen and the crude antigens of members of the WSMoV serogroup, including members of the formal species WSMoV and Peanut bud necrosis virus, and members of three tentative species, Watermelon bud necrosis virus, Capsicum chlorosis virus and Calla lily chlorotic spot virus. The MAb to MYSV-TW NP reacted only with the homologous antigen and the other geographic isolates of MYSV from <b>Japan</b> (<b>JP)</b> and Thailand (TH). Our results of reciprocal tests indicate that the NP and the NSs protein of MYSV are serologically related to those of WSMoV-serogroup tospoviruses. Furthermore, we show that both the MYSV NP MAb and the WSMoV NP MAb are reliable tools for identification of MYSV and WSMoV from single or mixed infection in field surveys, as verified using species-specific primers in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction...|$|R

Here, the work suggested in the peer-review process shall be carried out to expand the applicability domain and fully replace the rabbit assay. National pharmacopoeias limit the pyrogen content of pharmaceutical products for parenteral application and require the use of appropriate tests. Several decades after the Rabbit Pyrogen Test (RPT) and the Bacterial Endotoxin Test (BET) the Monocyte Activation Test (MAT) has been established as an in vitro method for the detection of pyrogens (1). The method was incorporated in the European Pharmacopoeia (EP 6. 7 Chapter 2. 6. 30) in April 2010 as a replacement for the RPT (2). The respective reception into the Pharmacopoeias of the United States (USP) and <b>Japan</b> (<b>JP)</b> so far has not taken place, though a positive peerreview was carried out by JaCVAM. The test method was recommended by ICCVAM following a comprehensive evaluation of its validation status.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The lateral line sensory {{system allows}} fish to sense water movement. It has {{been implicated in}} many behaviors, {{including}} schooling, prey detection and capture, and rheotaxis. The number and arrangement of neuromasts in the lateral line varies substantially between populations of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In some cases, variation in the lateral line is correlated with variation in ecological habitat, suggesting {{that it may be}} adaptive. Previous work in the Peichel lab identified differences between the adult lateral line patterns of two stickleback populations, a marine population from <b>Japan</b> (<b>JP)</b> and a freshwater benthic lake population from British Columbia (PB), as well as the genetic architecture of those differences. The most striking differences between these two populations are in the number and patterning of neuromasts in the main posterior (Mp) trunk line. For my thesis research, I investigated the developmental and genetic basis of the differences in Mp. PB fish have more neuromasts than JP in the Mp line, and this difference maps to Chromosome XXI. In Chapters 2 and 3, I used a number of techniques to try to identify the gene within the region responsible for the difference in number: recombination mapping, analysis of individual candidate genes, RNA-seq analysis of all genes in the region, and in situ hybridization. I did not identify the causative gene, but I did show that the candidate gene Eya 1 is expressed in neuromasts during stickleback development. I also demonstrated that difference in neuromast number between PB and another freshwater population does not map to Chromosome XXI, suggesting that there are other loci that control neuromast number in sticklebacks. A second difference in the Mp line, the arrangement of neuromasts, correlates strongly with the presence of bony lateral plates and maps to Chromosome IV. In Chapter 4, I found that the elaboration of the neuromast pattern coincides with the growth of those plates through postembryonic development. I also used transgenesis to demonstrate that pleiotropic activity of the gene responsible for plate development, Eda, is also responsible for the difference in neuromast pattern...|$|R

Dublin, Ireland August 25 – 28, 2016 BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular {{events are}} {{the leading cause of}} {{mortality}} and morbidity in United States (US) and other industrialized countries. However, little is known about trends in the incidence and resource utilization of these conditions in Asia as life-style have westernized. OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence (IR) and medical resource utilization of cardiovascular events among the study population in Hong Kong (HK), Taiwan (TW), <b>Japan</b> (<b>JP)</b> and US from 2006 - 2013. METHODS: We utilized the OMOP common data model in the AsPEN converted from a 1 % random sample of Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), a 5 % random sample from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Japan Medical Data Center Database (JMDC), and 5 % sample from the US Medicare database. Hospitalization and length of hospital stay for myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were identified from the databases. Comorbidities and concurrent medications for the patients {{at the time of the}} MI/ACS were assessed. RESULTS: The age-gender adjusted IR (per 100 persons) for MI/ACS were 0. 2 in HK, 0. 1 in JP and TW, and 0. 9 in US. Average number of hospitalizations increased from 4. 7 - 15. 2 in HK, 0. 8 - 1. 1 in JP, 4. 5 - 7. 0 in US but slightly decreased in TW (10. 8 - 10. 0) over the study period. Average length of stay was increased by 14. 5 %- 107. 9 % across the four countries. Congestive heart failure and hypertension were the most common comorbidities in these patients. Medications used after MI/ACS were quite different across sites: 93 % of HK and 63 % of TW patients started antiplatelet after MI/ACS vs. only 14 % patients in JP and 0. 1 % in US. 61 % patients in HK started renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors after diagnosis, whereas 22. 1 % and 38. 3 % patients in TW and US started the same treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The IR of MI/ACS were similar among different Asian sites but were higher in US. An increasing number of hospitalizations and length of stay suggested an increasing disease burden. Discrepancy in recommended drug use after MI/ACS provides additional insights into the variation across countries in treatment patterns that must be appreciated when undertaking multinational studies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of clinically recognized disease among the study population in Hong Kong (HK), Taiwan (TW), <b>Japan</b> (<b>JP)</b> and the United States (US). METHODS: We utilized the OMOP common data model in the AsPEN converted from a 1 % random sample of Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), a 5 % random sample from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Japan Medical Data Center Database (JMDC), and 5 % sample from the US Medicare database. Prevalence rates (per 100 persons, age-gender adjusted) of 33 clinically recognized diseases were evaluated. RESULTS: 6, 476, 773 individuals were identified in 4 databases, 47 % were male. Hypertension is the most common disease in HK, TW and US and ranked fourth in JP with the prevalence of 2. 6, 7. 9, 59. 6 and 4. 6 respectively. Diabetes ranked third in HK (1. 3), fourth in TW (3. 8), fifth in JP (3. 7) and third in US (23. 3). Hyperlipidemia is the second most common in TW (5. 1), JP (4. 9) and US (51. 6) and seventh in HK (0. 8). Obstructive chronic bronchitis is the third most common disease in TW and JP (4. 6 for TW, 4. 8 for JP, 0. 7 for HK, 9. 1 for US). Asthma is the most common disease in JP (7. 6) but not in other sites (0. 5 for HK, 2. 3 for TW, 5 for US). Prevalence of cancers were similar among Asian sites ranging from 0. 1 - 0. 5 but were lower than US (0. 4 - 2. 2). Similar pattern was observed in psychiatric disorders; Prevalence of depression and schizophrenia were 0. 4 - 1. 6 and 0. 4 in Asian sites whereas 4. 4 and 1 in US. US has the highest prevalence in most of the diseases. CONCLUSIONS: US has the highest age-gender adjusted prevalence across most of the diseases but the discrepancy was much less in non-CV diseases. This may be due to the difference in diet and lifestyle as well as in health care system and coding between Asian countries and US. Understanding the underlying prevalence of disease across standardized database representations is important when undertaking multi-national studies. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
