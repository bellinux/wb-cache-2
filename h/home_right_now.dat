50|$|Flav {{decides to}} have the three {{remaining}} girls' parents come over {{so he can get}} to know them. Hours before the remaining girls' parents arrive, everyone is cleaning and preparing rooms for the parents. Suddenly New York is bothering Deelishis because she believed that Deelishis intentionally took the room that New York chose her parents to stay in. Deelishis, unknowing of what New York is so upset about, has a brief confrontation with New York over who gets the room. Then Deelishis' parents arrive. Flav immediately likes Deelishis's parents. New York's parents arrive and as was shown from Season 1, New York's mother doesn't like Flav. This leads to a confrontation early on, and we discover that New York's mother will do anything to keep her daughter from being together with Flav, even fake a terminal illness. Flav then invites his six children and two grandchildren to the house to get their input on who would make a better stepmother. Later, he takes the women and their mothers over on separate dates: Deelishis and her parents go to a magic show and dinner; Krazy, her mother, and her grandmother go to the hair salon; and Flav orders an assortment of soul food for New York and her parents. That night during elimination, Flav eliminates Krazy because he suspects she is only on the show to further her singing career. At the end, he announces that Deelishis and New York will be going to Placencia, Belize the next day. The show ends with New York's mother yelling, insisting that New York is coming <b>home</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> New York, however, does not leave the mansion.|$|E
40|$|An Englishman's home is his castle”. The phrase {{originates}} from 17 th century England, when it {{referred to}} the principle of being able to refuse entry to your home. If you are browsing this article from <b>home</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> you might question if that principle is particularly well applied in a time of mass surveillance. But today, when we say a person’s house is their castle it is usually to suggest that it is natural for us to buy a house – particularly if we are British. The implication is that we won’t feel safe and secure, certainly not prosperous, unless we own a home. This emotional connection to home ownership is something that politicians can be keen to connect to. Yet recent evidence shows unrestrained mechanisms for home ownership are actually an enemy of our prosperity...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [91]- 92) The {{major issues}} of People's Republic of China Chinese students' assimilation to the US culture and their segregation from the culture {{are discussed in}} this thesis. I explored the factors influencing assimilation of Chinese students: achieving success in American terms, lack of culture awareness and belief in American hegemony. The factors influencing segregation of Chinese students are: sense of inferiority, sense of frustration, perception of what Chinese students believe about Americans, and the treatment from Americans. A historical reference of "Working-study Movement in France” is used to demonstrate {{its impact on the}} current Chinese students who are studying in the United States. The discussions on these issues provide an understanding of what is happening to the PRC Chinese students in this country. The findings show that assimilation results in students' personal growth and critical learning from this country; on the other hand, it also results in the students' strong Americanization. Segregation results from the students' cultural characteristic and their unpleasant experience of stepping into the society. Regarding the issue of going back home or staying in this country, I find that the June 4 th Tiananmen incident impacts the students' attitudes very much. They don't want to go <b>home</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> because of the political situation since June 4 th 1990, but they want to go home later if things change. M. S. Ed.

I’ll bet you’d {{like some of}} this heat, it must be terribly cold at <b>home</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> I didn’t do {{anything}} this weekend, I only had until nine o’clock Saturday night because {{we were supposed to}} fly Sunday. Went to the movies on the post, saw two stinkin’ pictures, I’ve even forgotten what they were. I went last night again though and saw Fred MacMurray and Claudette Colbert in “Practically Yours” it was quite good and very funny. I saw “Experiment Perilous” it was marvelous wasn’t it? Well honey I finally wrote Uncle Guy. Told him I was going to get married now I’m hopefully awaiting an answer. I guess Dottie told you I was getting 15 days delay en route in March. We still want to get married down here because it’s so much easier and cheaper, the Six’s will probably blow a gut but that’s T. S. were’re [sic] the ones that are getting married. Gosh the train fare home for us would just about swamp me, and then we’d have {{to go all the way}} to Texas, I couldn’t do it, it will be tough enough as it is. And another thing, we’d waste so much time traveling too. How do you feel about it honey? Do you think I should get married at home? I spoke to the Chaplain about the chapel. He’s a wonderful man, a lot of fun we talked for about an hour and a half like a couple of old ladies. It’s all arranged for two o’clock Sunday afternoon. I think I graduate at ten in the morning. Honey, what kind of a bouquet should I get Dottie? What did Bobbie have? I’ve never done this before, you’re an old hand at it by now I guess. Gosh it sure is complicated, I can see now what you went through marrying off two daughters. I spoke to the photographer and that’s all settled, for $ 15. Money, money, whew! Well honey, take care of yourself, I’m so glad you’re feeling better. Give my love to everyone and to you honey, I send a heartful and a thousand kisses, always. Your devoted Son Judd [Transcription ends...|$|E
