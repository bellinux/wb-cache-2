5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

500|$|A hadith records that, {{when the}} second Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (580–644) came to kiss the stone, he said {{in front of all}} assembled: [...] "No doubt, I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a stone and can neither harm anyone nor benefit anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger [...] kissing you, I would not have kissed you." [...] However, in the hadith {{collection}} Kanz al-Ummal, it is recorded that Ali responded to Umar, saying, [...] "This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm. ... Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, 'Am I not your creator?' Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a pair of eyes, ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj." ...|$|E

The public took it for granted, Maria was startled: [...] "Nicholas, what have you done? Didn't you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> heir presumptive?" [...] The oath sparked an unprecedented dynastic crisis: two principal contenders forfeited their rights in favor {{of each other in}} [...] "a hitherto unheard-of struggle — a struggle not for the acquisition of power, but for its renunciation!". The throne remained vacant.|$|E

2500|$|On 12–13 May 2010, Pope Benedict XVI {{visited the}} Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima and {{strongly}} stated his {{acceptance of the}} supernatural origin of the Fátima apparitions. On the first day, the Pope arrived at the Chapel of Apparitions to pray; he gave a Golden Rose to Our Lady of Fátima [...] "as a homage of gratitude from the Pope for the marvels that the Almighty has worked through you {{in the hearts of}} so many who come as pilgrims to this your maternal home". The Pope also recalled the [...] "invisible hand" [...] that saved John Paul II. He said in a prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary that [...] "it is a profound consolation to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> crowned not only with the silver and gold of our joys and hopes, but also with the 'bullet' of our anxieties and sufferings." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the United Kingdom and {{the other}} Commonwealth realms, the British (and Commonwealth) monarch sends {{greetings}} (formerly as a telegram) on the 100th birthday and on every birthday beginning with the 105th. The tradition of Royal congratulations dates from 1908, when the Secretary for King Edward VII sent a congratulatory letter to Reverend Thomas Lord of Horncastle in a newspaper clipping, declaring, [...] "I am commanded by the King to congratulate you on the attainment of your hundredth year, after a most useful life." [...] The practice was formalised from 1917, under the reign of King George V, who also sent congratulations on the attainment of a 60th Wedding anniversary. Queen Elizabeth II sends a greeting card style with the notation: [...] "I am so pleased to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> celebrating your one-hundredth birthday, I send my congratulations and best wishes to you on such a special occasion", thereafter each few years the card is updated with a current picture of the Queen to ensure people do not receive the same card more than once. The Queen further sends her congratulations on one's 105th birthday and every year thereafter {{as well as on}} special wedding anniversaries; people must apply for greetings three weeks before the event, on the official British Monarch's website.|$|E
