5|$|Fast pace {{of life in}} Viet Nam {{during the}} decades of {{integration}} and development witnesses {{the changes in the}} traditional ao dai. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> traditional ao dai is disappearing from Vietnamese life. Yet, it is becoming more adaptable to these modern days.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5000|$|As Stan Moore has written, [...] "Just because truth {{has been}} omitted, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> truth is <b>not</b> true. Just because reality has <b>not</b> been perceived, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> real." ...|$|R

This era needs a vigilant society {{to be prepared}} for emergencies and unexpected events. Although natural disasters and violent acts cause people to panic, the scariest is actually people's mind.|$|R

5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on {{the manner in which the}} weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
25|$|Past simple accent {{retraction}} is regular, {{present tense}} accent retraction is sporadic. If a particular verb retracts its accent in one tense, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other tense will follow suit.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{statistical}} mechanics proper involves dynamics, here the attention is focussed on statistical equilibrium (steady state). Statistical equilibrium <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> particles have stopped moving (mechanical equilibrium), rather, {{only that the}} ensemble is not evolving.|$|E

25|$|On August 8, 2015, {{after months}} of speculation, Nine {{confirmed}} that the Big Brother house had been dismantled, {{and that they had}} formally 'rested' the format. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show may not return in future years.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{customer}} attrition is bad. For many firms, it {{is useful}} and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away. This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers. However, simply because a customer is unprofitable <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> customer should be divested, because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers.|$|E
25|$|If the {{reaction}} equation is balanced, that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reaction really occurs. The {{rate at which}} reactions occur depends on the particle energy, the particle flux and {{the reaction}} cross section. An example of a large repository of reaction rates is the REACLIB database, as maintained by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics.|$|E

25|$|The {{evaluation}} of such characteristics is now predominantly subjective though efforts to meaningfully quantify {{this type of}} information are ongoing. Subjective evaluation <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> results of properly conducted comparisons will be unreliable or inaccurate. To the contrary, scientific testing has shown that professional document examiners (as a group) out-perform lay-people when comparing handwriting or signatures to assess authorship.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advocate}} replacing enlarging with evolution. Certainly moles {{that change}} and evolve {{will be a}} concern. Alternatively, some practitioners prefer elevation. Elevation can help identify a melanoma, but lack of elevation <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lesion is not a melanoma. Most melanomas in the US are detected before they become elevated. By the time elevation is visible, they may have progressed to the more dangerous invasive stage.|$|E
25|$|A breed {{that is not}} {{recognised}} by a {{kennel club}} means {{that it has not}} been sufficiently vetted according to that particular kennel club's rules. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breed is not a breed. Major kennel clubs usually require a breed to have a specific amount of documentation, as well as a large enough breed club to warrant the training of judges for the breed, for the breed to be accepted.|$|E

25|$|The Hague Conventions, {{addressing}} the codes of wartime conduct {{on land and}} at sea, were adopted before the rise of air power. Despite repeated diplomatic attempts to update international humanitarian law to include aerial warfare, it was not updated before the outbreak of World War II. The absence of positive international humanitarian law <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> laws of war did not cover aerial warfare, {{but there was no}} general agreement of how to interpret those laws.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of adolescence, the amount of white matter in the brain {{increases}} linearly, while the amount of grey matter in the brain follows an inverted-U pattern. Through a process called synaptic pruning, unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated {{and the amount of}} grey matter is pared down. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> brain loses functionality; rather, it becomes more efficient due to increased myelination (insulation of axons) and the reduction of unused pathways.|$|E
25|$|The second legal {{criterion}} is {{that the}} constitution must be rigid. This is important to ensure that constitutional provisions can only be changed by an authority that is higher in status than the ordinary legislative body existing under the Constitution. However, rigidity <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Constitution is completely immutable. If the Constitution is static, the nation's political development may be stunted. Instead, rigidity of the Constitution merely contemplates that compared to ordinary legislation, the Constitution should {{be more difficult to}} amend.|$|E

25|$|Many {{genes in}} the {{flowering}} time pathway are conserved across all plants studied to date. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mechanism of action is similarly conserved. For example, the monocot rice accelerates its flowering in short-day conditions, while Arabidopsis thaliana, a eudicot, responds to long-day conditions. In both plants, the proteins CO and FT are present but in Arabidopsis thaliana CO enhances FT production, while in rice the CO homolog represses FT production, resulting in completely opposite downstream effects.|$|E
25|$|Explanation. This must {{be clear}} and {{coherent}} as attributing physical symptoms to a psychological cause is not accepted by many educated people in western cultures. It must emphasize the genuineness of the condition, {{that it is}} common, potentially reversible and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sufferer is psychotic. Taking a neutral-cause-based stance by describing the symptoms as functional may be helpful, but further studies are required. Ideally, the patient should be followed up neurologically {{for a while to}} ensure that the diagnosis has been understood.|$|E
25|$|An MOT test {{certificate}} confirms {{that at the}} time of test, the vehicle has met the minimum acceptable environmental and road safety standards. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vehicle is roadworthy for the life of the certificate. The test does not cover the condition of the engine (other than the emissions), clutch or gearbox. Maintenance that is necessary for the reliable and efficient operation of the vehicle but not its safety forms part of a service inspection that is recommended by manufacturers, but is not a legal requirement for operating the vehicle on the public highway.|$|E
