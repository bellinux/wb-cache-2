5|$|East of Rochester, NY31 {{continued}} eastward to Jordan, {{utilizing the}} Rochester–Pittsford portion of legislative Route14, the Perinton–Jordan segment of Route20, and its current alignment between Pittsford and Perinton. From Weedsport to Jordan, NY31 used {{a slightly different}} routing. It initially exited the village on Clinton Road and followed that road to Jordan, where NY31 turned north and followed modern NY317 and NY31 north and east to modern CR84. NY31 turned north here, using what is now Old Route31, current NY31, and <b>Downer</b> Street to reach Baldwinsville. Within the village, NY31 followed <b>Downer</b> Street and what is now NY48 along Syracuse Street between <b>Downer</b> and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY31 remained on its current routing to Cicero, where it followed a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road. It rejoined its modern alignment near the eastern town line, and followed it east {{to what is now}} NY316 in Lenox. From here, NY31 went southeastward to NY5 in Oneida by way of modern NY316 and NY46.|$|E
