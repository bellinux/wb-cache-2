Angelfish escape preferentially at 180 ˚ and 130 ˚ away from the stimulus, maximizing the distance covered from the stimulus and escaping at the limit of their discriminating zone, respectively. Angelfish correct their responses when turning towards the stimulus, suggesting that <b>escape</b> <b>trajectories</b> are modulated by sensory feedback. Re-analysis of published work on other animals, by employing circular histograms of <b>escape</b> <b>trajectories,</b> reveals multimodal patterns which are also not apparent from the linear plots.

The first stimulus consisted of mechanosensory cues, while the second stimulus included visual and mechanosensory cues. Responses to the two stimulus types differed, with the combined cues from the second stimulus type resulting in escapes over longer distances, and with greater directionality, compared to those following purely mechanosensory stimulation. Altering the direction of approach of the ‘predator’ affected the proportion of escapes that were to the side opposite from the eliciting stimulus and strongly influenced <b>escape</b> <b>trajectories.</b> Such unpredictability in the escape direction of P. elegans may be an example of so-called ‘Protean’ behaviour...|$|R

40|$|The <b>escape</b> <b>trajectories</b> animals take {{following}} a predatory attack appear to show high degrees of apparent 'randomness' - a property {{that has been}} described as 'protean behaviour'. Here we present a method of quantifying the <b>escape</b> <b>trajectories</b> of individual animals using a path complexity approach. When fish (Pseudomugil signifer) were attacked either on their own or in groups, we find that an individual's path rapidly increases in entropy (our measure of complexity) following the attack. For individuals on their own, this entropy remains elevated (indicating a more random path) for a sustained period (10 seconds) after the attack, whilst it falls more quickly for individuals in groups. The entropy of the path is context dependent. When attacks towards single fish come from greater distances, a fish's path shows less complexity compared to attacks that come from short range. This context dependency effect did not exist, however, when individuals were in groups. Nor did the path complexity of individuals in groups depend on a fish's local density of neighbours. We separate out the components of speed and direction changes to determine which of these components contributes to the overall increase in path complexity {{following a}}n attack. We found that both speed and direction measures contribute similarly to an individual's path's complexity in absolute terms. Our work highlights the adaptive behavioural tactics that animals use to avoid predators and also provides a novel method for quantifying the <b>escape</b> <b>trajectories</b> of animals.

40|$|The escape {{response}} of the cockroach is a well-studied example of sensorimotor behavior. Cockroaches respond to wind puffs, which may signal a predator attack, by making a swift turn followed by a forward acceleration. We have recently shown that their <b>escape</b> <b>trajectories,</b> measured relative {{to the position of}} the threatening stimulus, show preferred directions. 1 Previous work has often distinguished between {{the most common type of}} escape turn, which begins as a rotation away from the stimulus, and the relatively rare turns initiated towards the stimulus. Here, we analyze these “away” and “towards” responses in light of our recent work on preferred <b>escape</b> <b>trajectories</b> (ETs). We find that the ETs of towards responses show a pattern of frequency distribution similar to that of away responses. The range of the bodyturn angles of towards responses, however, is much smaller than that of away responses, being < 30 ° in most cases, which approximately corresponds to the angular distance between ET peaks. This suggests that cockroaches minimize their turn when making a towards response, which could represent an effective anti-predator behavior that allows cockroaches to reach one of the preferred ETs within a relatively short time...|$|R
