40|$|In this work, an {{analytical}} flow system {{able to perform}} low pressure chromatography with amperometric detection is presented. As case study, the determination of niacin (vitamin B 3) in coffee brewed samples was selected. The manifold comprised a 1. 0 cm length monolithic column coated with <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> a laboratory-made boron doped diamond electrode, and featured in-line ionic strength adjustment of the mobile phase. The figures of merit concerning the selected case study namely, detection limit, 7. 90 10 7 M, determination rate, ca. 10 samples h 1, mobile phase and ISA solution consumption, ca. 2. 6 mL per analysis, and CV, below 5 % for retention time and peak height, showed the competitiveness of this analytical strategy comparing to the described HPLC methods for niacin determination. The strategy displays a simple configuration, low cost, fast and easy assembling, foreseeing its use to general purpose applications...|$|E
40|$|Organoclays {{synthesised}} by the {{ion exchange}} of sodium in Wyoming Na-Montmorillonite (SWy- 2 -MMT) with three surfactants octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (ODTMA) formula C 21 H 46 NBr b) <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (DDDMA), formula C 22 H 48 BrN, and c) di(hydrogenated tallow) dimethylammonium chloride (tallow) were tested for hydrocarbon adsorption. Using diesel, hydraulic oil and engine oil an evaluation {{was made of}} the effectiveness of the sorbent materials for a range of hydrocarbon products that are likely to be involved in land-based oil spills. It was found that the hydrocarbon sorption capacity of the organo-clays depended upon the materials and surfactants used in the organoclay synthesis. Greater adsorption was obtained if the surfactant contained two or more hydrocarbon long chains. Extensive utilisation of chemometrics principally with the aid of MCDM methods, produced models which consistently ranked the organoclays well above any of the competitors including commercial benchmark materials. Thus the use of organo-clays for cleaning up oil spills is feasible due to its many desirable properties such as high hydrocarbon sorption and retention capacities, hydrophobicity. The negative effects of the use of organoclays for oil-spill cleanup are the cost, the biodegradability, and recyclability of the organo-clay...|$|E

40|$|Fluoroacetate is {{a highly}} toxic species {{naturally}} found in plants and in commercial products (compound 1080) for population control of several undesirable animal species. However, it is non-selective and toxic to many other animals including humans, and thus its detection {{is very important for}} forensic purposes. This paper presents a sensitive and fast method for the determination of fluoroacetate in blood serum using capillary electrophoresis with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection. Serum blood samples were treated with ethanol to remove proteins. The samples were analyzed in BGE containing 15 mmol/L histidine and 30 mmol/L gluconic acid (pH 3. 85). The calibration curve was linear up to 75 mu mol/L (R(2) = 0. 9995 for N = 12). The detection limit in the blood serum was 0. 15 mg/kg, which is smaller than the lethal dose for humans and other animals. Fluoride, a metabolite of the fluoroacetate defluorination, could also be detected for levels greater than 20 mu mol/L, when polybrene was used for reversion of the EOF. CTAB and <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> are not useful for this task because of the severe reduction of the fluoride level. However, no interference was observed for fluoroacetate.

40|$|Catanionic vesicles are {{appealing}} vectors in non-viral gene transfection. They possess high kinetic stability and the preparation procedures are easy and cheap. In addition, {{their size and}} charge are easily modulated by varying the mole ratio between the components. For these reasons, we investigated the interactions between positively charged catanionic vesicles made of <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (DiDAB) and 8 -hexadecyl sulfate (8 -SHS) with calf thymus DNA. Strongly associating complexes are obtained and their structure depends on DNA content. At low concentration, DNA/vesicles complexes are stable, with features very similar to bare vesicles. In the presence of DNA, multi-lamellar entities are formed; the process is promoted by the aggregation and rearrangement of DNA/vesicle complexes. Surface adsorption onto vesicles increases in proportion to DNA content. In such conditions, zeta-potential abruptly decreases, because {{of the formation of}} large clusters in which the vesicular identity is retained. Thereafter, precipitation occurs. The solid obtained accordingly is a lamellar phase with DNA sandwiched between the lamellae. The D- 1 distance between DNA molecules in the lamellar phase and the precipitate composition depend on the biopolymer content. The double helix of DNA undergoes a reversible compaction process that favors penetration into cells and protects it from nucleases degradation. Finally, addition of the anionic surfactant to the complexes favors DNA release, allowing for a specific signal controlled release...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{grafting}} of a phenate bearing sulfonate {{group in}} solution onto commercially available poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymers, where VDF and HFP stand for vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropene, respectively, is presented. This reaction leads to novel fluoropolymers, bearing aryl sulfonic acid side functions, which are fuel cell membrane precursors. A mechanism {{similar to the}} grafting of bisphenol onto VDF-containing copolymers is discussed. First, the sulfonate phenate is modified to give the <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> sulfonate phenate salt, {{in order to promote}} the substitution onto a fluorine atom in VDF unit adjacent to one HFP unit onto a fluorine atom in the copolymer. The substitution of this salt onto the fluorinated copolymer yields low molar percentages of grafted phenate, ranging from 1. 8 to 5. 1 mol-%, whereas it reaches values up to 13 mol-% grafting when the NH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 -S-CH 2 -CH 2 -C 6 H 4 -SO 3 Na amine is used as the grafting agent. NMR characterization is used to monitor the grafting process. The electrochemical properties of the resulting phenate grafted-poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymer are studied. The theoretical ion exchange capacities are half that of Nafion®. The proton conductivities are also lower than that of Nafion®, although one conductivity measurement reached a value of 5. 1 mS cm– 1, showing a non-negligible conductivity. The water uptake is lower than these noted for a sulfonated amine-grafted copolymer, and is of the same order as that for Nafion®. Finally, it is shown that these novel materials start to decompose above 200 °C, showing a similar thermostability as that of an amino-containing aryl sulfonate-grafted poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymer...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{show that}} transport-generated phase {{separation}} at the air-liquid interface in systems containing self-assembling amphiphilic molecules and polymers can be controlled by the relative humidity (RH) of the air. We also show that our observations can be described quantitatively with a theoretical model describing interfacial phase separation in a water gradient that we published previously. These phenomena arises {{from the fact that}} the water chemical potential corresponding to the ambient RH will, in general, not match the water chemical potential in the open aqueous solution. This implies nonequilibrium conditions at the air-water interface, which in turn can have consequences on the molecular organization in this layer. The experimental setup is such that we can control the boundary conditions in RH and thereby verify the predictions from the theoretical model. The polymer-surfactant systems studied here are composed of polyethylenimine (PEI) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (DDAB). Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering results show that interfacial phases with hexagonal or lamellar structure form at the interface of dilute polymer-surfactant micellar solutions. From spectroscopic ellipsometry data we conclude that variations in RH can be used to control the growth of micrometer-thick interfacial films and that reducing RH leads to thicker films. For the CTAB-PEI system, we compare the phase behavior of the interfacial phase to the equilibrium bulk phase behavior. The interfacial film resembles the bulk phases formed at high surfactant to polymer ratio and reduced water contents, and this can be used to predict the composition of interfacial phase. We also show that convection in the vapor phase strongly reduces film formation, likely due to reduction of the unstirred layer, where diffusive transport is dominating...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{behavior}} of {{an ad hoc}} synthesized surfactant, sodium 8 -hexadecylsulfate (8 -SHS), and its mixtures with <b>didecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (DiDAB) in water is reported. We dealt with dilute concentration regimes, at a total surfactant content of < 30 mmol kg- 1 where vesicular aggregates may be formed. The high synergistic {{behavior of}} such catanionic mixtures is concomitant with strongly negative interaction parameters, β (≈- 18 kBT), significant gain in the free energy of association, ΔGagg, and much lower association concentration compared to the pure surfactants. Vesicle size and ζ-potential depend on the mixture composition. Hydrodynamic diameters increase by progressive addition of oppositely charged surfactants {{to the one in}} excess. Counter-intuitively, the ζ-potential becomes more negative at DiDAB molar fractions close to 0. 2. The same holds in the reverse case, the ζ-potential becomes more positive after small additions of 8 -SHS; anyhow, the effect is more significant in anionic-rich mixtures. This phenomenon was explained by assuming a significant release of counterions and an asymmetric distribution of the two surfactants in the inner and outer vesicle leaflets. The equimolar mixtures form a cubic phase rather than the expected lamellar one. The effect of NaBr concentration on the stability of catanionic vesicles was also investigated. At high NaBr concentrations, all systems are destabilized. For DiDAB-rich vesicles, flocculation is observed, while for 8 -SHS-rich ones, lamellar domains are formed {{at the bottom of the}} samples. The role played by NaBr depends on whether it is added before or after mixing the surfactants. In particular, preformed catanionic vesicles show a great kinetic stability towards addition of NaBr compared to those obtained by other procedures.
