5|$|Lions {{head coach}} Buddy Parker saw Johnson's {{value as a}} blocker and moved him to fullback.

DePeyster used agents of the British Indian Department such as Alexander McKee and Simon Girty, both of whom had close relations with American Indians of the Ohio Country, to coordinate British and Indian military operations.|$|E
