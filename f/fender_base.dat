50|$|On February 11, 1994, the <b>Fender</b> {{manufacturing}} plant <b>based</b> in Ensenada, Mexico burned down. Fender President Bill Shultz decided to temporarily move production from the Mexico plant to the U.S. plant. These Fender guitars are fairly rare {{and can be}} identified by the unique serial number.|$|R
50|$|Takeshi {{has his own}} {{signature}} Bass, {{available from}} <b>Fender</b> Japan and <b>based</b> on a 1962 precision bass {{with a few of}} Takeshi's personal touches. It is available in both 4 and 5 string models, with a different set of stickers depending on which model it is.|$|R
50|$|When Fender redressed the Deluxe in 1963, {{they began}} {{producing}} a spin-off model that included an integrated spring reverb tank, thus {{giving birth to}} the Fender Deluxe Reverb. While the Deluxe Reverb continued to prosper for many years into the future, <b>Fender</b> discontinued the <b>base</b> Deluxe model in 1966.|$|R
50|$|Since he has {{released}} {{a series of}} introspective solo acoustic albums Long Way North (2008), Portraits (2010) and About A Time (2013) until the 2014 <b>Fender</b> Telecaster group <b>based</b> psychedelic garage rock of The World of The Wooltones.

50|$|In 1996, Isuzu {{replaced}} its Pick Up with {{a version}} of the Louisiana-built Chevrolet S-10, the Isuzu Hombre, based on the Brazilian market S-10 (the front grille and <b>fenders</b> are <b>based</b> on the Brazilian S-10 along with the truck bed sheet metal). The Hombre differs from its GM siblings mostly in the front sheetmetal, with different lights, grille, front bumper and front fenders, which are more flared out. The rear quarter panels are also different, as they have a slight flare over the wheel well to match the front fenders. - which was shared with the Brazilian-built Chevrolet S10 pickup. The Hombre had a much smaller range of equipment options. The Spacecab extended cab, V6 and four-wheel drive was added from 1997 to 1998.|$|R
5000|$|On May 13, 2005, {{the bridge}} caught on fire. NJ Transit {{engineers}} {{believe that the}} 13kV overhead electrical wires overheated, sending shards of metal towards the creosote-covered wooden <b>fenders</b> at the <b>base</b> of the bridge. [...] The immediate result of the fire was to block all traffic until the next morning. [...] The cost of the incident was $5M. On August 4, 2014, the bridge caught on fire, interrupting rail traffic for half an hour.|$|R
5000|$|Instead of {{updating}} the Telecaster, <b>Fender</b> decided, <b>based</b> on customer feedback, {{to leave the}} Telecaster as it was and design a new, upscale solid-body guitar to sell alongside the basic Telecaster. Western swing guitarist Bill Carson {{was one of the}} chief critics of the Telecaster, stating that the new design should have individually adjustable bridge saddles, four or five pickups, a vibrato unit {{that could be used in}} either direction and return to proper tuning, and a contoured body for enhanced comfort over the slab-body Telecaster's harsh edges. Fender, assisted by draftsman Freddie Tavares, began designing the Stratocaster in late 1953. It included a rounder, less [...] "club-like" [...] neck (at least for the first year of issue) and a double cutaway for easier reach to the upper registers.|$|R
5000|$|Shiflett uses various Gibsons and Gretschs, {{but over}} the past few years has been using mostly Fender Telecasters, Fender Telecaster Deluxes, and Fender Telecaster Thinlines. Shiflett also {{assembled}} some Telecaster Deluxes and Telecaster Thinlines out of Warmoth guitar parts with his tech. On the headstock of the Warmoth Telecasters, Shiflett's nickname [...] "Shifty" [...] replaces the Fender logo that would appear on a Telecaster created by Fender. He also has a signature <b>Fender</b> Telecaster Deluxe <b>based</b> on the Warmoth Telecasters, that is now his main guitar.|$|R
5000|$|Danel is {{the author}} of several books, the best known of which are biographies of French playwright and actor Sacha Guitry. His second book about Guitry is {{featured}} on the book list for French students at Berkeley University, CA. Danel also published a book about the Fender Stratocaster (foreword by Hank Marvin). In 2014, he released the video [...] "The <b>Fender</b> Stratocaster Story", <b>based</b> on the book and on his vast collection of guitars, in which can be found [...] "Miss Daisy", a scarce 1954 pre-production Stratocaster, worth US$250,000.|$|R
25|$|In May and June 1982, Honeyman-Scott {{was first}} in Los Angeles {{and then in}} Austin, Texas, for a short visit with his wife Peggy Sue <b>Fender</b> (an actress/model <b>based</b> in Austin, Texas), whom he had married in April 1981. His wife was staying with local guitarist Mark Younger Smith at this time (FamousInterview.com). While in Austin, he became {{involved}} in his first co-production effort for an album by Stephen Doster that was never released. During the sessions with Stephen Doster in Austin, Honeyman-Scott was called back to London for a band meeting on 14 June with Chrissie Hynde and Martin Chambers {{that resulted in the}} dismissal of Pete Farndon from the Pretenders, due to Farndon's increasing substance dependence.|$|R
5000|$|While {{recording}} the Cure's debut Three Imaginary Boys album in 1978, Smith's guitar {{during this period}} was a Woolworth's Top 20 electric guitar, and was told by Chris Parry to use a more suitable instrument, so Smith went out and purchased a <b>Fender</b> Jazzmaster (<b>based</b> on Smith's having recently seen Elvis Costello playing one on Top of the Pops, but then decided to have the Top 20 Pickup installed into the Jazzmaster, giving it a 3rd pickup. Smith explained this guitar customization in 1992: [...] "The third pickup the Fender Jazzmaster is from a Woolworth's Top 20 guitar, my very first electric. I took it in to record our first album, along with a little WEM combo amp. Manager/producer Chris Parry, who was paying for the record, said," [...] you can't use that!" [...] We {{went out and bought}} a Fender Jazzmaster, and I immediately had the Top 20 pickup installed in it, which really upset Chris. I played the entire Three Imaginary Boys album through a Top 20 pickup. It's a brilliant guitar, though I actually bought it because of how it looked." ...|$|R
50|$|In boating, a fender is {{a bumper}} used {{to absorb the}} kinetic energy of a boat or vessel {{berthing}} against a jetty, quay wall or other vessel. Fenders, used on all types of vessels, from cargo ships to cruise ships, ferries and personal yachts, prevent damage to vessels and berthing structures. To do this, fenders have high energy absorption and low reaction force. Fenders are typically manufactured out of rubber, foam elastomer or plastic. Rubber fenders are either extruded or made in a mold. The type of fender that is most suitable for an application depends on many variables, including dimensions and displacement of the vessel, maximum allowable stand-off, berthing structure, tidal variations and other berth-specific conditions. The size of the <b>fender</b> unit is <b>based</b> on the berthing energy of the vessel which {{is related to the}} square of the berthing velocity.|$|R
50|$|The most {{striking}} and obvious {{difference is the}} use of TV Jones or Fidelitron pickups, both of which are based on Gretsch designs. Gretsch was the first to have a patent approved for a humbucking pickup although Gibson had filed two years earlier, but there are significant differences in their designs. Gretsch pickups are said to have more of a jangle in their tone whereas Gibson humbuckers are more full bodied in tone and slightly larger. Over time, the Gibson design became the standard for humbucker pickups, although the Gretsch design has a smaller but significant following. The TV Jones Classic pickups are a modified and arguably improved version of the Gretsch Filter'Tron. Similarly, the <b>Fender</b> Fidelitron is <b>based</b> on the Filter'Tron design, although they have a tone more akin to a single coil pickup, the tone most associated with Fender.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, {{vehicles}} {{destined for}} General Export and the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council countries) received a facelift. Wider fenders, new headlights, grille, bumper, fog lights and sidesteps were {{all part of}} the redesign. The wide fenders are often called [...] "blister flare fenders". Driver and front-passenger SRS airbags were made standard on models equipped with the 3.5-liter DOHC V6 engine, whilst still remaining optional on GLS models with the 3.0-liter SOHC V6. 1080 of these units were also assembled in Iran by Bahman Khodro Group before being taken off production. An upgraded interior wood trim was made available on 3.0-liter GLS and 3.5-liter models. A leather-wrapped or leather and wood trim steering wheel was also made available, alongside an upgraded suspension and steering system. The 3.0-liter 12-valve SOHC engine was now available with a 24-valve configuration. Models without wide <b>fenders</b> remained as <b>base</b> models (GLX), available with a 2.4-liter 16-valve DOHC engine, producing [...] The 3.0-liter 12-valve engine was optional on these GLX models, and remained the base engine on the GLS.|$|R
40|$|Fendering {{systems are}} widely used in {{offshore}} installations for attenuating {{the effects of the}} impact energy of ships and barges in berthing or moored conditions. This study focuses on investigating current design practices and, developing a rational and functional approach to address random loading effects exerted on fendering systems. These loadings are often a consequence of combined wind, wave and current excitation as well as more controlled vessel motions. Dimensional analysis is used to investigate the degree to which empirical design data can be collapsed and to provide an indication of the nonlinearity associated with the empirical data for fender sizing. In addition, model test data specifically measuring the normal fender force for a coupled mini-TLP/Tender Barge performed at the Offshore Technology Research Center (OTRC) model basin is used in this research investigation [...] This data was characterized in terms of the typical statistical moments, which include the mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. The maxima and extreme values are extracted from the <b>fender</b> response data <b>based</b> upon a zero-crossing analysis and the results were studied {{in order to determine the}} underlying probability distribution function. Using selected parameter estimation techniques, coefficients of a best-fit two parameter model were determined. An illustrative example is presented and discussed that contrasts the deterministic and probabilistic models...|$|R
