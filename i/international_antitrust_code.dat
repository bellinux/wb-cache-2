40|$|In {{economic}} anthropology, {{the concept}} of 'market' needs a more detailed elaboration. The traditional distinction between barter and price markets does not suffice. One of the identifiable forms of market in anthropology is the individualized, "subjective" market which {{is defined by the}} question: "What is my (!) market?". It is characterized by competitive tension between economic rivals, not just by a good and an area. Using this concept of the market in the subjective sense, some aspects of globalized economy look different from hitherto held propositions. One of these aspects is a global competition law. An earlier draft proposal of an <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> <b>code</b> will be discussed and related to {{the concept of}} the subjective market {{as well as to the}} "convention method" of regulating crossborder legal issues in intellectual property law (the Paris and Berne Conventions). ...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{theory and}} {{empirical}} evidence suggest that governments might usefully intervene in high-technology competition in two ways: First, they could {{act as a}} neutral agent that creates the necessary credibility, commitment and mutual trust among private companies so as to facilitate cooperation in high-risk, high-volume R&D. Second, if — {{in view of the}} externalities involved — an element of subsidization is to be added, this could be done in a nondiscriminatory fashion. A favourable tax treatment of R&D expenditures may be the most appropriate tool to achieve this task. In practice, governments do engage in targeted industrial and technology policies, whether justified on economic grounds or not. As a consequence, the string of trade conflicts in hightech industries that began in the 1980 s is unlikely to end in the near future, unless substantial reforms are undertaken in some crucial areas of the international trade order. Above all, appropriate reform steps should be made with a view to the regulations on (i) subsidies, (ii) structural impediments, and (iii) dumping and anti-dumping. To mitigate the frictions that arise from a subsidization of domestic firms, a new set of rules should be established. The rules should provide that all plans to grant or to alter existing subsidies are to be notified to and approved by the WTO. Moreover, all subsidies should be ranked according to their potential distortional effects on competition and trade. For each category, quantitative limits that constrain the provision of subsidies to a certain fraction of the subsidy base should be set. To facilitate further liberalization steps, a country should be allowed to exceed these limits, if a national subsidy program offers an open access to firms located in third markets. Besides restrictive business practices of private firms, government regulations and technical standards are the most important structural impediments to trade. Existing GATT Articles already offer a multilateral route to conflict resolution in cases of structural impediments. However, this route has not been used by complainants up to now. The so-called "non-violation" clause of Article 23 GATT provides access to a multilateral dispute settlement even if the defending country has not explicitly violated GATT rules. This route should be tested and, if necessary, improved. To reduce the potential for a protectionist abuse of existing anti-dumping regulations, explicit reference to the state of competition in the relevant exporting and importing country markets should be made in anti-dumping investigations. To meet specific anti-trust concerns in hightech competition — notably with respect to network externalities, systems leverage, standardization, and innovation cartels — one might consider adopting the Draft <b>International</b> <b>Antitrust</b> <b>Code</b> (DIAC) that has recently been proposed by an international group of legal experts.

40|$|Various {{problems}} {{coming along}} with the ongoing globalization of markets and business activities like international cartels, monopolization of world markets, deterrence of market access in spite of relaxed trade barriers as well as jurisdictional conflicts about transnational mergers and alleged or actual anticompetitive business strategies call {{for the creation of}} an <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> regime. Two alternative avenues to internationalize antitrust policy are currently advanced by governments and antitrust authorities. The first avenue is to complement the World Trade Organization (WTO) by a board of supervision for international competition issues including a harmonized <b>antitrust</b> <b>code.</b> With the Doha Declaration (2001), the WTO members agreed to engage in negotiations on an <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> agreement, although the time schedule remains uncertain {{in the light of the}} Cancún failure.

40|$|<b>International</b> <b>antitrust</b> {{issues have}} become {{important}} in current debates regarding {{international trade and}} international regulation. This Article addresses {{one of the central}} questions about <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> – the appropriate forum for negotiations. The Article argues that the combination of domestic <b>antitrust</b> policy and <b>international</b> trade makes a substantive multilateral agreement unlikely unless transfers are made from states that gain from such a deal to those that lose. The Article advocates bringing the issue of <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> within the WTO because that forum is the best suited to accommodate such transfers. The experience of efforts to negotiate an agreement in intellectual property (IP) is offered as a demonstration of the advantages offered by the WTO. Like antitrust, the realities of IP made an agreement without transfers virtually impossible. In the case of IP, the difficulty was that developing countries had little to gain from such an agreement. Once negotiations were brought within the WTO, however, an agreement was reached because developing countries were granted trade concessions in exchange for accepting the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) agreement.

40|$|The term ‘international antitrust’ is a {{convenient}} yet inaccurate means of describing the national rules, bilateral agreements, and multilateral initiatives {{that attempt to}} fill the vacuum created by the failure to agree upon <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> rules. The ‘stillborn’ International Trade Organisation (ITO) would have integrated <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> rules into the multilateral trading system and provided a twin track to trade liberalisation, but was never ratified. The three faces of <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> – unilateralism, bilateralism and multilateralism – have developed in parallel to the increasing globalisation of trade, removal of state-imposed barriers and economic integration and interdependency. International cooperation and convergence efforts in antitrust are essential in order to safeguard the benefits that should flow from trade liberalisation. Cooperation and convergence also diminishes the risk of conflict between antitrust authorities, which would otherwise increase due to: the extraterritorial enforcement of national antitrust rules; {{the growing number of}} antitrust regimes; and ‘ripple effects’ due to globalisation of trade. In analysing the activities that comprise the <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> dialogue, this thesis suggests that the primary objective of the dialogue is to support and supplement trade liberalisation. There is doubt however, as to whether the operation of the international merger control framework (which consists of a plethora of national merger control regimes, bilateral engagement, and multilateral convergence efforts) is consistent with the primary objective. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are important means of foreign direct investment and can create cross-border synergies, which should help realise the benefits to be reaped from trade liberalisation. While anti-competitive M&A jeopardise those benefits, and are correctly scrutinised (and occasionally blocked), multi-jurisdictional merger review must balance the need to intervene in anti-competitive M&A, with the desire to facilitate all other M&A. A paradoxical position arises however, if multi-jurisdictional merger review unduly hinders those M&A which would further the cause of trade liberalisation, whilst attempting to control the anti-competitive mergers. Hence the operation of multi-jurisdictional merger review is potentially inconsistent with the primary objective of the <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> dialogue. This thesis focuses upon the international merger control framework in chapter 5, and evaluates whether reforms are needed to ensure greater consistency with the primary objective. This thesis concludes by offering several recommendations regarding the <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> dialogue, particularly with regard to the international merger control framework, but recommends against the creation of an international merger control regime (IMCR), or a common pre-merger notification system at the current time.

40|$|Present {{research}} paper is targeting an evolving area of <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> – merger control regulation and cooperation. Prompted {{by the recent}} developments in the European and US legal reforms in this area, present work provides an original analysis of the EU-US merger control cooperation mechanism {{and its role in}} the <b>international</b> <b>antitrust.</b> The EU-US cooperation model is placed in the international framework of the existing antitrust agreements, policy proposals and regulatory unification and harmonization concepts developed by the international organizations and academia. Bilateral interagency cooperation in the matters of merger control is assessed according to the possibility of its international application and in comparison with other multilateral and unilateral alternatives. The conclusion of the paper provides an open-ended answer on the research question: what is the possible role that bilateral interagency cooperation based on the EU-US model can play in <b>international</b> <b>antitrust.</b> The outcome of the present research is leading to the position that bilateral interagency cooperation mechanism in the matters of merger control as the one developed between EU and US provides a viable and efficient solution that should be further researched and developed. The analysis of other available alternatives shows that it is very unlikely that any of them would be implemented in the near future. For the purposes of facilitating international mergers and avoiding conflicts in the extraterritorial application of merger control regulations, interagency cooperation yields immediate results and mutual benefits for the merging companies and antitrust enforcement authoritie...|$|R

40|$|International {{trade has}} changed {{some of the}} {{challenges}} faced by antitrust authorities: it has added an international dimension. Under {{the current system of}} <b>international</b> <b>antitrust,</b> the backbone of enforcement is unilateral: each country applies its own tools to deal with <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> issues within the constraints imposed upon it by public international law. This enforcement pattern is sometimes coupled with cooperation agreements which are based on the realization that while cooperation among firms might be anti-competitive, this is generally not true for cooperation among countries. Yet such cooperation is often limited. This paper, which is part of a book on Cooperation, Comity And Competition Policy (Oxford University Press, 2009), analyzes the effects that a unilateral enforcement system has on a small economy, by focusing on a specific case study: Israel. The case of Israel is interesting not only as a stand-alone case study, but mostly because it provides useful insights into the reality of enforcing antitrust in a globalized world by a small economy. As the paper indicates, even when it possesses the legal tools to tackle <b>international</b> <b>antitrust</b> issues, Israel often suffer from serious practical deficiencies. Most importantly, it frequently cannot create a credible threat to large, multinational firms that engage in anti-competitive conduct which harms its economy. It also has limited resources and incentives to deal with international anti-competitive conduct, especially when such conduct is addressed by other jurisdictions. As a result, despite the sometimes severe effects of anti-competitive conduct on its markets, Israel, like other small economies, is a marginal player in the globalized antitrust regime and is generally a passive bearer of the effects of international anti-competitive conduct and of the enforcement actions of larger jurisdictions rather than proactive confronters of such issues and actions. This observation has important implications for a globalized antitrust regime. The paper also analyzes some intriguing issues which arise from public international law doctrines of extraterritoriality. For example, it analyzes the issue of whether the effects doctrine acts as a pre-condition for a finding of an anti-competitive conduct if some of the parties are foreign or does it apply only if there is a finding of an anti-competitive conduct that has direct legal implications for a foreign firm. It also analyzes the issue of whether presumptions of illegality can apply in cases which involve foreign firms and in which jurisdiction is based on proof of 2 ̆ 2 a significant and direct 2 ̆ 2 anti-competitive effect...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in <b>international</b> <b>{{antitrust}}</b> has been how to make antitrust more effective around the world. Most antitrust laws have been adopted or significantly modified since 1990. A number of key jurisdictions are either fairly new to antitrust altogether or to an antitrust regime that effectively employs the latest in economic thinking and the legal tools necessary to promote competition. Jurisdictions that have made antitrust a new and important cornerstone to economic policy include Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Because of the stakes involved {{in the ability of}} antitrust to foster economic development and to prevent misguided antitrust policy from operating as a regulatory tax, it is critical that the future of antitrust focus on improving agency capacity around the world.
