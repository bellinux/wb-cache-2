40|$|The {{gas engine}} driven carbon dioxide heat pump {{designed}} for providing the heat, cold and electricity for industrial poultry house is proposed. The scheme {{differs from the}} known by using recuperative heat exchanger installed between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> of poultry house and heat pump evaporator and the heat curtain installed on the air duct after the evaporator. The air coming into the poultry house after the regenerative heat exchanger is supplied to the heat pump gas cooler. The heat pump produces heat of the required parameters of the input air and water for watering of poultry, space heating, etc. Heat pump compressor is driven by gas engine (GPA), by natural gas or biogas. The part of the gas-piston engine heat is used for adjusting the optimal heat pump mode and for regeneration of the absorbent in an evaporative cooler. The proposed technical solution of the above scheme provides a higher COP of the heat pump. Installing of heat curtain {{does not require the}} use of non-freezing solution to prevent icing of the air outlet of heat pump evaporator. The latter allows producing, besides electric power and heat, still cold (with the use off the adsorption-refrigerating machine) and provide drying air inlet evaporative cooler (if necessary) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} at Luleå University of Technology in cooperation with Norconsult AB and Lindbäcks Bygg AB during the autumn of 2015. The purpose of this work is to examine which energy saving measurements that are suitable for comprehending future demands in Swedish apartment buildings. Boverket has made a proposition to define near-zero energy (NZE) buildings, which will become the future standard for house construction. The allowed amount of energy used by buildings will decrease. The thesis have a depicted apartment building with district heating. It proves that only making changes to the building envelope {{is not enough to}} attain the threshold levels for NZE-buildings. Alternative energy systems are required that can recover lost heat and generate energy. The heat pump is a modern energy system used for heating the house, in new houses {{it will have to be}} replaced with alternative heating methods due to less profitable electricity heating. Different savings in energy measures for the building are made and are compared by the houses annual energy usage. Simulations prove that most energy are used to heating of ventilation, heating radiators and domestic hot water. Three systems have been evaluated in more detail. The systems were optimized and applied to the portrayed apartment building. 1. Heat recovery from ventilation. 2. Heat recovery in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> placed after the heat recovery from ventilation. During summer it will be used to preheat domestic hot water. 3. Solar collector for heating domestic hot water. Systems combined correspond to about 55 % savings of all purchased electricity and heat needed to obtain a good indoor climate in the portrayed apartment building. These measures are sufficient to achieve the proposed energy requirements for NZE-buildings. Validerat; 20160329 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

40|$|The rodent Research Animal Holding Facility (RAHF), {{developed}} by NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) to separately house rodents in a Spacelab, was verified {{as a barrier}} to environmental contaminants during a 12 -day biocompatibility test. Environmental contaminants considered were solid particulates, microorganisms, ammonia, and typical animal odors. The 12 -day test conducted in August 1988 was designed to verify that the rodent RAHF system would adequately support and maintain animal specimens during normal system operations. Additional objectives of this test were to demonstrate that: (1) the system would capture typical particulate debris produced by the animal; (2) microorganisms would be contained; and (3) the passage of animal odors was adequately controlled. In addition, the amount of carbon dioxide exhausted by the RAHF system was to be quantified. Of primary importance during the test was the demonstration that the RAHF would contain particles greater than 150 micrometers. This was verified after analyzing collection plates placed under <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> and and rodent cages during cage maintenance operations, e. g., waste tray and feeder changeouts.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} the numerically {{investigations of the}} performance of a run-around membrane energy exchanger (RAMEE) at different outdoor air conditions and the effects of non-uniform exchanger channels. The RAMEE is a new type of building ventilation air energy recovery system that allows heat and moisture to be transferred between isolated supply and <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> streams. Two liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) are placed in the supply and <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> and transfer heat and moisture between air and a circulating liquid desiccant that couples the two LAMEEs together. The ability of the system to transfer heat and moisture between isolated supply and exhaust ducts makes it appropriate for numerous HVAC applications (e. g., hospitals and building energy retrofits). The performance of the RAMEE at different outdoor air conditions is shown to be highly variable due to the coupling of the heat and moisture transfer by the desiccant. This coupling allows the humidity ratio between the indoor and outdoor air to influence the heat transfer and the moisture transfer is influenced by the difference between the indoor and outdoor air temperatures. The coupling produces some complex RAMEE performance characteristics at some outdoor air conditions where the effectiveness values (i. e., sensible, latent, and total) were shown to be less than 0 % or greater than 100 %. Effectiveness and operating correlations are developed to describe these complex behaviours because existing correlations do not account for the coupling effects. The correlations can serve as design and operation tools for the RAMEE which do not require the use of an iterative computational numerical model. Non-uniform exchanger channels are present in the RAMEE because of pressure differences between the air and solution channels which deform the membrane into the air channel. The non-uniform channels are analytically shown to create maldistributed fluid flows and variable heat and mass transfer coefficients. The combined effects of these two changes lead to a reduction in the RAMEE effectiveness, which increases as the size of the membrane deformation increases. The reduction in total effectiveness for an exchanger where the membrane has a peak deflection of 10 % of the nominal air channel thickness operating at a NTU of 12 was shown to be 12. 5 %. These results of non-uniform exchanger channels agree with previously conducted experimental results...|$|R

40|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{transcritical}} CO 2 refrigeration is the gliding temperature available when cooling the transcritical fluid {{from the final}} high temperature at completion of compression to as low a temperature as practicable. This property may be exploited when requiring simultaneous cooling and heating in building air conditioning applications. The CO 2 compressor discharge can usually heat enough water for heating, reheating and hot water purposes thereby obviating {{the need for a}} boiler and its fuel supply. Using USA Department of Energy data for energy consumption by USA office buildings it is shown that CO 2 cooling reduces primary energy consumption, energy cost, water consumption at the buildings and CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 55 %, 57 %, 75 % and 53 % respectively in the existing building stock when coupled with a 25 % reduction in supply and return <b>duct</b> <b>air</b> velocities, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>duct</b> <b>air</b> velocities.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the leakage of air-to-air recovery {{heat exchanger}} consisting of 100 capillary thermal tubes 1. 5 m long and aligned in ten rows. The {{operation of the}} recovery exchanger prototype was tested in a pigsty. The analysis focuses on how the exchanger leakage affects the heat utilisation efficiency of the <b>air</b> <b>ducted</b> from the pig-sty, changes in supply/exhaust air flow rate ratio, supply air temperature, thermal out-put obtained, and exchanger’s total thermal and mass balances. The results obtained in in-process measurements and the mass and thermal balances show that the exchange leakage causes the outside supply air to contain 12. 1 – 37. 3 % of the pigsty <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> The percentage of the pigsty air increases {{with the increase of}} mass flow rates of supply and <b>exhaust</b> <b>air.</b> This leakage re-sulted particularly in a major change in supply and <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> mass flow rates, higher moisture content, temperature and thermal flow of the air conducted in the pigsty.

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of a low-cost, hoop-type swine building (3. 55 × 5. 7 × 10. 3 m) was evaluated under the winter weather conditions of Central Japan. The hoop building had two curved roofs made from 2. 5 cm diameter tubular steel pipes each covered with a reflective film. There was a 20 cm air space between {{the inner and outer}} covers through which the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> flowed. A positive-pressure ventilation fan and an <b>air</b> distribution <b>duct</b> were used to supply the fresh air. The evaluation was conducted for three opening configurations of the <b>air</b> distribution <b>duct</b> (one, two, or four holes on a cross-section of the duct) and presence or absence of an internal curtain. Furthermore, the effect of replacing the reflective film with a PVC film for the east side cover on solar transmission and thus the internal temperature rise was quantified. The building was simulated to house 30 pigs at a body weight of 70 kg. Resistive heating wire was used to simulate the sensible heat generation of the pigs at 131. 5 W/pig at 10 °C temperature. The inside temperature averaged 6. 9 °C higher than the outside temperature during the minimum ventilation period. As the <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> passed through the double-layer air space, 25. 4 % of exhaust heat transferred back into the building and 74. 6 % lost to the outside. When replacing the reflective covers with the PVC film covers on the east side, the internal temperature rise increased to an average of 7. 6 °C with a maximum of 12. 7 °C. The magnitude of temperature rise was proportional to the transmitted solar radiation, as evidenced by the higher temperature rise during the day and significantly reduced temperature rise at night. To eliminate the effects of cold, nocturnal radiation, the PVC film cover should be covered by the regular reflective cover at night.

40|$|This study explores {{a method}} of {{generating}} electricity while recovering waste heat through the integration of heat pipes and thermoelectric generators (i. e. HPTEG system). The simultaneous waste heat recovery and power generation processes are achieved {{without the use of}} any moving parts. The HPTEG system consists of bismuth telluride thermoelectric generators (TEG), which are sandwiched between two finned pipes to achieve a temperature gradient across the TEG for electricity generation. A counter-flow heat exchanger was built using two separate <b>air</b> <b>ducts.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> were thermally coupled using the HPTEG modules. The evaporator section of the heat pipe absorbed the waste heat in a hot <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> The heat was then transferred across the TEG surfaces.
