This issue becomes particularly intricate when dealing with older texts where little is known about pronunciation, and transmitting the fullest possible detail of their notation is historically important. There are several approaches to the romanization of such material. The YIVO transliteration system is solely intended to serve as an English-oriented phonetic counterpart to the modern Standard Yiddish described (and to some extent prescribed) in the SYO. That work does, however, consider the transcription of variant pronunciation as will be discussed below.|$|E

This is done by Ganthet to prevent the last ring from being stolen, as there would be no other lantern to send to retrieve it. Unlike most of the Green Lanterns' rings, Kyle's did not require a twenty-four-hour period of recharge, only when the ring's capacity was depleted; and it was not necessary to recite the Corps' oath when recharged. Rayner is the first Lantern not to suffer from a weakness to items colored yellow. Both Mongul and Superman are very surprised at this upon first encountering him. Kyle states that he didn't know about the weakness and never had any trouble with it. Originally, this was explained as his ring being a [...] "new model", which also explained why it had slightly different abilities than those seen previously. Later, this was retconned with the explanation that rings can affect yellow if the user faces and overcomes their fear; as an artist, Kyle had faced his fear of rejection every time he showed his work, and this extended to his constructs, which he considered part of his artwork.|$|E

30|$|Researchers have {{proposed}} a variety of systems and partitioning techniques to provide scalable transaction support for web applications. Some {{of them have been}} listed here. Grolinger K., et al. presented [6] different partitioning techniques used by NoSQL data stores and NewSQL data stores to achieve scalability. Sandholm T. et al. presented [12] notes on Cloud Computing principles which describes horizontal scalability for achieving scalable transactions in cloud data stores. Sudipto Das et al., proposed ElasTras [13], which uses schema level partitioning to improve scalability. It also uses a range partitioning. Scalability is accomplished by restricting the execution of a transaction to a single partition. P. A. Bernstein et al., suggested the Cloud SQL Server [9] where transactions are forced to execute on one partition. In the Cloud SQL Server, the partition is called a table group, which is normally keyless or keyed. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>keyed,</b> then all the tables in the table group must have a common key (primary key). The row group is a set of all tuples that have a common partitioning key. Curino et al., suggested the Relational Cloud [14] in, which scalability is achieved with the workload-aware approach termed as graph partitioning [10]. In graph partitioning, the data items, which are accessed by the transactions are kept on a single partition. J. Baker et al., presented Megastore [8] in which data is partitioned into a collection of entity groups. An entity group is a collection of related data items, and is put on a single node so that the data items required for execution are accessed from a single node. It is developed to offer transactional consistency for web applications. Megastore provides synchronous replication, but comes at the cost of increased transaction latencies. As discussed above, four systems use the static partitioning algorithm and it is designed with the common objective, where the related rows are kept on a single partition. But there are some applications such as online games, where groups are formed dynamically with time and therefore, Sudipto Das et al., proposed G-Store [15], where the keys from a group on a different node are put together and form a new group on a single partition. There is another approach, which works without the partitioning technique. Aguilera et al., presented Sinfonia [16], in, which the transactions are partitioned into sub transactions called as mini transactions. The mini transactions guarantee transactional semantics on only a small set of operations such as atomic and compare, and swap. Wei et al., introduced Cloud TPS [17], which splits the Transaction Manager into any number of Local Transaction Managers (LTMs). Cloud TPS has certain assumptions that the transactions are short, access a small amount of data, and are well identified in an advance. Scalability is achieved by distributing the data among the Local Transaction Managers. D. Lomet et al., proposed design Deuteronomy [18] in which scalability is achieved by separating transaction and data management. The key feature of Deuteronomy is that, data items can be found anywhere in the Cloud. The single Transaction Component is responsible for handling all the requests. Therefore, it is not suitable for large cloud deployments. Ahirrao and Ingle presented [19] scalable transactions in cloud data stores which explains the concept of partitioning based on data access patterns of web applications.|$|E
40|$|Presentation {{given at}} the Geography and the Humanities Symposium, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, June 22 - 24, 2007. How can GIS help {{scholars}} to understand the history of travel? How can GIS tools work in tandem with digitized archival materials? The Travelers in the Middle East Archive (TIMEA) is addressing such questions by building a digital archive of resources relating to Westerners’ travel to Egypt {{and other parts of}} the Middle East in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. TIMEA ([URL] offers historical maps; XML-encoded texts such as travel guides, travel narratives, and museum catalogs; and images such as postcards, stereographs, and book illustrations. In addition, TIMEA makes available a GIS map featuring layers such as elevation, hydrography, satellite imagery, and historic sites. Users can search or browse TIMEA for a specific place name and go directly to that location on the GIS map. TIMEA enables humanities researchers to study a range of topics related to geography, history and culture. For instance, scholars can search the archive for texts and images related to a particular place, and even restrict their search to particular dates. To investigate how places changed over time, they can compare maps of locations taken from different editions of travel guides; for instance, an 1888 map shows a train station where there was none in 1870. Researchers can locate a place name on the GIS name and view related information, such as water and roads. Thus a researcher could investigate the relationship between historic sites and rivers or transportation systems. The GIS map is built in such a way that scholars could fairly easily add a new layer, so long as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>keyed</b> to the correct latitude/longitude. The ArcIMS interface for delivering the GIS map online has proven difficult to customize and confusing to users, so we are currently developing Google Maps that make locations on the GIS map serve as access points to related archival resources and that show itineraries for Nile cruises provided in Sir John Gardner Wilkinson’s Hand-book for travellers in Egypt (1847) and Cook's tourists' handbook for Egypt, the Nile, and the Desert (1897). TIMEA’s contributions to the geography and the humanities community include: •	Focusing on a region that has heretofore been unrepresented by GIS efforts •	Integrating a multimedia thematic research collection with GIS tools •	Developing software for automatically marking up place names in XML-encoded texts, then generating links from those place names to related resources in the archive. •	Building educational modules that explore GIS in the humanities and provide background information on places Developing GIS resources for the TIMEA project has raised several challenges. We have had difficulty locating historical data sources, although travel guides can offer useful data such as population, recommended itineraries, and climate We have not found a compelling way to represent the relationship between space and time—how dynamic processes affect regions, and vice versa—although applications such as TimeMap hold promise. For researchers not accustomed to working with GIS tools, the map interface can be daunting and confusing. Finally, creating GIS resources requires significant labor and expertise, so collaboration and clear communication between scholars and technical experts are essential.
