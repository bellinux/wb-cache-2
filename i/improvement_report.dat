40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} critiques the {{different}} approaches {{to the use of}} narrative in quality improvement research. The defining characteristics of narrative are chronology (unfolding over time); emplotment (the literary juxtaposing of actions and events in an implicitly causal sequence); trouble (that is, harm or the risk of harm); and embeddedness (the personal story nests within a particular social, historical and organisational context). Stories are about purposeful action unfolding in the face of trouble and, as such, have much to offer quality improvement researchers. But the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>report</b> (a story about efforts to implement change), which is common, must be distinguished carefully from narrative based quality improvement research (focused systematic enquiry that uses narrative methods to generate new knowledge), which is currently none. We distinguish four approaches to the use of narrative in quality improvement research [...] narrative interview; naturalistic story gathering; organisational case study; and collective sense-making [...] and offer a rationale, describe how data can be collected and analysed, and discuss the strengths and limitations of each using examples from the quality improvement literature. Narrative research raises epistemological questions about the nature of narrative truth (characterised by sense-making and emotional impact rather than scientific objectivity), which has implications for how rigour should be defined (and how it might be achieved) in this type of research. We offer some provisional guidance for distinguishing high quality narrative research in a quality improvement setting from other forms of narrative account such as report, anecdote, and journalism...|$|E

40|$|Composite {{measures}} are frequently developed in healthcare and often involve summarizing several variables {{to provide a}} more valid or complete description of a concept such as hospital quality or patient health. For instance, new measures may be created to assess adherence to guidelines or to describe how combinations of variables combine to predict risk. Applying a composite measure can be challenging for several reasons. First, the variables comprising the composite may not be readily available in a single data file, such as from a quality <b>improvement</b> <b>report</b> or patient record, or the variables may not have been measured at the appropriate level, such as per procedure versus total stay expenditures. Second, the calculation method may be complex, requiring the performance of algebraic manipulations within a series of logical statements. However, all of these issues can be overcome by creating a SAS program which can not only combine various data sources and summarize data at different levels but which can also automate algebraic calculations and handle complex logical statements. Once created, several issues can limit the application of composite measures both in practice and in research. Issues such as difficulty in the interpretation of the underlying latent concept, questions concerning reliability and validity, and difficulty applying the new measure to specific situations which can be addressed using SAS programs written to focus attention on interpretation and relevant statistical issues.

40|$|Summary: Out of 50 {{selected}} {{cases of}} tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis diagnosed {{on the basis}} of clinical features but not responding to standard antitubercular drugs for 1 year or deteriorating after 3 - 6 months ’ treatment, 6 cases were culture positive for acid fast bacilli and of these 1 was due to M. tuberculosis and 5 were due to atypical mycobacteria (scotochromogens, Runyon Gr. II). Histopatho-logical examination was suggestive of atypical mycobacteria in 4, Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 27, Hodgkin’s disease in 3, metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1 and non-specific lymphadenitis in the remaining 5. While dealing with cases of cervical lympha-denitis, the clinicians rely mainly on their clinical findings, be it in the big well-equipped institutions or in their private clinics. It is customary to institute standard anti-tubercular chemotherapy once a case of cervical lymph-adenitis is diagnosed clinically as one of tuber-cular aetiology. Many of these cases do not respond to treatment and deteriorate with the standard anti-tubercular drugs. Some cases, after initial <b>improvement,</b> <b>report</b> back with exacerbations. These observations led us to the present study with an aim to look into the possible causes of failure of treatment. The common causes, other than tuberculosi, are inflamma-tory, reticulosis and malignant metastatic depo-sits. A very important group, “anonymous” or “atypical ” mycobacteria, which in the recent years has been studied extensively abroad and in some centres cf India has also been proved to be an aetiological agent. With this know-ledge as the background, this study was carried out (during the period from December, 1981 to November, 1982) in 50 selected cases of clinically diagnosed tuberculous lymphadenitis which did not respond to standard anti-tuber-cular chemotherapy or deteriorated after treatment.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{establish}} whether recall of {{elements of the}} neurological examination can be improved by use of a simple patient assessment score. In a previous study we demonstrated that in-patients referred to neurology at two United Kingdom (UK) hospitals were not fully examined prior to referral; we therefore designed a larger quality <b>improvement</b> <b>report</b> with 80 % power to detect a 10 % increase in tendon hammer or ophthalmoscope use following an educational intervention. In-patients referred to neurology over a four month period (in hospitals in the UK (10), Jordan (1), Sweden (2), and the United Arab Emirates (1)) were asked whether they recalled being examined with a tendon hammer (T), ophthalmoscope (O), and stethoscope (S) since admission. The results were disseminated to local medical teams using various techniques (including Grand Round presentations, email, posters, discounted equipment). Data were then collected for a further four month period post-intervention. Pre-intervention and post-intervention data were available for 11 centres with 407 & 391 patients in each arm respectively. Median age of patients was 51 (range 13 - 100) and 49 (range 16 - 95) years respectively, with 44. 72 % and 44. 76 % being male in each group. 264 patients (64. 86 %) recalled being examined with a tendon hammer in the pre-intervention arm, which significantly improved to 298 (76. 21 %) (p< 0. 001). Only 119 patients (29. 24 %) recollected examination with an ophthalmoscope pre-intervention, which significantly improved to 149 (38. 11 %) (p= 0. 009). The majority of patients (321 (78. 87 %)) pre-intervention recalled examination with a stethoscope, which significantly improved to 330 (84. 4 %) {{to a lesser extent}} (p= 0. 045). Results indicate that most patients are not fully examined prior to neurology referral yet a simple assessment score and educational intervention can improve recall of elements of the neurological examination and thus the likelihood of patients being examined neurologically.

40|$|Title: Improving the Processes in a WarehouseBackground: For {{warehouses}} {{to perform}} as efficiently and effectively as possible, helping companies maintain a high service level and react to market changes, continuous improvement is necessary. This is achievable through amongst other methods, {{the analysis of}} operations to identify wasteful activities and eliminate them. Purpose: This paper, through a thorough description {{and understanding of the}} current outbound processes at Company N, seeks to identify any wasteful activity and what might be causing such wastes. Furthermore the paper shall seek to make recommendations for reducing or eliminating wastes identified. Research Questions: What wastes can be identified in Company N’s outbound processes and why do they occur? What recommendations should be made for reducing wastes at Company N? Method: This research is qualitative in nature carried out using a deductive approach. Primary data was gathered mainly through observation and semi-structured and unstructured interviews with the goal of gaining as deep an understanding of the processes as possible. Secondary data was also gotten from multiple sources within the company. Contemporary tools and techniques like Value Stream Mapping and Gemba (observation at the place of work) were useful in identifying wastes; meanwhile the 5 Why’s questioning technique was used for finding the causes of wastes identified. Benchmarking was also used as a means of sourcing ideas and proven standards of performance. Conclusion: The research identified five main wastes including waiting, travelling, unnecessary motion, defects and processing. The main causes of the wastes include the use of manual verification during processes, limited use of batch picking, the absence of lifting aid and dissatisfaction amongst workers. The report makes recommendations including change of handling equipment and operating procedures to accommodate automatic verification of locations and items, as well as better usage of batch picking. It is also recommended to swap the location of certain articles and introduce marketing analysis to reduce travelling. Finally, recommendations are made for counteracting worker dissatisfaction such as a proposed <b>improvement</b> <b>report,</b> an appraisal system, more cross training and internal personnel development...|$|E
40|$|Background : Constant-site or {{buttonhole}} cannulation {{of native}} arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) has gained in popularity compared with rope-ladder cannulation. However, cannulating nonhealed skin might {{increase the risk}} of (AVF-related) infectious events, as suggested by small reports. Study Design : Quality <b>improvement</b> <b>report.</b> Setting & Participants : All patients on in-center hemodialysis therapy using a native AVF from January 1, 2001, to June 30, 2010. Quality Improvement Plan : Shift to buttonhole cannulation between August 2004 and January 2005. Because the infectious event rate increased after the shift, educational workshops were held in May 2008 for all nurses, with review of every step of buttonhole protocol. Outcomes : Infectious events (unexplained bacteremia caused by skin bacteria and/or local AVF infection) and complicated infectious events (resulting in metastatic infection, death, or AVF surgery) were ascertained during 4 periods: (1) rope-ladder technique in all, (2) switch to buttonhole, (3) buttonhole in all before workshops, and (4) buttonhole in all after workshops. Results : 177 patients (aged 70. 4 ± 11. 5 years) with 193 AVFs were analyzed, including 186, 481 AVF-days. 57 infectious events occurred (0. 31 events/ 1, 000 AVF-days). The incidence of infectious events increased after the switch to the buttonhole method (0. 17 [95 % CI, 0. 086 - 0. 31], 0. 11 [95 % CI, 0. 0014 - 0. 63], and 0. 43 [95 % CI, 0. 29 - 0. 61] events/ 1, 000 AVF-days in periods 1, 2, and 3, respectively; P = 0. 003). This reached significance during only the second full year of buttonhole cannulation. During period 4, the incidence tended to decrease (0. 34 events/ 1, 000 AVF-days). Complicated infectious events (n = 12) were virtually restricted to period 3 (n = 11; 0. 153 [95 % CI, 0. 076 - 0. 273] events/ 1, 000 AVF-days), with a significant decrease in period 4 (n = 1; 0. 024 [95 % CI, 0. 001 - 0. 118] events/ 1, 000 AVF-days; RR for period 3 vs period 4, 6. 37 [95 % CI, 1. 09 - 138. 4]; P = 0. 04). Limitations : Observational partly retrospective design.

40|$|Background: Hip {{fractures}} {{are a major}} {{global health}} care issue, with the 1. 26 million estimated cases in 1990 predicted to increase to 4. 5 million by 2050. Varying models of care {{have been developed to}} improve outcomes following fragility hip fractures. Most of these care models embrace an interprofessional approach to care. Specialist orthopedic nurses {{play an important role in}} the management of fragility hip fracture patients and their contribution to the interprofessional health care team is an important predictor of patient outcomes. Assessment of the problem: The Sunshine Coast Hospital and Health Service (SCHHS) compromises of four hospitals in South East Queensland, Australia however only one large regional hospital provides specialist hip fracture services. Approximately, 350 older hip fracture patients present to the Sunshine Coast Hospital & Health Service (SCHHS) each year. We used Hospital Health round table (HHRT) data to identify and assess key performance care and management of hip fracture patient and outcomes. at SCHHS. The HHRT is a nonprofit membership organisation of health services across Australia and New Zealand that aims to provide opportunity for Health Services to achieve best practice, collect analyse and publish information, identify ways to improve and promote collaboration and networking. Exemplars of best practice are also identified in the data so that organizations can adopt similar models of care. HHRT data identified underperformance in management of hip fracture patients in a number of quality indicators at the study site, including length of stay (LOS), time to surgery and relative stay index (RSI). Strategies for quality improvement: Following review of HHRT data key stakeholders undertook a quality improvement project and formed the Hip Fracture Clinical Network Group (HFCNG). This was established in 2013 with the aim of improving outcomes and achieving key performance indicators for all elderly patients who sustain a hip fracture through active collaboration and regular communication between a broad group of key clinical stakeholders. Results of the quality improvement project: Following the implementation of the initiative the Relative Stay Index reduced from 88 % in 2012 / 13 to 78 % in 2014 / 15, and the average LOS reduced from 10. 4 days to 8. 6 days. The percentage of patients receiving surgery within 2 days rose from 85 % to 96 %; demonstrating consistent outperformance of the time to surgery key performance indicator of 80 %. The percentage of patients discharged to their place of usual residence increased from 45 % to 54 %. The rate of complications reduced slightly from 69 % to 66 %. Rates of hospital acquired anaemia reduced from 20. 7 % to 15 %. Detection of delirium rose over the reporting period from 22 % to 34 %, enabling rapid management. We noted during this period that there was no corresponding increase in readmission rates for this group of patients. These data reflect improvement to clinical documentation and the appropriate identification of cognitive changes. Conclusion: In this quality <b>improvement</b> <b>report,</b> we describe how key stakeholders were engaged to improve communication and collaboration, and how the use of a national benchmarking dataset enabled health care providers to identify care gaps and inconsistencies in clinical practice.
