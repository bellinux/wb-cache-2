5000|$|Numerous {{efforts have}} {{attempted}} to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet shock data loggers and impact sensors help monitor impacts a player receives. One example is a device created by Schutt Sports during the Arena Football League's 2008 season known as the [...] "Shockometer"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a g-force which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will {{increase the risk of}} a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device. Riddell created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games. Every HITS helmet features MX Encoders, which would automatically record every hit. Eight NFL teams had planned to use the system in the [...] season, but it was ultimately not used. In 2013, Reebok developed the Head <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator,</b> which is a quarter-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard. Similarly to Reebok's <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator,</b> Battle Sport Science has released the <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator</b> 2.0. The <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator</b> 2.0 looks to increase long-term brain safety for all those who play football. On February 3, 2013, the NFL and General Electric partnered on a five-year, $50 million project to develop technology to predict brain injuries, show injury severity and the rate of recovery, and to create more protective material.|$|E

40|$|A cradle-to-grave {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} is done to identify {{the environmental impacts of}} chromated copper arsenate (CCA) -treated timber used for highway guard rail posts, to understand the processes that contribute to the total impacts, and to determine how the impacts compare to the primary alternative product, galvanized steel posts. Guard rail posts are the supporting structures for highway guard rails. Transportation engineers, as well as public and regulatory interests, have increasing need to understand the environmental implications of guard rail post selection, in addition to factors such as costs and service performance. This study uses a life cycle inventory (LCI) to catalogue the input and output data from guard rail post manufacture, service life, and disposition, and a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to assess anthropogenic and net greenhouse gas (GHG), acidification, smog, ecotoxicity, and eutrophication potentially resulting from life cycle air emissions. Other indicators of interest also are tracked, such as fossil fuel and water use. Comparisons of guard rail post products are made at a functional unit of one post per year of service. This {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) finds that the manufacture, use, and disposition of CCA-treated wood guard rails offers lower fossil fuel use and lower anthropogenic and net GHG emissions, acidification, smog potential, and ecotoxicity environmental impacts than <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> values for galvanized steel posts.

Using constrained random walks, mass points are routed from defined release pixels {{of one to}} many mass movements through a digital elevation model until a defined break criterion is reached. Compared to existing tools, the major innovative features of r. randomwalk are (i) multiple break criteria can be combined to compute an <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> score; (ii) the uncertainties of break criteria can be included by performing multiple parallel computations with randomized parameter sets, resulting in an <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> index in the range 0 – 1; (iii) built-in functions for validation and visualization of the results are provided; (iv) observed landslides can be back analysed to derive the density distribution of the observed angles of reach. This distribution can be employed to compute impact probabilities for each pixel. Further, <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> scores and probabilities can be combined with release indicator scores or probabilities, and with exposure indicator scores.

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{is considered to}} be one of the main concerns in the construction industry. Environmental pollution has become a major challenge to construction projects due to the huge amount of pollution caused by construction projects. There are different types of environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint, eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP), human health (HH) particulate, ozone depletion, and smog. Each of these environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> can be linked to different phases of the construction projects. The overall environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> can be divided into direct, indirect, and operational emissions. This paper presents a Building Information Modeling (BIM) -based methodology for the assessment of environmental impacts in road construction projects. The model takes into account the overall life cycle of the road construction project, which is divided into: manufacturing phase, transportation phase, construction phase, maintenance phase, operational phase, recycling phase, and deconstruction phase. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model.

Penta-treated utility poles commonly are used for electricity distribution and transmission, and telecommunications. In addition, this LCA has evaluated the opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts associated with penta-treated poles and has compared the penta-treated pole product to alternative products. A model of penta-treated utility pole life cycle stages was created and used to determine inputs and outputs during the pole production, treating, service life, and disposal stages. Pole production data are based on published sources. Primary wood preservative treatment data were obtained by surveying wood treatment facilities in the United States. Product service life and disposal inventory data are based on published data and professional judgment. Life cycle inventory inputs, outputs, and impact indicators for penta-treated utility poles were quantified per pole. In a similar manner, an inventory model was developed for the manufacture, service life, and disposal of the primary alternative products: steel and spun concrete utility poles. <b>Impact</b> <b>indicator</b> values, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fossil fuel and water use, and emissions {{with the potential to}} cause acidification, smog, ecological toxicity, and eutrophication were quantified for each of the pole products.

40|$|Abstract Background Funders {{of medical}} {{research}} {{the world over}} are increasingly seeking, in research assessment, to complement traditional output measures of scientific publications with more outcome-based indicators of societal and economic impact. In the United Kingdom, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) developed proposals for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) to allocate public research funding to higher education institutions, inter alia, {{on the basis of}} the social and economic impact of their research. In 2010, it conducted a pilot exercise to test these proposals and refine <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> and criteria. Methods The <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> proposed in the 2010 REF impact pilot exercise are critically reviewed and appraised using insights from the relevant literature and empirical data collected for the University of Oxford’s REF pilot submission in clinical medicine. The empirical data were gathered from existing administrative sources and an online administrative survey carried out by the university’s Medical Sciences Division among 289 clinical medicine faculty members (48. 1 % response rate). Results The feasibility and scope of measuring research impact in clinical medicine in a given university are assessed. Twenty <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> from seven categories proposed by HEFCE are presented; their strengths and limitations are discussed using insights from the relevant biomedical and research policy literature. Conclusions While the 2010 pilot exercise has confirmed that the majority of the proposed indicators have some validity, there are significant challenges in operationalising and measuring these indicators reliably, as well as in comparing evidence of research impact across different cases in a standardised manner. It is suggested that the public funding agencies, medical research charities, universities, and the wider medical research community work together to develop more robust methodologies for capturing and describing impact, including more valid and reliable <b>impact</b> <b>indicators.</b> </p...|$|R

We then define a health <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> based on the traffic emissions, named IISCEP for Chronic health <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> of pollutant emission.

40|$|This work {{looks at}} {{coupling}} Life cycle assessment (LCA) with a dynamic inventory and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) {{to improve the}} validity and reliability of single score results for complex systems. This is done using the case study of a representative Danish single family home over the service life of the building. This case study uses both the established and the coupled MCDA assessment methods to quantify and assess the balance of impacts between the production of mineral wool insulation versus the production of space heat. The use of TOPSIS method for calculating single scores is proposed {{as an alternative to}} the ReCiPe single score impact assessment method. Based on the single score impact values obtained from both of these methods, various insulation levels are ranked to determine an ideal insulation level and gauge the effectiveness of environmental impact reduction measures in current Danish building regulations. Using a comparison of the results from the two methods, a preferred choice of impact assessment method is determined. The findings show that if the midpoint impacts for a particular scenario are strongly correlated with a climate change <b>impact</b> <b>indicator,</b> it does not matter which impact assessment is applied. However, for the scenarios where other impact categories vary inversely or independently from the climate change <b>impact</b> <b>indicator,</b> such as with renewable energy production, there is need for a more unconventional method, such as the TOPSIS method, for calculating single score impacts.
