40|$|Plastics {{have become}} the {{ubiquitous}} workhorse material of the modern economy [...] combining unrivalled functional properties with low cost. Their use has increased twenty-fold in the past half-century {{and is expected to}} double again in the next 20 years. Today nearly everyone, everywhere, every day comes into contact with plastics [...] especially <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging,</b> the focus of this report. While delivering many benefits, the current plastics economy has drawbacks that are becoming more apparent by the day. After a short first-use cycle, 95 % of <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> material value, or USD 80  120 billion annually, is lost to the economy. A staggering 32 % of <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> escapes collection systems, generating significant economic costs by reducing the productivity of vital natural systems such as the ocean and clogging urban infrastructure. The cost of such after-use externalities for <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging,</b> plus the cost associated with greenhouse gas emissions from its production, is conservatively estimated at USD 40 billion annually [...] exceeding the <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> industry's profit pool. In future, these costs will have to be covered. In overcoming these drawbacks, an opportunity beckons: enhancing system effectiveness to achieve better economic and environmental outcomes while continuing to harness the many benefits of <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging.</b> The 'New <b>Plastics</b> Economy' offers a new vision, aligned with the principles of the circular economy, to capture these opportunities. With an explicitly systemic and collaborative approach, the New Plastics Economy aims to overcome the limitations of today's incremental improvements and fragmented initiatives, to create a shared sense of direction, to spark a wave of innovation and to move the plastics value chain into a positive spiral of value capture, stronger economics, and better environmental outcomes. This report outlines a fundamental rethink for <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> and <b>plastics</b> in general; it offers a new approach with the potential to transform global <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> materials flows and thereby usher in the New Plastics Economy...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the use of}} <b>plastic</b> in <b>packaging</b> {{has largely}} increased, {{consumer}} research consistently indicates that consumers attach a high quality perception to glass packaged products. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine individuals’ recognition and affective judgments of 30 food packages after visual and haptic exploration. We included packages of three food products that are more often packaged in glass (wine, honey, chocolate cream) and three products that are usually <b>plastic</b> <b>packaged</b> (yogurt, milk, juice). For each product, five packages were used: a glass package; a transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> with a shape similar to the glass package; a transparent <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> with a shape different from the glass package; a non-transparent plastic package; a <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> with a very unusual shape. 30 participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: visual, haptic, and visual + haptic exploration. The visual group watched the packages while their eye-movements were recorded, whereas participants of the other two groups were video-recorded and haptic Exploration Procedures were coded. All participants were asked to name each package and to rate how much they liked it. Moreover, they blind tasted 20 products and were asked to judge liking and quality. Participants were unaware that, for each food category, they were tasting the exact same product repeatedly. The results show that pleasantness judgments were higher for glass <b>packages</b> than for <b>plastic</b> <b>packages.</b> Similarly, participants reported to like the products they believed to come from glass packages more than products contained in <b>plastic</b> <b>packages.</b> Unusual shapes required longer visual and haptic exploration, were overall rated as less pleasant and containing the lowest quality products. The implications for packaging material, shape and design are discussed...|$|R

[...] Type 7 is the catch-all [...] "other" [...] class, and some type 7 plastics, such as polycarbonate (sometimes identified with the letters [...] "PC" [...] near the recycling symbol) and epoxy resins, are made from bisphenolA monomer.

40|$|Packages {{have high}} {{rotation}} {{as they become}} municipal solid waste just after the consumption of the product. Therefore, packages should be labeled with identification of the material they are made of {{in order to help}} the recycling chain. Many products made from plastics show a resin identification code - usually from 1 to 7 inside a three-arrow triangle above a monogram - aimed at identifying the type of plastic the product is made of, and help its separation and later recycling. In other words, one aims to facilitate recovery of plastics discarded with the municipal solid waste. In this study we collected data on the resin identification code in flexible <b>plastic</b> <b>packages</b> to assess whether the guidelines for material identification are being followed. The data collection was performed in a total of 509 flexible <b>plastic</b> <b>packages</b> used for packing food and non-food products available in the Brazilian market. Even though the NBR 13230 Brazilian standard is already in its second revision, the resin identification code in <b>plastic</b> <b>packages</b> is still used in a very heterogeneous fashion. Approximately 50 % of the packages had the resin identification code. Up to 30 % of some packages showed incorrect material identification code. Therefore, misinformation still occurs in the Brazilian market concerning the type of material for <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> - including lack of the resin identification code and incorrect form of identification code in the <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging.</b> Both of these problems have negative effects on the plastic recycling chain. We propose that other materials used in flexible <b>plastic</b> <b>packages,</b> e. g. aluminum foil, should also be identified, {{in order to make the}} separation and recycling easier...|$|R
40|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> is at {{the center}} of our lives as it is found in {{numerous}} products used every day. Increasing the sustainability of <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> will have a major impact on the world. As one of the largest and most innovative global packaging companies, Amcor leads the industry, having integrated sustainability into and across its core values. To understand the best opportunities for improvement, this project analyzed Amcor’s full supply chain through a natural capital valuation. The natural capital valuation puts a dollar value on the ecosystems services and externalities associated with Amcor’s business. Our preliminary findings led us to conclude that, accounting for GHG emissions, water use and waste generated can make post-consumer resin comparable to virgin resin from a cost perspective. We also found that Amcor is relatively efficient in its own operations when compared to the rest of the supply chain, and should therefore focus on its downstream impacts where it can create the most impact in terms of post-consumer waste. In focusing on these downstream impacts, we learned quickly that there is minimal data, globally, on <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> waste, its collection, country infrastructure, and perception and education around plastic recovery. A model was created to predict <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> recovery rates for countries where this data does not exist, and also get a better understanding of which factors most influence the <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> recovery rates. We found that total household municipal waste, percent of waste to landfill, and the Gini index have a statistically significant impact on <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> recovery rates. Amcor has an opportunity to focus on these variables when attempting to improve their downstream footprint...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 <b>Plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> is a {{cost-effective}} solution for housing RF and microwave integrated circuits in low cost communication devices. While enabling low cost packaging of integrated circuits, <b>plastic</b> <b>packages</b> including the circuit ground patch (paddle) inside the package {{can have a}} significant parasitic effect on circuit performance. The purpose of this thesis is to develop accurate broadband models and associated extraction procedures for the paddle in <b>plastic</b> surface-mount RF-IC <b>packages.</b> Availability of package models will help the RF design engineer to include the packaging effects directly during the circuit design phase. In this thesis a new lumped element equivalent circuit model for the ground paddle inside a <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> is presented. The ground paddle is characterized by planar full-wave electromagnetic simulation {{as well as by}} measurement of an equivalent paddle test structure. To de-embed the effects of the measurement probes, several test structures are designed. The equivalent circuit parameters for the paddle in a general symmetric 2 n-pin <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> are extracted from a set of measured or simulated two-port scattering parameters. To illustrate the modeling approach, the response of the paddle model for a four-pin and eight-pin <b>plastic</b> <b>package</b> is shown and found to be in good agreement with the measured and simulated data over a broad frequency range extending beyond 5 GHz. Finally, the extraction of the equivalent circuit model of the paddle through the package lead-frame is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The Dutch {{post-consumer}} <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> recycling {{network has}} been described in detail (both {{on the level of}} packaging types and of materials) from the household potential to the polymeric composition of the recycled milled goods. The compositional analyses of 173 different samples of post-consumer <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> from different locations in the network were combined to indicatively describe the complete network with material flow analysis, data reconciliation techniques and process technological parameters. The derived potential of post-consumer <b>plastic</b> <b>packages</b> in the Netherlands in 2014 amounted to 341 Gg net (or 20. 2 kgnet. cap - 1. a - 1). The complete recycling network produced 75. 2 Gg milled goods, 28. 1 Gg side products and 16. 7 Gg process waste. Hence the net recycling chain yield for post-consumer <b>plastic</b> <b>packages</b> equalled 30 %. The end-of-life fates for 35 different <b>plastic</b> <b>packaging</b> types were resolved. Additionally, the polymeric compositions of the milled goods and the recovered masses were derived with this model. These compositions were compared with experimentally determined polymeric compositions of recycled milled goods, which confirmed that the model predicts these compositions reasonably well. Also the modelled recovered masses corresponded reasonably well with those measured experimentally. The model clarified the origin of polymeric contaminants in recycled plastics, either sorting faults or packaging components, which gives directions for future improvement measures. </p...|$|R
