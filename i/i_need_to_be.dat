While promoting Nights in Rodanthe, she expressed frustration with being typecast and stated that she was [...] "gunning for something that's not so sympathetic. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bitch, and <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a comedy. I've decided. No more Miss Nice Guy." [...] Lane had even contemplated quitting acting and spending more time with her family if she is unable to get these kinds of roles. She said in an interview, [...] "I can't do anything official. My agents won't let me. Between you and me, I don't have anything else coming out."

500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences.

[...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E

500|$|Complex {{named it}} the second best {{song of the}} first half of 2014. Writer Justin Charity commented saying, [...] "While hardly their strongest verses of even the past couple years, Ross, Kanye, and Sean all come correct with the quotables here, from Sean's opening mantra to Kanye's {{aggressive}} confessional to post-sex grilled cheese. The song's weary gospel build-up makes way for the minimal, rarefied ecstasy of that spaceship hangover melody. An arena confession <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shouting at the livest of live shows by year's end: [...] "All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch!" [...] Verdict: We need another Yeezus." [...] MySpace also named the song one of the 50 best songs of the same time period.
