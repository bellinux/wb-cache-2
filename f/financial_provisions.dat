One of the <b>financial</b> <b>provisions</b> obliged Daimler to pay BSA an annual dividend of £100,000 representing approximately 40 per cent of the actual cash BSA had put into Daimler. This financial burden deprived Daimler of badly needed cash to fund development, forcing the Daimler company to borrow money from the Midland Bank.|$|E
25|$|Domestic water {{charges in}} Ireland were thus {{prohibited}} under the Local Government (<b>Financial</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Act 1997, passed in May 1997 {{shortly before the}} June 1997 general elections in which Fine Gael lost to Fianna Fáil under Bertie Ahern. However, because of popular discontent, the new government chose not to pursue domestic water charges. Instead, it embarked on consultations {{which resulted in the}} 1998 Water Services Pricing Policy. This policy banned cross-subsidy of domestic services from non-domestic charges. For non-domestic users, the policy required the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from these users. It also foresaw the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006. Domestic operational costs were to be paid for through a local government fund, and capital costs were to be financed through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.|$|E

The paper evaluates the criteria of <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> of small businesses. It offers the organizational mechanism of <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> of small business.

The use of foresight technologies in building scenarios for the formation of <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> of small businesses is proposed. Stages and methods of systemic foresight are considered. The conclusion is made that <b>financial</b> <b>provision</b> of small business in Ukraine should be focused not only on changes in the legislation, but also on the improvement of state support of small businesses and expansion of the relationship “state-small businesses”...|$|R

500|$|The {{defiance}} of [...] the Poplar councillors generated widespread interest and sympathy, and the publicity embarrassed the government. Several other Labour-controlled councils (including Stepney whose mayor was the future Labour leader Clement Attlee) threatened [...] similar policies. After six weeks' incarceration the councillors were released, {{and a government}} conference was convened to resolve the matter. This conference brought a significant personal victory for Lansbury: {{the passage of the}} Local Authorities (<b>Financial</b> <b>Provisions)</b> Act, which equalised the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. As a result, the rates in Poplar fell by a third, and [...] additional revenues of £400,000 was gained by the borough. Lansbury was hailed as a hero; [...] in the 1922 general election he won the parliamentary seat of Bow and Bromley with a majority of nearly 7,000, and would hold {{it for the rest of}} his life. The term [...] "Poplarism", [...] always identified closely with Lansbury, became part of the political lexicon, [...] applied generally to campaigns where local government stood against central government on behalf of the poor and least privileged of society.|$|E

[...] For example, one of the (predecessor) Local Government Act of 1974 1974 Act's highly prescriptive provisions was s663, which gave councils a statutory power to install, light and maintain a town clock. [...] It is said that by the mid 1990s, the 1974 Act rivalled the country's income tax legislation in terms of size and complexity. With over 100 amendments, the 1974 Act had become an unwieldy mish-mash of 1950s and 60s prescriptive planning, overlaid with 1990s accountability and <b>financial</b> <b>provisions,</b> with a complicated numbering system.|$|E
2500|$|Townshend also {{faced the}} problem {{of what to do}} about the New York Provincial Assembly, which had refused to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act because its members saw the act's <b>financial</b> <b>provisions</b> as levying an unconstitutional tax. The New York Restraining Act, which {{according}} to historian Robert Chaffin was [...] "officially a part of the Townshend Acts", suspended the power of the Assembly until it complied with the Quartering Act. The Restraining Act never went into effect because, by the time it was passed, the New York Assembly had already appropriated money to cover the costs of the Quartering Act. The Assembly avoided conceding the right of Parliament to tax the colonies by making no reference to the Quartering Act when appropriating this money; they also passed a resolution stating that Parliament could not constitutionally suspend an elected legislature.|$|E

Yet, if I seem in this chapter to assume sometimes the liberties which are habitual to historians, but which, in spite of the greater knowledge with which we speak, we generally hesitate to assume towards contemporaries, let the reader excuse me when he remembers how greatly, if it is to understand its destiny, the world needs light, even if it is partial and uncertain, on the complex struggle of human will and purpose, not yet finished, which, concentrated in the persons of four individuals in a manner never paralleled, made them, in the first months of 1919, the microcosm of mankind.|$|E
