It leaves the valley via Greenhorn Creek, passing the Feather River Route's Williams Loop and then {{following}} the small <b>Estray</b> Creek to Lee Summit, which the rail line passes under in the Spring Garden Tunnel. This brings SR 70 {{into the valley}} of the Middle Fork Feather River, which takes it southeast to Blairsden, where the State Scenic Highway ends and State Route 89 splits to the south, and then east, through the Plumas National Forest, to Portola and Beckwourth. The large Sierra Valley begins at the latter community, and SR 70 heads almost directly across, passing the north end of SR 49 at Vinton and the south end of SR 284 at Chilcoot before crossing Beckwourth Pass, which the railroad takes the Chilcoot Tunnel under, and descending slightly to end at U.S. 395 at Hallelujah Junction.|$|E
500|$|Federal {{protection}} for all free-roaming horses was ultimately accomplished by {{the passage of}} the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, which specifically states: [...] "A person claiming ownership of a horse or burro on the public lands shall be entitled to recover it only if recovery is permissible under the branding and <b>estray</b> laws of the State in which the animal is found." [...] which alleviated the problem of horses being rounded up under the auspices of belonging to local ranchers. [...] Ranchers were given a specified time period following passage of the Act to claim their horses, and any remaining unbranded and unclaimed herds roaming BLM or Forest Service [...] became the property of the federal government.|$|E
500|$|Ownership of free-roaming herds {{remained}} contentious, {{and ranchers}} {{continued to use}} airplanes to gather them. [...] Horses were still subject to individual states' <b>estray</b> laws, and no law prevented the complete elimination of horse herds. [...] Federal agencies also continued to try to eliminate horses from areas where they were perceived to be causing resource damage. [...] Under BLM policy, ranchers could release a branded mare into a herd then later round up not only the mare, but the band the mare ran with, for slaughter or sale. In Nevada, state law permitted ranchers to round up any unbranded horses on their private land and slaughter or sell them. Concerned about these practices, and about continuing horse hunts in unprotected areas, International Society for the Protection of Mustangs and Burros of which Johnston was the first president, began working to pass federal legislation to protect feral horses throughout the U.S. She was joined {{by a number of}} prominent people, including country music singer Judy Lynn, Gunsmoke actress Amanda Blake, and New Hampshire Union Leader publisher and conservative William Loeb III, who continued to lobby for federal rather than state control over the disposition of free-roaming horses.|$|E

500|$|The {{constitutionality}} {{of the new law}} was disputed. [...] Up until then, feral horses and burros were considered to be under the jurisdiction of State <b>estray</b> laws, and managed as unclaimed livestock that the Federal government had no right to interfere with. [...] To test this assertion, in 1974 the New Mexico Livestock Board seized 19 free-roaming feral burros which were preventing cattle from using a watering hole on federal land. The United States District Court for the District of New Mexico held that, under the , Congress could regulate [...] "wild" [...] animals only to protect public land from damage. [...] The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that Congress's power to manage public land [...] "necessarily includes the power to regulate and protect the wildlife living there." [...] and that, unclaimed free-roaming horses could be considered [...] "wildlife" [...] for purposes of determining whether Congress has the power to protect them. In United States v. Johnson, 685 F.2d 337 (9th Cir. 1982) the act was challenged in court for being unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutionally overbroad in its definition of [...] "unbranded and unclaimed horses". The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the wording of the act.- ...|$|E
2500|$|Pursuant to a {{parallel}} clause in , the Supreme Court has held that states may not tax such federal property. In another case, Kleppe v.

[...] The case prohibited the entering upon the public lands of the United States and removing wild burros under the New Mexico <b>Estray</b> Law.|$|E

By 1805, there were so many horses in California that people began to simply kill unwanted animals to reduce overpopulation.

Some wandered off because the Spanish generally did not keep them in fenced enclosures, and Native {{people in the area}} captured some of these <b>estrays.</b> [...] Other horses were traded by Oñates' settlers for food, women or other goods. [...] Initially, horses obtained by Native people were simply eaten, along with any cattle that were captured or stolen. [...] But as individuals with horse-handling skills fled Spanish control, sometimes with a few trained horses, the local tribes began using horses for riding and as pack animals. [...] By 1659, settlements reported being raided for horses, and in the 1660s the [...] "Apache" [...] were trading human captives for horses.

The cattle were subsequently moved from the Gulf coast to the Conquista Ranch on the San Antonio River, still under {{the management of the}} same family, and left to multiply, graze, and wander away. Perhaps one-third were branded, and the caretakers apparently made no great effort to keep up with them and may have willfully neglected the branding in order that they might not be readily sold and themselves deprived of their easy position. The wanderings were such that in 1856, the herd could be estimated as numbering the same 400. Others in the area, though being aware that the unbranded <b>estrayed</b> cattle were likely Maverick's, followed the range convention of the time and burned their own brands into the [...] "mavericks," [...] as they had come to refer to the unmarked cattle. Mr. Maverick had little interest in the cattle, and Mrs. Maverick's appendix contains a number of letters advising him of the state of his herd. A Mr. Leo J. Toutant followed up on his own father's earlier offer to purchase Maverick's herd, and in 1856 did so himself. The correspondence relating to the sale appears in the appendix.|$|R

The edifice seems to be of white marble, now much blackened with London smoke, and has a Grecian pillared portico. In the square, just above us, is a statue of William Pitt. We went down Bond Street, and part of Regent Street, just <b>estraying</b> a little way from our temporary nest, and taking good account of landmarks and corners, so as to find our way readily back again. It is long since I have had such a childish feeling; but all that I had heard and felt about the vastness of London made it seem like swimming in a boundless ocean, to venture one step beyond the only spot I knew. My first actual impression of London was of stately and spacious streets, and by no means so dusky and grimy as I had expected,--not merely in the streets about this quarter of the town, which is the aristocratic quarter, but in all the streets through which we had passed from the railway station. If I had not first been so imbued with the smoke and dinginess of Liverpool, I should doubtless have seen a stronger contrast betwixt dusky London and the cheerful glare of our American cities. There are no red bricks here; all are of a dark hue, and whatever of stone or stucco has been white soon clothes itself in mourning.|$|R

A sense of the past imparted itself to the well-known encounter with the portier and the head waiter at the hotel door, to the payment of the driver, to the endeavor of the secretary to have them take the most expensive rooms in the house, and to his compromise upon the next most, where they found themselves in great comfort, with electric lights and bells, and a quick succession of fee-taking call-boys in dress-coats too large for them. The spell was deepened by the fact, which March kept {{at the bottom of}} his consciousness for the present, that one of their trunks was missing. This linked him more closely to the travel of other days, and he spent the next forenoon in a telegraphic search for the <b>estray,</b> with emotions tinged by the melancholy of recollection, but in the security that since it was somewhere in the keeping of the state railway, it would be finally restored to him.|$|E

This is the picture you see spread far below you, with distance to soften it, the sun to glorify it, strong contrasts to heighten the effects, and over it and about it a drowsing air of repose to spiritualize it and make it seem rather a beautiful <b>estray</b> from the mysterious worlds we visit in dreams than a substantial tenant of our coarse, dull globe.
