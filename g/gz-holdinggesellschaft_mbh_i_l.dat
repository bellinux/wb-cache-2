40|$|Fat {{network is}} known as one {{essential}} element in development of ice cream infrastructure. The main goal {{in the study was}} to understand the effect of stabilizers on fat agglomeration during freezing in the presence and absence of emulsifier. Eight commercial ice creams were analyzed for particle size and melting properties. Additionally, ice cream mix was formulated to contain 10 % milk fat, 10 % milk solids-not-fat, 12 % sucrose, 6 % corn syrup solids, and 0. 15 % carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The formulations also included mixes with and without 0. 15 % mono-and di-glycerides (MDG). Fat aggregation was indicated by D[4. 3] and % particles above 10 μm as measured by a Malvern Mastersizer. Melting rate was defined as amount of dripped loss divided by melting time. Commercial ice cream analysis showed that ice cream with egg yolks (EY) and no stabilizers had no fat aggregates. Particle size distributions varied between ice cream brands. Ice creams with MDG or those with gums in addition to EY showed an increased aggregation. Ice cream without stabilizer had no fat aggregates and melted at the fastest rate. Gums decreased the melting rate and the melting properties were independent from particle size. Ice cream with only CMC showed the highest amount of fat aggregates and highest melting resistance. The effect was followed by ice cream made with both CMC and MDG, and only MDG. The amount of fat aggregates was highly correlated to the melting resistance of the ice creams. Ice cream with most melting resistance had greater amount of fat aggregates. <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> ili <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> i i i ll <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> il il li li l ll <b>l</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> i <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> ili <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> i i i i i i i i i i i <b>i</b> <b>i</b> ili <b>l</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> i ll <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>l</b> <b>l</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>i</b> <b>l</b> <b>i...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} (CL) is {{a neglected}} infectious disease {{and a major}} health problem in several developing countries. Despite some reasonable explanation for their potential benefits, there is only trace evidence regarding the role of dressings {{in the treatment of}} CL. METHODS: This randomized, assessor-blind, controlled, clinical trial was conducted in an endemic area for CL caused by Leishmania major in Iran to assess the efficacy of administration of weekly intralesional meglumine antimoniate (<b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA) either alone or combined with application of a silver or a non-silver polyester dressing on their lesions for 6 weeks. After screening of 241 patients with CL lesions, 83 eligible patients with 158 lesions were randomly allocated in three arms of the study. Eligibility criteria included parasitologically confirmed CL, age of 12 to 60 years; willingness to participate, duration of lesion< 3 months, number of lesions< 5, largest ulcer diameter< 5 cm. Pregnant or lactating women were excluded. The primary outcome was absolute risk reduction (ARR) based on the proportion of complete healing, which was defined as more than 75 % reduction {{in the size of the}} lesion compared with baseline in each group at the termination of treatment and 1 month later. FINDINGS: ARR (95 % Confidence Interval [CI]) in <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA versus <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA+non-silver dressing groups was 5. 98 % (- 7. 07 % to 20. 25 %), between <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA versus <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA+silver dressing groups was - 0. 23 % (- 13. 53 % to 14. 82 %), and between <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA+non-silver dressing versus <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA+silver dressing groups was - 6. 21 %(- 18. 28 % to 6. 52 %) after 6 weeks of treatment. ARR (95 % CI) in <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA versus <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA+non-silver dressing groups was - 2. 22 % (- 22. 12 % to 18. 10 %), between <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA versus <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA+silver dressing groups was 3. 64 % (- 15. 36 % to 22. 82 %), and between <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA+non-silver dressing versus <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> MA+silver dressing groups was 5. 86 % (- 12. 86 % to 24. 31 %) 1 month later.

The appearance of antitoxin-containing plasma cells in jejunal lamina propria correlated {{with the amount of}} antitoxin recovered in jejunal washings which, in turn, correlated with protection against challenge with cholera toxin. Thus, lamina propria antitoxin-containing plasma cells appeared to be the source of protective antitoxin. However, after sequential s. c. -oral immunization with toxoid, protection against challenge with Vibrio cholerae far outlasted the major systemic and local antitoxin responses and was not obviously explained by either. These studies reveal methods for induction of a mucosal antitoxin response, but leave in question the mechanism of prolonged protection induced by s. c. -oral immunization of dogs...|$|R

Immunization consisted of intraloop (<b>i.</b> <b>l.),</b> subcutaneous (s. c.), or combined <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> and s. c. inoculation of CT. Fluid from the loops and sera were tested for neutralization of CT by the blueing test and for relative content of isotype-specific (immunoglobulins A [IgA] and G [IgG]) anti-CT. To demonstrate protection against CT, fluid production by the chronic T-V loops was measured after challenge with CT; an “acute” loop prepared from adjacent intestine {{at the time of}} challenge was also tested in some animals. The highest neutralizing titers in loop fluids were found in animals receiving <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> or <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> and s. c. inoculations, whereas titers in sera were highest in rabbits receiving s. c. or <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> and s. c. inoculations.

Combined s. c. and <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> immunization was accompanied by reduced content of IgA anti-CT in fluids as compared with that obtained with <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> inoculation alone. This finding strongly suggested a suppressive effect on local immunization by s. c. inoculation. While this suppression may have been due to a direct (toxigenic) effect of CT on lymphocytes, an immunogenic mechanism, probably mediated through suppressor T cells, is favored. Little IgG anti-CT was detected in any loop fluids, but high levels were found in sera after two s. c. inoculations or four <b>i.</b> <b>l.</b> inoculations. Neutralization titers for the fluid specimens showed much better correlation with IgA anti-CT values than with IgG anti-CT values. The chronic and acute T-V loops showed protection against fluid production after exposure to CT in systemically and locally immunized animals. However, IgG anti-CT usually appeared in both loops; leakage of serum antibodies because of surgical manipulation was felt, therefore, to invalidate these protection results as a demonstration of local immunity. In challenge studies in undisturbed chronic loops, only local immunization alone was found to result in definite protection...|$|R
