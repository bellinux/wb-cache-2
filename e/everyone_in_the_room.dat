When Mr. Brockway arrives, he sees Darrin and Dorothy {{standing}} next to each other and assumes they are married to each other. When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake, and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha, Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account. After discovering that Mr. Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an African-American woman, Larry rejects Mr. Brockway's offer. Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account. Through witchcraft, Samantha causes Mr. Brockway to see <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> including himself, as having black skin. On Christmas Day, while the Wilsons are visiting the Stephens, Mr. Brockway arrives, apologizes for his previous actions, and repents of his racism. Samantha invites Mr. Brockway to join them for Christmas dinner, and he accepts.|$|E
5|$|The SSG {{entered the}} complex, which {{also served as}} Abdul Rasid Ghazi's living quarters, and engaged in a firefight in the main courtyard. Militants fired on them from {{makeshift}} bunkers beneath the stairwell. Army spokesman Arshad later stated that the militants must have been fortifying the bunkers for several months. Once the courtyard was cleared, the SSG entered the labyrinth of the Jamia Hafsa building. Militants inside were armed with guns and rockets, and some areas were booby-trapped. Some militants had bullet- and explosion-proof vests and other sophisticated weapons. The SSG suffered most of their casualties during {{this phase of the}} operation. In close-quarter combat, the SSG were attacked with smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, and fragmentation grenades. Twenty-nine of the thirty-three SSG commandos who were injured in the operation received injuries from fragmentation grenades. As the fight continued, the SSG came upon a room in which half a dozen militants were present. One of the militants detonated a suicide jacket, killing <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room..</b> It took several hours of intense fighting before the SSG gained control of Jamia Hafsa, with only the basement remaining to be secured.|$|E
5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool. When they were eventually able to access the area, they discovered thirty-two workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, with the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the thirty-two deceased represented <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at the time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E

25|$|On August 28, 1943, Stanley Lovell {{was asked}} to make a {{presentation}} {{in front of a}} not very friendly audience of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, since the U.S. top brass were largely skeptical of all OSS plans beyond collecting military intelligence and were ready to split the OSS between the Army and the Navy. While explaining the purpose and mission of his department and introducing various gadgets and tools, he reportedly casually dropped into a waste basket a Hedy, a panic-inducing explosive device {{in the shape of a}} firecracker, which shortly produced a loud shrieking sound followed by a deafening boom. The presentation was interrupted and did not resume since <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> fled. In reality, the Hedy, jokingly named after Hollywood movie star Hedy Lamarr for her ability to distract men, later saved the lives of some trapped OSS operatives.|$|E

One man asked for the privilege of placing the balls in a certain position for Adams to bowl at; Adams made the shot easily. This started Adams' career as a finger billiard expert. In the next town he traveled to, he hired a table, performed the same stunts with the balls, and added a few new shots. For three months after that Adams practiced various shots each day, and some of the shots he developed during that time became part of his regular exhibition repertoire.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. <b>Everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E

According to Hickman in the foreword to The Soulforge, [...] " [...] were just settling in to the game when I turned to my good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing.

[...] However, Bell wasn't all confidence when recording with Menzel, described the experiences working with her co-star as [...] "nerve-racking". The duo had rehearsed at Idina's house a song called [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", in which Bell greatly commended Idina's powerful voice. Regarding the songs that she performed in the film, Kristen said, [...] "We're singing the lovely songs of Kristen and Bobby Lopez, who wrote 'Book of Mormon.' So it's really, really funny music.

After some failed attempts to record other songs, Slade and Kolderie suggested Radiohead play [...] "Creep" [...] again. They recorded the song in a single take; after the performance <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> burst into applause.

[...] Mike Love remembers Wilson comparing the song to Einstein's theory of relativity. Music journo David Dalton said that [...] "Brian studied it like an adept memorizing the Koran." [...] In July 1967, he visited Wilson at his home, later writing about a box of tapes he discovered in Wilson's bedroom: [...] "I assumed they were studio demos or reference tracks and threw one on the tape machine.

2500|$|The {{band and}} their {{creative}} team focused initial meetings {{on what they}} wanted to communicate to the audience and how to make them feel. After defining the thematic arc of the show, the stage design began to take shape. Devlin explained the creative team's approach in designing the multifaceted stage: [...] "We wanted to respond to the geometry of an arena: all that oval air, how to energize the whole mass of air in those spaces so that the atmosphere reaches <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> equally." [...] Williams found it beneficial to collaborate with two separate firms, Devlin's company and Stufish, on the stage because of their contrasting work methods. Devlin's team created physical models, while Lipson's team made animations and collaborated with Tait on construction drawings. Fisher was unable to physically attend any meetings after the first one, but did occasionally videoconference with the creative team via Skype. In the final meeting he attended before his death in June 2013, when Bono asked the team to think of an object that could symbolise U2 and be incorporated into the stage design, Fisher suggested a cross; the idea would be implemented into some of the stage's lighting fixtures.|$|E

Nardwuar then asked Chrétien [...] "Do you think, if you were say 40 years younger, that you too would be writing punk songs about Suharto and protesting against APEC?" [...] Chrétien replied that he himself had protested as a student, and that in a democracy, protests were to be expected. Nardwuar followed up by telling the Prime Minister that [...] "Some of the protesters were maced." [...] Chrétien asked, [...] "What do you mean by that?" [...] Nardwuar then clarified, [...] "Mace? Pepper spray?" [...] Chrétien then stated abruptly, [...] "I don't know, these techniques did not exist in those days", which received big laughs from <b>everyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Nardwuar simply smiled at Chrétien's joke, and the Prime Minister concluded his answer by adding [...] "For me, pepper, I put it on my plate", with a smile while pantomiming shaking pepper onto a plate. This line also received laughter. However, allegations soon arose that someone in the Prime Minister's Office or Chrétien himself gave the go-ahead for the pepper-spraying of protesters.

[...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E
