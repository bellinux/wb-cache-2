30|$|Summarizing the literature, {{the high}} {{importance}} of students’ use of <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication</b> {{in their daily}} life is evident. But does this type of ICT use enhance students’ CIL skills? Or, does it even rather have a negative effect, because less time remains for “worthwhile” computer usage, such as learning activities? This study examines the relationship between students’ use of <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication</b> and their {{computer and information literacy}} and attempts to contribute to a deeper understanding of this relationship.|$|E
30|$|The {{arrival and}} rapid {{dissemination}} of digital {{technology in the}} last decade of the twentieth century raises the question how so called digital natives use technology in daily life and what relevant skills they need to develop in order to participate effectively in the digital age. From the literature, the high importance of students’ use of <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication</b> in their daily life is evident. In this paper we tried to answer the question if this type of ICT use enhances students’ CIL skills or if it—on the opposite—perhaps even rather has a negative effect, because less time remains for “worthwhile” computer usage, such as learning activities.|$|E
30|$|We first {{analysed}} {{the relationship}} between students’ CIL score and their use of <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication.</b> In the ICILS study, the student questionnaire included three questions that require students to rate the frequencies of their use of ICT applications. From these questions four scales were derived. One of them was “Students’ use of ICT for Social Communication” (S_USECOM). The {{students were asked to}} identify the frequency with which they were using the internet for various communication and information exchange activities outside of school. The response categories were “never”, “less than once a month”, “at least once a week but not every day” and “every day”. S_USECOM had an average reliability of 0.74 (Fraillon et al. 2015).|$|E
30|$|Further, one {{may argue}} that the overall use of {{computers}} could have a moderating effect on the studied relationship. However, including the respective variable into the regression model proofed to not change much the effect of <b>ICT</b> use <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication</b> on CIL and also did not enhance the explained variance of the CIL score significantly.|$|R
30|$|We could {{identify}} indeed {{a relationship between}} students’ CIL score and their use of <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> communication: in all educational systems participating in ICILS (further for simplicity referred to as “countries”), the CIL score increased along with an increase of students’ scale score in “Use of <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> communication”. This relationship was statistically significant in 16 out of 21 countries. However, the relation was weak; the explained variance of the CIL score was less than 10  % in most countries. We continued the analysis by investigating further the relationship between CIL {{and each of the}} four variables constructing the scale score <b>for</b> “Use of <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> communication”.|$|R

30|$|When we {{consider}} the interactive nature of social media, it can be assumed that they provide students with a medium for collecting and managing information as anticipated in Strand 1 and also for producing and exchanging information as conceptualized in Strand 2. Hence, this item seems truly be related with both strands of the CIL construct, which {{may be one reason}} for the close relationship. Lacking of an experimental design, this study cannot make causal inferences on the relation between CIL and e-communication. Therefore we cannot conclude if frequent use of ICT for communication enhances CIL skills, or if in turn students with high CIL use more frequently <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E
30|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between students’ use of information and communication technology (<b>ICT)</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication</b> and their {{computer and information literacy}} (CIL) scores. It also examines whether gender and socioeconomic background moderates this relationship. We utilized student data from IEA’s International Computer and Information Study (ICILS) to build multivariate regression models for answering the research questions, and accounted for the complex sample structure of the data by using weights for all statistical analyses, employing jackknife repeated replication for variance estimation. Students who frequently use the internet for messaging and participation in social networks (i.e., at least once a week) scored on average 44 points higher than those who use ICT for the same purpose only less than once a week or never. The direction of this effect was the same in all 21 participating educational systems, the difference ranging from 19 to 75 points (always statistically significant). We continued the analysis by testing whether the relationship is moderated by gender; as girls use more often <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication</b> and have higher CIL scores on average. After controlling for the gender effect the CIL scores between the two examined groups decreased only by 2 points on average. Even after including students’ socio-economic background into the model, the difference in CIL between the two groups of interest declined only little—to 32 points on average across all countries. The difference remained to be statistically significant in all countries but one. The results suggest a strong relationship between students’ CIL proficiency level and the frequency of their use of electronic devices for social communication; hence, respective skills needed at schools and later on at the workplace are reflected in their use outside of school and for socializing.|$|E
30|$|We first {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} students’ CIL score and their use of <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication.</b> The CIL score increased along with an increase of students’ scale score in “Use of ICT for social communication” in all educational systems participating in ICILS. This relationship was statistically significant in 16 out of 21 countries. However, the relation was weak. We continued the analysis by investigating further the relationship between CIL {{and each of the}} four variables constructing the index “Use of ICT for social communication”. We found out that the variable which has the closest relationship with CIL was “Communicating with others using messaging or social networks [for example instant messaging or (status updates)]”, while other variables comprising the index showed different or no patterns related with CIL.|$|E

30|$|Comparing the {{resulting}} {{two groups of}} students, we found a large average difference in CIL scores (44 points) favoring students using <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>communication</b> more frequently. The direction of the effect was the same in all countries; the difference ranged from 19 points in Switzerland {{to as much as}} 75 points in the Slovak Republic. Since these results were rather striking, we examined whether this effect was moderated by other variables such as SES and Gender. We found however that the moderating effect of these variables on the observed relationship was weak or even negligible in all participating countries. In other words, the relation between the use of ICT for communicating with others using messaging or social networks and CIL scores was still high and consistent across countries when controlling for SES and Gender.|$|E

40|$|As {{the country}} with biggest Internet population, by December 2011, China had at least 513 million Internet users. As the biggest {{developing}} country in the world, {{in the past three}} decades China experienced rapid social change and enormous economic development. The impacts of new media and ICT (Information and <b>Communication</b> Technology) on <b>social</b> change and development in China have attracted increasing attention among scholar communities. This dissertation aims to study the new media and <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change and development phenomena in China. It draws upon data from my fieldwork and participant observations {{in the past three years}} as well as a nationwide large sample survey of ICT use among Chinese CSOs (civil society organizations). I situate this research primarily in the theoretical framework of <b>communication</b> <b>for</b> development and <b>social</b> change studies (e. g., Servaes, 1999; Servaes, 2008). In this research, new media and <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change phenomena refer to the widely emerging new media and <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change and development policies, projects, or actions initiated by different stakeholders including government, CSOs, and individual activists. Through a case analysis approach, this research analyzes specific new media and <b>ICT</b> <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change cases, conducted by different stakeholders, concerning urgent social change issues such as digital inequality, CSOs empowerment, government accountability and transparency, and hunger/malnutrition using various <b>communication</b> <b>for</b> development and <b>social</b> change theories as well as other new media studies theories and the ICT/new media <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change model that I propose in Chapter two. This research reveals: how different stakeholders engage in new media <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change and development interventions (policies, projects or actions); the communication channels involved in these interventions; the relation and the interactions of different stakeholders in these new media <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change interventions; the sustainability issue of these social change and development interventions. The findings of the research show that the new media <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change model I propose is an effective analytical framework for the study of new media <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change. The research reveals that a multi-channel perspective which incorporates ICTs and other communication channels as well as the interactions between different channels is of great significance in the study of new media <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change. Moreover, the analysis of the interactions between different communication channels shows that in the media environment of convergence culture (Jenkins, 2006), in social change actions, the relation between ICT channels and other communication channels is not an either/or relation. They interact with each and reinforce each other in the social change actions. The research also shows that the multi-stakeholders approach I employed can significantly enrich our knowledge of the new media <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change phenomena. The multi-dimensional relations and interactions between different stakeholders in social change interventions are important issues that the study of new media <b>for</b> <b>social</b> change should address. ...|$|R
