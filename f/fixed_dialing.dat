50|$|A {{variable}} {{dialing plan}} has different dialing procedures for local and long distance telephone calls. A call {{within the same}} city or within an area is dialed only by the subscriber number, while for calls outside the area, the number must be prefixed with the destination area code. For <b>fixed</b> <b>dialing</b> plan it is always required to dial all digits of the complete telephone number, including any area codes, if implemented.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>Dialing</b> Number (FDN) is {{a service}} mode of a GSM phone's Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card. Numbers {{are added to}} the FDN list, and when activated, FDN restricts {{outgoing}} calls to only those numbers listed, or to numbers with certain prefixes. A notable exception is that emergency calls to 000, 112, 911, 999 and the like are exempt (and typically require no SIM or even an active service contract). Incoming calls are not affected by FDN mode.|$|E
50|$|He {{was granted}} the patent on January 16, 1838. Apart from the {{simplifications}} noted above, Rieussec made another important modification to his chronographs. From that time on, {{they had a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>dial</b> and a moving hand.|$|R
5000|$|In 1908 Frederic Dreyer {{suggested}} an improvement, adding gears {{so that the}} enemy bar would alter direction automatically when the dial plate was rotated. This allowed an automatic correction of enemy direction as the home ship changed course. [...] A similar [...] "helm-free" [...] Mark VI* model with a range and bearing clock and <b>fixed</b> <b>dial</b> plate permitted a gyrocompass input to automatically track own ship as it altered course, and was the one incorporated in the Dreyer Fire Control Table Mark III and III*. [...] Such equipment was quite specialized to a larger fire control context.|$|R
50|$|Parentheses {{are used}} in {{national}} notation to indicate digits that are sometimes not dialed, such as area code in variable-length dialing numbering plans. Parentheses are not allowed in the international notation, according to the standard, as international callers use <b>fixed</b> number <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 7 June 2004, Telkom {{began to}} provide their own {{international}} direct <b>dial</b> <b>fixed</b> line services. On 16 November 2005, the Telkom-2 satellite was launched to replace all satellite transmission services that have been served by previous satellite, Palapa B-4.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the late}} 14th century, a fixed hand (often a carving {{literally}} {{shaped like a}} hand) indicated the hour by pointing to numbers on a rotating dial; after this time the current convention of a rotating hand on a <b>fixed</b> <b>dial</b> was adopted. Minute hands (so named because they indicated the small or minute divisions of the hour) only came into regular use around 1690, after {{the invention of the}} pendulum and anchor escapement increased the precision of time-telling enough to justify it. [...] St John the Evangelist, Groombridge, Kent, has a fine example of a clock with only an hour hand. In some precision clocks a third hand, which rotated once a minute, was added in a separate subdial. This was called the 'second-minute' hand (because it measured the secondary minute divisions of the hour), which was shortened to 'second' hand. The convention of the hands moving clockwise evolved in imitation of the sundial. In the Northern hemisphere, where the clock face originated, the shadow of the gnomon on a horizontal sundial moves clockwise during the day. This was also why noon or 12 o'clock was conventionally located {{at the top of the}} dial.|$|R
50|$|In {{national}} notation, {{the trunk}} prefix can be {{included with the}} area code if required by national writing conventions; trunk prefix is included in most European countries whenever they use <b>fixed</b> or variable <b>dialing,</b> but is omitted in USA and Canada where phone numbers only indicate optional area code.|$|R
60|$|After having got {{every thing}} ready, the boys waited till {{the evening before}} <b>fixing</b> up the <b>dial,</b> {{because they could not}} see the North Star in the day time. But when the evening came, they went out, and began their preparations. It was a clear and pretty cold evening, and the stars were out in thousands.|$|R
50|$|In a {{makeshift}} costume, Nelson Jent helps Squid rescue Manteau. Not {{wanting to be}} controlled by Ex Nihilo, Abyss leaves causing Ex Nihilo to face them alone. As a nullomancer though, she has control over the holes of nothingness that permeate the Squid's body since his last encounter with Abyss and he urges Nelson and Manteau to escape and <b>fix</b> their <b>dial</b> while he sacrifices himself. When Abyss returned to Littleford, Ex Nihilo has moved on leaving Squid in a near-death state. As Nelson in the form of Cock-a-Hoop fights Abyss, Squid watches and explains that when disoriented, the smaller nothings are more easily controlled by Hairbringer and that Cock-a-Hoop should team with her to send those nothings back to Abyss. Squid then passes away following Abyss' defeat.|$|R
25|$|On {{the front}} {{face of the}} {{mechanism}} (see reproduction here:) there is a <b>fixed</b> ring <b>dial</b> representing the ecliptic, the twelve zodiacal signs marked off with equal 30 degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the constellation boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic Egyptian calendar, twelve months of 30 days plus five intercalary days. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the Greek alphabet. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.|$|R
5000|$|Analog clocks usually use a clock face which {{indicates}} time using rotating pointers called [...] "hands" [...] on a <b>fixed</b> numbered <b>dial</b> or dials. The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world, has a short [...] "hour hand" [...] {{which indicates}} the hour on a circular dial of 12 hours, making two revolutions per day, and a longer [...] "minute hand" [...] {{which indicates the}} minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a [...] "second hand" [...] which indicates the seconds in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the 24 hour analog dial, because {{of the use of}} 24 hour time in military organizations and timetables. Before the modern clock face was standardized during the Industrial Revolution, many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours. During the French Revolution the French government tried to introduce a 10-hour clock, as part of their the decimal-based metric system of measurement, but it didn't catch on. An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).|$|R
50|$|He, once again, {{makes the}} point that you can compare these beings with a key, which they {{represent}} themselves, whereas nature is the lock. Professor Richard Dawkins then explains that a key has to fit a lock exactly, and demonstrates this with a model of a lock. He mentions that a key is something very improbable. However it is hard to measure the probability of such a key, therefore Dawkins takes a bicycle lock for illustration, where you can calculate how likely it is to open the lock, because there is a <b>fixed</b> number of <b>dials</b> with a <b>fixed</b> number of positions. In Dawkin's case we have 3 dials, with 6 positions each, so the probability that you open the lock by sheer luck is one to two hundred and sixteen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Households with {{fixed-line}} telephones {{have decreased}} while mobile (cell) phone ownership has increased. We therefore sought {{to examine the}} feasibility of recruiting young women for a national health survey through random digit dialling mobile phones. Methods Two samples of women aged 18 to 39 years were surveyed by random digit <b>dialling</b> <b>fixed</b> and mobile numbers. We compared participation rates and responses to a questionnaire between women surveyed by each contact method. Results After dialling 5, 390 fixed-lines and 3, 697 mobile numbers, 140 and 128 women were recruited respectively. Among women contacted and found to be eligible, participation rates were 74 % for fixed-lines and 88 % for mobiles. Taking into account calls to numbers where eligibility was unknown (e. g. unanswered calls) the estimated response rates were 54 % and 45 % respectively. Of women contacted by fixed-line, 97 % reported having a mobile while 61 % of those contacted by mobile reported having a fixed-line at home. After adjusting for age, {{there were no significant}} differences between mobile-only and fixed-line responders with respect to education, residence, and various health behaviours; however compared to those with fixed-lines, mobile-only women were more likely to identify as Indigenous (OR 4. 99, 95 %CI 1. 52 - 16. 34) and less likely to live at home with their parents (OR 0. 09, 95 %CI 0. 03 - 0. 29). Conclusions Random digit dialling mobile phones to conduct a health survey in young Australian women is feasible, gives a comparable response rate and a more representative sample than dialling fixed-lines only. Telephone surveys of young women should include mobile dialling. </p...|$|R
5000|$|... ”The {{volume and}} shape of this {{instrument}} are about those of a large pocket chronometer. The dial is movable and turns about an axis that is perpendicular to its plane and passes through its centre. When the Chronograph is operating, this dial makes one revolution per minute, and since its circumference is divided into 60 parts, the angular motion of one division corresponds to one second. A small window next to the hanging ring reveals a number, which is replaced by another number with each revolution of the dial and indicates the minutes; the Chronograph can run about three-quarters of an hour without stopping.To use this instrument, when it is mounted and in a resting state, one first sets the divisions marking the time to the starting points by turning a knurled knob with one’s hand. Through the intermediary of a gear train, the knob causes the minute and second dials to move. Having done this, when the moment to start timing arrives, one presses a small button next to the knob to set the machine in motion. The observer can give full attention to the phenomena whose successive time intervals he wishes to measure, {{and as soon as}} one of the divisions of these intervals is reached, he presses a second button next to the one we have just mentioned. At the moment when it is pressed a small pen, or metal point, passing through the open tip of a cone filled with black oil ink and placed opposite the moving <b>dial’s</b> <b>fixed</b> zero point, marks a point on the circumference that is divided into seconds. This point then indicates the second and fraction of a second corresponding to the beginning or end of the period of time being measured.Operation of the pen trigger mechanism neither stops nor slows the moving dial’s motion, so the button can be pressed several times while this motion lasts, making a number of black points on the scale divided into 60 parts; each point indicates, by its position, the moment when it was marked.To stop the chronograph quickly, one need only press the button that started it. The mechanism is arranged such that pressing this button abruptly changes {{the current state of the}} machine, making it pass from a resting state to movement or from movement to its resting state.We did not examine the inside of the instrument, and we do not think that it offers anything particularly remarkable, given the current state of watchmaking. Its principal merit lies in its ability to instantly indicate the first and last moments of several successive time intervals by means of permanent, visible signs on a moving dial, without requiring the attention of the observer’s eyes or ears.A chronograph with such a property unquestionably offers precious resources to physicians, engineers and, in general, anyone who measures phenomena. A highly satisfactory trial was recently made at public horse races; but its use can obviously extend to an infinite variety of other kinds of observations, the testing of moving machines, gauging of running water, and almost all hydraulic operations. The passage of a star over the cross-hairs of a telescope, when the astronomer has only one free hand, will be very precisely indicated by this new means, which will either serve to verify the count of the seconds on a clock, or will replace such a count if the distant location of the clock or poor hearing keeps the escapement from being heard. …We think that Mr. Rieussec’s Chronograph deserves the Academy’s approval.|$|R
