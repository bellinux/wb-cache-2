5|$|During the {{following}} summer, Trott again {{acted as a}} Test selector, along with the incumbent Test captain George Giffen and former captain Percy McDonnell. When choosing the Australian team for the previous tour of England, Giffen used his influence to ensure the selection of his younger brother, Walter. The team chosen for the 1896 tour of England included a number of promising young players, including Joe Darling and Clem Hill, both of whom went on to captain Australia. Albert Trott was a controversial omission, in light of performances in the previous Ashes series, but he accompanied the team on their voyage and later settled in England. He had a successful career with Middlesex and appeared for England in two Test matches against South Africa. The cricket historian David Frith records that when the Trott brothers encountered each other on an English street, they merely exchanged acknowledging nods and <b>kept</b> <b>walking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1859 {{there was}} no {{standard}} colour, although {{there is evidence that}} the lettering and Royal Cypher were sometimes picked out in gold. In 1859, a bronze green colour became standard until 1874. Initially, it was thought that the green colour would be unobtrusive. Too unobtrusive, as it turned out — people <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> into them. Red became the standard colour in 1874, although ten more years elapsed before every box in the UK had been repainted.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

60|$|And, whilst {{he slept}} thus, Sir Lionel <b>kept</b> watch, <b>walking</b> {{up and down}} in the shade of a hedge near-by.|$|R
60|$|Either the Raja {{could not}} answer the question, or perhaps he would not, being {{determined}} to break the spell which had already <b>kept</b> him <b>walking</b> to and fro for so many hours. Then the Baital, who had paused to let his royal carrier commit himself, seeing that the attempt had failed, proceeded without making any further comment.|$|R
2500|$|As {{an added}} bonus, {{completing}} various tasks and doing certain objectives {{in the game}} will unlock [...] "video files." [...] These are selected clips from the actual U.S. TV show. They are mostly extremely dramatic moments (such as when Uchenna & Joyce couldn't pay their taxi driver at the final Pit Stop and Chris & Alex making the closest finish in Amazing Race) or funny moments (such as when Fran & Barry <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> past a clue that was within arm's length). The clips appear exactly as they did on TV, except that all logos are pixelated, even those that went uncensored on TV. Clips from seasons 1 to 15 are included.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Brando made one of the strongest commitments to furthering King's work. Shortly after King's death, he announced that he was bowing out of the lead role of a major film (The Arrangement) (1969) which was about to begin production in order to devote himself to the civil rights movement. [...] "I felt I'd better go find out where it is; {{what it is to be}} black in this country; what this rage is all about," [...] Brando said on the late-night ABC-TV talk show Joey Bishop Show. In A's Biography episode on Brando, actor and co-star Martin Sheen states, [...] "I'll never forget the night that Reverend King was shot and I turned on the news and Marlon was walking through Harlem with Mayor Lindsay. And there were snipers and there was a lot of unrest and he <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> and talking through those neighborhoods with Mayor Lindsay. It was one of the most incredible acts of courage I ever saw, and it meant a lot and did a lot." ...|$|E
60|$|Maxwell <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> hack and forth, and Louise {{began again}} {{at a new}} point.|$|E
60|$|And so, dear soft people, {{should you}} ever visit London Town, and see these men {{asleep on the}} benches and in the grass, please do not think they are lazy creatures, preferring sleep to work. Know that {{the powers that be}} have <b>kept</b> them <b>walking</b> all the night long, and that in the day they have nowhere else to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] Matt took a fresh grip of his friend's arm, {{and walked}} him {{steadily}} forward, and <b>kept</b> him <b>walking</b> {{in spite of}} his involuntary tendency to come to a halt every few steps, and try to urge something that he never quite got from his tongue, against the probability of what Matt was saying. [...] "I mean that these people are right in their suspicions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you said}} that you <b>kept</b> picturing father <b>walking</b> about the streets of London, wrestling with his pride and trying to make up his mind to come home again," [...] said her niece, maliciously.|$|R
60|$|Old Granny Fox muttered {{this over}} and over, as she <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> around uneasily and {{sniffing}} the air.|$|E
60|$|As to {{the fate}} of the Cast-iron Man, he was wound up so tightly that he <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> {{straight}} on until he reached the sea, where he stepped into the water, went down to the bottom, and stuck fast in the mud.|$|E
60|$|When, for {{the third}} time, Julian found himself obliged, with his companions, to pass this {{troublesome}} brace of fops, they <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> close behind him, speaking so loud as to be heard, and {{in a tone of}} perfect indifference whether he listened to them or not.|$|E
60|$|Finding a {{break in}} the cliff they descended, and started through the woods for the watercourse. It was indeed cold, and only their brisk <b>walking</b> <b>kept</b> them warm. A stiff wind was rising, and {{overhead}} the branches swayed mournfully.|$|R
6000|$|Nobody, in short, {{could enter}} this room, except by passing through that of Mrs. Ricketts, {{the door of}} which [...] "was always made fast by a drawn bolt". Yet {{somebody}} <b>kept</b> rustling and <b>walking</b> in the inner room, which somebody could never be found when sought for.|$|R
6000|$|We made an {{appointment}} at a café in the Champs Elysées. In [...] the morning we took some chocolate. The wind was westerly, [...] and the air fresh. The sun was surrounded by white clouds, [...] spread in masses over an azure sky. Reaching the Bois de [...] Boulogne by eight o'clock, Jean Jacques set to work [...] botanising. As he collected his little harvest, we <b>kept</b> [...] <b>walking</b> along. We had gone through part of the wood, when in [...] {{the midst of the}} solitude we perceived two young girls, one [...] of whom was arranging the other's hair.--[Reminded them of [...] some verses of Virgil.]....|$|R
60|$|Sick with distaste, Grace {{nevertheless}} complied, as by clockwork {{and they}} moved evenly side by side into the deeper recesses of the woods. They went farther, much farther than Mrs. Charmond had meant to go; {{but she could not}} begin her conversation, and in default of it <b>kept</b> <b>walking.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{hurry and}} get back to the road of yellow brick before dark," [...] he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> until Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} such kissing and hugging, such crying and laughing. Mr. Quiverful could not sit still at all, but <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> from room to room, then out into the garden, then down the avenue into the road, and then back again to his wife. She, however, lost no time so idly.|$|E
60|$|For {{a little}} while he kept to the road, then, as the idea {{occurred}} to him that some of his pursuers might use a vehicle, he broke through the hedge and took to the fields. His legs gave way beneath him, and he stumbled rather than ran, but he <b>kept</b> on alternately <b>walking</b> and running until all signs of the pur-suit had ceased.|$|R
5000|$|Early on, he {{developed}} rickets, which <b>kept</b> him from <b>walking</b> {{until he was}} four years old. At the age of four, {{he developed}} pneumonia and heard a doctor say to his father, [...] "Your boy is lost". At that point, he decided to be a physician. He {{was very interested in}} the subjects of psychology, sociology and philosophy. After studying at University of Vienna, he specialized as an eye doctor, and later in neurology and psychiatry.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, the [...] "unexpected" [...] ending {{is part of}} {{the nature}} of {{interesting}} literature. An example of this is Denis Diderot's novel Jacques le fataliste (literally: James the Fatalist; sometimes referred to as Jacques the Fatalist or Jacques the Servant and his Master). At one point in the novel, Diderot speaks directly to the reader:Now I, as the author of this novel might have them set upon by thieves, or I might have them rest by a tree until the rain stops, but in fact they <b>kept</b> on <b>walking</b> and then near night-fall they could see the light of an inn in the distance.(not an exact quote). Diderot was making the point that the novel (then a recent introduction to European literature) seemed random (in the sense of being invented out of thin air by the author, not in a modern technical sense). See also Eugenio Montale, Theatre of the Absurd.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! well!" [...] {{cried the}} {{commercial}} drummer. [...] "To be sure I met that fellow. The way I noticed him {{was because he}} acted so queer. He didn't want to sit still, but <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> {{up and down the}} aisle and from one car to another. I saw the conductor talk to him once or twice, too." ...|$|E
60|$|Rollo and Jennie {{would have}} liked to stop and look longer at the arch; but they did not wish to {{separate}} from Adrienne and Antoine, who <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> steadily on all the time with their father and mother. Rollo supposed, as has been said before, that this party were going to some church; but they were not. They were going to a place called the Hippodrome.|$|E
60|$|They {{turned into}} no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but still <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, {{until they came}} {{within sight of the}} lights of a town at no great distance. On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge.|$|E
5000|$|Daphne {{reveals that}} her disease <b>kept</b> her from <b>walking</b> {{until the last}} eclipse, when she gained her powers which {{restored}} her ability to walk. After explaining to Matt she orders him to leave which he does as her father returns. At the comic book store, Hiro goes {{through all of the}} 9th Wonders! issues in an attempt to regain his memory. Upon finding the more unpleasant events (fighting Sylar, the death of his father, etc.), he runs to hide in the bathroom not wanting to [...] "grow up." ...|$|R
500|$|On May 22, {{four days}} {{after the fall of the}} Muong Khoua {{garrison}}, three of its soldiers—the garrison radio operator Novak and two Laotians—reached the only remaining French outpost in northern Laos, Phong Saly. Bernard Fall recorded in Street Without Joy: [...] "he was only twenty-five years old, but he looked fifty; he <b>kept</b> on <b>walking</b> like an automaton to the centre of the post before he was stopped by some of the men staring at him as at a ghost." [...] Novak and the two other soldiers had spent the four days moving through the jungle of Laos following the defeat of their unit. Two days later, Sergeant Pierre Blondeau also arrived at the outpost. His account detailed 57 hours spent hiding from the Viet Minh before a three-day march without food or navigational aids and then encountering native tribesmen who provided food and a pony, with which he reached the French forces.|$|R
60|$|You will {{remember}} {{there was no}} road--not even a pathway--between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four travelers {{went in search of}} the Witch she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. They <b>kept</b> on <b>walking,</b> however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning--all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.|$|R
60|$|Hewet {{could see}} that {{there was very little}} use in going on with the conversation, for it was obvious that Evelyn did not wish to say {{anything}} in particular, but to impress upon him an image of herself, being, for some reason which she would not reveal, unhappy, or insecure. He was very tired, and a pale waiter <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> ostentatiously {{into the middle of the}} room and looking at them meaningly.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} dark, and it {{required}} {{a moment to}} accustom the eye to objects by a light so feeble: when this was done, however, the admiral discovered that the ship was not close by the wind, as he had ordered {{that she should be}} <b>kept.</b> <b>Walking</b> to the helm, he perceived that it was so far borne up, as to cause her head to fall off toward the north-east, which was, in fact, in the direction to Spain.|$|E
60|$|The {{chief mate}} <b>kept</b> <b>walking</b> {{up and down}} the quarter-deck, with a lighted long-nine cigar in his mouth by way of a torch; and spoke but few words to us the whole watch. He must have had a good deal of {{thinking}} to attend to, which hi truth is the case with most seamen the first night out of port, especially when they have thrown away their money in foolish dissipation, and got very sick into the bargain. For when ashore, many of these sea-officers are as wild and reckless in their way, as the sailors they command.|$|E
5000|$|Ironic enough, I briefly met Doc Ice and Kangol (Kid) at the Albee Square Mall in Brooklyn, and, like Roxanne, I {{paid them}} no {{mind when they}} tried to get their rap on. All this was taking place while Paul Anthony and I were just {{becoming}} friends. Full Force was looking for someone to play the permanent role of Roxanne, even though they had already cut the track with someone they picked out of a club, whom, by the way, had absolutely no rap experience. They utilized her for an answer back to outbid Roxanne Shante's track. It seems that while they tried to create this character, they were having issues with this individual and her mother, so I was told, and that's when I was asked by Paul Anthony if I would audition for the guys, and I said sure, and I did. And, from there, I <b>kept</b> on <b>walking</b> in the shoes of THE REAL Roxanne! ...|$|R
