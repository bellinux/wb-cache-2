Benefits of this reconstruction is faster, more stable and more modern network that will facilitate the work of employees of ZŠMŠ Ohradní. To these improvements, I have mainly contributed by measurements. I participated in the design and implementation of new form of data network.

40|$|What is <b>Data</b> <b>Cabling?</b> A {{structured}} cabling {{system is a}} type of network construction that is open and is used by different systems like data, access management, telephony, building automation, along with many other similar capabilities. It is an extremely flexible and economical set up. Usually, a cabling system such as this can be broken into six components: work space, horizontal cabling, backbone cabling, gear space, telecommunication closet (room) and entrance ways. Common Network Set up Work space components are extended over into horizontal cabling networks via the telecommunications connector, reaching into the equipment in the targeted workspace. The components utilized in the work place usually include channel equipment (computers, information terminals, telephones, etc.), patch cables (modular cords, PC adapter wires, fiber patch cables, etc.) and communication sockets or outlets. Horizontal cabling setups are designed to extend to the telecommunications data outlet directly to the desired work area. The elements of horizontal cabling contain cable terminations, telecommunication outlets, cross-connections, cable from the patch panel into the work place, and cross-connects into different telecommunication rooms. Generally speaking, backbone cabling networks contain components such as spine wires (typically optical fiber cables), mechanical terminations, intermediate and main cross-connects, and patch cables that can be utilized for backbone-to-backbone cross-connections. Typically, equipment rooms within a building houses (stores) equipment in a type of network room. This usually includes main corr-connect, horizontal connects, or intermediate cross connects. A telecommunication room house any terminations of backbone and horizontal cables to joining hardware such as patch cords or jumpers. Entrance facilities typically have a telecommunications service entrance to the backbone and construction pathways different buildings. These areas contain the wires, network demarcation points, connecting safety devices, hardware and other equipment that connect to personal network cabling and your access provider. Why a Business Needs a Cabling Structure Without the right network installation and data infrastructure, a company {{would not be able to}} operate or compete in the marketplace. Today, most businesses operate using a data network system to help process transactions, store and handle sensitive information, conduct daily business operations, manage accounting and money, employee tracking and payroll, along with business email and hosting services...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{analytical and}} forensic tools for <b>data</b> <b>cabling,</b> with particular focus on Ethernet cabling to assist designers and {{those involved in}} deployments in analyzing cable performance and the reasons behind the actual performance obtained. The need for higher bandwidth to accommodate increasing demand for multimedia services and data centers network infrastructure {{led to the formation}} of IEEE P 802. 3 bq to create standards for 40 GBASE-T over twisted pair cables. The 40 GBASE-T is expected to offer bandwidth of up to 2000 MHz over a maximum channel length of 30 m. The research investigated means of predicting key performance parameters in Ethernet cabling standardization using the 40 GBASE-T as an example. The performance parameters prediction method provided is equally applicable to ongoing and future high data rate Ethernet cabling standardization such as the 2. 5 / 5 GBASE-T and 50 / 100 GBASE-T. Another problem in the Ethernet networking world is the availability of counterfeit and non-standards compliant twisted pair cables in the market. The significant amount of communications cables in the market containing copper clad aluminum cable or other non-standards compliant conductors disguised as Category 6 cables can pose serious problems to companies’ networks, the contractors or the installers. This is in view of the growing demand for internet of things (IOT) services that makes it imperative to have a reliable Ethernet driven communication network to support the required infrastructure. This thesis therefore, provides techniques that can be used to evaluate cables key performance parameters using the Feature Selective Validation method and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The technique can help engineers avoid subjective judgement and make objective decisions in the selection of cables. The research provided a technique that can be used to reverse engineer impedance profile from the return loss measurement of Ethernet cables using genetic algorithms. The method can be applied in situations where time domain tests are inaccessible or only simple (magnitude) tests in the frequency domain are available and there is the need for impedance profiles of cables to evaluate their performance or physical integrity before or after installation. The method can also be useful where only simple (magnitude) tests are the only historical data available for the cables and facilities for time domain reflectometry measurements are inaccessible. This research also presented a method of evaluating and predicting NEXT in unshielded twisted pair (UTP) using Category 6 cables as an example. The results obtained from the evaluation were used to provide crosstalk parameters for fast NEXT prediction in Category 6 (UTP) cables. The research used the measured NEXT of three Category 6 (UTP) cables from different manufacturers for evaluation and validation. The evaluation and modeling method can thus be useful to engineers investigating NEXT in the design of data communication systems...|$|E
