40|$|It is an incontrovertible {{fact that}} firms are {{increasingly}} expandig therir product offer - offering the customer with {{an increasing number}} of options and variants - in order to keep up with competition, especially in many mature markets. Expanding product variety poses great managerial challanges to the firm, as it tends to reduce repetitiveness in operational processes. The present paper presents the preliminary results of an interview study exploring what are the practices firms adopt in order to ensure operations efficiency in conditions of <b>high</b> <b>product</b> variety. From the analysis of the interviews it emerges that also firms offering relative low variety are adopting practices that are typically described as typical of <b>high</b> <b>product</b> variety environments.

40|$|The Minister of State, with {{responsibility}} for Drugs Strategy, Róisín Shortall T.

In May 2010, approximately 200 substances were placed {{under the control of}} under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. In August 2010 the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 made it a criminal offence to sell substances which have psychoactive effects. Due to these concerted legislative actions, there has been a significant {{reduction in the number of}} headshops operating throughout the country, from over 100 to approximately 10. “These new substances are dangerous and pose significant health risks for people who use them” the Minister said. “The Government has now brought under control another 60 substances approximately. This would not have been possible without the close working between my Department and other statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as individual experts in this field. ” she added.

40|$|We use text-based {{computational}} {{analysis of}} business descriptions from 10 -Ks to examine in which industries conglomerates {{are most likely}} to operate and to understand conglomerate valuations. We find that conglomerates are more likely to operate in industry pairs that are closer together in the product space and in industry pairs that have profitable opportunities "between" them. Conglomerate firms have lower stock market valuations than matched single-segment firms when their products are easier to replicate with single-segment firms. Conglomerate firms have stock market premiums when they have <b>higher</b> <b>product</b> differentiation and produce in more profitable industries.

40|$|A set of 7 {{different}} lignin preparations {{was generated}} {{from a range}} of organosolv (acidic, alkaline, ammonia-treated and dioxane-based), ionic liquid, autohydrolysis and Kraft pretreatments of lignocelluloses. Each lignin was characterised by 2 D HSQC NMR spectroscopy, showing significant variability in the β-O- 4 content of the different lignin samples. Each lignin was then valorised using three biocatalytic methods (microbial biotransformation with Rhodococcus jostii RHA 045, treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens Dyp 1 B or Sphingobacterium sp. T 2 manganese superoxide dismutase) and two chemocatalytic methods (catalytic hydrogenation using Pt/alumina catalyst, DDQ benzylic oxidation/Zn reduction). <b>Highest</b> <b>product</b> yields for DDQ/Zn valorisation were observed from poplar ammonia percolation-organosolv lignin, which had the highest β-O- 4 content of the investigated lignins and also gave the highest yield of syringaldehyde (243 mg/L) when using R. jostii RHA 045, and the most enzymatic products using P. fluorescens Dyp 1 B. The <b>highest</b> <b>product</b> yield from the Pt/alumina hydrogenation was observed using oak dioxasolv lignin, which also had a high β-O- 4 content. In general, <b>highest</b> <b>product</b> yields for both chemocatalytic and biocatalytic valorisation methods were obtained from preparations that showed highest β-O- 4 content, while variable yields were obtained with preparations containing intermediate β-O- 4 content, and little or no product was obtained with preparations containing low β-O- 4 content...|$|R
