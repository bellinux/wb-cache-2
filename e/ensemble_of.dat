5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored the work, like other cantatas written in Weimar, {{for a small}} <b>ensemble</b> <b>of</b> three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir only in the chorales, and a Baroque instrumental <b>ensemble</b> <b>of</b> four violas (Va), cello (Vc), bassoon (Fg) and basso continuo. The setting for four violas is unusual. In a similar orchestration, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 also omits violins.|$|E

The scoring requires only a small <b>ensemble</b> <b>of</b> a soprano soloist, three additional vocal parts for the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental <b>ensemble</b> <b>of</b> oboe, strings and basso continuo. While the first aria is pensive and elegiac, the second aria is of dancing folk-like character.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ensemble {{methods are}} able to improve the {{predictive}} performance of many base classifiers. Up till now, they have been applied to classifiers that predict a single target attribute. Given the non-trivial interactions that may occur among the different targets in multi-objective prediction tasks, {{it is unclear whether}} ensemble methods also improve the performance in this setting. In this paper, we consider two ensemble learning techniques, bagging and random forests, and apply them to multi-objective decision trees (MODTs), which are decision trees that predict multiple target attributes at once. We empirically investigate the performance <b>of</b> <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> MODTs. Our most important conclusions are: (1) <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> MODTs yield better predictive performance than MODTs, and (2) <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> MODTs are equally good, or better than <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> single-objective decision trees, i. e., a set <b>of</b> <b>ensembles</b> for each target. Moreover, <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> MODTs have smaller model size and are faster to learn than <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> single-objective decision trees. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{determine}} the spectral dimensions {{of a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> infinite trees.

We also introduce a class <b>of</b> <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> infinite trees, called generic random trees, which are obtained as limits <b>of</b> <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> finite trees conditioned to have fixed size N, as N →∞.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in optimization methods used for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with kernels, which are normalized according to particular constraints, have shown remarkable success. This work introduces an approach for training CNNs using <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> joint spaces of kernels constructed using different constraints. For this purpose, we {{address a problem}} <b>of</b> optimization on <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> products of submanifolds (PEMs) of convolution kernels. To this end, we first propose three strategies to construct <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> PEMs in CNNs. Next, we expound their geometric properties (metric and curvature properties) in CNNs. We make use of our theoretical results by developing a geometry-aware SGD algorithm (G-SGD) for optimization on <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> PEMs to train CNNs. Moreover, we analyze convergence properties of G-SGD considering geometric properties of PEMs. In the experimental analyses, we employ G-SGD to train CNNs on Cifar- 10, Cifar- 100 and Imagenet datasets. The results show that geometric adaptive step size computation methods of G-SGD can improve training loss and convergence properties of CNNs. Moreover, we observe that classification performance of baseline CNNs can be boosted using G-SGD on <b>ensembles</b> <b>of</b> PEMs identified by multiple constraints. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
