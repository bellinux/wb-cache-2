5|$|A new convoy, codenamed Operation Excess {{was on its}} {{way through}} Malta with {{ammunition}} supplies. Excess coincided {{with the arrival of the}} Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) in Sicily to support the faltering Italians in the theatre, after the failed invasion of Egypt. On 9 January the Regia Aeronautica flew a fighter sweep over the Grand Harbour. Eighteen Macchi C.200s from 6° Gruppo were engaged in aerial combat. MacLachlan climbed to 22,000 feet and spotted the enemy fighters 10,000 below. <b>He</b> <b>attacked</b> a group of six and shot one down into the sea where it left a large plume of water. MacLachlan circled the sea and noticed the Italian pilot had escaped his aircraft and survived. Capitano Luigi Armanino was taken aboard a rescue craft to a prisoner of war camp in Malta, wounded in the thigh and arm. MacLachlan claimed a second Macchi shot down minutes later. The following day <b>he</b> <b>attacked</b> an Italian Fiat CR.42 over the Excess convoy as the Italians attacked the ships once more. Four others appeared and they climbed over him and dropped onto his tail. Not risking a five to one encounter, MacLachlan flew over the Excess convoy hoping the ship's fire would protect him The British vessels fired at him in error but his aircraft was not hit.|$|E

5|$|Another of Donnchadh's sons, Eóin (John), {{owned the}} land of Straiton. He was {{involved}} in the Galwegian revolt of Gille Ruadh in 1235, during which <b>he</b> <b>attacked</b> some churches in the diocese of Glasgow. He received a pardon by granting patronage of the church of Straiton and {{the land of}} Hachinclohyn to William de Bondington, Bishop of Glasgow, which was confirmed by Alexander II in 1244. Two other sons, Ailean (Alan) and Alaxandair (Alexander), are attested subscribing to Donnchadh and Cailean's charters to North Berwick. A Melrose charter mentions that Ailean was parson of Kirchemanen. Cailean, and presumably Donnchadh's other legitimate sons, died before their father.|$|E

5|$|Cahill had won {{popular support}} as a {{vigorous}} and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply {{and in his}} first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>attacked</b> the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this, combined with Bruxner and Treatt constantly clashing over policy and candidate issues, contributed to the Liberal-Country Coalition again being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election. This amounted to a total loss of ten seats, three being Country Party seats, and a swing against them of 7.2%. Bruxner retained his seat with 60.15%.|$|E

5|$|Griffin and Collett {{were cleared}} {{of half the}} charges against them—the jury {{remained}} divided on the other charges, and a retrial was ordered.

They were met outside the court by about 200 supporters, who Griffin addressed with a megaphone. <b>He</b> <b>attacked</b> Tony Blair and the BBC, and defended the BNP's right to freedom of speech.
