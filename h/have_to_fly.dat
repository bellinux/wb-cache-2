5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{production}} Silverplate aircraft {{were ordered}} in August 1944 {{to allow the}} 509th Composite Group to train {{with the type of}} aircraft they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> in combat, and for the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to test bomb configurations. These were followed by 28 more aircraft that were ordered in February 1945 for operational use by the 509th Composite Group. This batch included the aircraft which were used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Including the Pullman B-29, a total of 46 Silverplate B-29s were produced during and after World War II. An additional 19 Silverplate B-29s were ordered in July 1945, which were delivered between {{the end of the war}} and the end of 1947. Thus, a total of 65 Silverplate B-29s were made.|$|E
5|$|When World War II broke out, Shaw took a {{break from}} acting and joined the Royal Air Force. He was {{commissioned}} as an Acting-Pilot Officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941 {{and over the next}} three months was promoted to Pilot Officer on probation, then Flying Officer and then Flight Lieutenant. According to his obituary in the Guardian, he saw little action in the service and was told the only chance he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> would be as a rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech. He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned the commission on 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of the Mark III Fat Man, a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s. The lead-acid batteries that powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and in June 1948 the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project had only three teams. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to Sandia Base to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.|$|E
5|$|Eilat Airport was {{established}} in 1949 by the Israel Air Force, following the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. During its early years, the airport aimed to establish a comprehensive set of connections to towns across the country, most notably with Tel Aviv and Haifa. Consequently, a regular route from Eilat to Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion International Airport) was started. Soon after, a route to Haifa Airport became operational. In December 1950, following their establishment, Arkia Israel Airlines became the largest domestic operator at Eilat Airport, taking {{the position of the}} former companies Eilata and Aviron. To this day, they retain this position. Later, in 1964 the runway was expanded to 1500m, and a passenger terminal was built. Five years later, the runway was further expanded increasing the length to 1900m. In 1975, Eilat Airport started to attract Scandinavian airlines. The first international flight arrival to Eilat, of the Danish airline, Sterling Airlines landed in this year. Since then, many international routes have been established directly linking Eilat with Europe, however, the airport is still unable to handle landings of large aircraft which <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to Uvda International Airport.|$|E

25|$|Widerøe won {{back the}} Vardø {{contract}} in August 2002, thus curtailing Arctic Air from operating the route. Also the Fagernes route was lost. However, Arctic Air was experiencing record-high patronage on the Fagernes route, up eighteen {{percent from the}} previous year. Russian authorities decided in October 2002 that Arctic Air would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> at a higher altitude than their aircraft without pressure cabins could withstand. Subsequently, Arctic Air was forced to terminate its route from 25 October. Arctic Air subsequently operated its last scheduled flight on 30 March 2003.

25|$|Construction of {{an airport}} is {{estimated}} to cost NOK530 million and have an annual operating cost of NOK28 million. An economic analysis showed that the airport would have a negative net present value for society of NOK1014 million, excluding operating subsidies for the airline. There is little time gain from the project as travelers to Oslo would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> via Sørkjosen to Tromsø and there change aircraft, instead of taking direct flights from Alta. Only passengers having Tromsø as travel target would have a gain from an airport. Avinor has recommended not upgrading the Kautokeino Airport.|$|E
25|$|Stein {{published}} {{an article on the}} biomechanics of Pteranodon flight. He crafted model Pteranodon wings and tested them in a wind tunnel. He found that Pteranodon was a capable, maneuverable flyer but was best adapted to long distance flights at low velocities. Stein calculated that a large Pteranodon would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> at least 10 miles an hour to stay airborne. He concluded that Pteranodon would have had to land on its hind feet because making the front feet ready for landing would collapse the wings, which would no longer be useful for keeping the pterosaur aloft. Stein's conclusions contradicted the previous findings of Bramwell and Whitfield.|$|E
500|$|The Japanese convoy – {{comprising}} eight destroyers {{and eight}} troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – assembled and departed from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul on 28 February. During the January operation, a course was followed that hugged the south coast of New Britain. This {{had made it}} easy to provide air cover, but being close to the airfields also made it possible for the Allied Air Forces to attack both the convoy and the airfields at the same time. This time, a route was chosen along the north coast, {{in the hope that the}} Allies would be deceived into thinking that the convoy’s objective was Madang. Allied air attacks on the convoy at this point would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> over New Britain, allowing interdiction from Japanese air bases there, but the final leg of the voyage would be particularly dangerous, because the convoy would have to negotiate the restricted waters of the Vitiaz Strait.

500|$|Eastern England was {{dotted with}} RAF {{stations}} {{that had been}} used by RAF Bomber Command and the US Eighth Air Force in the Combined Bomber Offensive during the Second World War. Many were still being used by the RAF and USAF, while others had been turned over to other uses but were still in good condition. The use of government-owned land saved the costs of land acquisition. RAF Witchford was initially included at the instigation of the Americans, but [...] the land was owned by the Church Commissioners, and nearby RAF Mepal was substituted. The main selection criterion was the condition of the road network connecting the bases; a grade of more that one in seventeen was considered an unacceptable risk of grounding the missile transport. Some proposed sites in Yorkshire based around RAF Dishforth ran into problems with radar coverage, and a new group of stations was found around RAF North Luffenham. These were not considered ideal as the missiles would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> over populated areas.|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps) {{had already}} busied {{themselves}} with searching the air waves {{for signs of}} a British raid. Before the first RAF bombers had taken off, they had already determined that a raid of at least 500 aircraft would take place that night. The Luftwaffe defences were alerted. Shortly afterwards the code word Gisela was issued to fighter units. Some German units did not treat the message with the urgency required. It is likely, after several months, unit officers did not remember {{the significance of the}} name and it took time for the crews to recall that it signified the offensive air patrol they were briefed about in late 1944. Crews were given a re-fresher briefing to compensate for the three-month time-gap.

500|$|Ptyonoprogne martins feed {{mainly on}} insects caught in flight, {{although}} they will occasionally {{feed on the}} ground. [...] When breeding, birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and usually feeding close to the nesting territory. To maintain the high frequency with which the young are fed, the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the nest, since the further they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to catch insects, the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest. At other times, they may hunt low over open ground. The insects taken depend on what is locally available, but may include mosquitoes and other flies, aerial spiders, ants and beetles. Martins often feed alone, but sizeable groups may congregate if food is abundant, such as where insects are fleeing grass fires. [...] The Eurasian crag martin may take aquatic species such as stoneflies, caddisflies and pond skaters. Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns.|$|E

500|$|The cast {{found out}} {{a couple of weeks before}} filming the episode that parts would be in animation. The {{animated}} portions were produced with Zoic Studios. Over an eight-week period, the studio defined the primary Fringe characters into their animated counterparts, and used footage of the actors and fight scene choreography to provide motion for the characters. The animators used a stand-in for Nimoy so that he did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to Vancouver from Los Angeles. The studio aimed to achieve a mixed look between stylized and authenticity to allow them to focus on animating the characters' emotions. The work also include recreating some of the settings already established from Fringe, such as Bell's office. Other parts of Olivia's dreamscape were handpainted scenes, projected onto 3D plates and used within the animation software. Andrew Orloff, Zoic's creative director commented, [...] "This project was one of the most intensive and rewarding we have worked on in Zoic’s history. It was an incredible undertaking, from the amazing writers at Fringe to the animation production that is both steeped in tradition and groundbreaking." [...] The episode ultimately contained sixteen minutes of animation; executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that the amount of man hours placed into the episode was [...] "by far" [...] the longest the series has had to date. The writers have cited Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Waltz with Bashir as influences for the episode.|$|E
