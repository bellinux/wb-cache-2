30|$|<b>Resonance</b> <b>frequencies</b> of beams {{with various}} types of end {{supports}} were examined for flexural vibration. Rectangular beams with dimensions of 300 (L) × 25 (R) × 5 or 10 mm (T) were used as the test specimens. Various compressing stresses were applied to the parts around both ends of a test beam and flexural vibration tests were conducted. The measured <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> started to increase from the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of a beam with simply supported ends and was stable around the <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of a beam with fixed ends as the compressing stress increased. The stable <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> was lower than the theoretical value because perfect fixation of a beam to a post was difficult. From these results, the temporal change in <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> itself, rather than the stable <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency,</b> is effective to examine whether a beam has enough strength as a guardrail.|$|R

To overcome this, a 2x3 multicellular design with a dispersion of 40°×90° was used. This allowed the sound to leave the horn and be dispersed largely without coming into contact with the cone of the bass driver. The horn was also coated with a damping compound to reduce high <b>frequency</b> <b>resonance</b> from the plastic. The original 601 The first 604 had a crossover frequency of 2000 Hz.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "acid" [...] {{sound is}} {{typically}} produced by playing a repeating note {{pattern on the}} TB-303, while altering the filter's cutoff <b>frequency,</b> <b>resonance,</b> and envelope modulation. The TB-303's accent control modifies a note's volume, filter resonance, and envelope modulation, allowing further variations in timbre. A distortion effect, either by using a guitar effects pedal or overdriving the input of an audio mixer, is commonly used to give the TB-303 a denser, noisier timbre—as the resulting sound is much richer in harmonics. Popular pedals include pedals by Boss and DOD Electronics pedals like the Grunge or Death Metal.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is defined}} in terms of the {{impedance}} presented to a driving source. It is still possible for the circuit to carry on oscillating (for a time) after the driving source has been removed or it is subjected to a step in voltage (including a step down to zero). This is similar to the way that a tuning fork will carry on ringing after it has been struck, and the effect is often called ringing. This effect is the peak natural <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> of the circuit and in general is not exactly the same as the driven <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency,</b> although the two will usually be quite close to each other. Various terms are used by different authors to distinguish the two, but <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> unqualified usually means the driven <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency.</b> The driven frequency may be called the undamped <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> or undamped natural frequency and the peak frequency may be called the damped <b>resonance</b> <b>frequency</b> or the damped natural frequency.

50|$|The TB-303 has {{a single}} audio oscillator, which may be {{configured}} to produce either a sawtooth wave or a square wave. The square wave {{is derived from the}} sawtooth waveform using a simple, single-transistor waveshaping circuit. This produces a sound that is subtly different from the square waveform created by the dedicated hardware found in most analog synthesizers. It also includes a simple envelope generator, with a decay control only. A lowpass filter is also included, with -24dB per octave attenuation, and controls for cutoff <b>frequency,</b> <b>resonance,</b> and envelope modulation parameters. It is a common misconception that the filter is a 3 pole 18 dB per octave design when in fact it is 4-pole 24 dB per octave.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the memory capable of holding 16 presets, the Source features a 37-note keyboard, and two VCOs that can be selected among three waveforms and three octaves. Programmed presets can be saved to an audio cassette interface to free up the onboard memory for additional new patches. The 24dB/octave VCF has parameters for keyboard tracking, cutoff <b>frequency,</b> <b>resonance,</b> and envelope amount. There are two ADSR envelope generators that can be set in single or multi trigger modes, one for the VCF {{and one for the}} VCA. For modulation, the Source features LFO and sample and hold. The unit also features a rudimentary sequencer. The Source was made in at least 2 versions the latter offering more voltage control options. A modification offered by Encore Electronics offers the addition of MIDI, increased memory and more sequence storage.|$|E
50|$|In general, primary blast {{injuries}} {{are characterized by}} the absence of external injuries; thus internal {{injuries are}} frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, <b>frequency</b> <b>resonance,</b> and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary blast injuries. Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of blast injuries within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. Blast lung refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these.

5000|$|The Neuron synthesizer's {{hardware}} {{was based}} around a standard PC mainboard running {{an early version}} of the Gentoo Linux operating system. A custom application ran the sound synthesis algorithm, and the instrument used custom front panel displays and a custom sound card. The front panel and the casing of the synthesizer were designed by Axel Hartmann. It featured 3 orange stick controllers which allowed simultaneous manipulation of 2 assignable parameters (X/Y direction). There were 2 oscillators per voice (called [...] "Resynators") which were split in two parameter groupings: [...] "Scape" [...] would refer to the generation properties of a sound (such as the excitation source in a real instrument), [...] "Sphere" [...] would contain all parameters referring to the properties of the resonating [...] "instrument" [...] body. The two Resynators could be combined and put through a [...] "Blender", which allowed different modes to be applied in the combination. The Neuron synthesizer also had an effects unit with EQ, delay, modulation, distortion, ring modulation, reverb and spectral warping effects, a digital filter with variable cutoff <b>frequency,</b> <b>resonance</b> and selectable characteristics, and assignable control wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{voices are}} based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3394 chip. This allows for one voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) per voice, with on/off toggles for any combination of sawtooth, triangle and variable pulse waveforms. There are coarse (up to 4 octaves) and fine (to just under a semitone) tuning parameters. A [...] "poly mod" [...] parameter allows the audio output of one voice to feed another's voltage-controlled filter (VCF) when they are layered in [...] "double" [...] mode. This results in a sound with 4-voice polyphony with no audio from the second voice's oscillators, processed through two filters in series. The single low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is free-running (i.e. doesn't restart when a key is depressed), with programmable rate (0.25 to 20 Hz according to the manual), and has programmable depth and waveform (triangle or square). This can modulate any combination of filter cutoff frequency, pitch, or oscillator pulse-width. There is a chorus with fixed rate and frequency. Filter cutoff <b>frequency,</b> <b>resonance</b> (to self-oscillation), keyboard tracking (off, half or full) and envelope amount can be programmed, but the envelope cannot be inverted. The two ADSR envelopes modulate the VCA and the 24 dB/octave VCF. The rate for the polyphonic portamento is programmable. [...] "Unison" [...] (monophonic mode) can be programmed for each patch. In this mode, the envelopes are re-triggered only after all keys are released ("legato", with low-note priority), and a delay of four oscillators relative to the other four can be programmed (fixed at 20, 40 or 80 milliseconds). A program can be [...] "linked" [...] to another so that both are called up and assigned correctly in a split or layer. There is also a programmable output level for each patch to help balance loud and soft sounds.|$|E
