500|$|In 1951, the Canadian Department of Trade and Commerce {{issued an}} order for two prototypes and a static test airframe, under the CF-103 project designation. Jigs, tools and {{detailed}} engineering drawings were in place by June 1951, with wind tunnel testing, conducted at Cornell University, completed by November 1951. Although a wooden mock-up of the CF-103 was built, along with a separate cockpit area and engine section that was partially framed in, the mock-up did not feature an undercarriage unit nor any interior fittings. Two different tail designs were fitted with the initial effort only having a swept {{leading edge of the}} tail, while the definitive version had a much more raked appearance. The engineering and <b>installation</b> <b>requirements</b> for the CF-103's proposed Orenda 17 jet engines were not finalized, as the experimental [...] "hybrid" [...] using an Orenda 8 compressor unit and Orenda 11 two-stage turbine, matched to a [...] "reheat" [...] unit, had not been fully developed.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, US {{curbside}} mailboxes {{are classified}} as (T) Traditional, (C) Contemporary, or (L) Locking. Traditional or Contemporary non-locking curbside mailboxes are approved in three sizes - No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, measured by minimum interior dimensions. The largest acceptable curbside mailbox is the No. 3, which measures 22.81inches long, 11inches wide, and 15inches in height (58cm x 28cm x 38cm) at the peak. Locking mailbox designs that provide security for the recipient's incoming mail have fewer restrictions on shape and size, though designs with a slot for incoming mail {{must be at least}} 1.75inches high by 10inches wide. Residential locking mailboxes cannot require the postal carrier to have a key, by USPS Specifications. [...] Therefore, no USPS approved residential locking mailbox has secure outgoing mail. <b>Installation</b> <b>requirements</b> vary from standard unlocked mailboxes: with locking mailboxes, the incoming mail slot must be 41"-45" [...] above the roadside surface, and the front of the mailbox must be 6"-8" [...] back from the curb. [...] USPS specifications for all mailboxes mandate the same, except the placement of the 'incoming mail area' varies with a locking mailbox.|$|E

40|$|Tamacola is a dynamic, {{self-sustaining}} meta-language system grounded {{upon the}} Tamarin VM. 1 Tamacola compiles a Scheme-like S-expression language into ActionScript bytecodes, and con-tains meta-linguistic features, {{such as a}} PEG parser generator and macro system, which make it useful for defining new languages. In fact, Tamacola is written in itself, using its meta-linguistic features. Since the Tamarin VM can load ActionScript bytecode files to extend and replace running programs, Tamacola can extend itself and define new languages while it is running. Furthermore, since the Tamarin VM {{is part of the}} ubiquitous Adobe Flash player, this self-modification can be accomplished while running in a web browser, with no extra <b>installation</b> <b>requirement.</b> Objects in Tamacola are intimately tied to their ActionScript counterparts, providing good interoperability between Tamacola and the Flash Player. To show that the system is ready for practical use, we used Tamacola to implement both an interactive program-ming environment (“Workspace”) and a simple particle language...|$|R

Starting from the mission specification, requirements and mission profile, weights estimation and design match point analysis have been performed. From this preliminary work the needed values of wing-loading and power-to-weight ratio have been identified and the required wing area and engine power have been estimated. The global configuration has been chosen {{taking into account the}} payload and the rear engine <b>installation</b> <b>requirement.</b> A wing section optimization was performed trying to maximize the endurance parameter CL 3 / 2 /CD with a limited increase of the pitching moment coefficient since high value of airfoil pitching moment leads to high tail loads to balance the aircraft with consequent high trim drag and loss of efficiency. A complete analysis of global aircraft performances has been performed and the effect of moment coefficient on global aircraft drag and endurance has been evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Accidents {{on roads}} {{are one of}} the main causes of human loss and damages to {{property}} every day and anywhere that vehicles travel. Communications-based approaches to reducing highway accidents include vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) communications. However, while V 2 V and V 2 I are promising approaches for reducing accidents, they require installation of new sensors in vehicles and the information they can produce is limited. In this paper, we present the navigation-to-navigation (Nav 2 Nav) approach for reducing accidents on roads which is different from V 2 V and V 2 I from several perspectives including: (a) the widespread availability and use of navigation systems with no <b>installation</b> <b>requirement,</b> (b) the familiarity and acceptance of navigation systems by many people around the word, (c) the availability of map databases in navigation systems which facilitates map matching (the process of finding the correct segment of road as opposed to raw positioning data) and prediction in navigation, and (d) the availability of routes requested by drivers. © 2010 ICST...|$|R

30|$|Web-based applications, however, are {{essential}} for the remote live monitoring if the monitoring {{is expected to be}} done through any web-enabled devices. The major limitation for desktop applications built for real-time monitoring is that the applications have to be installed on a computer before using them. The <b>installation</b> <b>requirement</b> violates the concept of remote real-time monitoring, and restricts the availability and flexibility of remote monitoring through web-enabled devices. For example, remote monitoring may not be done through a hotel computer if the applications for monitoring cannot be installed. In contrast, web-based applications are installed on a remote server and accessible through a web browser. Because a web browser is a standard application for almost all web-enabled devices, it offers an ideal solution for the application accessibility problem. In addition, if data analysis is computational intensive, desktop applications may not be run efficiently if they are installed on a local device. In contrast, the efficiency of web-based applications is not affected by computational capacity of the local device as they are installed and run on cloud virtual machines. Although cloud virtual machines provide on-demand computing resources, the speed and efficiency of web applications may be further improved using emerging lightweight solutions, such as docker and kubernetes.|$|R
