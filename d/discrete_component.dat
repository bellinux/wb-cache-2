25|$|Small {{compasses}} {{found in}} clocks, mobile phones, and other electronic devices are solid-state microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) compasses, usually {{built out of}} two or three magnetic field sensors that provide data for a microprocessor. Often, the device is a <b>discrete</b> <b>component</b> which outputs either a digital or analog signal proportional to its orientation. This signal is interpreted by a controller or microprocessor and either used internally, or sent to a display unit. The sensor uses highly calibrated internal electronics to measure the response of the device to the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

50|$|The Model 200 uses <b>discrete</b> <b>components</b> to {{implement}} the memory subsystem logic. In the Model 240, these <b>discrete</b> <b>components</b> are replaced by three ASICs, the MB ASIC, the MT ASIC and the MS ASIC. The MB (Memory Buffer) ASIC serves as an interface between the 40 MHz CPU module domain and the 25 MHz system module domain. It {{is connected to the}} MT ASIC, which serves as the memory controller. The MT ASIC provides memory control and refresh, handles memory DMA and transactions, and ECC checking. The MS (Memory Strobe) ASIC provides 15 sets of memory control lines and routes memory control signals from the MT ASIC to the destination SIMM. The MS ASIC replaces 16 <b>discrete</b> <b>components</b> used in the Model 200 and also generates the 25 MHz system clock signal, replacing a further three <b>discrete</b> <b>components</b> used in the Model 200.|$|R

500|$|The {{method of}} {{coupling}} between non-adjacent resonators {{is not limited}} to mechanical filters. [...] It can be applied to other filter formats and the general term for this class is cross-coupled filter. For instance, channels can be cut between cavity resonators, mutual inductance can be used with <b>discrete</b> <b>component</b> filters, and feedback paths can be used with active analogue or digital filters. [...] Nor was the method first discovered in the field of mechanical filters; the earliest description is in a 1948 patent for filters using microwave cavity resonators. [...] However, mechanical filter designers were the first (1960s) to develop practical filters of this kind and the method became a particular feature of mechanical filters.|$|E
2500|$|... "Resonance" [...] is {{a central}} {{operative}} principle of the cosmos as conceived by the Huainanzi. The phrase itself means [...] "stimulus" [...] (gan 感) and [...] "response" [...] (ying 應), which is how we have translated it when the Huainanzi refers specifically to the <b>discrete</b> <b>component</b> processes that the term denotes. Fundamentally, [...] "resonance" [...] {{is a process of}} dynamic interaction that transcends the limits of time, space, and ordinary linear causality. Through the mechanism of resonance, an event in one location (the [...] "stimulus") produces simultaneous effects in another location (the [...] "response"), even though the two phenomena have no direct spatial or mechanical contact. They may indeed be separated by vast gulfs of space. For example, connections between celestial events (eclipses, planetary motions) and events in the human community were understood as examples of [...] "resonance." [...] For the authors of the Huainanzi, such connections were not coincidence or mere correspondence but dynamic influences exchanged through the energetic medium of qi. All phenomena are both composed of and impelled by qi, and since all currently differentiated qi emerged from an originally undifferentiated Grand One, all qi remains mutually resonantly linked. The pathways of resonance are not random, however. Objects are most sensitive to resonant influences emanating from other objects that share the same constituent form of qi.
