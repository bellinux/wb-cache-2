40|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the role of selenium and vitamin E in metabolic processes of living organisms, {{the effect of these}} oxidants on slaughter value and carcass quality of commercial goose was investigated. The experiment was carried out on 200 one-day-old White Koluda geese that were randomly divided into two groups: 50 males and 50 females each. From first day until 13 th wk of age the control group was maintained on commercial basic feeds, the experimental group received feed enriched with organic selenium (0. 3 mg kg- 1) and vitamin E (100 mg kg- 1). Later on, for three wks all birds were feed with oat grain and cereals ground. At 112 day of live all birds were weighted individually and from each group 20 birds (10 males and 10 females) were chosen randomly, slaughtered and after 24 hours chilling at + 4 °C the following parameter were evaluated (in grams, exact to 0. 1 g and % in relation to live body weight and <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> with neck) : <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> with neck, neck without skin, wings with skin, breast and leg muscles, edible giblets (heart, liver, gizzard), skin with subcutaneous fat, abdomen fat and remainder of carcass. Feed supplementation with tested antioxidants had non-significant (P≥ 0. 05) effect on evaluated female traits, but significantly increased (P≤ 0. 05) the male live body weight and <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> with neck.

Birds were eviscerated and carcass cuts and non-edible offal components were determined according to the procedure described by Kekeocha (1985). Dressed weight was measured after the removal of blood and feather and the dressing percentage was calculated as the proportion of dressed carcass weight to slaughter weight. <b>Eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> weight was determined after removing blood, feather, shank, head, kidney, lungs, pancreas, crop, proventriculus, small intestine, large intestine, caeca and urogenital tracts. The eviscerated percentage was determined as the proportion of slaughter weight. From <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> weight drumstick, thigh, breast meat, heart, gizzard and liver were separated, weighed and calculated as a percentage of slaughter weight.

40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{hundred and}} fifty-five geese from four strains (Chinese, Hungarian, Pilgrim, and Synthetic) were {{slaughtered}} at 173, 180, and 194 days of age. One {{hundred and twenty}} of the <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcasses</b> (5 males and 5 females from each strain and slaughter group) were divided into legs, breast, back, and wings. The proximate composition was determined on 72 carcasses (3 males and 3 females from each strain and slaughter group).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare growth performance and carcass characteristics of exotic meat strains and indigenous chicken ecotypes under hot climate. A total of 105 Hybro, 105 Hubbard, 102 Bare- neck, 129 Large Baladi and 75 Betwil one old day chicks obtained from three consecutive hatches, were reared under CRD up to 8 week of age. Body weight feed intake and mortality were recorded at weekly intervals. <b>Eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> weights, carcass dressing percentage and carcass cuts as percentages of <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> were also recorded. Chemical compositions and taste panel were conducted to evaluate the meat quality. The results showed significant differences (P< 0. 01) for growth rate and carcass traits between the exotic meat strains and native chicken ecotypes from hatch up to 8 th weeks of age. A significant difference (P< 0. 01) was also found within the exotic meat strains (Hybro and Hubbard) with Hybro being heavier at 3, 4, 5 and 7 weeks of ages whereas the Hubbard was heavier than Hybro at hatch. On the other hand significant differences (P< 0. 01) were found among native chicken ecotypes with Bare- neck being heavier than Large Baladi and Betwil native chicken ecotypes from hatch up to 8 weeks of age. Feed intake and feed conversion ratio were found to be significantly different (P< 0. 01) between the exotic meat strains and native chicken ecotypes with the exotic strains consumed amount of feed three times that consumed by the native chicken ecotypes.

DEB treatments were prepared {{by the addition of}} NH 4 Cl, NaHCO 3, KHCO 3 and NaHCO 3 plus KHCO 3 to the basal diet, respectively. High Ca diet reduced WG, FI, plasma potassium, <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> weight and increased FCR and plasma Ca. Altering DEB of 250 by 50 mEq kg - 1 influenced WG and FI of chickens without altering FCR, plasma total Ca and electrolytes and carcass composition.

The predominant serotype isolated from meat and environment usually changed from visit to visit. Salmonella sandiego and Salmonella anatum were the most frequent among 23 serotypes recovered. Most of the isolated serotypes are commonly associated with turkeys and have been incriminated as causative agents of human salmonellosis.

This hypothesis is based on published studies showing elevated blood lead concentrations in subsistence hunter populations, retention of ammunition residues in the tissues of hunter-killed animals, and systemic, cognitive, and behavioral disorders associated with human lead body burdens once considered safe. Our objective {{was to determine the}} incidence and bioavailability of lead bullet fragments in hunter-killed venison, a widely-eaten food among hunters and their families. We radiographed 30 <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcasses</b> of White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) shot by hunters with standard lead-core, copper-jacketed bullets under normal hunting conditions. All carcasses showed metal fragments (geometric mean = 136 fragments, range = 15 – 409) and widespread fragment dispersion. We took each carcass to a separate meat processor and fluoroscopically scanned the resulting meat packages; fluoroscopy revealed metal fragments in the ground meat packages of 24 (80 %) of the 30 deer; 32 % of 234 ground meat packages contained at least one fragment. Fragments were identified as lead by ICP in 93 % of 27 samples. Isotope ratios of lead in meat matched the ratios of bullets, and differed from background lead in bone. We fed fragment-containing venison to four pigs to test bioavailability; four controls received venison without fragments from the same deer. Mean blood lead concentrations in pigs peaked at 2. 29 µg/dL (maximum 3. 8 µg/dL) 2 days following ingestion of fragment-containing venison, significantly higher than the 0. 63 µg/dL averaged by controls. We conclude that people risk exposure to bioavailable lead from bullet fragments when they eat venison from deer killed with standard lead-based rifle bullets and processed under normal procedures. At risk in the U. S. are some ten million hunters, their families, and low-income beneficiaries of venison donations...|$|R

2500|$|Feces tend to leak {{from the}} carcass until the {{evisceration}} stage, and the evisceration stage itself gives {{an opportunity for}} the interior of the carcass to receive intestinal bacteria. (The skin of the carcass does as well, but the skin presents a better barrier to bacteria and reaches higher temperatures during cooking.) Before 1950, this was contained largely by not <b>eviscerating</b> the <b>carcass</b> at the time of butchering, deferring this until the time of retail sale or in the home. This gave the intestinal bacteria less opportunity to colonize the edible meat. The development of the [...] "ready-to-cook broiler" [...] in the 1950s added convenience while introducing risk, under the assumption that end-to-end refrigeration and thorough cooking would provide adequate protection. E. coli can be killed by proper cooking times, but there is still some risk associated with it, and its near-ubiquity in commercially farmed chicken is troubling to some.

40|$|Partially-eviscerated (also {{described}} as effilé, effileé, roped, partly eviscerated, partially drawn, wire drawn or Boston drawn) poultry {{are produced by}} removing the intestines from the poultry carcass but leaving the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard inside the body cavity (as defined in Regulation (EC) 543 / 2008). Regulation (EC) 853 / 2004 allows production of partially-eviscerated poultry, provided it is authorised by the competent authority. The overall aim of this project was {{to carry out a}} risk assessment of partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry production (poultry with the heart, liver, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard left inside the body cavity) with a view to considering whether the risks of partially-eviscerated poultry production can be managed to an acceptable level such that the practice could be authorised in the UK. To achieve this aim the project had four Objectives: Objective 1, an initial risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain together with a review of all relevant and appropriate literature/company information relating to the control of partially-eviscerated poultry production; Objective 2, an industrial survey of current production of partially-eviscerated poultry; Objective 3, a series of short practical evaluations of any processes where further data was required; Objective 4, a full analysis of all the data and findings of Objectives 1 to 3 and the production of the final project report. The literature review found that documentation on the production of partially-eviscerated poultry was scarce and not comprehensive. However, it highlighted the important points for risk assessment and identified a reason for the development of partial-evisceration processing, i. e. the prevention of “greening” during storage due to the removal of the intestines. The review of current post-mortem inspection of poultry concluded that of the twenty one conditions that are currently looked for during post-mortem inspection of poultry, the majority of these conditions do not pose a risk to public health. Seven conditions were considered to be of concern to public health (Ascites/oedema, Cellulitis, Contamination, Hepatitis, Pericarditis, Perihepatitis/peritonitis, Respiratory disease (airsacculitis)). It was concluded that only four of those seven conditions (hepatitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis/peritonitis, and respiratory disease (air sacculitis)) may not be identified during post-mortem inspection of partially-eviscerated poultry. Their public health significance was considered to be as indicators of the presence of enteric microbial pathogens rather than any inherent pathology of the conditions. Data on condemnations show that the rates of condemnations for these conditions are very low. In addition, these conditions should be clearly identifiable by the end user of the poultry during preparation of the carcass for cooking. Therefore, in our opinion, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumer would ingest such infected viscera. Four French plants and two UK plants were visited during the industrial survey. Although there was a commonality in the practices employed at all of the plants, differences were found between the plants, particularly in the specific method used to remove the intestines from the carcasses in order to produce the product. Four main methods have been identified that can be used to partially eviscerate poultry, three are manual, one is mechanical. The only UK plant currently producing partially-eviscerated poultry, skinned the whole carcass with its feathers on. Partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry report 3 of 166 Due to the lack of data on the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated poultry a series of short targeted experimental evaluations were carried out to: (1) investigate the difference in chilling time between partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses; (2) investigate any difference between the growth of microorganisms on partially-eviscerated and <b>eviscerated</b> broiler <b>carcasses</b> during chilled storage; (3) investigate the growth of microorganisms in the organs of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage. These studies showed: (1) due to the presence of warm internal organs partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses are warmer than <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcasses</b> at the start of chilling and the rate of cooling of partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses is slower than that of similar eviscerated carcasses; (2) there was no significant difference between the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated and <b>eviscerated</b> broiler <b>carcasses</b> after chilling and during chilled storage; (3) ACC, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, coliform and Escherichia coli counts were all shown to be capable of increasing in/on the heart, crop, feet, gizzard, cavity, skin and liver of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage. A critical review of all available relevant and appropriate literature and data was carried out, supplemented by a survey of current industrial practice and a practical evaluation of processes, to form a risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain. This risk assessment considered: 1. What abnormalities may not be identified in partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 2. Whether the risk of zoonotic pathogens are any greater for partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 3. The aetiology of those conditions; 4.

After 60 days in feedlot, measurements of body length, thoracic perimeter, height at the anterior and rump height were taken. The lambs were slaughtered, skinned and <b>eviscerated.</b> <b>Carcass</b> were weighed hot and chilled at 2 ºC during 24 h. Cooling losses, hot carcass weight, cold carcass weight, hot carcass yield, cold carcass yield, half carcass weight, fat thickness, final weight, slaughter weight, empty body weight, thorax depth, croup width, perimeter of the croup, carcass length, internal carcass length, hindlimb length, hindlimb width and hindlimb conformation score were evaluated. Only hindlimb width was inversely correlated to adding macaúba cake in the diet. Macaúba cake can be included in diets for lamb in feedlot up to 300 g/kg without affecting body measurements in vivo or carcass characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Myostatin is a {{negative}} regulator of skeletal muscle growth. We evaluated effects of myostatin polymorphisms in three elite commercial broiler chicken lines on mortality, growth, feed conversion efficiency, ultrasound breast depth, breast percentage, <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> weight, leg defects, blood oxygen level, and hen antibody titer to infectious bursal disease virus vaccine. Progeny mean data adjusted for fixed and mate effects and DNA from 100 sires per line were used. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the myostatin gene segregating in these lines were identified by designing specific primers, amplifying individual DNA in each line by polymerase chain reaction, cloning, sequencing and aligning the corresponding products. Individual sires were genotyped for five identified SNPs which contributed to eight haplotypes. Frequencies of SNP alleles and haplotypes differed between lines. Using the allele substitution effect model, the myostatin SNPs {{were found to have}} significant (P < 0. 031) associations with growth, mortality, blood oxygen and hen antibody titer to infectious bursal disease virus vaccine, although the associations were not often consistent across lines. These results suggest that the myostatin gene has pleiotropic effects on broiler performance. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to rank {{commercial}} broiler chicken breeds vis-à-vis their sexes based on their carcass evaluation at 56 days of age. The strains were Marshall, Arbor Acre and Hubbard, and the traits considered were live weight, dressing weight and percent, <b>eviscerated</b> weight, <b>carcass</b> weight and percent, breast muscle, back muscle, thigh, drumstick, head, neck, wing and leg weights. Other traits measured were wing and leg lengths, edible giblets and abdominal fat. There was highly significant (P< 0. 01) strain x sex interaction effects on all the traits evaluated with the exception of leg length, liver, gizzard and abdominal fat. Males and females of Marshall broilers recorded superior and higher (P< 0. 01) mean values in almost all the traits than the sexes of the other two strains. The obtained results indicate that most carcass traits are breed and sex dependent. In addition, the result showed that both sexes of Marshall broilers produced greater chicken proportions than Arbor Acre and Hubbard broilers. Therefore, important interventions to increase animal proteins consumption in this country, both sexes of Marshall broilers could be raised, and also for maximum profit for stockholders and processing industries...|$|R
40|$|The genus Campylobacter is {{of great}} {{importance}} to public health because it includes several species that may cause diarrhea.

40|$|MOST present-day rations for grow-ing chicks now contain DL-methio-nine as a {{supplement}} to the amino acids in the feed ingredients. This additional amino acid is used because growing rations are usually high in soybean oil meal with the ration subsequently being low in me-thionine. Although it is added for its stim-ulation of growth the authors felt that the dietary methionine might increase the methionine and cystine in the carcass thus providing a more nutritious food product. This study was designed to study the effects of age and dietary me-thionine on the methionine and cystine in the poultry meat. MATERIALS AND METHODS Day-old broiler-type male chicks were assigned to battery pens at random, banded, and vaccinated for Newcastle disease immediately and for bronchitis after three days. To the basal ration (Table 1), 0 %,. 05 % and. 5 % DL-methio-nine were added. Each ration was repli-cated twice by pens and each pen con-tained 50 chicks.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} select {{representative}} traits from phenotypic variability between broiler chicken grandparent lines using cluster analysis. Chicks from four dam lines and two sire lines of broiler grandparents were housed to assess performance traits (body weight, <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> yield, breast yield and leg yield) and morphometric traits (back and leg feathering), which {{were used to}} calculate the Mahalanobis ’ distance, between chicken line pairwise. Phenograms were obtained based on those distances using UPGMA method in cluster analysis. The smallest relative contribution of traits for divergence between chicken lines was assessed to eliminate them. Body weight at 35 days, all carcass traits and back feathering at 28 days were the most representative traits to explain phenotypic variability between chicken lines. From observed clusters and the largest heterogeneity between chicken lines from different clusters, crosses between sire lines SL 1 and SL 2 with dam lines DL 3 and DL 4 might result in strain combinations with the largest heterosis. Cluster analysis on performance and morphometric traits is suitable to study phenotypic variability between broiler chicken grandparent lines. We suggest analyzing data from poultry breeding using cluster analysis. Key words: Feathering, selection index, multivariate analysis, phenotypic variabilit...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of long-term feeding of a beta agonist (cimaterol) on female Japanese quail. Quail used were from lines selected for high (HD) and low (LD) body density from a randombred population. Dietary treatments consisted of 1) the basal feed, 2) the basal feed containing. 5 ppm, or 3) 1. 0 ppm of the beta agonist. The treatment period for the six experimental groups extended from 14 to 94 days of age. Weight gains to 49 days and live weights at 94 days of age were greater (P<. 05) in the cimaterol-fed groups. Age and live weight at first egg in both lines were greater (P<. 01) when groups were fed treated diets. <b>Eviscerated</b> <b>carcass</b> yields were higher (P<. 01) and carcass moisture was lower (P<. 05) in treated groups. There were no differences in carcass fat or protein among the dietary treatments. Abdominal fat pad weights were larger (P<. 05) in the heavier (P<. 01) HD line but were not significantly affected by cimaterol. Abdominal adipocyte diameters were significantly larger in HD (P<. 05) and cimaterol-treated (P<. 05) quail. (Key words: quail, beta agonist, fat, body density, adipocyte...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT When <b>eviscerated</b> turkey <b>carcasses</b> are {{illuminated}} {{with white}} {{light from a}} 100 W lamp in the body cavity dorsal to the sternum, about 90 % of carcasses with deep pectoral my-opathy can be detected subjectively. With this method, subjective detection is more reliable than photometric detection. When a fiber-optic probe is placed {{in direct contact with}} a lesion, the absorbance spectrum of reflected light is radically different to the spectrum from normal muscle, and three types of lesions can be identified (red-purple, green, and yellow). However, the presence of lesions is masked by even a shallow depth (approximately 1 cm) of normal muscle between the lesion and the probe. A combination of both optical methods might enable carcasses to be inspected without slashing the breast muscles of all the carcasses from flocks of suspect birds, but the whole length of the supracoracoideus on each side would have to be traversed by the fiber-optic probe. For a fiber-optic detection system in the abattoir, the simplest diagnostic charac-teristic would be the ratio of two wavelengths (480 / 550 nm). The average ratio for normal muscle was. 68. The average ratios for lesions were from 1. 17 to 1. 38. (Key words: turkeys, myopathy, green muscle, fiber optics...|$|R
40|$|In {{the aquatic}} ecosystem, mesozooplankton {{are the major}} {{secondary}} producers, which graze on phytoplankton and in turn are preyed on by carnivorous invertebrates such as jellyfish and planktivorous fish. Zooplankton are the main prey of two forage fish species, Menidia menidia (Atlantic silverside) and Menidia beryllina (inland silverside), in the Upper Pettaquamscutt River Estuary (UPR) and the Upper Point Judith Pond (UPJP), Rhode Island, USA. The zooplankton communities in the UPR and UPJP were previously shown to be quite different, especially in spring when these two species ripen for spawning. The zooplankton community at UPR is dominated by calanoid copepods, suggesting a rather clean environment, whereas that at UPJP is dominated by polychaete larvae, suggesting a somewhat degraded environment. The purpose {{of this research was}} {{to determine the effects of}} habitat quality, as expressed in the nutritional quality of the zooplankton, on the maternal provisioning for spawning and egg and larval quality. ^ I measured the proximate composition and essential fatty acids in the zooplankton, adult Menidia spp. <b>eviscerated</b> <b>carcasses</b> and their eggs to trace the biochemical compositions from prey to parent to offspring. I monitored weights of gonadal and somatic tissues and calculated the fraction of the caloric energy from the zooplankton that goes into the gonadal, liver and carcass tissues by measuring daily zooplankton caloric content consumption, and the caloric content of the tissues. Finally, I measured diameters of individual spawned eggs, percentage of eggs that hatched, total lengths of larvae at hatching and percentage of larvae that survived after 7 days. ^ This study was carried out in the springs of 2005, 2006 and 2007. In spring 2005 in UPJP, an unusually low abundance of Menidia spp. and high abundance of Cyanea capillata (lion 2 ̆ 7 s mane jellyfish) were recorded and appeared to be related, so only UPR data on Menidia spp. were available for that year. In 2006 and 2007, both UPR and UPJP had abundant Menidia spp., and in UPJP C. capillata abundance was low to non-existent. Zooplankton taxonomic composition in 2005, 2006 and 2007 in UPR was dominated by crustaceans and UPJP by polychaetes, as was previously seen in other studies. For proximate composition, significant differences were observed in lipid (but not protein or ash) content a) for zooplankton between estuaries, b) between Menidia spp., and c) between estuaries for each species. Significant differences were further observed in content of the total omega- 3, omega- 6 and omega- 9 fatty acids for zooplankton and for M. menidia gonads between estuaries. Based on laboratory experiments, the absorption efficiency of M. menidia and M. beryllina from UPR and UPJP ranged from 90 to 93...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effect of marination on marinade uptake of chicken carcasses and to determine the meat quality of carcass parts. In total, 45 <b>eviscerated</b> chicken <b>carcasses</b> were divided into three marinating treatments: no marination, marination in water, marination in non-phosphate and low-salt solution (NPLS). The study showed that the marinade uptake of chicken carcasses was higher than 4. 0 % for NPLS marination and than 3. 5 % for water marination when compared with the non-marinated treatment. However, raw chicken meat yield after cut-up was not significantly different (p≥ 0. 05) among treatments. Carcasses marinated in NPLS solution presented higher water-holding capacity (WHC). The results showed that NPLS marination may reduce cooking loss and expressible water of chicken meat after cooking. Based on the Warner-Bratzler Shear (WBSF) results, NPLS marination had a stronger effect on textural quality of cooked breast meat than thighs and drumsticks. However, no significant differences of texture profile analysis (TPA) parameters were observed (p≥ 0. 05). In the sensory evaluation, NPLS marination influenced the sensory quality of cooked meat, particularly texture and appearance attributes, but not the taste and aftertaste attributes of cooked meat. It is concluded that NPLS marination effectively increased carcass weight, despite its effects on meat quality varied according to the anatomical location of the parts...|$|R
