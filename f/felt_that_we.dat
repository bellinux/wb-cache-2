5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|A large {{aspect of}} the game is the {{alternative}} history in which it is set, where the Nazis won the Second World War. The team saw this aspect as an opportunity to create everything at a very large scale, with very little limitations; [...] "so many things that we can create, and work with, and expand on. So, I never really <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were limited," [...] said Öjerfors.|$|E
60|$|But that didn't {{discourage}} us. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{should get}} it clean in time.|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> {{could do}} a 400 cc bike that was 18 percent lighter, {{we should be able}} to do the same with a 750", recalls Mr. Yokouchi.|$|R
60|$|Tramping silently {{over the}} parched grass, I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> talked, we must infallibly disagree; his straight-up, narrow {{forehead}} so suggested a nature divided within itself into compartments of iron.|$|R
500|$|Life {{acknowledged}} {{there were}} exceptions, such as The Defenders with E.G. Marshall and Robert Reed as socially conscious attorneys, and quoted Aubrey's defense {{to charges of}} pandering to the public. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had an obligation to}} reach the vast majority of most of the people," [...] he said. [...] "We made an effort to continue purposeful drama on TV, but we found out that people just don't want an anthology. They would rather tune in on Lucy." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2007 Danough {{left the}} band. [...] "We <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had grown apart {{and it was}} time for both parties to move on", the band wrote in a statement. After his {{departure}} he wrote on his MySpace blog: [...] "..Just know that when this all comes out don't think you've seen the last of Scott. I'm on to the next chapter very soon and I'm excited to see what the future brings." [...] After Danough's departure he was quickly replaced by Jona Weinhofen of Australian band I Killed The Prom Queen – one of several factors that led that band to split up.|$|E
500|$|Lucinda Dalton was {{the fourth}} wife of Charles Wakeman Dalton, and {{they were married in}} 1868. Lucinda resented the {{expectation}} that she be meek and obedient in her marriage. Charles assured her that husbands have obligations to their wives as wives do to their husbands. She {{came to the conclusion that}} she should marry Charles because of a spiritual witness they experienced together: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were in the presence of the hosts of heaven; and a direct incontrovertible testimony was given me that it was the will of God and not my will that I should accept this man for my yokefellow." ...|$|E
60|$|Somehow, <b>we,</b> too, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if the Story Girl did {{not approve}} of us it made little {{difference}} who else did or did not.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can make}} sure they shall never hear of it," [...] {{returned}} Richard, as, after more urging, he took the coin. [...] "I can understand how desperate you <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> morning <b>we</b> met at the newspaper office, and we'll let the whole matter drop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} nothing for him; I can do nothing for him. I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> when <b>we</b> {{were trying to get}} him into parliament. If he could marry, and be independent, and powerful, and rich, it would be better, perhaps, for all of us." ...|$|R
500|$|Daniel Hales, {{brother of}} the organisation's {{worldwide}} leader Bruce Hales, described the book {{as part of a}} trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members. He said such criticism showed it is [...] "open season to kill us". [...] "We're happy to live our lives in anonymity, just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low-key way. We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then we <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> really had to put our point of view. We felt that it wasn't fair to our members," [...] said Daniel Hales to The West Australian.|$|E
500|$|Nixon and Broderick also crafted the {{character}} as a darkly brooding and mysterious {{man in the}} same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, Edward Rochester from Jane Eyre, and Maxim de Winter from Rebecca. Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because, as she told Soap Opera Weekly, [...] "In doing the 'stolen life' story, I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed something to follow that was also a little larger than life, very romantic, and gothic." [...] The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines. Maxim de Winter's estate, Manderley, provided the inspiration for Dimitri's Pine Valley estate, Wildwind. The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier's book and the depiction from the film Rebecca, a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mr. Rochester, the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the war, No.82 Squadron was {{selected}} to join the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. It re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters between 12September and 11January 1946, losing two aircraft to accidents in the process. The squadron deployed to Bofu, a former kamikaze base, during 13–18March 1946, once again as part of No.81 Wing with Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons; Nos.381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and maintenance support, respectively. No.82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs, along with an escorting deHavilland Mosquito, in bad weather en route to Bofu, killing all crew members. From April 1946, the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts. The Australians found that, far from offering resistance, the Japanese went out of their way to be accommodating. No.82 Squadron's [...] commanding officer, Squadron Leader Graham Falconer, remarked following a dinner with Bofu's mayor, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were being treated more as visitors than as an occupying force!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He hasn't a {{doubt of}} it," [...] I went on diplomatically. [...] "But we felt--and I <b>felt</b> personally, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to be}} in touch with you, to work along with you, to keep {{informed}} how things are going in the city." ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 1824, Airy met Richarda Smith (1804–1875), [...] "a great beauty", on {{a walking}} tour of Derbyshire. He later wrote, [...] "Our eyes met ... and my fate was sealed ... I <b>felt</b> irresistibly <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must be united," [...] and Airy {{proposed}} two days later. Richarda's father, the Revd Richard Smith, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Airy lacked {{the financial resources}} to marry his daughter. Only in 1830, with Airy established in his Cambridge position, was permission for the marriage granted.|$|R
60|$|Felix and I shivered. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> {{suddenly}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had escaped}} a dreadful danger--the danger {{of having been}} born somebody else. But it took the Story Girl to make us realize just how dreadful it was and what a terrible risk we had run years before we, or our parents either, had existed.|$|R
500|$|Valo has {{appeared}} in a few select films and TV series over his career, aside from talk show and performance appearances. Valo's first acting job came in 1998, when he {{played the role of}} [...] "Lippumies" [...] in the Ilppo Pohjola directed short film Asphalto. Valo has often collaborated with skateboarder and Jackass member Bam Margera, appearing in his films CKY 3, , 411 Productions Presents: 61: The Bam Issue, Jackass Number Two, and , as well as the TV series Viva La Bam. Margera has also used much of HIM's music and the heartagram in his various projects, as well as directed four music videos for the band. In 2008, Valo voiced the character [...] "Moto Moto" [...] in the Finnish dub of [...] When asked about the possibility of becoming an actor, Valo responded by saying [...] "I've had offers in the past. Nothing too big, nothing too interesting. But I'm not an actor. I've always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> need to sell about 80 million copies more for me to become an actor, a painter, an opera singer or a TV personality." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{party were}} further slowed {{down by the}} {{frostbite}} in Oates' left foot - daily marches were now down to less than five miles, which was insufficient {{given the lack of}} oil. Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, who [...] "now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless", voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of AOL TV {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{linchpin}} {{of the hour}} was Brittany's belief in Santa Claus." [...] The New York Post Jarett Wieselman called it [...] "adorably realized by actress Heather Morris", and Canning said she [...] "perfectly played up Brittany's innocence and joy surrounding everything Santa". Brown was less enthusiastic, and wrote that she was tiring of the [...] "look how dumb yet kind-hearted Brittany is" [...] plots. Keller approved of the Artie and Brittany coupling, {{and said it was}} [...] "way more fun to watch than Rachel and Finn and all their angst", and Canning felt that the episode's heart was Artie working to keep Brittany from becoming disillusioned about Santa. He also wrote, [...] "shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] Burns agreed: [...] "Coach Bieste's performance as the Santa Claus bearer of harsh reality was quite moving. It's nice to see her get to show her acting chops and refreshing to see her character's vulnerability." [...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of the}} absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] However, he was disappointed by how the storyline played out: [...] "it didn't feel right that after the story the episode built around Brittany, it then <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed to see Artie on his feet for it to be a truly happy ending." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No more do I," [...] Tom Jackson replied. [...] "I <b>felt</b> {{quite sure}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going right at first, but somehow I don't think so now." ...|$|R
5000|$|The UK {{underground}} didn’t {{really have}} any focus or any point from which you could get underground music, nothing that really pulled all that stuff together. I wanted to combine the music I like {{from around the world}} with some of the UK underground stuff ... it <b>felt</b> right <b>that</b> <b>we</b> became a part of that, to help disseminate it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since then we have, of course, {{heard nothing}} of you. Cacama {{said that he}} did not see you when he met Malinzin; but of course he did not examine the faces of the white soldiers, being {{occupied}} solely with their chief and the officers round him. But <b>we</b> all <b>felt</b> assured <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should hear from you, shortly.|$|R
500|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten, voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was really}} {{disappointed}} at get ting out", he said. [...] "I {{felt as if}} I'd let the team down with just four overs to go and I'd {{wanted to see it}} through. Allan and I were confident we could play through tomorrow. We certainly <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could save the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the council}} leader Nicholas Paget-Brown was interviewed on BBC's Newsnight, he was criticised for his remark that [...] "many {{residents}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{needed to get}} on with the installation of new hot water systems, new boilers and that trying to retrofit more would delay the building and that sprinklers aren't the answer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Universal Motown Records, Bell's label at the time, was {{hesitant}} to release an album {{that had no}} contribution from its musicians and producers, but Bell said it only took one song to convince them to release it. Bell also said: [...] ""I think having {{it any other way}} would feel false. I <b>felt</b> capable <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could get it done, and we did." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{call for}} me to sign a 180 form {{came from the same}} {{partisan}} operatives who were lying about my record on a daily basis on the Web and in the right-wing media. Even though the media was discrediting them, they continued to lie. I <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't kowtow to them and their attempts to drag their lies out.|$|R

2500|$|... {{at the age}} of 36, Abdel-Nasser <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could ignore Egyptian {{public opinion}} until we had reached our goals, but with the caution of a 53-year-old, I {{believed}} that we needed grassroots support for our policies, even if it meant postponing some of our goals. I differed with the younger officers on the means by which to reach our goals, never on the principles.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics {{reflect the}} concern felt by Strummer about world events with the {{reference}} to [...] "a nuclear error" [...] to the incident at Three Mile Island, which occurred earlier in 1979. Joe Strummer has said: [...] "We <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were struggling about to slip down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails. And {{there was no one}} there to help us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 25 March, {{awaiting}} {{death in}} his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell {{letter to his}} expedition treasurer Sir Edgar Speyer, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have overshot our mark.

6000|$|But Jacopo Ronchi and the {{two sons}} of Bartolomeo were sent out to {{discover}} what was going on. We could not think what had driven the council to their step; but we felt sure they must have good reasons for acting so courageously. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> also <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had lost all power, all hope. The wheel had turned, and now {{we were at the}} bottom. After several hours, Alessandro Moratini came back and said,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Captain Mallett. I {{thought of}} him when those fellows in the mosque were keeping such a heavy fire upon us as we were waiting {{to get into the}} Secunderbagh. It seemed to me that his chance of ever getting his money was not worth much. How the bullets did whizz about! I <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be all mown down before we could get under the shelter of the wall.|$|R
60|$|A deep but quiet sigh followed, and {{the pipes}} were resumed in silent resignation. And, I must add, I <b>felt</b> devoutly thankful <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not sell fire-water, when I {{looked at the}} strong {{features}} and powerful frames of the red-men around me.|$|R
