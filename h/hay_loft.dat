5|$|East Worldham House, a Grade II listed building, {{dates to}} the late 18th and early 19th century. The two-storey house is made with ashlar walls, flat arches and stone cills. The {{entrance}} {{is located on the}} west side and features a Tuscan porch in the centre, with 5 windows, one of them large. The interior of the house contains Regency features, with a staircase, panelled doors in architraves, and several fireplaces. The coach house, 5 metres {{to the north of the}} house is also a listed building, dated to the early 19th century. It is made of malmstone ashlar, with the upper wall of the centre boarded with a <b>hay</b> <b>loft</b> door and has a hipped slate roof. Today this building functions as a garage and workshop.|$|E

50|$|OLSW {{began in}} 1999 as a study group “Mater Ecclesiae” in Combermere, Ontario, under the {{directorship}} of John Paul Meenan. The centre sought to provide affordable Catholic education to students wishing {{to advance their}} studies after high school. In the early days, studies took place in living rooms, basements, <b>hay</b> <b>lofts,</b> and other areas hosted by local families, while teaching and tuition were free.|$|R

At the end, were the stores for bread, legumes, olive oil, wine and other basics. Taking {{advantage of the}} slope, a basement was constructed {{to be used as}} stables, <b>hay</b> <b>loft,</b> hot house, woodshed, chicken coop and sanitary holding tanks. In the cloister were planted apple trees, plum trees, roses and carnations.|$|E
25|$|Originally the Carriage House {{served as}} a stable with horse stalls, a <b>hay</b> <b>loft,</b> and storage for a carriage, but soon became a garage with a service area for a car, and an upstairs {{apartment}} for a chauffeur. The Carriage House also contained the boilers for the complex's heating system. Built between 1903 and 1905, the original structure was demolished in 1962, and rebuilt during the restoration between 2004 and 2007. The Carriage House is {{at the north end}} of the complex, directly north of the Martin House porte-cochere, to the west of the Conservatory.|$|E
500|$|Now a Grade II listed building, The Coach House {{stands on}} Clifton Hill. It was built as the coach house of Aberdeen Lodge (now 5 Powis Villas). [...] Statue-maker Joseph Rogers Browne built this house for himself, {{along with the}} {{neighbouring}} villas at numbers 6 and 7. [...] He later wanted accommodation for his carriages, so in 1852 he erected the brick, flint and stucco building with space for two coaches and three horses. [...] There was also a <b>hay</b> <b>loft</b> and a separate room for the coachman, and the exterior had Coade stone decoration. By the 1920s {{it had become a}} garage; in 1937, after this closed, the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital bought it and used it to store their ambulances. [...] Local conservationists set up a limited company, which bought the building in 2006, intending {{to turn it into a}} community centre and museum; but it was repossessed in 2008 and was thereafter used for storage by a clothes shop. In its assessment of the building's architectural importance when granting listed status in 2005, English Heritage described it as a [...] "substantially intact and rare survival" [...] with [...] "polite architectural and sculptural features".|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} some bank barns called a [...] "High-Drive Bank Barn" [...] allowed for wagons to enter {{directly}} into the <b>hay</b> <b>loft</b> making unloading the hay easier. Sometimes the high-drive was accessed by an earthen or wood ramp and sometimes the ramp was covered like a bridge {{to make it more}} durable. In the Pennsylvania Barns the animals were housed in the basement level. In many other bank barns the tie-ups were on the upper-ground level and below the stables a basement usually acted as a manure collection area. Many bank barns simply have a small incline leading up to the loft area as opposed to a ramp. Some bank barns are constructed directly into existing hillsides while others are fitted with built up earthen and stone areas to create the trademark bank. The design is similar to English barns except for bank and basement aspects. The basement space could be utilized for animals while the area above, easily accessed by wagon because of the bank, could be used for feed and grain storage. Bank barns {{can be thought of as}} English barns raised up on an exposed full basement.|$|E
50|$|The {{form of a}} {{traditional}} 19th century farmhouse is a long chimney-less building with low walls of horizontal logs and a high straw thatched roof. The log walls are one third and the roof {{two thirds of the}} total building height. The build has three sections, the threshing floor, the kiln room and the dwelling chamber and was used as the primary residence during the winter. The kiln room was the only heated room and all indoor activities were carried out there. During the autumn it was used to dry grain. From summer to autumn cooking was performed in an external summer kitchen and people slept in <b>hay</b> <b>lofts</b> and store rooms.|$|R
50|$|The Rolfe Barn is a {{historic}} barn at 16 Penacook Street in the Penacook village of Concord, New Hampshire. Built c. 1790, the timber frame barn is probably the best-preserved barn of the period in the state. It is also distinctive for its construction methods and materials, which are also rarely seen to survive in New Hampshire. The building's frame is made of oversized timbers, which were hand-hewn and then smoothed with an adze, a rare step not usually taken for barn construction. The building was framed as two separate three-bay English-style barns joined by bay in the center, giving the frame seven bays in all. The interior layout of the barn matches this construction: the central area has two threshing bays, and there are <b>hay</b> <b>lofts</b> on the outer ends.|$|R

With evangelistic fervor, they were obsessively focused {{on the work of}} [...] "winning the lost," [...] stressing personal evangelism at all concert events. Indian reservations in Canada, mental institutions in Maine, prisons in Ohio, rotundas and halls of State office buildings, International Exposition Halls, camps of migrant workers, tents at County Fairs, Churches in most states east of the Mississippi, open-air platforms, Music Halls, military bases, colleges, amphitheaters, nursing homes, parking lots, street corners and <b>hay</b> <b>lofts</b> ― the band's flexibility allowed it to present a variety of musical expressions best serving the needs of evangelism.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{timber house}} in Finland was generally of two types: i. Eastern Finland, influenced by Russian traditions. For example, in the Pertinotsa house (now in the Seurasaari Open Air Museum in Helsinki) the family's dwelling rooms {{are on the}} upper floors while the animal barns and storerooms {{are on the ground}} floor, with <b>hay</b> <b>lofts</b> above them; ii. Western Finland, influenced by Swedish traditions. For example, in the Antti farmstead, originally from the village of Säkylä (nowadays also in Seurasaari), the farmstead consisted of a group of individual log buildings placed around a central farmyard. Traditionally, the first building to be constructed in such a farmstead was the sauna, followed by the first or main room ("tupa") of the main house, where the family would cook, eat and sleep. In summertime they would cook outdoors, and some family members would even choose to sleep in the barns.|$|R

2500|$|Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has a broad {{geographical}} distribution. It {{has been}} isolated from many areas {{across the world}} including Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Antarctica where it is known from {{a broad spectrum of}} substrates. It is principally characterized as a phyllosphere fungus and is commonly found in areas of decaying organic material such as leaves and grains as well as ripening grapes. Isolates of this species however have been recovered from freshwater, marine water and clinical specimens. [...] It has also been isolated from agricultural areas and indoor built environments. In agricultural environments, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor can pose a respiratory hazard for agricultural workers. Agricultural workers are subject to increased exposure when they partake in activities involving the handling of grains. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has additionally been isolated from straw in hay barns or <b>hay</b> <b>lofts.</b> Workers in these settings should consider the proper use of masks to avoid infection. If individuals show atopic symptoms, a change in occupation might be considered. In indoor environments, S.salmonicolor has been associated with severe water and mould damage.

This fungus will also commonly associate with standing water films, although not very much has been documented on this. It can form a pink water film around stagnant toilet water.

50|$|The Higgins Barn {{is set on}} {{the west}} side of Oak Hill Road, about 325 ft from the roadway. The {{property}} also includes a c. 1830-40s Cape house, which has been extensively altered, a family cemetery, and several other outbuildings. The barn, 1-1/2 stories in height, measures 30 x 40 ft, and is oriented with its front (located on a long side, as is typical for English barns) facing east. Constructed of hand-hewn timbers, it is set on a fieldstone foundation, and has a side-gable roof. The walls are sheathed in a variety of wood shingles, some of which are typical clipped and rounded shingles of the Late Victorian period. The main facade has an off-center double sliding door sheltered by a wide portico, with a window at the first floor level to one side and a second at loft height on the other. The upper southernmost part of the barn slightly overhangs an open area used for wood storage and a chicken yard; this is a later 19th-century alteration. The main access door {{on the west side}}, originally matching that on the east side, has been closed off and the space partly taken up by two windows. The interior has a typical English barn layout, with a central wide hall, with animal stalls to either side, with <b>hay</b> <b>lofts</b> above. The stalls on the left have been partly disassembled due to the installation of milking equipment.|$|R
