I hate when there's too much editing. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which <b>I</b> <b>like,</b> which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|She {{was better}} known than her three sisters during her {{lifetime}} and headed Red Cross committees during World War <b>I.</b> <b>Like</b> {{her older sister}} Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, she nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital from 1914 to 1917, until the family was arrested following the first Russian Revolution of 1917.|$|E

It never saw combat in World War <b>I,</b> <b>like</b> the other units of the 87th Division, the brigade was used for labor duties and a pool of reinforcements. It received a campaign streamer for World War I without an inscription. After the war, it was demobilized on 23 May 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|The {{background}} vocals are {{an important}} part of the picture for me. That's why <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to do them myself a lot of the time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks. I'll double my voice or do a couple of tracks of my own voice. It's easy for me to match my voice. And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.|$|E

5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, <b>I,</b> <b>like</b> the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E

6000|$|Yet {{it was not}} so easy to pull up and go. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the row-boat on the lake, {{though it}} was getting too cold and rough for that; <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the way the railway guards called out [...] "Verney-Montreux!" [...] and [...] "Territey-Chillon!" [...] as they ran {{alongside}} the carriages at these stations; <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the pastel portraits of mademoiselle's grandmothers on the gray walls of our pretty chamber that overlooked the lake, and overheard the lightest lisp of that sometimes bellowing body of water; <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the notion of the wild-ducks among the reeds by the Rhone, though I had no wish to kill them; <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> our little corner fireplace, where I covered a log of the grand bois every night in the coals, and found it a perfect line of bristling embers in the morning; <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> Poppi and the three generations of Boulettes; and, yes, <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> mademoiselle and all her boarders; and I hated to leave these friends. Mademoiselle made a grand Thanksgiving supper in honor of the American nation, for which we did our best to figure both at the table, where smoked a turkey driven over the Alps from his Italian home for that fête (there are no Swiss turkeys), and in the dance, for which he had wellnigh disabled us. Poppi was in uncommon tune that night, and the voice of this pensive rheumatic lent a unique interest to every change of the Virginia reel.|$|R

Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro was {{completed}} on 31 March 1917 and {{assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–18, though she had no combat role in World War <b>I.</b> <b>Like</b> her sister, she patrolled {{off the coast of}} China during the war and assisted during the Great Kanto Earthquake. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she did make a port visit to Port Arthur, China, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China. Yamashiro became flagship of the Combined Fleet in 1935. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched radio-controlled Kawanishi E7K2 floatplanes.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War <b>I,</b> <b>like</b> many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and {{the largest and most}} drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established {{in the southern part of}} Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and the East Coast main line railway station at Grantham. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.|$|E
