25|$|After the {{depositions}} {{had been}} taken and briefs filed, the defendants moved for summary judgement. Judge Michael M. Mihm granted it on all but the First Amendment claim. Much of his opinion, handed down in early 1990, consisted of a lengthy explication of Illinois case law on contract formation as it applied to language in the hospital's <b>employee</b> <b>handbook.</b> He held {{that it did not}} constitute a firm offer of continued employment and thus could not be considered a contract Churchill had become party to by continuing to work once aware of its terms. Since there was no contract to breach, there could be no denial of due process rights. He could not grant summary judgement on the First Amendment claim since there was a factual dispute in that area, and ordered a status conference to be held the next month with a magistrate.|$|E

2500|$|The implied-contract {{theory to}} {{circumvent}} at-will employment {{must be treated}} with caution. [...] In 2006, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Matagorda County Hospital District v. Burwell held that a provision in an <b>employee</b> <b>handbook</b> stating that dismissal may be for cause, and requiring employee records to specify the reason for termination, did not modify an employee's at-will employment. The New York Court of Appeals, that state’s highest court, also rejected the implied-contract theory to circumvent employment at will. [...] In Anthony Lobosco, Appellant v. New York Telephone Company/NYNEX, Respondent, the court restated the prevailing rule that an employee could not maintain an action for wrongful discharge where state law recognized neither the tort of wrongful discharge, nor exceptions for firings that violate public policy, and an employee's explicit <b>employee</b> <b>handbook</b> disclaimer preserved the at-will employment relationship. [...] And in the same 2000 decision mentioned above, the Supreme Court of California held that the length of an employee's long and successful service, standing alone, is not evidence {{in and of itself}} of an implied-in-fact contract not to terminate except for cause.|$|E

25|$|At-will {{employment}} disclaimers are {{a staple}} of <b>employee</b> <b>handbooks</b> in the United States. It is common for employers to define what at-will employment means, explain that an employee’s at-will status cannot be changed except in a writing signed by the company president (or chief executive), and require that an employee sign an acknowledgment {{of his or her}} at-will status. However, the National Labor Relations Board has opposed as unlawful the practice of including in such disclaimers language declaring that the at-will nature of the employment cannot be changed without the written consent of senior management.|$|R
2500|$|The National Labor Relations Act {{provides}} {{protection to}} employees {{who wish to}} join or form a union and those who engage in union activity. The act also protects employees who engage in a [...] "concerted activity." [...] Most employers set forth their workplace rules and policies in an <b>employee</b> <b>handbook.</b> A common provision in those handbooks is a statement that employment with the employer is [...] "at-will." [...] In 2012, the National Labor Relations Board, the federal administrative agency responsible for enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), instituted two cases attacking at-will employment disclaimers in employee handbooks. The NLRB challenged broadly worded disclaimers, alleging that the statements improperly suggested that employees could not act concertedly to attempt to change the at-will nature of their employment, and thereby interfered with employees’ protected rights under the NLRA.|$|E
2500|$|In Valve's early days, the company's {{structure}} {{was similar to}} other development firms; this was principally driven {{by the nature of}} physical game releases through publishers that required tasks to be completed by given deadlines, requiring a more regimented structure. As the company moved to digital releases where they serve as their own publisher, the company structure has become more as a flat organization. Valve published their <b>employee</b> <b>handbook</b> to the public in 2012, demonstrating at that time that outside of executive management, there were no bosses, and the company used an open allocation system, allowing employees to move between departments at will. This approach allows employees to work on whatever interests them, but requires them to take ownership of their product and mistakes they may make, according to Newell. Newell recognized that this structure works well for some but that [...] "there are plenty of great developers for whom this is a terrible place to work".|$|E

By creating addendums to previously existing <b>employee</b> <b>handbooks,</b> businesses are able to provide their employees with new policies and expectations of sustainable behaviors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of the picture plus discussion (PPD) intervention on the comprehension abilities of high school students with moderate intellectual disability when read a variety of expository texts aloud.

Comprehension assessment was collected in both three option knowledge based multiple-choice questions and student retell of the text content. While mixed results were observed in the multiple-choice accuracy, this study revealed that the PPD intervention was effective in increasing student comprehension by improving the story retell in terms of quantity (i. e. word count and idea units) and quality (i. e. text and picture relevant idea units) across the text types. These overall positive effects were replicated in the generalization phase, which involved peer supports in an inclusive, neutral school setting. ...|$|R

The {{focus of this}} qualitative single case {{study was to explore}} customer-relationship management strategies managers use to improve financial performance from historically Black colleges and universities located within the state of Georgia with a student enrollment that exceeds 2, 000 students. The conceptual framework for this study was the general system theory.

Themes that emerged were efficiencies with technology, student retention, and financial performance. Using up to date and effective technology including customer relationship management, and creating strategies to focus on student retention can help educational organizations improve their financial performance. The potential for social change includes the opportunity to increase the graduation and student retention rates to provide more opportunities for local business leaders and enhance the economic sustainability of local communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{encounter}} {{of recognition}} theory {{with the world}} of work will be enhanced if it can find useful dialogue partners within the discipline of economics. It is the argument of this paper that potentially fruitful points of contact will be found with heterodox labour economics. Institutionalism, a branch of heterodox economics, is one potential dialogue partner for recognition theory. The institutionalist approach postulates that it is the interplay of socio-cultural, political as well as economic forces that determine the structure and outcomes of labour markets. Consequently, the institutionalist approach adopts both a multidisciplinary perspective and a wide range of research methodologies when studying labour markets. In order to demonstrate the potential compatibility of institutionalism with recognition theory the paper will discuss a key institutionalist concept, the internal labour market. The paper will also examine the topic of workers’ rights which is clearly an area of interest for recognition theory. Specifically, the paper will draw upon the work of the radical US labour economist Richard Edwards on rights at work. An issue that will receive particular attention is that of enterprise rights, which are normally articulated in <b>employee</b> <b>handbooks.</b> These rights have proved difficult to enforce yet they are of great significance for workers in non-union workplaces...|$|R
