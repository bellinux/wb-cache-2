40|$|Ground source {{heat storage}} can {{condition}} buildings with reduced consumption of fossil fuels, {{an important issue}} in modem building design. However, seasonal heat storage can cause soil temperature fluctuations and possibly deformation of soft clays. This thesis evaluates the thermo-mechanical response of soft clays to seasonal heat storage and associated temperature fluctuations. A literature review reveals that, in normally consolidated to lightly overconsolidated clays, increases in soil temperature can lead to significant plastic strains {{and a reduction in}} soil strength. This behavior can be modeled through constitutive formulations that include thermal strain within the elasto-plastic framework of the well-known Modified Cam-Clay Model. The current research uses the MCC Picard (1994) model to study the ground response to a buried heat <b>exchange</b> <b>pipe.</b> The spacing of the pipe was found to govern the effectiveness of ground heat storage. With only one pipe in semi-infinite soil, heat transfer to the ground dissipates quickly and thermal-mechanical interaction is negligible; however, seasonal heat storage is not possible. Closely spaced heat pipes would permit effective seasonal heat storage, but could undergo significant thermally induced consolidation deformations. by Shoshanna Dawn Saxe. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Domestic solar {{hot water}} units, if {{properly}} designed, {{are capable of}} providing all hot water needs in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective way. Despite 50 years of development, commercial technology has not yet achieved substantial market penetration compared to mainstream electric and gas options. Therefore, alternate designs are warranted if they can offer similar or greater performance for a comparable cost to conventional units. This study proved that such alternatives are possible by designing and testing two novel solar hot water systems (SHWS). The first system used compound parabolic collector (CPC) panels to concentrate solar energy and produce steam. The steam moved from a rooftop downward into a heat <b>exchange</b> <b>pipe</b> within a ground level water tank, heating the water, condensing and falling into a receptacle. The operation was entirely passive, since the condensate was pulled up due to the partial vacuum that occurred after system cooling. Efficiencies of up to 40 % were obtained. The second system used an air heater panel. Air was circulated in open and closed loop configuration (air recycling) {{by means of a}} fan/blower motor and was forced across a compact heat exchanger coupled to a water tank. This produced a natural thermosiphon flow heating the water. Air recycling mode provided higher system efficiencies: 34 % vs. 27 %. The concurrent development of an analytical model that reasonably predicted heat transfer dynamics of these systems allowed 1) performance optimisation for specific input/starting operating conditions and 2) virtual design improvements. The merit of this model lay in its acceptable accuracy in spite of its simplicity. By optimising for operating conditions and parameter design, both systems are capable of providing over 30 MJ of useful domestic hot water on clear days, which equates roughly to an increase of 35 °C in a 200 L water tank. This will satisfy, on average, daily hot water requirements for a 4 -person household, particularly in low-latitude regions (eg. Queensland). Preliminary costing for these systems puts them on par with conventional units, with the passive, remotely coupled, low maintenance, CPC SHWS comparable to higher end models. The air heater SHWS, by contrast, was much more economical and easier to build and handle, but at the trade-off cost of 1) the need for an active system, 2) increased maintenance and running costs and 3) the requirement for a temperature control mechanism that would protect the panel body by dumping hot air trapped inside if stagnation were to occur...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{utilisation}} of {{the ground}} with the help of earth-coupled structural elements (“energy geostructures”) is a future-oriented method for domestic heat generation. Due to the incorporation of heat <b>exchanging</b> <b>pipes</b> into necessary structural elements, the installation costs for energy geostructures are much lower than for common geothermal systems. Traditionally, concrete geostructures are used as energy geostructures, whereby the heat <b>exchanging</b> <b>pipes</b> are attached to the existing reinforcement. In this context, the thermal activation of piles, walls, base slabs and tunnels is known. In this thesis, thermo-active seal panels were developed. The thermo-active seal panels can replace a conventional sealing system, for example for basement walls, which are in contact to (streaming) groundwater. The heat <b>exchanging</b> <b>pipes</b> are incorporated into concrete protecting plates made of PE-HD. Due to the thin plate a nearly direct contact to the ground can be achieved. Furthermore, a flexible arrangement of the heat <b>exchanging</b> <b>pipes</b> is possible, due to the existing regular arranged pimples (anchors) on the concrete protecting plate. For determining the effectiveness of the thermo-active seal panels, a large-scale laboratory test station was developed. In this test station, heat extraction tests were carried out, whereby different boundary conditions and system configurations were tested. The determined heat output varied between 25 W/m² and 300 W/m² depending on the applied conditions. The median was about 80 W/m². Thus, the possible heat output of thermo-active seal panels is in the same order of magnitude as documented values in literature for other energy geostructures. Until now, no suitable calculation approach, which considers all influencing parameters, exists. This is due to the fact, that different heat transport mechanisms in the ground, in the structural element and in the heat exchanging system with varying complexity has to be considered. Furthermore, different scales characterize the different sub-processes. Thus, the coupling of all sub-processes is an additional difficulty. Moreover, no rotation-symmetrical heat transfer exists for plane energy geostructures. Therefore, a heat transfer to the ground (outside) and to the adjacent room (inside) has to be taken into account. Hence, a calculation approach for plane energy geostructures was developed in this thesis. This approach considers all heat transport processes involved using the analogy to thermally active building systems (TABS). The multi-layered structural element as well as the heat exchanging system is modelled via thermal resistances. Due to a star connection, a distinction between the heat transfer to the outside and to the inside can be made and both heat flows can be calculated separately. For the coupling of the thermal resistance model and the ground both, analytical methods and numerical methods, were used. However, just numerical methods enable a detailed design of energy geostructures with sufficient accuracy. Thus, the thermal resistance model was implemented in the software tool SHEMAT-Suite, whereas the Geophysica Beratungs-gesellschaft mbH (Aachen) was responsible for the numerical implementation. The mathematical approach and its numerical implementation were verified and validated. For this purpose, comparative calculations using a fully discretised Finite-Element-Modell (COMSOL) were carried out. The results of both numerical models show a very good agreement. Additionally, a comparison between numerical model and laboratory tests was carried out. The modelled and measured return temperatures show also a very good agreement. Thus, the validity of the new calculation approach and its numerical implementation is proved. Furthermore, the computing times of the new approach are of some order of magnitude smaller than the computing time of the fully discretised numerical model. Energy geostructures are mainly utilised in the near-surface ground. Therefore, a time-varying ground temperature has to be taken into account. In this thesis, a calculation algorithm for determining the average earth-surface temperature for each month was developed. This approach is based on the energy balance at the earth surface. Therefore, a suitable combination of calculation approaches for each component of the energy balance was derived. This reference approach set delivers a very good agreement with measured ground temperatures for locations in Germany. Finally, an extensive parameter study was carried out. The most important parameters are the flow rate in the heat exchanging system, the ground temperature, the groundwater flow (direction and amount), the pipe and shank distance as well as the pipe cover. Furthermore, recommendations for the constructive design of plane and shallow energy geostructures were given. In this case, the avoidance of the heat flow to the inside is one important aspect to prevent a thermal circuit...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} high {{efficiencies}} and versatility planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer {{a lot of}} advantages compared to other fuel cell systems and combustion engines. One of the main problems concerning the development of {{state of the art}} planar SOFCs are the occurrence of ageing effects in long term application. To a great deal these effects are caused by the release of volatile Cr-species from metallic interconnects which leads to an inhibition of the electrochemical processes at the cathode resulting in a rapid degradation of the cell performance. A goal in further development of SOFC-systems is the reduction of the operation temperature of the cell from currently 800 °C to 700 °C and below. For this purpose alternative electrolyte materials with higher oxygen ion conductivities have to be developed. Doped lanthanum gallates have been identified as promising materials. However for these materials a depletion of Ga by vaporization has been observed under anodic conditions which may lead to a destruction of their electrolyte properties. The aim of this work is the study of the vaporization processes leading to the mentioned degradation effects. For this purpose an experimental setup according to the transpiration method has been developed. Concerning the vaporization of chromium the Cr release rates of the main ferritic interconnect alloys, namely Crofer 22 APU, ZMG 232, E-Brite, IT- 10, IT- 11, IT- 14 and Ducrolloy as well as a variety of Ni- and Co-base superalloys and stainless steels with different contents of Al, Si, Ti, Mn, W, Ni and Co were measured at 800 °C in air and compared to each other. The alloys that form an upper layer of Cr-Mn-spinel on top of the grown chromia scale showed a reduction of the Cr release by 61 - 75 % compared to pure chromia scales whereas alloys with an outer Co 3 O 4 (s) scale had a by more than 90 % reduced Cr release. For the former alloys a significant vaporization of Mn under anodic conditions could be detected. On the base of empirical data it could be extrapolated that in order to achieve the long term requirements for SOFC-systems additional coatings are necessary. Tests with sputtered perovskite and metal coatings showed that the Cr release could be reduced by up to three orders of magnitude by coatings of Co, Ni or Cu. Additionally the Cr vaporization rates of alumina forming and alitized alloys was investigated. Due to the high electrical resistance of alumina these materials are not suitable for interconnect but for other components like heat <b>exchanges,</b> <b>pipes,</b> pumps etc. After short oxidation times these materials showed Cr release rates that are by more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of chromia forming materials. Concerning the vaporization of doped lanthanum gallates the vaporization rates of the elements Ga, Mg, Sr and La were measured as function time, temperature, gas flow rate and stoichiometry for compositions of the type La(1 -x) SrxMgy(Fez) Ga(1 -y-z) O 3 -d(s) with x= 0, 1 - 0, 3, y= 0, 12 - 0, 32 and z= 0 - 0, 08. As a consequence of the depletion of Ga the formation of the im-purity phases LaSrGaO 4 (s) and LaSrGa 3 O 7 (s) was observed. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the results to a vaporization model with imposed solid state diffusion. In order to elucidate the quality of thermodynamic calculations equilibrium measurements were performed with pure Cr 2 O 3 (s) and Ga 2 O 3 (s) in air or Ar/H 2 respectively as function of temperature and humidity. For the vaporization of Ga 2 O 3 (s) it could be shown that GaOH(g) is the most abundant Ga species in the gas phase. The determined partial pressures for CrO 2 (OH) 2 (g) and CrO 3 (g) or GaOH(g) respectively and the derived enthalpies and entropies of reaction for CrO 2 (OH) 2 (g) and GaOH(g) showed significant differences compared to the thermodynamical data in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} {{operation of}} an embedded water based floor heating {{system has been}} studied {{by means of a}} numerical simulation tool. Prior to this study, Caccavelli et al. (1994) experimentally derived reference data for the specific setup. This paper constitutes an attempt to experimentally validate the numerical simulation tool that was recently developed by Karlsson (2010). The thermal response of the system is tested in both long (16 h) and short (30 min) cycle experiments where the water flow alter between on and off. Temperature distribution, within the floor construction, and the heat exchange process are studied throughout the test cycles. The model underestimates the steady state heat <b>exchange</b> from the <b>pipe</b> loop by 16 % when boundary conditions and thermal properties according to the reference case are applied. Temperatures at the floor surface are assed with good precision while temperatures {{at the core of the}} concrete slab are underestimated by up to 1. 5 °C. Amplitudes, phase shifts, rise and delay times at different measurement points are simulated with good precision. A sensitivity analysis is performed where material parameters and boundary conditions are analysed. None of the tested parameters can independently explain the observed general trend in temperature deviations between simulations and measurements...|$|R

Because of its important role, there needed clean water reserve, whether in quantity or quality. City development and all life asect in indirect way influenced the huge needs of clean water. The existing distribution network in gravity way with heterogen pipe variation. Exaggerate pipe construction and many turn in pipes caused many reduction to pressure. Control to pressure tried to plan clean water needs {{service of the}} consumer. In distribution network system development, network plan was simplified to minimize exaggerate network and minimize reducing caused by pipes turn. This development hoped to increase wealth and life quality of Gondanglegi sub-district people about clean water, along with people growth and society level which increased. From analysis there found citizen in 2019 counted with Geometric method for 20026 soul, for water needs in 2019 found average water needs 10. 5 lt/sec, maximum daily needs 12. 0 lt/sec, and peak hour needs 15. 7 lt/sec.
