Both food and fish (and salmon) called neqa (sg) neqet (pl) in Yup'ik. Also for salmon called neqpik ~ neqpiaq (sg) neqpiit ~ neqpiat (pl) in Yup'ik, means literally “real food”.

25|$|Pakistani food {{makes use}} of fresh hand-pounded masalas, unlike the dried herbs and powders {{that are used in}} Indian cooking. Ghee is used, but the main {{component}} of the meal or a dish <b>is</b> <b>meat</b> (beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or fish), and vegetables are sparingly used. Surprisingly, Pakistani food also makes extensive use of olive oil. Sparingly used vegetables does not mean there is no vegetarian food on the menu. Since the cuisine is very similar to Punjabi-style of cooking, tikka, simmered dals, tawa sabzi, and chaat feature here.|$|E

500|$|Time {{television}} critic James Poniewozik, {{notes that}} by the end of the first episode Frank establishes that his metaphor of choice <b>is</b> <b>meat</b> because both literally and figuratively it is his preference. He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs, because [...] "I’m feelin’ hungry today!", but also he describes life with meat metaphors: he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration: [...] "She’s as tough as a two-dollar steak."; he plans to destroy an enemy the way [...] "you devour a whale. One bite at a time."; and he endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders, he tells us, by [...] " [...] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet." [...] Poniewozik notes that all of this comes from a character whose name, Underwood is a reference to the hallmark deviled ham of the William Underwood Company.|$|E

2500|$|... "Amritdharis" [...] {{that belong}} to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari and Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the {{consumption}} of meat and eggs (though they do consume and encourage the consumption of milk, butter and cheese). This vegetarian stance has been {{traced back to the}} times of the British Raj, with the advent of many new Vaishnava converts. In response to the varying views on diet throughout the Sikh population, Sikh Gurus have sought to clarify the Sikh view on diet, stressing their preference only for simplicity of diet. Guru Nanak said that over-consumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. Passages from the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that it is [...] "foolish" [...] to argue for the superiority of animal life, because though all life is related, only human life carries more importance: [...] "Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not. Who can define what <b>is</b> <b>meat</b> and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?" [...] The Sikh langar, or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma.|$|E
