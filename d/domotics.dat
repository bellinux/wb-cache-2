2500|$|IoT {{devices are}} a part of the larger concept of home automation, also known as <b>domotics.</b> Large smart home systems utilize a main hub or {{controller}} to provide users with a central control for all of their devices. These devices can include lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems. Ease of usability is the most immediate benefit to connecting these functionalities. Long term benefits can include the ability to create a more environmentally friendly home by automating some functions such as ensuring lights and electronics are turned off.

40|$|While {{the main}} {{objective}} of the ASK-IT project is to increase independence of mobility impaired users during trips, the integration of a <b>domotic</b> system is a valuable addition. It helps to make the ASK-IT services more accessible when the user is at home, {{taking into account the}} user's specific impairment. Additionally, <b>domotic</b> systems also increase the feeling of safety and security by letting the user check the state of their home while being on the move. As of today, no common standard for a <b>domotic</b> system has been established. Instead, many different, typically incompatible systems are competing in the market. Also when considering technical aids for mobility impaired users, there are various isolated solutions available. This situation presents a massive challenge to the ASK-IT project. Taking decision for a single existing <b>domotic</b> system may rule out a number of useful devices. Because the whole ASK-IT platform is not specifically targeted for <b>domotic</b> applications, it is also not to be expected that third party manufacturers will adapt their devices to work with the ASK-IT platform in the immediate future. Another hurdle is that installing new wires to connect <b>domotic</b> devices is not always an adequate solution. Using radio frequency or power-line (“no-new-wires”) is often mor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} <b>Domotic</b> OSGi Gateway (DOG) able to expose {{different}} <b>domotic</b> networks as a single, technology neutral, home automation system. The {{adoption of a}} standard framework such as OSGi, and of sophisticated modeling techniques stemming from the Semantic Web research community, allows DOG to go beyond simple automation and to support reasoning-based intelligence inside home environments. By exploiting the DogOnt ontology for automatic device generalization, syntactic and semantic command validation, and internetwork scenario definition, DOG provides the building blocks for evolving current, isolated, home automation plants into so-called Intelligent <b>Domotic</b> Environments, where heterogeneous devices and <b>domotic</b> systems are coordinated to behave as a single, intelligent, proactive system.

40|$|Current <b>domotic</b> systems {{manufacturers}} {{develop their}} systems nearly in isolation, responding to different marketing policies and to different technological choices. While {{there are many}} available approaches to enable interoperation with <b>domotic</b> systems as a whole, few solutions tackle interoperation between single <b>domotic</b> devices belonging to different technology networks. This paper introduces an automatic device-to-device interoperation solution exploiting ontology- based semantic device modeling. By explicitly modeling interoperation through ontology concepts and relations, the devised solution allows to automatically generate devicelevel interoperation rules. These rules, executed by a suitable rule-execution layer integrated in an intelligent <b>domotic</b> gateway (DOG), allow interconnecting arbitrary devices in a general and scalable manner. A case study is shown, where the automatic-generation of interoperation rules is applied to two real-world demo cases, with either KNX or BTicino device...|$|R

40|$|The Information and Communication {{technologies}} {{spread across}} our life {{to make easier}} our everyday tasks and to increase {{the quality of our}} existence in every domain, realizing the Pervasive Computing vision. As in other domains, also in home environments many appliances are rapidly becoming computationally enabled, equipped with different communications protocols, and therefore connected to home networks. <b>Domotic</b> systems, variously called "smart homes", "smart environment systems", "intelligent buildings", or "intelligent homes", can now be proposed and would go far towards simplifying the interaction between the people and their domestic environment. A great number of benefits would stem from the implementation of such systems: greater safety, autonomy and self-esteem for disabled and elderly people, energy saving, and consequently better comfort. The problem of modern <b>domotic</b> systems arise often from the communication incompatibility among products of different manufacturers.

40|$|The {{automatic}} detection of anomalies in Active and Assisted Living (AAL) environments {{is important for}} monitoring the wellbeing and safety of the elderly at home. The integration of smart <b>domotic</b> sensors (e. g. presence detectors) with those ones equipping modern mobile robots (e. g. RGBD camera) provides new opportunities for addressing this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to combine local activity levels detected by a single RGBD camera with the global activity perceived by a network of <b>domotic</b> sensors. Our approach relies on a new method for computing such a global activity using various presence detectors, based {{on the concept of}} entropy from information theory. This entropy effectively shows how active a particular room or environment’s area is. The solution includes also a new application of Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) to merge different information sources for local and global anomaly detection. The system has been tested with RGBD data and a comprehensive <b>domotic</b> dataset containing data entries from 37 different <b>domotic</b> sensors (presence, temperature, light, energy consumption, door contact), which is made publicly available. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach and the potential for complex anomaly detection in AAL settings...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of economically viable and efficient sensor technology provided impetus {{to the development}} of smart devices (or appliances). Modern smart environments are equipped with a multitude of smart devices and sensors, aimed at delivering intelligent services to the users of smart environments. The presence of these diverse smart devices has raised a major problem of managing environments. A rising solution to the problem is the modeling of user goals and intentions, and then interacting with the environments using user defined goals. `Domotic Effects' is a user goal modeling framework, which provides Ambient Intelligence (AmI) designers and integrators with an abstract layer that enables the definition of generic goals in a smart environment, in a declarative way, which can be used to design and develop intelligent applications. The high-level nature of <b>domotic</b> effects also allows the residents to program their personal space as they see fit: they can define different achievement criteria for a particular generic goal, e. g., by defining a combination of devices having some particular states, by using domain-specific custom operators. This paper describes an approach for the automatic enforcement of <b>domotic</b> effects in case of the Boolean application domain, suitable for intelligent monitoring and control in <b>domotic</b> environments. Effect enforcement is the ability to determine device configurations that can achieve a set of generic goals (<b>domotic</b> effects). The paper also presents an architecture to implement the enforcement of Boolean <b>domotic</b> effects, and results obtained from carried out experiments prove the feasibility of the proposed approach and highlight the responsiveness of the implemented effect enforcement architectur...|$|R
