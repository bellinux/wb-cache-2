40|$|The Drosophila S 3 ribosomal protein has {{important}} roles in both protein translation and DNA repair. In regards to the latter activity, {{it has been shown}} that S 3 contains vigorous N-glycosylase activity for the removal of 8 -oxoguanine residues in DNA that leaves baseless sites in their places. Drosophila S 3 also possesses an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity in which the enzyme catalyzes a β-elimination reaction that cleaves phosphodiester bonds 3 ′ and adjacent to an AP lesion in DNA. In certain situations, this is followed by a δ-elimination reaction that ultimately leads to the formation of a single nucleotide gap in DNA bordered by 5 ′- and 3 ′-phosphate groups. The <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 3 protein, although 80 % identical to its Drosophila homolog and shorter by only two amino acids, has only marginal N-glycosylase activity. Its lyase activity only cleaves AP DNA by a β-elimination reaction, thus further distinguishing itself from the Drosophila S 3 protein in lacking a δ-elimination activity. Using a hidden Markov model analysis based on the crystal structures of several DNA repair proteins, the enzymatic differences between Drosophila and <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 3 were suggested by the absence of a conserved glutamine residue in <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 3 that usually resides at the cleft of the deduced active site pocket of DNA glycosylases. Here we show that the replacement of the Drosophila glutamine by an alanine residue leads to the complete loss of glycosylase activity. Unexpectedly, the δ-elimination reaction at AP sites was also abrogated by a change in the Drosophila glutamine residue. Thus, a single amino acid change converted the Drosophila activity into one that is similar to that possessed by the <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 3 protein. In support of this were experiments executed in vivo that showed that <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 3 and the Drosophila site-directed glutamine-changed S 3 performed poorly when compared with Drosophilawild-type S 3 and its ability to protect a bacterial mutant from the harmful effects of DNA-damaging agents...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The human psoriasin (S 100 A 7) gene {{has been}} implicated in {{inflammation}} and tumor progression. Implementation of a mouse model would facilitate further investigation of its function, however little is known of the murine psoriasin gene. In this study we have cloned the cDNA and characterized {{the expression of the}} potential murine ortholog of <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 7 /psoriasin in skin inflammation and mammary tumorigenesis. Methods On the basis of chromosomal location, phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequence similarity, conservation of a putative Jab 1 -binding motif, and similarities of the patterns of mouse S 100 A 7 /psoriasin gene expression (measured by RT-PCR and in-situ hybridization) with those of <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 7 /psoriasin, we propose that mouse S 100 A 7 /psoriasin is the murine ortholog of human psoriasin/S 100 A 7. Results Although mouse S 100 A 7 /psoriasin is poorly conserved relative to other S 100 family members, its pattern of expression parallels that of the human psoriasin gene. In murine skin S 100 A 7 /psoriasin was significantly upregulated in relation to inflammation. In murine mammary gland expression is also upregulated in mammary tumors, where it is localized to areas of squamous differentiation. This mirrors the context of expression in human tumor types where both squamous and glandular differentiation occur, including cervical and lung carcinomas. Additionally, mouse S 100 A 7 /psoriasin possesses a putative Jab 1 binding motif that mediates many downstream functions of the <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 7 gene.

40|$|Rationale: S 100 A 12 is overexpressed during {{inflammation}} {{and is a}} marker of inflammatory disease. Furthermore, it has been ascribed {{to the group of}} damage-associated molecular pattern molecules that promote inflammation. However, the exact role of <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 12 during early steps of immune activation and sepsis is only partially described thus far. Objectives: We analyzed the activation of human monocytes by granulocyte-derived S 100 A 12 as a key function of early inflammatory processes and the development of sepsis. Methods: Circulating S 100 A 12 was determined in patients with sepsis and in healthy subjects with experimental endotoxemia. The release of <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 12 from granulocytes as well as the promotion of inflammation by activation of human monocytes after specific receptor interaction was investigated by a series of in vitro experiments. Measurements and Main Results: S 100 A 12 rises during sepsis, and its expression and release from granulocytes is rapidly induced in vitro and in vivo by inflammatory challenge. A global gene expression analysis of S 100 A 12 -activated monocytes revealed that <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 12 induces inflammatory gene expression. These effects are triggered by an interaction of S 100 A 12 with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4). Blocking S 100 A 12 binding to TLR 4 on monocytes or TLR 4 expressing cell lines (HEK-TCM) abrogates the respective inflammatory signal. On the contrary, blocking S 100 A 12 binding to its second proposed receptor (receptor for advanced glycation end products [RAGE]) has no significant effect on inflammatory signaling in monocytes and RAGE-expressing HEK 293 cells. Conclusions: <b>Human</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 12 is an endogenous TLR 4 ligand that induces monocyte activation, thereby acting as an amplifier of innate immunity during early inflammation and the development of sepsi...|$|E

In mice, the S 4 protein is encoded by an X-linked gene, Rps 4, and is identical to <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 4 X; there is no mouse Y homolog. We report here the organization of the human RPS 4 X and RPS 4 Y and mouse Rps 4 genes. Each gene comprises seven exons; the positions of introns are conserved. The 5 ' flanking sequences of human RPS 4 X and mouse Rps 4 are very similar, while RPS 4 Y diverges shortly upstream of the transcription start site. In chickens, S 4 is encoded by a single gene that is not sex linked. The chicken protein differs from <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 4 X by four amino acid substitutions, all within a region encoded by a single exon. Three of the four substitutions are also present in <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 4 Y, suggesting that the chicken S 4 gene may have arisen by recombination between S 4 X- and S 4 Y-like sequences. Using isoform-specific antisera, we determined that <b>human</b> <b>S</b> 4 X and S 4 Y are both present in translationally active ribosomes.

This initial step may be untangled by analyzing appropriate ancestral molecules, but it is a daunting task to recapitulate the evolution of non-additive (epistatic) interactions of amino acids and function of a protein separately. To adapt to the ultraviolet (UV) -free retinal environment, the short wavelength-sensitive (SWS 1) visual pigment in human (<b>human</b> <b>S</b> 1) switched from detecting UV to absorbing blue light during the last 90 million years. Mutagenesis experiments of the UV-sensitive pigment in the Boreoeutherian ancestor show that the blue-sensitivity was achieved by seven mutations.
