25|$|Secondary {{schools are}} divided into three types - gymnasiums, {{professional}} and craft schools. After graduating from the primary school, students take a test called Matura. The test covers subjects that were taught in primary school. They are awarded the maximum of 40 points at the test. They also get points from their average marks from 5th to 8th grade, and the maximum is 60 points. Both the points from Matura and from average marks are totallized into the maximum of 100 points. Then, students {{make a list of}} their preferred schools and are sorted according to how much points they had gained - every secondary school has a limited number of students it takes. After students make lists for preferred schools, they get into the first school that suits them according to the points. If they fail to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>any</b> of the schools they had listed (ex. if they don't have enough points, but they had chosen very competitive schools), they make another list for the Second Enrollment Deadline.|$|E

And I said, 'I totally respect that. I'm obviously not gonna <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>any</b> domestic anything. That's your wife.' But the record was 'My Love.' And it ended up being an interesting blessing in disguise because I think Tip for that record—I mean his verse is phenomenal." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 6, 2005, Hoffman saved a 6–5 {{win over}} the St. Louis Cardinals as the Padres won two {{straight}} in St. Louis {{for the first time}} since 1977. It was Hoffman's 400th save, and he became the third pitcher in MLB history to reach the milestone, following John Franco (424) and Lee Smith (478). Hoffman was named both the NL Pitcher of the Month and Delivery Man of the Month in May after a perfect 12 for 12 in save opportunities while posting a 0.82ERA (1ER/11.0IP) in 12games as the Padres went 22–6 for their best month in franchise history.

Hoffman did not <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>any</b> save situations as the Padres never led through any of the 27 innings in the series.|$|E

2500|$|Fenerbahçe {{was founded}} as a {{football}} club in 1907 in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, by Ziya Songülen (then Nurizade Ziya Bey), Ayetullah Bey and [...] (then Enver Necip Bey). This group of individuals founded the club secretly {{in order to keep}} a low profile and not <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>any</b> trouble with the strict Ottoman rule. So strict that the Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, forbade the Turkish youth to set up a club or engage in the game of football played by the English families that was watched in envy. The club's name comes from Fenerbahçe, a neighbourhood in Istanbul. The name literally means [...] "lighthouse garden" [...] in Turkish (from fener, meaning [...] "lighthouse", and bahçe, meaning [...] "garden"), referring to a historic lighthouse located at Fenerbahçe cape.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2005, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Bryant Gumbel, Moss admitted that he has smoked marijuana during his NFL career [...] "every blue moon." [...] When asked whether he still used marijuana currently, Moss replied [...] "I might. I might have fun. And, you know, hopefully ... I won't <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>any</b> trouble by the NFL by saying that, you know. I have had fun throughout my years and, you know, predominantly in the offseason." [...] The interview drew criticism from the league office, and his agent tried to spin it that his words were taken out of context. In response, Moss said [...] "That was really me talking {{in the past tense}} of way back in the beginning of my career and my childhood – especially in high school and college." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Redknapp said of Modrić, [...] " [...] {{a hell of}} {{a player}} and a manager’s dream, so I am told. He trains like a demon and never complains, will work with and without the ball on the field and can beat a defender with a trick or with a pass. He could <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>any</b> team in the top four and he’ll be even better this season." [...] On 29 August 2009, during Tottenham's 2–1 win over Birmingham City, Modrić was taken off injured with a {{suspected}} calf injury. The following day, it was confirmed that Modrić had sustained a fracture to his right fibula and was expected to be out for six weeks. He returned on 28 December in the London derby against West Ham United, which Spurs won 2–0 with an 11th-minute goal scored by Modrić using the leg he broke. He again scored in a home win against Everton on 28 February 2010, and in an away defeat against Burnley on 9 May.|$|E

The Vedas also recommend not to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the practice of reciting mantras without complete faith and belief. A guide or Guru is very much required to attain success.|$|R
