40|$|Uncontrolled hemorrhaging, {{or blood}} loss, {{accounts}} for upwards of 3 million deaths {{each year and}} {{is the leading cause}} of preventable deaths after hospital admission around the world. Biological-based hemostatics are quite effective at controlling blood loss, but prohibitively expensive for people in developing countries where over 90 % of these deaths are occurring. Synthetic-based hemostatics are less expensive, yet not nearly as effective as their biological counterparts. A better understanding of how synthetic materials interact with and affect the body's natural clotting response is vital to the development of future hemostatic material technology which will help millions around the world. Initial in vitro experimentation focused on investigating the key chemical and structural material properties which affect Factor VII (FVII) activation in citrated human plasma. Enzyme-linked assays were utilized to confirm the ability of specifically formulated charged hydrogels to induce FVII activation and provided insight into the critical material parameters involved in this activation. Dynamic mechanical analysis was used to establish a correlation between polymeric microstructure and FVII activation. Experiments utilizing coagulation factor depleted and inhibited plasmas indicated that FVII, FX, FII, and FI are all vital to the process outlining the general mechanism of fibrin formation from the onset of FVII activation. The ability of the polymer to induce fibrin formation in "artificial plasma" explicitly lacking calcium, TF, and platelets suggested that a specifically designed material surface has the capability to substitute for these vital cofactors. Clinical diagnostic experimentation using sheep blood indicated that hydrogels containing higher amounts of electrostatic positive charge and lower cross-link density were able to induce faster, more robust clot formation in the presence of a coagulation cascade activator. Subsequent in vivo animal experimentation clearly demonstrated the ability of such hydrogels to aggregate platelets and erythrocytes promoting the formation of an effective <b>hemostatic</b> <b>seal</b> at the wound site. Moreover, in vivo testing confirmed the viability of such a charged polymer hydrogel to effectively control blood loss in a clinically relevant model...|$|E
40|$|PurposeProximal {{endovascular}} aortic graft fixation {{and maintenance}} of <b>hemostatic</b> <b>seal</b> depends on the long-term stability of the aortic neck. Previous investigations of aortic neck dilation mostly focused on the infrarenal aortic diameter. Fenestrated and branched stent grafts facilitate suprarenal graft fixation and may thereby improve the long-term integrity of the aortic attachment site. For these devices, {{the natural history of}} the suprarenal aortic segment is also of interest. We investigated the natural history of the supra- and infrarenal aortic segment after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. MethodsFor this retrospective analysis, we reviewed the preoperative and the initial postoperative as well as the most recent CT series that were obtained from 52 patients undergoing conventional repair of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm between January 1998 and December 2002. Measurements were performed using electronic calipers on a “split screen”, allowing direct comparison of subsequent CT series at corresponding levels along the vessel. Main outcome measures were changes in postoperative measures of the supra- and infrarenal aortic diameters. ResultsThe first postoperative exam was at a mean (±SD) of 7. 0 ± 3. 5 months, and the final exams were at 44. 4 ± 21 months. Over this time period, the estimated rate of change in suprarenal diameter was 0. 18 mm/ y with 95 % confidence interval (CI) from 0. 08 to 0. 27. The estimated rate of change for the infrarenal diameter was 0. 16 (95 % CI: 0. 05 to 0. 27). A clinically relevant diameter increase of ≥ 3 mm was observed in seven patients (13 %). There was evidence of larger diameter increases associated with larger AAA diameters (P =. 003 and <. 001 for suprarenal and infrarenal diameters), an inverted funnel shape (P =. 002 and <. 001), and marginal evidence of association with a history of inguinal hernia (P =. 043 and. 066). ConclusionsAlthough there is statistically significant evidence of increases in the supra- and infrarenal aortic diameters after conventional AAA repair, mean annual increases tended to be small and clinically relevant increases of 3 mm or more were observed in only a small proportion of cases...|$|E

40|$|When a {{blood vessel}} is injured, a repair {{mechanism}} is initiated through {{the formation of}} a <b>hemostatic</b> plug that <b>seals</b> the wound to prevent blood loss. This life saving process becomes life threatening when clots form inside a functional blood vessel leading to pathological thrombosis. Therefore, the clotting process must be carefully regulated. Arrest of bleeding is achieved through platelet adhesion and thrombin-related fibrin clotting at the site of injury. In order for the platelets to stick to the injured tissues and to each other, they need to be activated. In addition to causing fibrin clotting, the protease thrombin plays a crucial role in activating platelets and its action is tightly regulated because of its procoagulant and anticoagulant activities (Dahlback, 2000). Therefore, the molecular details of the interaction of thrombin with platelets are required for a proper understanding of the clotting process. Most platelet responses to thrombin depend on protease-activated receptors (PARs), which are seven-transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors expressed at the platelet surface (Sambrano, 2001, Sadler, 2003). Glycoprotein Ibα (GP Ibα) in the GpIb-IX-V receptor complex is the major binding site for thrombin associated with platelets. We hav...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Research {{with animal}} models has {{demonstrated}} tissue healing of endovascular grafts in both native arte-rial segments and in experimentally created arterial aneurysms. Fundamental {{to the successful}} clinical use of endovascular grafts {{for the treatment of}} aneurysmal disease is the creation of a permanent <b>hemostatic</b> <b>seal</b> between the graft ends and the arterial wall. Characteristics of this healing process in patients with aneurysmal disease have not been fully studied. In this study, we analyzed the macroscopic and histopathologic changes of the arterial wall after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. Methods: Over a 7 -year period, 313 patients were treated with endovascular grafts to exclude arterial aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Of these patients, 11 had their endovascular grafts recovered for analysis. Five graft specimens were recovered during subsequent open aortic surgery. Six grafts were recovered at autopsy after the death of the patient of causes unrelated to the patient's endovascular graft. All specimens were fixed in formalin. Histologic analysis included light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome stains. Well-preserved specimens were selected after light microscopic examination and postfixed in 3 % buffered glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy. The aortas from autopsy specimens were removed en bloc and fixed in formalin; representative regions of each graft were sectioned for analysis. Adherence of the graft to the vessel wall was categorized as densely adherent or easily separated after graft explantation. Traction applied to the graft-aortic anastomosis was equal to traction generated by suspending a standardized 2 -kg weight. Infrarenal graft specimens were obtained with supraceliac aortic clamping, longitudinal aortotomy, and graft sampling before endograft revision. Results: In eight patients, endograft fixation was found to be firmly adherent to the arterial wall. A translucent film of fibrinous material was consistently seen across the entire luminal surface of the endograft. Light and electron microscopy failed to demonstrate an endothelial layer or organized pseudointima at the graft-artery interface. Conclusion: Despite suggestive experimental data regarding endograft healing in animals, minimal graft incorporation was apparent in the stent grafts recovered in this study. A greater emphasis on the construction and mechanism of fixation of endograft attachment systems will be important for long-term device function. (J Vasc Surg 2001; 33 : 733 - 8. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Most endografts for an endoluminal AAA repair cannot {{achieve an}} {{adequate}} <b>hemostatic</b> <b>seal</b> in ectatic common iliac arteries larger than 14 mm. The {{extension of the}} endograft into the external iliac artery can alleviate this problem but requires sacrifice of the internal iliac artery. We have used the larger diameter aortic extension cuff to obtain adequate endograft to arterial wall apposition in patients with ectatic, nonaneurysmal common iliac arteries. Because of the resultant flared configuration of the iliac limb, the technique is termed bell-bottom. However, it is unknown whether subsequent enlargement of these ectatic common iliac arteries {{that will lead to}} endoleaks or endograft migration will occur. Methods: The records of all 96 patients who have undergone endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at our institution were reviewed. Fourteen patients were identified in whom aortic extension cuffs were placed into 18 ectatic (> 14 mm, but < 20 mm) common iliac arteries. The mean follow-up time was 14 months (range, 6 - 24 months). The maximal diameter of the common iliac artery on computed tomography scan before endograft placement was compared with the maximal diameter at the most recent follow-up. The incidence of endoleaks, ruptures, and endograft migration related to the “bell-bottom” technique were recorded. Results: The mean preoperative common iliac artery diameter was 18 mm (range, 15 - 20 mm). Aortic extension cuffs of 20 -mm diameter and 24 -mm diameter were used in 14 and 4 common iliac arteries, respectively. The diameter did not change in 11 common iliac arteries (61 %), increased by 1 mm in 4 common iliac arteries (22 %), and decreased by 1 mm in 3 common iliac arteries (17 %). No endoleaks, ruptures, or endograft migration related to this technique was identified. Conclusion: The use of aortic extension cuffs for ectatic common iliac arteries expands the number of patients who can be treated endoluminally without sacrifice of the internal iliac artery. Most common iliac arteries do not increase in diameter. When enlargement occurs, the degree of dilation is minimal. Therefore, the “bell-bottom” technique appears to be an acceptable option in the management of large, nonaneurysmal iliac vessels during endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

40|$|Primary snoring {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be a consequence of soft palate vibration caused by a partial upper airway collapse during sleep. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is a surgical treatment used to remove tissue in the throat for snoring and/or sleep apnea syndrome. UPPP is still the most frequently used surgical treatment for snoring and/or sleep apnea syndrome. Innovative advances have recently introduced regarding instrumentation, energy sources, and devices aimed at facilitating surgical procedures in terms of efficient hemostasis, tissue legation and dissection, as well as reduction in surgical time: although curative for many patients, these procedures present side effects. The Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel® is an ultrasonic cutting and coagulating surgical device. The equipment consists of a generator, an hand-piece, and specific inserts. The mechanism of the Harmonic Scalpel® (HS) is based on transforming electrical energy into mechanical movement of 55. 5 kHz frequency. The high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations produced by the HS cause an effect referred to as cavitation whereby the collagen and proteoglycans in the tissue become denatured and then combine with the tissue fluids to form a coagulum. The pressure exerted on the tissue by the blade surface collapses blood vessels and allows the coagulum to form a <b>hemostatic</b> <b>seal.</b> The HS controls bleeding by coaptive coagulation at low temperatures, ranging from 50 °C to 100 °C. By contrast, electrosurgery and laser coagulate by burning (obliterative coagulation) at higher temperatures (150 - 400 °C). The vibration frequency of HS is optimal for soft tissue and does not cut mineralized tissue (lower frequency waves need to be utilized) In UPPP, among the available hand-pieces and inserts, a specific hand-piece and insert was preferred: the insert, shaped like scissor, had a sharp inner beveled radius forcutting under tension, a blunt outer radius for coaptive coagulation, and a flat side for surface coagulation. In all the patients treated, the HS allowed rapid and easy intraoperative management and a precise and safe cut, especially in difficult anatomic sites. The operating fields were blood free with perfect intraoperative visibility. These features facilitate the use of the HS in tight spaces, where precision is essential. Postoperatively, all patients had a recovery of snoring (no complications with regard to haemostasis or other major complication, were noted in our study group), with an acceptable level of pain. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|Introduction: The role of {{hemostatic}} agents as {{an adjunct}} for closure of the nephrostomy tract in tubeless percutaneous surgery (tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy [tPNL]) has been previously evaluated, observing a potential benefit in terms of reduced bleeding and urinary leakage. We assessed the rate of postoperative complications after the use of <b>hemostatic</b> agents for <b>sealing</b> the nephrostomy tract in patients undergoing tPNL at our institution. Subjects and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 52 consecutive patients undergoing tPNL at our center between January 2010 and December 2013. No substance was placed within the tract in 25 patients (Group 1). A cylinder of Surgicel((R)) in addition to 1 unit of Gelita((R)) were placed within the access tract in 27 patients (Group 2). We accounted for demographic variables, stone size, operative time, postoperative pain, development of hematoma, postoperative hematocrit drop, urinary leakage, residual lithiasis, and hospital stay length. Results: Age and sex differed significantly {{between the two groups}} (P = 0. 0002 and P = 0. 048 respectively). However, {{there were no significant differences}} in terms of body mass index and stone burden. No significant differences between groups were found with regards to operative time, postoperative hematocrit drop, postoperative pain and presence of residual lithiasis. Conclusion: The use of Gelita((R)) and Surgicel((R)) as hemostatic agents in tPNL is safe, but we were not able to demonstrate any significant benefit in terms of postoperative morbidity after comparing the use of these agents in tPNL. We concluded that the uses of hemostatic agents needed to be evaluated in prospective randomized trials to define its benefits...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of TachoSil® (Nycomed UK, Oxford, Buckinghamshire, UK), a <b>hemostatic</b> sponge, to <b>seal</b> major collecting system injuries (in addition to providing an adjunct to hemostasis) after partial nephrectomy in a porcine chronic survival model. Materials and Methods: Laparoscopic upper-pole partial nephrectomies were performed in 10 farm pigs (> 40 kg). After hilar clamping, an energyless incision was made at a point halfway between the hilum and the upper pole of the kidney and the collecting system was opened widely. TachoSil was applied to cover the defect; 15 to 20 minutes after the application of TachoSil, the hilar clamp was removed, hemostasis confirmed, and the pig survived. Assessment was made for hematoma and urinoma. Four weeks postoperatively, the pigs were euthanized. Ex-vivo retrograde studies were performed to assess collecting system leak. Weight, blood pressure, estimated blood loss, the weight of the partial and completion nephrectomy specimen, presence/absence of urinary leak on retrograde study, histopathologic findings, and complications were recorded. Results: All pigs survived. Mean warm ischemia time was 18 minutes, mean blood loss was 90 mL, and mean resected weight was 13. 7 g. There was no evidence of leak on retrograde study. Histologically, nonspecific changes were noted in all specimens, which included dystrophic calcification, scarring, and areas of fibrosis at the partial nephrectomy surgical margin. Conclusion: TachoSil seals the collecting system after partial nephrectomy on a porcine chronic survival model, in addition to providing an adjunct to hemostasis. More studies, including human trials, are warranted to evaluate this observation further. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc [...] Articl...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Successful {{endovascular}} {{repair of}} an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) requires {{the creation of}} a <b>hemostatic</b> <b>seal</b> between the endograft and the underlying aortic wall. A short infrarenal aortic neck may be responsible for incomplete aneurysm exclusion and procedural failure. Sixteen patients who had an endograft positioned completely below the lowest renal artery and 37 patients in whom a porous portion of an endograft attachment system was deliberately placed across the renal arteries were studied to identify if endograft positioning could impact on the occurrence of incomplete aneurysm exclusion. Methods: Fifty-three patients underwent aortic grafting constructed from a Palmaz balloon expandable stent and an expandable polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft implanted in an aorto-ilio-femoral, femoral-femoral configuration. Arteriography, duplex ultrasonography and spiral CT scans were performed in each patient before and after endografting to evaluate for technical success, the presence of endoleaks, and renal artery perfusion. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in patient demography, AAA size, or aortic neck length or diameter between patients who had their endografts placed below or across the renal arteries. However, significantly more proximal aortic endoleaks occurred in those patients with infrarenal endografts (P ≤. 05). Median serum creatinine level before and after endografting was not significantly different between the 2 patient subgroups, with the exception of 2 patients who had inadvertent coverage of a single renal orifice by the endograft. Median blood pressure and the requirement for antihypertensive therapy remained the same after transrenal aortic stent grafting. Significant renal artery compromise did not occur after appropriately positioned transrenal stents as shown by means of angiography, CT scanning, and duplex ultrasound scan. Mean follow-up time was 10. 3 months (range, 3 to 18 months). Patients who had significant renal artery stenosis (≥ 50 %) before aortic endografting did not show progression of renal artery stenosis after trans-renal endografting. Two patients with transrenal aortic stent grafts had inadvertent coverage of 1 renal artery by the endograft because of device malpositioning, which resulted in nondialysis dependent renal insufficiency. In addition, evidence of segmental renal artery infarction (< 20 % of the kidney), which did not result in an apparent change in renal function, was shown by means of follow-up CT scans in 2 patients with transrenal endografts. Conclusion: Transrenal aortic endograft fixation using a balloon expandable device in patients with AAAs can result in a significant reduction in the risk of proximal endoleaks. Absolute attention to precise device positioning, coupled with the use of detailed imaging techniques, should reduce the risk of inadvertent renal artery occlusion from malpositioning. Long-term follow-up is essential to determine if there will be late sequelae of transrenal fixation of endografts, which could adversely effect renal perfusion.
