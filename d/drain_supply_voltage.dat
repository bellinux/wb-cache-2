40|$|The {{objective}} of the bachelor graduation project detailed in this thesis {{is the development of}} a system suited for testing radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs). This PA test system is in particular set up for testing two-transistor interpolating-supply amplifiers. Interpolating-supply PAs are efficiency-enhanced by employing multiple transistors supplied by different, fixed <b>drain</b> <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> leading to different efficiency characteristics, which are then combined by switching between the transistors, resulting in an enchanced overal efficiciency. Turning on the right amplifying transistor takes place digitally by pre-adjusting the different data inputs or control of gate biases. The PA test system is required to provide support for measurement and signal generation for 40 dBm output power of a 20 dB gain PA. Moreover, it is required to provide remote control access to the measurement equipment and automation of the tests, implemented in MATLAB. The to-be-measured PA performance metrics were constrained to static tests for drain efficiency, power-added efficiency, AM/AM distortion, total harmonic distortion (THD) and intermodulation distortion (IMD). In order to meet the requirements while making use of the available resources, it was recognized that the following subsystems were necessary: • Baseband signal generation using a DAC; • RF signal generation using a to-be-calibrated IQ modulator; • Pre-amplifier, by own design; and • Spectrum analyzer, controlled remotely. The baseband signal generation subsystem was characterized with respect to noise and gain performance, which resulted in the making of noise-reducing LC low-pass filters. The provided IQ modulators were successfully calibrated for device non-idealities in an automated MATLAB GUI, allowing for clean RF signal generation. Three pre-amplifiers with over 27. 5 dB power gain were realized for sufficient PA input power. A set of MATLAB functions and scripts for the spectrum analyzer and top-level control was written, enabling semi-automatic PA testing. At the time of writing this thesis, the PA test system was put in use to characterize and evaluate two interpolating supply PAs. For automation, another GUI was implemented for the PA test system. The system proved to be able to determine PA input, output and DC power to measure the gain, linearity and efficiency in multiple static tests and for different PA bias conditions. Also THD and IMD for single-transistor were measured using the PA test system. The results were to a realistic extent similar to the simulated PA characteristics, aside from some anomalies which could possibly be explained by PA design implementation mistakes or test system nonidealities...|$|R

High Power Amplifier {{is the most}} critical element within a multifunctional transceiver chip. The need for high linearity and high output power for RF input signals with a high peak-to-peak average power ratio makes the design of high power amplifiers extremely challenging. Drain bias modulation techniques like envelope tracking is used to improve the efficiency of a wideband power amplifier by modulating the <b>drain</b> <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> to the envelope of the input RF signal using an envelope amplifier. The critical element within an envelope amplifier is the high frequency switch-mode power converter. The key enabler for delivering high efficiencies at high switching frequencies within an envelope amplifier is the power switch. The low on-resistance and input capacitance of RF GaN HEMT transistors make them ideal candidates as power switches. The integration of power switches within a high power amplifier would allow the minimization of all circuit parasitics, enabling delivery of high voltage and high currents at an extremely high slew rate to the drain of the high power amplifier. This thesis investigates the above mentioned properties and presents the use of commercial foundry GaN HEMTs as power switches for RF power amplifier supply modulators. Pulsed I-V characterisation was undertaken to study the impact of trapping on switch efficiency {{as well as a}} transient analysis in a hybrid implementation.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{adaptable}} and reliable L 1 data cache design (Adapcache) with the unique capability of automatically adapting itself for different <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> levels and providing the highest reliability. Depending on the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> level, Adapcache defines three operating modes: In high <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> Adapcache provides reliability through single-bit parity. In middle range of <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> Adapcache writes data to two separate cache-lines simultaneously {{in order to}} use one line for error recovery when the other line is faulty. In near threshold <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> Adapcache writes data to three separate cache-lines simultaneously in order to provide the correct data based on bitwise majority voter. We design and simulate one embodiment of the Adapcache as a 64 -KB L 1 data cache with 45 -nm CMOS technology at 2 GHz processor frequency for almost nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> (1 V- 0. 6 V), at 900 MHz for middle <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> (0. 6 V- 0. 4 V), and at 400 MHz for near threshold <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> (0. 4 V- 0. 32 V). According to our experimental results, the energy reduction and latency as well as cache capacity usage are improved compared to typical previous proposals, Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) and Double Modular Redundancy (DMR) techniques and also to {{the state of the art}} proposal, Parichute Error Correction Code (ECC).
