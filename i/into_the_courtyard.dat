Dissatisfied with their meagre share, the Connachta rise against the Ulaid, and a drinking bout breaks out in the hostel and spills out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> outside. Fergus rips up a great oak tree from the ground by the roots. Mac Da Thó unleashes Ailbe to see which side it would choose; Ailbe sides with the Ulaid, and precipitates the rout of the Connachta. The dog itself is decapitated by Aillil's charioteer Fer Loga at Mag nAilbi.|$|E

5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} in the writing process. For a few days, {{it was thought that}} Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through the sliding glass door that opens from Merrigan's office <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} Jack Sparks, a young American, who is {{traveling}} in Turkey. He befriends an aged Turk during a carriage ride and the Turk invites Jack into his home. The man smokes from a hookah {{and several of}} other men arrive and speak with the Turk whilst Jack wanders about the house. Soon afterwards, the men are all arrested for conspiracy against the government and Jack is imprisoned {{as one of the}} conspirators. In jail, Jack tries to make his escape and throws the guard to the ground, no sooner has he left the cell is he forced back by two more guards. He struggles in vain, but is once again locked in his cell. Jack gets an idea to escape when he sees the bed sheet and the cell window. Using his pocket knife, he digs out the bar of the cell window and drops to freedom. He struggles and overpowers a guard before climbing over the wall and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> of the Pasha's palace.|$|E

50|$|Entry to {{the castle}} was {{achieved}} then as now in two ways. On one side, access was gained through a gateway to <b>the</b> main <b>courtyard</b> and, on <b>the</b> other, through another gateway {{at the end of}} the Schlossgasse leading from <b>the</b> Böhmergasse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>courtyard.</b> <b>The</b> castle itself was further separated from the town by a moat and drawbridge.

25|$|Dzongs were {{frequently}} {{built on a}} hilltop or mountain spur. If the dzong is built {{on the side of}} a valley wall, a smaller dzong or watchtower is typically built directly uphill from the main dzong with the purpose of keeping the slope clear of attackers who might otherwise shoot downward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> of the main dzong below (see image at head of article).|$|E

The brick-built, three-storey entrance tower faces the church; a grand stone archway leads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> On each corner of the tower there is an octagonal turret rising an extra floor, with lead ogee domes.|$|E
25|$|Attacks on medieval castles in Central Europe {{were not}} usually {{carried out by}} large siege armies. Often just twenty to a hundred men blocked the entrances to the castle and {{demoralized}} its occupants with occasional attacks. Animal carcasses or debris might be thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> A blockaded castle actually only needed to be starved out, nevertheless supplies were also {{a problem for the}} besieging force. Farmers in the area would hide their grain in erdstalls and drive their cattle into the forest.|$|E
50|$|In 1882, the Peabody Trust {{built the}} Abbey Orchard Estate on former {{marshland}} {{at the corner}} of Old Pye Street and Abbey Orchard Street. Like many of the social housing estates, the Abbey Orchard Estate was built following the square plan concept. Blocks of flats were built around a courtyard, creating a semi-private space within the estate functioning as recreation area. <b>The</b> <b>courtyards</b> were meant to create a community atmosphere and the blocks of flats were designed to allow sunlight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards.</b> <b>The</b> blocks of flats were built using high-quality brickwork and included architectural features such as lettering, glazing, fixtures and fittings. The estates built in the area at the time were considered model dwellings and included shared laundry and sanitary facilities, innovative at the time, and fireplaces in some bedrooms. The design was subsequently repeated in numerous other housing estates in London.|$|R
50|$|Several {{methods were}} used in {{traditional}} architecture to alleviate the harsh climate of the country. Windows were seldom used {{in order to reduce}} heat conduction. The badgheer construction method allowed air to be channeled into houses for ventilation purposes. This was accomplished by several methods, including horizontal air gaps in rooms and parapets, and vertical openings in wind towers called hawaya which drew air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards.</b> Wind towers, however, were not as common in Doha as they were {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|R
60|$|Five minutes {{afterwards}} {{everything was}} over. Joshua's soldiers threw down their arms, and ran or galloped to right and left, save {{a number of}} them who fled through the gates of the palace, which they had opened, and across <b>the</b> drawbridge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> within. After them, or, rather, mixed up with them, followed the Mountaineers, killing all whom they could find, for they were out of hand and would not listen to the commands of Maqueda and their officers, that they should show mercy.|$|R
25|$|In past years, {{the band}} {{participated in the}} Spirit Walk, wherein the band formed a tunnel into the stadium from the main {{thoroughfare}} and played various school songs as the football team entered. From here, the band moved approximately two hours before kickoff <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> of the Iowa State Center near the Scheman Building. Here the students would stretch and warm up on their musical instrument. Guides would sometime give special performances before assembly for early-arriving Cyclone fans, and the whole band would perform a few songs and {{a sample of the}} halftime shows for the gathered audience. The band would then break by ranks to form a block and parade under cadences to the south side of Jack Trice Stadium for pregame.|$|E
25|$|The {{passage through}} the Gatehouse, crowned with the royal Bavarian coat of arms, leads {{directly}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> The courtyard has two levels, the lower one being defined to the east by the Gatehouse and to the north by {{the foundations of the}} so-called Rectangular Tower and by the gallery building. The southern end of the courtyard is open, imparting a view of the surrounding mountain scenery. At its western end, the courtyard is delimited by a bricked embankment, whose polygonally protracting bulge marks the choir of the originally projected chapel; this three-nave church, never built, was intended to form the base of a 90-metre (295-ft) keep, the planned centrepiece of the architectural ensemble. A flight of steps at the side gives access to the upper level.|$|E
25|$|Blue overhears Blondie {{relaying}} Babydoll's plan to Gorski, confirming {{his suspicions}} {{that something is}} amiss. He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.|$|E

50|$|In 1882, the Peabody Trust {{built the}} Abbey Orchard Estate {{on the corner}} of Old Pye Street and Abbey Orchard Street. The estate was {{designed}} by Henry Darbishire and built on former marshland. The buildings rest on arches, supported by a foundation of piles. Like many of the social housing estates, the Abbey Orchard Estate was built following the square plan concept. Blocks of flats were built around a courtyard, creating a semi-private space within the estate functioning as recreation area. <b>The</b> <b>courtyards</b> were meant to create a community atmosphere and the blocks of flats were designed to allow sunlight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyards.</b> <b>The</b> blocks of flats were built using high-quality brickwork and included architectural features such as lettering, glazing, fixtures and fittings.

25|$|Wishing {{to open up}} the square, Piermarini first {{demolished}} one of the old wings before {{concentrating on}} the renovation of the building's exterior. The result is a sober two-storey facade. The first floor contains windows with small stone cornices and a small bugnato ashlar socle while the other two have pilasters along the full length of the facade with tympanum windows, alternatingly triangular and curved. The interiors were then completely renewed. The entrance leads <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> with its monumental Baroque staircase. To complete this part of the palace, the facade of the Church of San Gottardo in Corte had to be demolished while use was also made of the adjoining square. The most renowned artists, decorators and cabinet makers of the period were called upon to design the furniture and decorations. The external structure was completed in 1778 but work on the interior continued for several years.|$|E
25|$|After {{his arrival}} at Cheb, however, certain senior Scottish and Irish {{officers}} in his force assassinated {{him on the}} night of February 25. To carry out the assassination, a regiment of dragoons under the command of an Irish colonel, Walter Butler and the Scots colonels Walter Leslie and John Gordon first fell upon Wallenstein's trusted officers Adam Trczka, Vilém Kinsky, Christian Illov and Henry Neumann while the latter attended a feast at Cheb Castle (which had come under the command of Gordon himself), and massacred them. Trczka alone managed to fight his way out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> only to be shot down by a group of musketeers. A few hours later, an Irish captain, Walter Devereux, together with a few companions, broke into the burgomaster's house at the main square where Wallenstein had his lodgings (again courtesy of Gordon), and kicked open the bedroom door. Devereux then ran his halberd through the unarmed Wallenstein, who, roused from sleep, is said to have asked in vain for quarter.|$|E
25|$|Most of the museum's {{collections}} of mammalian and dinosaur fossils remain hidden from public view. They {{are kept in}} numerous storage areas located deep within the museum complex. Among these, the most significant storage facility is the ten story Childs Frick Building which stands within an inner courtyard of the museum. During construction of the Frick, giant cranes were employed to lift steel beams directly from the street, over the roof, and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> {{in order to ensure}} that the classic museum façade remained undisturbed. The predicted great weight of the fossil bones led designers to add special steel reinforcement to the building's framework, as it now houses the largest collection of fossil mammals and dinosaurs in the world. These collections occupy the basement and lower seven floors of the Frick Building, while the top three floors contain laboratories and offices. It is inside this particular building that many of the museum's intensive research programs into vertebrate paleontology are carried out.|$|E
