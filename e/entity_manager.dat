40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{relationships}} between implicit theories, the quality of leader-member exchange (LMX), and the type of process-feedback and person-feedback given to subordinates. Randomly selected manager and subordinate dyads reported the types of feedback they provided and received, respectively. Managers reported their beliefs regarding the degree to which intelligence is fixed and subordinates responded to measures of the quality relationship they shared with their managers. Multiple regression analyses revealed that <b>entity</b> <b>managers</b> were more likely to give process-criticism feedback than incremental managers and incremental managers were more likely to give person-praise feedback than <b>entity</b> <b>managers.</b> Results also showed that the quality of LMX was positively associated with person-praise and process-praise feedback, and negatively associated with person-criticism and process-criticism feedback. Findings are discussed in terms of the contributions they make to the literature. Specifically, this dissertation is among the first of its kind to examine the specific types of feedback messages real managers give real subordinates in real organizational settings and the different factors that influence managers to give different feedback. ...|$|R

40|$|While opening {{avenues for}} {{unlimited}} possibilities, distributed systems have introduced management complexity as an unfavorable trait. Therefore, as distributed systems become commonplace, the automation of system management {{has become a}} primary challenge in information technology. The state of art in system management assigns each managed resource to an external <b>entity</b> (<b>manager),</b> which monitors, analyzes and controls the resource {{and a collection of}} such managers manages a system. In such settings, each manager has to act with partial knowledge about the system, and to maintain the system as a whole in acceptable state, those managers should be controlled and coordinated. This paper presents a scalable and robust coordination architecture for distributed management. The proposed architecture consists of a cloud of managers placed on a P 2 P network, and a coordinator, which re-elects on failure. Each resource in the system is assigned to a manager, and managers monitor the system and maintain a distributed data model, which reflects system state (a metamodel). Using the meta-model, each manager enforces a set of user-defined management rules to implement resource level management, and the global coordination is achieved using user-defined, global management rules enforced by the coordinator. Main contributions of the paper are, a coordination architecture for distributed management which supports elections based recovery, a meta-model which reflects the system state, and the application of rules on top of the meta-model to achieve manager coordination. 1...|$|E

In particular, the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 authorized federal laboratories operated by contractors, including the Department of Energy's (DOE) national laboratories, to enter into cooperative research and development agreements (CRADA). Under a CRADA, the partner and DOE laboratory agree to jointly conduct research and typically share the research costs. By fiscal year 1992, DOE's national laboratories were among the leading federal laboratories participating in CRADAs. Recently however, the 12 laboratories that DOE surveyed have substantially reduced their CRADA partnerships and their technical assistance to small businesses. Instead, the laboratories have increasingly transferred technology through agreements that did not involve collaborative research and were funded by a business or other nonfederal <b>entity.</b> <b>Managers</b> at most of the laboratories say the lack of dedicated funding for technology for transfer to technology partnerships, including funding targeted to small businesses, {{is the most important}} barrier to their technology transfer activities.

40|$|Ensuring smooth {{operation}} of an airport {{is a complex}} task with many stakeholders involved that {{have to work together}} closely in order to achieve optimal results. In particular, the field of security control harbors diverging interests of different entities that share responsibility for secure and timely flights. These entities usually comprise governmental organizations (e. g., legislative authorities, police) and private companies (e. g., airport operators, private security companies). Due to conflicting interests between these <b>entities,</b> <b>managers</b> might perceive each other as adversaries rather than as partners for collaboration. To our knowledge, the present report is the first one to relate procedure and results of a fruitful collaboration on management level between representatives of these different entities at an airport, including a governmental organization as the executive, i. e., carrying out the security control, and a private company (the airport operator). In the setting of the security control at a large European airport, the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement System (ProMES) methodology [1] was chosen to identify stakeholders in the security control process as a first step {{in order to be able}} to define their interests, demands, and needs in a second step. Subsequently, justified demands were grouped and categorized into six goal domains. For each goal domain, key performance indicators were developed. Last but not least, the indicators were prioritized by weighing their relevance against each other in order to resolve conflicting interests. This process can be rather quick and efficient provided it is well prepared and monitored. It is further suggested to have an independent facilitator supervise and moderate the process. This study highlights the importance of bringing together high level managers of different organizational entities with a systematical approach in order to pave the way for good cooperation in complex work domains. As a result, s- akeholders and demands can be identified, conflicting demands can be discussed, and priorities set. Subsequently, those guidelines can be handed over to the next lower level in the organizational hierarchy. Supervisors on this next level can then define goals for their respective domains using the guidelines provided by the management...|$|R

Apart from the MAC layer responsibility to manage transmission of packets from the upper layers across the physical wireless channel to a neighboring node, an interface to Energy Manager is foreseen in order for the MAC layer to manage issues related to RF energy (e.g., transmission power and sleep times). Multiple instantiations of the MAC Adaptation Layer will act as an interface to upper layers (network layer) and cross-layer <b>entities</b> (Energy <b>Manager</b> and NVM) to tune MAC layer parameters (e.g., to instantiate different time/frequency scheduling patterns). In the proposed node architecture, the challenge at MAC is to support different hardware owners and for each different applications. For example, in subsequent developments related to the emerging IEEE 802.15. 4 e, this is solved by having different superframes with different duty cycles running in parallel. Other link layer technologies, such as IEEE 802.15. 4 - 2003 / 2006, would need to handle such virtualization challenge sequentially and thus, not to be depleted quickly, need to be highly energy efficient.|$|R

This study aims to test propositions that firms whose staffing policies and systems are aligned with their strategic goals and objectives to outperform those firms with poorer organizational alignment.

Some 479 completed surveys were returned yielding a 59 percent response rate.

This concept is difficult to apply to vernal pools, which represent a tremendous habitat value- but are difficult to successfully replicate using construction methods (as mentioned above). Thus, it has been very controversial to apply mitigation strategies to vernal pool systems due to the obvious risks inherent in trying to reconstruct this kind of habitat. Although, some agencies are now requiring two replacements for every vernal pool that is destroyed, in order to compensate for the low quality of man-made habitat.|$|R
