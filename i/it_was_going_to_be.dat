He said“I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|E

She owned a cat named Joey, whom she named after both Joey Ramone and Joey McIntyre of New Kids on the Block. Joey died on 29 January 2010. Annie is an avid reader and follows global politics. She is friends with musician Peaches. Her musical influences include Madonna, Saint Etienne, the Pet Shop Boys, and Kate Bush. She has a green belt in karate.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{proposed}} by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who envisioned a crossover between the Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei series. Although initially reluctant {{due to their}} workload, Atlus agreed to the collaboration, {{and much of the}} early work went into deciding what genre of game <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game. The production period lasted five years. A notable feature was musical numbers produced by Japanese entertainment company Avex Group.|$|E

25|$|To help boost {{his spirits}} {{and to look}} for new inspirations, White {{decided to go to}} Mexico in the summer of 1925. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both a {{teaching}} experience, as several students went with him, and a chance for him to begin photographing again. He arrived in Mexico in early July, and, as a sign of White's reputation and influence, he was immediately visited by Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles.|$|E
25|$|Not all the {{soldiers}} were agreed to stay together.

25|$|The PSFS sign {{has become}} a Philadelphia icon.

Loews briefly considered altering the sign by projecting the Loews name on it, but the idea was soon scrapped.|$|E

Ted Lilly, who had also signed with the Cubs that prior winter had requested #31 but was told it was not available as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> retired for Greg Maddux and Fergie Jenkins, and they were just waiting for Maddux to retire. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.|$|E
25|$|Miles {{promised that}} the company would stay {{headquartered}} in Birmingham (the city where the company was founded {{and a majority of}} employees were located), in 2011. In 2014, though, when the company announced that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> publicly traded, SEC filings showed the headquarters as Plano, Texas. Reasons given for the shift included simplifying travel, a lack of talent available in Birmingham (the talent source for the companies initial growth and development), and the need to consolidate offices to prepare for an IPO. Local media, business, and civic leaders said they were unaware of the move.|$|E

25|$|The Casa del Deán is {{the oldest}} noble house {{in the city of}} Puebla, {{constructed}} by Tomás de la Plaza Goes, who was the deacon of the Cathedral of Puebla. It was finished in 1580. The building remained practically intact until 1953, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> demolished to construct a movie theater. Protests to save the building, due to its murals and façade, succeeded. The murals are frescos, which are the only surviving non-religious examples from the 16th century in their original place in Mexico. The gray stone façade is completely smooth to let the main portal, of Renaissance style, stand out. The portal contains and upper and lower portion with a crest.|$|E
25|$|For a while 1914 {{looked like}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the first ever}} {{relatively}} calm year for Merezhkovsky. With the two Complete Works Of editions released by the Wolfe's and Sytin's publishing houses, academic Nestor Kotlyarevsky nominated the author for the Nobel Prize for literature. Then World War I broke out. Merezhkovskys expressed their skepticism as to the Russian involvement in it and the patriotic hullabaloo stirred up by some intellectuals. The writer made {{a conscious effort to}} distance himself from politics and succeeded almost, but in 1915 was in it again, becoming friends with Alexander Kerensky and joining the Maxim Gorky-led Movement of the patriotic left calling for Russia's withdrawal from the War in the painless possible way.|$|E
25|$|What did {{not break}} down was communication. Operationally, the air {{division}} and corps headquarters were placed alongside, and moved with, army equivalents. The air liaison teams attached to the corps and Panzer Divisions were directed to report the battle situation at the front, but were forbidden to advise the army, or request air support. The army sent separate reports, under the same conditions. The reports were digested by Kleist and Richthofen's chiefs of staff, and action was or was not taken with mutual agreement. Attack orders could be delivered in minutes to air units. A Gruppe (Group) of Ju 87s and Bf 109s was ready in reserve to respond, and could do so within 45 to 70 minutes. Fliegerkorps VIII and Richthofen {{were led to believe}} they would spend the entire campaign supporting Reichenau in northern Belgium, but the OKL did not inform the Corps that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in a Meuse river breakthrough.|$|E

25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E
