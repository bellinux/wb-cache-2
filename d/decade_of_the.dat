5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land in the first <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelfth century.

It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him.
