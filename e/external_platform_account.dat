40|$|The {{automobile}} industry is {{at a critical}} point {{in the development of}} in-vehicle entertainment and information features. The consumer electronics industry is changing dramatically in the areas of entertainment through audio and video playback, personal efficiency tools, and wireless communications. Equally as significant is the rapid development and feature migration that is occurring between four of the major mobile device categories; mobile phones, smart phones, PDA's, and media players. With this convergence occurring, automakers are finding it more difficult to satisfy the needs of consumers with respect to these new capabilities. In order for the automakers to establish a solution, a new framework needs to be established. The automakers are unable to satisfy this market desire through traditional technology delivery strategies, especially given the fast changing and complex interface that currently exists in this market space. This thesis establishes the framework used to identify and critically evaluate an <b>external</b> <b>platform</b> strategy for the purpose of satisfying the above need. The thesis draws upon leading literature to provide key attributes of successful <b>external</b> <b>platform</b> implementations. The first aspect of the framework established involves ensuring the need for an <b>external</b> <b>platform</b> through complexity and development clockspeed incompatibilities. The second section of the framework involves the evaluation of the architectural attributes that lead to <b>external</b> <b>platform</b> success. Finally, the stakeholders are identified and roles are established. The next phase of the analysis involves the evaluation of two prominent solution proposals using the established framework. These include the standards-based solution model that was developed at Automotive Multimedia Interface Collaboration (AMI-C), and the more recent commercial operating system proposal. (cont) These proposals are evaluated to determine if a specific proposal is better suited to capture the mobility market interface in the automobile than another. The analysis and framework provided it this thesis provides a basis for further tactical evaluation by the automakers that wish {{to meet the needs of}} the mobility market. by Kevin Baughey.

40|$|In 2011 Clarkson and Hiscock (2011) {{presented}} several {{regression models}} for flakes with different platform types {{used to estimate}} original flake mass based on platform surface area and <b>external</b> <b>platform</b> angle {{in order to measure}} reduction intensity on lithic tools. In addition to subsampling and adding <b>external</b> <b>platform</b> surface area, Clarkson and Hiscock increased the accuracy of the regression models by using a 3 D laser scanner to measure platform surface area. Most previous studies multiplied platform width and thickness as an estimate of platform surface area. In this thesis, the regression models created by Clarkson and Hiscock were tested on an archaeological sample from Colmont-Ponderosa, a Middle Palaeolithic site in Limburg, the Netherlands. Instead of a 3 D laser scanner, photogrammetry was used to create 3 D models. It was found that Clarkson and Hiscock’s models are not applicable on the Colmont-Ponderosa sample. New models were created using the same procedure as Clarkson and Hiscock. In addition to platform type subgroups, flake shape subgroups were made. Creating subsamples based on platform type did not influence the correlation between mass and platform surface area. Subsampling based on flake shape resulted in slightly increased correlation, probably because broader flakes have a higher mass to platform surface area than other flakes. Even though a positive linear correlation between <b>external</b> <b>platform</b> angle and mass was found, this variable was not very influential on the final regression models. It was concluded that the newly created regression models are much better at predicting original flake mass for the Colmont-Ponderosa sample. Mass predictions of individual flakes are still not very accurate, which might result in faulty results when introducing new data...|$|R

40|$|The aim of our {{experiment}} Phage and Uracil Response was {{to extend}} the use of bacteriophage T 7 and uracil biological dosimeters for measuring the biologically effective ultraviolet (UV) dose in the harsh extraterrestrial radiation conditions. The biological detectors were exposed in vacuum-tightly cases in the European Space Agency (ESA) astrobiological exposure facility attached to the <b>external</b> <b>platform</b> of Zvezda (EXPOSE-R). EXPOSE-R took off to the International Space Station (ISS) in November 2008 and was installed on the <b>External</b> <b>platform</b> of the Russian module Zvezda of the ISS in March 2009. Our goal {{was to determine the}} dose–effect relation for the formation of photoproducts (i. e. damage to phage DNA and uracil, respectively). The extraterrestrial solar UV radiation ranges over the whole spectrum from vacuum-UV (λ< 200 nm) to UVA (315 nm<λ< 400 nm), which causes photolesions (photoproducts) in the nucleic acids/their components either by photoionization or excitation. However, these wavelengths cause not only photolesions but in a wavelength-dependent efficiency the reversion of some photolesions, too. Our biological detectors measured in situ conditions the resultant of both reactions induced by the extraterrestrial UV radiation. From this aspect the role of the photoreversion in the extension of the biological UV dosimetry are discussed...|$|R
