40|$|Abstract. Color <b>film</b> <b>{{printing}}</b> is {{a special}} printing. Screen printing {{is an important part}} of Color <b>film</b> <b>printing.</b> Because the process of screen printing in color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> is complex, its printing quality is affected by various factors. This paper proposes a set of normative test methods about standard operating, which is to find out these factors of Screen overprinting in Color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> by actual test in production. And it is to improve product quality at the same time. Scope of Screen overprinting in Color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> The Color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> process is printing on a hydraulic permeability paper as what the customer requested. Then transferring the printed pattern to the objects, where the pattern is attached on to achieve the purpose of transferring printing ink. This process is called Color <b>film</b> <b>printing.</b> The whole process of color <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> can be divided into four parts ―pro-printing process, screen printing; offset printing and die-cutting. The oil film of screen printing is used to bear multi color patterns, that is to say which overprinting the multi color patterns on screen printing’s oil film. The production of Color print requires a very high quality of <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> and overprinting accuracy. So do the coordination from the four parts. Screen printing is an extreme important part of Color <b>film</b> <b>printing.</b> And result of improving screen overprinting is the key of improving the quality o...|$|E

50|$|Earlier processes, used on 70 mm <b>film</b> <b>prints</b> {{and special}} presentations of 35 mm <b>film</b> <b>prints,</b> {{recorded}} sound magnetically on ferric oxide tracks bonded to the <b>film</b> <b>print,</b> outside the sprocket holes. 16 mm and Super 8 formats sometimes used a similar magnetic track {{on the camera}} film, bonded {{to one side of}} the film on which the sprocket holes had not been punched ("single perforated") for the purpose. Film of this form is no longer manufactured, but single-perforated film without the magnetic track (allowing an optical sound track) or, in the case of 16 mm, utilising the soundtrack area for a wider picture (Super 16 format) is readily available.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the impact on}} sonographers of converting an ultrasound facility from one that uses film to one that uses a picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Method. This {{study was conducted in}} two parts, part 1 to assess sonographer acceptance of PACS and part 2 to measure how much time was spent dealing with film before and after PACS installation. Results. PACS was well received by the sonographers prior to turning off film, and even better received after cessation of printing film. Significant time savings were gained. Four weeks after conversion, the results of the questionnaire were similar to that after cessation of <b>film</b> <b>printing,</b> indicating that the gains as a result of PACS were realized immediately at the time <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> was stopped. Conclusion. Transition to a filmless PACS was well received by sonographers and improved department efficiency. Significant time savings are realized once <b>film</b> <b>printing</b> stopped. Key words: PACS, filmless radiology, digital ultra-sound, soft-copy interpretation, ultrasonography The picture archiving communication system (PACS) in the Department of Radiology at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital is an integrated multidisciplinary program from acquisition to soft-copy interpretation and archiving. The system used by the ultrasound division is the KinetDx system, made by Acuson. The radiology PACS system also involves a Mitra server and Agfa workstations. Brigham and Women’s Hospital served as an alpha site for the KinetDx product before its commercial release. Three months prior to this study, PACS hardware was installed in the Division of Ultrasound, and soft-copy reading became available, but film was still printed. This process did not improve efficiency nor save film costs and had very little impact on workflow for the sonographer. For the radiologist, images were now available via workstation. After three months, printing of film was abruptly stopped. This was a key step in the implementation o...|$|E

50|$|Created by Kodak and ORC (Optical Radiation Corporation), Cinema Digital Sound was {{the first}} attempt to bring {{multi-channel}} digital sound to first-run theaters. CDS was available on both 35 mm and 70 mm <b>films.</b> <b>Film</b> <b>prints</b> equipped with CDS {{did not have the}} conventional analog optical or magnetic soundtracks to serve as a back-up in case the digital sound was unreadable. Another disadvantage of not having an analog back-up track is that CDS required extra <b>film</b> <b>prints</b> be made for the theaters equipped to play CDS. The three formats that followed, Dolby Digital, DTS and SDDS, can co-exist with each other and the analog optical soundtrack on a single version of the <b>film</b> <b>print.</b> This means that a <b>film</b> <b>print</b> carrying all three of these formats (and the analog optical format, usually Dolby SR) can be played in whichever format the theater is equipped to handle. CDS did not achieve widespread use and ultimately failed. It premiered with the film Dick Tracy and was used with several other films, such as Days of Thunder and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.|$|R
