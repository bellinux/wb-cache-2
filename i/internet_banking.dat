40|$|To date, <b>Internet</b> <b>banks</b> {{worldwide}} have underperformed newly chartered traditional banks {{mainly because}} their higher overhead costs. This paper analyses {{whether this is}} a temporary phenomenon and whether <b>Internet</b> <b>banks</b> may generate scale economies in excess of those available to traditional banks and/or they (and their customers) may accumulate experience with this new business model, which may allow them to perform as well or even better than their peers, the traditional banks. To this end, we have followed the same analytical framework and methodology used by DeYoung (2001, 2002, forthcoming) for <b>Internet</b> <b>banks</b> in the United States although the limitations in the availability of data as well as the existence of different regulatory frameworks and market conditions, particularly in the retail segment, in the fifteen European Union countries have required some modifications to such methodology. The empirical analysis confirms that <b>Internet</b> <b>banks</b> show technologically based scale economies, while no conclusive evidence exists of technology based learning economies. As <b>Internet</b> <b>banks</b> get larger, the profitability gap with traditional banks shrinks. To the extent that <b>Internet</b> <b>banks</b> are struggling to prove themselves a viable business model, European authorities may encourage a larger number of consumers to use this delivery channel, by tackling consumers' security concerns.

25|$|Wilmington {{has become}} a {{national}} financial center for the credit card industry, largely due to regulations enacted by former Governor Pierre S. du Pont, IV in 1981. The Financial Center Development Act of 1981, among other things, eliminated the usury laws enacted by most states, thereby removing the cap on interest rates that banks may legally charge customers. Many major credit card issuers, including Bank of America (formerly MBNA Corporation), Chase Card Services (part of JPMorgan Chase & Co., formerly Bank One/First USA), and Barclays Bank of Delaware (formerly Juniper Bank), are headquartered in Wilmington. The Dutch banking giant ING Groep N.V. headquartered its U.S. <b>internet</b> <b>banking</b> unit, ING Direct (now Capital One 360), in Wilmington. The United Kingdom's HSBC has their American operations headquartered in Wilmington. Wilmington Trust is headquartered in Wilmington at Rodney Square. Barclays and Capital One 360 have very large and prominent locations located along the waterfront of the Christina River. In 1988, the Delaware legislature enacted a law which required a would-be acquirer to capture 85 percent of a Delaware chartered corporation's stock in a single transaction or wait three years before proceeding. This law strengthened Delaware's position as {{a safe haven for}} corporate charters during an especially turbulent time filled with hostile takeovers.|$|E
