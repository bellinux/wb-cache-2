25|$|In {{the absence}} of interference, there are two factors at play when recalling a list of items: the recency and the primacy effects. The recency effect occurs when the {{short-term}} memory is used to remember the most recent items, and the primacy effect occurs when the long-term memory has encoded the earlier items. The recency effect can be eliminated {{if there is a}} period of interference between the input and the output of information extending longer than the holding time of short-term memory (15–30 seconds). This occurs when a person is given subsequent information to recall preceding the recall of the initial information. The primacy effect, however, is not affected by the interference of recall. The elimination of the last few items from memory is due to the displacement of these items from short term memory, by the distracting task. As they have not been recited and rehearsed, they are not moved into long-term memory and are thus lost. A task as simple as counting backwards can change memory recall; however an empty <b>delay</b> <b>interval</b> has no effect. This is because the person can continue to rehearse the items in their working memory to be remembered without interference. Cohen (1989) found that there is better recall for an action in the presence of interference if that action is physically performed during the encoding phase. It has also been found that recalling some items can interfere and inhibit the recall of other items. Another stream of thought and evidence suggests that the effects of interference on recency and primacy are relative, determined by the ratio rule (retention interval to inter item presentation distractor rate) and they exhibit time-scale invariance.|$|E

This Bureau of Mines report looks at the use of millisecond delays in blast design and their effect on the resulting ground vibrations and airblast. A total of 52 production blasts were instrumented and monitored at a surface coal mine in southern Indiana. Arrays of seismographs were used to gather time histories of vibrations and airblast. The data were analyzed for peak values of vibration and airblast and for frequency con-tent. Various <b>delay</b> <b>intervals</b> were used within and between rows of blastholes. <b>Delay</b> <b>intervals</b> within rows were 17 and 42 ms, and those between rows ranged from 30 to 100 msj these intervals are equivalent to 0. 5 and 1. 3 ms/ft within rows and 1. 2 to 4. 3 ms/ft between rows. Sub-sonic <b>delay</b> <b>intervals</b> within rows reduced airblast by 6 dB.

50|$|A {{series of}} lesion studies {{assessed}} {{the role of}} the hippocampus on retrospective memory. In the first delayed response task, nonhuman primates were shown two food wells. For the primates to get a reward, they had to remember which food well was baited. However, the primate had to retain the information about the two prospects until an apparatus was lowered and raised after a <b>delay</b> <b>interval.</b> The results showed that lesions to the hippocampus impaired performance on this task. In a variation of the study, the primates were required to approach the food well that was empty after a delay. It was found that damage to the thalamus also caused impaired performance on both tasks, but at longer delay intervals. These studies confirmed that damage to the hippocampus and thalamus impaired the recall for episodic memory of previously experienced events.|$|E
50|$|Reportedly, pilots {{found that}} the main initial {{difficulty}} in flying the TMR was the regulation of the aircraft's height; this was partially due to the slow response of the engine to throttle movements being commanded by the pilot. The <b>delay</b> <b>interval</b> between the throttle and the engine response was often around the one-to-two second mark; pilots would typically adapt to this peculiarity of the aircraft and become adept at mastering height control. Two {{attempts were made to}} improve the height control, the addition of a simplistic trimmer on the throttle to restrict its possible speed of movement, and the installation of 'throttle-anticipators' that failed to operate as intended. The TMR effectively demonstrated that delay in the height control response would be a major difficulty of VTOL aircraft, and the engines of later VTOL aircraft did typically feature faster response times.|$|E

The order of the faces presented was randomized for each participant. After viewing each face, participants made a JOL either immediately or after a 30 -s delay.

Pigeons were trained to perform an auditory-visual discrimination task by depressing two different foot treadles, one when an auditory tone was presented, and another treadle in the presence of a red light. The results from this experiment showed that pigeons demonstrated the Colavita visual dominance effect. When presented with a bimodal (auditory and visual) stimulus, the pigeons always responded on the visual treadle, implying visual dominance. Furthermore, in a subsequent task, Randich and his colleagues [...] delayed the presentation of the visual stimulus relative to the auditory stimulus. Visual treadle responses by pigeons still occurred with a <b>delay</b> <b>interval</b> of less than 500ms, showing that visual dominance still prevailed when visual stimulus onset was delayed.|$|E

40|$|Separate {{groups of}} rats of three ages (6 month, 15 month or 24 month) {{were trained in}} a two-lever operant chamber on one of two {{versions}} of a paired-trial delayed response task involving either matching or non-matching of the choice response to a sample lever. The older rats were unimpaired in learning either version of the task during initial training with no (0 s) delay between the sample and choice responses. However, when variable 0 - 24 s <b>delay</b> <b>intervals</b> were introduced, the 24 -month group was impaired on acquisition of the delayed non-matching task, and both the 15 - and 24 -month groups were impaired on acquisition of the delayed matching task compared to the 6 -month group.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} investigate the relationship of <b>delay</b> <b>interval</b> behavior, food panel pressing, {{on the performance of}} an antecedent response, lever pressing. Albino rats were trained in a modified Skinner box with a hinged food cup panel and a removable lever. The delay of reinforcement gradient for lever pressing at 4, 10, 30, and 50 seconds delay was determined under two different delay conditions. In Condition 1, the stimulus conditions, sDl (light on), remained constant throughout the <b>delay</b> <b>interval.</b> Under Condition 11, the stimulus conditions sDl remained constant up {{to the end of the}} presented <b>delay</b> <b>interval,</b> and a discrete auditory stimulus, sD 2, signalled the end of this interval. Under both conditions 1 and 11, the presentation of the terminal primary reinforcement was contingent on a panel press response. 	The animals of both groups were initially trained on a discrimination in which panel responses were reinforced at the end of the <b>delay</b> <b>interval</b> in the presence of sDl, Condition 1, or sD and the stimulus trace of sD 2 (Condition 11). Panel responses were never reinforced in the absence of these stimuli, a condition which prevailed on an average of 3 minutes (VI 3) between trials.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new control strategy for linear time invariant (LTI) systems with a single time delay. The delay appears within the feedback control logic. Earlier research on this class of systems determines the <b>delay</b> <b>intervals</b> for stable operations, exhaustively, exactly and completely. The newly developed inverting control logic suggests a very practical procedure of reversing {{the sign of the}} feedback control gain, in order to enlarge the stable <b>delay</b> <b>intervals.</b> This gives some additional capabilities to control system designer. The sign inversion idea is based on a critical mathematical feature of LTI-TDS (Time Delay Systems) which was first recognized under a paradigm called the Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots (CTCR). Several example case studies demonstrate the practicality and the advantages of the new control law. Copyright © 2002 IFA...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that the {{cerebellum}} and basal ganglia are involved in sub-second and supra-second timing, respectively. To test this hypothesis at the cellular level, we examined the activity of single neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus in monkeys performing the oculomotor version of the self-timing task. Animals were trained to report the passage of time of 400, 600, 1200, or 2400 ms following a visual cue by making self-initiated memory-guided saccades. We found a sizeable preparatory neuronal activity before self-timed saccades across <b>delay</b> <b>intervals,</b> while the time course of activity correlated with the trial-by-trial variation of saccade latency in different ways depending on the length of the <b>delay</b> <b>intervals.</b> For the shorter <b>delay</b> <b>intervals,</b> the ramping up of neuronal firing rate started just after the visual cue and the rate of rise of neuronal activity correlated with saccade timing. In contrast, for the longest delay (2400 ms), the preparatory activity started late during the delay period, and its onset time correlated with self-timed saccade latency. Because electrical microstimulation applied to the recording sites during saccade preparation advanced self-timed but not reactive saccades, regardless of their directions, the signals in the cerebellum may have a causal role in self-timing. We suggest that the cerebellum may regulate timing in both sub-second and supra-second ranges, although its relative contribution might be greater for sub-second than for supra-second time intervals...|$|R
40|$|When {{training}} and testing are conducted with trials {{presented in a}} delayed matching to sample (DMTS) format, mediating behaviors may occur during the delay that separates sample offset and comparison onset. In some cases, the mediating behavior can interfere with or enhance the maintenance of correct responding. The present experiment studied how mediating behavior could have influenced responding, according to equivalence classes by manipulation of a distractor task during the <b>delay</b> <b>interval</b> in DMTS test trials for derived relations. After training the baseline relations for equivalence classes, the emergent relations tests were presented with 6 -s delays. In Condition A, participants had to solve addition and subtraction tasks during the delay intervals in the emergent relations test trials.

Adverse reactions to relatively long <b>delay</b> <b>intervals</b> are often observed during clinical use of DAF, and may result from improper "matching " of the delayed signal.
