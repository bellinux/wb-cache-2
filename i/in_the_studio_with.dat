5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

5|$|Summerteeth (stylized as summerteeth) is {{the third}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 9, 1999 by Reprise Records. The album was heavily influenced lyrically by 20th century literature, as well as singer Jeff Tweedy's marital problems. Unlike previous albums, Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Pro Tools. Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio, a contrast to the band's previous albums, which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs.|$|E

5|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Megadeth's fifth studio album began in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California. Max Norman {{was chosen to}} produce the album, as the band was pleased with his mixing of Rust in Peace. Megadeth spent nearly four months <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Norman, writing and recording what became the band's most commercially successful effort, Countdown to Extinction. The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member. Ellefson explained that the band changed its approach to songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.|$|E
5|$|The set {{depicting}} Katsuki Manor {{was based}} on the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. These sets are decorated with props evocative of feudal-era aristocrats, such as kimono and armor, personally chosen by Mizoguchi. The scene where the protagonists travel through Lake Biwa on a boat was in fact shot on a pool <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> <b>with</b> added smoke. The assistant directors had to push the boat through the cold waters. Miyagawa identified this as one of the scenes shot from a crane.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band {{had been working on}} new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 2014, wife of Max Bemis, Sherri DuPree-Bemis {{published}} an instagram photo {{stating that the}} new Say Anything album is almost mixed. The band's record, Hebrews, was released June 10, 2014 on Equal Vision Records. The album was the first album that was self-produced by front-man Max Bemis. Bemis worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> audio engineer Garron DuPree for many months while recording the album at Bemis and Dupree's own studio in Tyler, TX. The album was mixed by mix engineer Brad Wood, and mastered by Emily Lazar. It returned to the collaborative nature of the band's earlier material, with guest vocals including Jon Simmons of Balance and Composure, Tom Delonge of Blink 182 and Angels and Airwaves, Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra and Jeremy Bolm of Touche Amore. The album was met with positive reception by fans and critics upon its release, and the group embarked on a successful headlining tour {{in support of the}} album in the summer of 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{four and a}} half months at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California, beginning in mid-June 1997, the longest Madonna had ever worked on an album. For most of the recording process, only three other people were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>with</b> Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours he spent in the studio.|$|E
