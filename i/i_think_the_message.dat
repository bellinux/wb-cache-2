40|$|Over {{the last}} few months I've been {{thinking}} about how people perform estimates on software teams. I've take time- not enough- to look through some of the research on estimation and try and understand how we can improve estimates. Originally I was interested in "retrospective estimation "- how we quantify the time we spent on a task which has been already been completed. However, it seems the research on this topic is thin on the ground; my attention turned to "predictive estimation "- judging {{how long it will take}} to perform a task. What follows are some very rough notes which result from reading several research papers, and some comments of my own. I intent to extract one or two (slightly) better written blog entries from this work and provide the full notes (the working drafts if you like) to a) better explain myself and b) in the hope that others will build on this work.

50|$|The Spanish layer, {{entering}} last, also terminates earliest. The Chinese layer, entering second, yet outlives the Spanish. Finally {{only the}} Malay layer is left sounding alone, {{as at the}} beginning. But five minutes {{before the end of}} the last tabuh, the instruments from the Chinese and Spanish ensembles re-enter by gradual degrees to be reintegrated as a symphony orchestra. Ching then inserts a dissonant, polytonal version of the opening of Wagner's Das Rheingold, the intervals inverted into the opening of The Star-spangled Banner. Explaining the work's unexpected conclusion, the composer writes:While Tabuh VIII carries on to its own close, it is engulfed by portents of post-1898 events—in particular, the sinking of the USS Maine—in the unmistakable guise of the Wagnerian Rhinegold of free-market capitalism and election-year demagoguery. The bar-lines, once disparate, now line up, as if by way of metaphor for the cultural levelling of the global village. This is at once apotheosis and lampoon, as the quotation and metamorphoses of the world’s best-known national anthem make clear. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> intended in my Third Symphony is not too obscure: The best, the richest, the most glorious part of a country’s heritage is also her past—in the case of a country like the Philippines, first and foremost her Asian past, shared to a large extent with her East and Southeast Asian neighbours, but also, since the Spanish Conquest, the high civilisation of Renaissance and post-Renaissance Europe, which touched off many a sympathetic vibration in her native spirit. 1898 may have brought about the end of Spanish rule, but it was also the logical culmination of over three hundred years of it. What followed, on the other hand, was a fundamental psychical disruption. The sense of the hierarchical, the numinous, the ceremonious, and the patrician—common to Asia and Europe alike—has no place in the Republic of Mob Rule and Pursuit of Profit. Yet we let it vanish at our peril. Human rites, as much as rights, are worth dying for.|$|E

50|$|In his own words, Morgan said: I was {{a student}} back in 2002 at (then) BIFHE on the Performing Arts Acting Course in Tower Street. I have now {{recently}} been contacted by many of my past colleagues informing me of the plans to cancel the performing arts course and I am completely appalled {{that this is the}} case. At the age of sixteen, a boy from Armagh, BIFHE was {{one of the very few}} options I had of being able to pursue my passion and ambition to act. Without that course I would have been lost and forced to choose subjects in a local technical college that I had no interest in doing and things could have taken a very different turn for my future.As it happens, BIFHE was there for me and offered me the opportunity to hone and develop my desire to act, study the craft that acting has the potential to be, learn from my peers and have the opportunity to perform in a safe environment, to gain a qualification and enabled me to then progress on the study at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and I have been working consistently in the profession now for nearly eight years and I credit BIFHE as being a vital step in where I am now.The impact of cancelling this course will have a detrimental effect to all those young people, like me, who are trying to make a future and a career out of performance. What message is being sent here by cancelling the course? To me it's a clear message of dismissal to the talent that exists in our country, it's a denial of development, it's an ignorance to the possibility of aspiration in the business and it's a failure to support a vital and thriving industry which Northern Ireland is now benefitting from.It's hard enough to try and make it as an actor from Northern Ireland as it is. I was forced to leave the country after studying at BIFHE because the opportunity to study at drama school wasn't available at home. The knowledge that the opportunity to enable young people to even apply (and have the ability and confidence to apply) to drama school is now being cut off just seems ludicrous. Are we saying that it's ok for major filming projects to come and film in Northern Ireland but our young people here aren't worthy to be trained to be a part of it?What are our options? How can we prevent this from happening? And if our message and our voice isn't being heard on this, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> becomes even clearer: acting and performance is not being treated as a serious career option for people in Northern Ireland. And I, and many other Northern Irish actors working professionally today, are here to say that it is achievable but we need all the help we can get.I hope in some way that we can turn things around and not let this disappointing blow happen to the future of our country's aspiring performers.|$|E

40|$|Those {{convicted of}} major drug crimes {{should be given}} {{mandatory}} life sentences, the IMO has agreed. Proposing the motion for the IMO to lobby the Minister for Justice to impose such sentences, Mayo GP Dr Oliver Whyte said that while misery was being imposed on our society, the “gang lords” were living in style in large houses and driving large cars. “The gardaí don’t {{seem to be able}} to get them, but the Sunday papers seem to have no trouble getting them. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> should go out to the people involved in supplying drugs that if they get caught… they will be locked up and we will throw away the key. ” Tralee GP Dr Bernard Ruane referenced New York City’s recent crime prevention measures, which had increased safety on the streets through a policy of “rounding-up drug dealers and putting them away for a long, long time”. Expressing his concerns, however, Public Health Specialist Prof Joe Barry questioned if a mandatory life sentence would actually solve the problem. “The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and taking away their assets tends to have a much greater impact,” he suggested, warning that imposing a mandatory life sentence might actually make things worse. Dr Liam Lynch, a GP in Neilstown — which he said had a significant concentration of the victims of drug crime — wanted a comprehensive plan which would involve looking after the victims of drugs and the ‘industry of drugs’, as he put it, in a comprehensive fashion.

40|$|Abstract The {{transformation}} {{of a normal}} cell into a cancer cell takes place through a sequence of {{a small number of}} discrete genetic events, somatic mutations: thus, cancer can be regarded properly as a genetic disease of somatic cells. The analogy between evolution of organisms and evolution of cell populations is compelling: in both cases what drives change is mutation, but it is Darwinian selection that enables clones that have a growth advantage to expand, thus providing a larger target size for the next mutation to hit. The search for molecular lesions in tumors has taken on a new dimension thanks to two powerful technologies: the micro-arrays for quantitative analysis of global gene expresssion (the transcriptome); and ‘deep’ sequencing for the global analysis of the entire genome (or at least the exome). The former offers the most complete phenotypic characterization of a tumor we could ever hope for – we could call this the ultimate phenotype; the latter can identify all the somatic mutations in an individual tumor – we could call this the somatic genotype. However, there is definitely the risk that while we are ‘drowned by data, we remain thirsty for knowledge’. If we want to heed the teachings of Lorenzo Tomatis, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> is clear: we ought {{to take advantage of the}} new powerful technologies – not by becoming their slaves, but remaining their masters.

The one pointed out fi rst is to inform "high woman" about the intense love which does "love death". "Tales of Ise" then this motif could use Nijo queen chapter and paragraph repeatedly as fi rst, but I noticed that feelings to an archduchess of kannabi are also expressed in a word as "love death" in "MatsuranomiyaMonogatari". "Matsuranomiya Monogatari" is consumed with the love a main character doesn't bear and the fl ow which wanders to a foreign land is also parallel with "Tales of Ise". "Matsuranomiya Monogatari" but Ujitada's mind was drawn, making "Tales of Ise" a pre text, and argued that a story is being advanced.
