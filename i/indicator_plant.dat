40|$|Citrus {{sudden death}} (CSD) {{transmission}} was studied by graft-inoculation and under natural conditions. Young sweet orange trees on Rangpur rootstock {{were used as}} <b>indicator</b> <b>plants.</b> They were examined regularly {{for one or two}} characteristic markers of CSD: (i) presence of a yellow-stained layer of thickened bark on the Rangpur rootstock, and (ii) infection with the CSD-associated marafivirus. Based on these two markers, transmission of CSD was obtained, not only when budwood for graft-inoculation was taken from symptomatic, sweet orange trees on Rangpur, but also when the budwood sources were asymptomatic sweet orange trees on Cleopatra mandarin, indicating that the latter trees are symptomless carriers of the CSD agent. For natural transmission, 80 young <b>indicator</b> <b>plants</b> were planted within a citrus plot severely affected by CSD. Individual insect-proof cages were built around 40 <b>indicator</b> <b>plants,</b> and the other 40 <b>indicator</b> <b>plants</b> remained uncaged. Only two of the 40 caged <b>indicator</b> <b>plants</b> were affected by CSD, whereas 17 uncaged <b>indicator</b> <b>plants</b> showed CSD symptoms and were infected with the marafivirus. An additional 12 uncaged <b>indicator</b> <b>plants</b> became severely affected with citrus variegated chlorosis and were removed. These results strongly suggest that under natural conditions, CSD is transmitted by an aerial vector, such as an insect, and that the cages protected the trees against infection by the vector.

40|$|International audienceField {{investigations}} in 361 liver fluke infected cattle- or sheep-breeding farms on acid soil {{were carried out}} during thirty years in March and April to record <b>indicator</b> <b>plants</b> {{in relation to the}} category of site colonized by the intermediate host of liver fluke, the snail Galba truncatula.

50|$|Plant {{species will}} respond {{differentially}} {{to the presence}} of viruses due to variation in susceptibility. This can cause differences in observable symptoms as well as the magnitude of those symptoms. For instance, a plant may harbor a viral infection and show no observable symptoms yet still be negatively affected. Therefore, some plant species become useful as indicators because their symptoms will develop at a faster rate, are more obvious, or are more consistent for diagnosis. Common techniques of transferring a viral infection from a suspected plant to an <b>indicator</b> <b>plant</b> include grafting or sap transmission. However, ELISA testing, related serological tests, and direct electron microscope observation of viruses are more modern methods for detection.|$|E
50|$|The third method {{looks for}} {{concentrations}} of <b>indicator</b> <b>plant</b> species {{in an area}} of interest. Some uranium ore bodies contain higher concentrations of certain elements, such as selenium, than the surrounding host rock in which they are found. Certain plants that concentrate these elements act as indicator species for likely ore body locations. Mapping these plants provides information about areas in which further prospecting should be done. For example, in areas such as the Colorado Plateau, various species of Astragalus are selenium concentrators (A. pattersoni, A. preussi, A. thompsonae). Other indicator plants for sulfur and calcium, such as Eriogonum inflatum and Oenothera caespitosa help to identify likely areas also, especially in conjunction with the selenium indicators.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to fewer}} {{bumblebees}} {{in rural areas}} these days, {{it is necessary to}} look for alternative habitats for the active protection of these very important pollinators. The research was carried out in The Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, in Wrocław, Poland. In the garden, approximately 2000 plant species were cultivated, of which 185 were visited by bumblebees. Amongst them, 57 plant species were deemed very attractive and were determined to be indicators for 7 bumblebee species. Indicator species for bumblebees ranged between 6 for Bombus pratorum to up to 20 for B. pascuorum. Monarda didyma was an <b>indicator</b> <b>plant</b> to 6 recorded bumblebee species.

40|$|Four {{distinct}} vegetation {{types are}} found in close proximity along an exposed section of the southern central coast of British Columbia. A coastal fringe of coniferous forest a few hundred metres wide is separated by a steep ecotone from an inland peatland-forest complex. The objectives {{of this study were}} (1) to describe the plant communities along the transition from forest to peatland, and (2) to identify some of the major environmental factors associated with those communities using <b>indicator</b> <b>plant</b> analysis. The coastal forest is dominated by Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, Picea sitchensis, and Chamaecyparis nootkaensis. Characteristic understory species include Gaultheria shallon and Blechnum spicant. Inland from the coastal forest are transitional forest stands with a species-rich understory including Cornus canadensis, Hylocomium splendens, and Vaccinium parvifolium. The peatlands are poor fens characterized by thickets of Pinus contorta and Chamaecyparis nootkaensis among open areas dominated by species such as Sphagnum sp., Empetrum nigrum, Juniperus communis, and bogs characterized by Myrica gale, Eriophorum angustifolium, and Sanguisorba officinalis. <b>Indicator</b> <b>plant</b> analysis identified differences in the ground surface materials, soil moisture and nutrient regime between the vegetation types. The general trend is for an increase in soil moisture from the forest vegetation to the peatlands and a concurrent change from the Mor humus forms that dominate the coastal forest floor to the surface groundwater table of the peatlands. These environmental differences between forest and peatland are likely related to the steeper slopes typically found in the fringe forest vegetation...|$|E

40|$|Mongolia´s {{grassland}} (steppe) {{is reported}} to be vulnerable to climate change, degradation, and densifi cation. The traditional Mongolian pastoral herding system is currently transforming due to changes in market relations and economic developments, and this transformation has an impact on species composition and biodiversity. For this study, we observed the current situation of the fl ora in the north-western Mongolian territories to provide data on plant species occurrence in this remote area. A vegetation assessment was conducted for 15 locations in June and July 2016. <b>Indicator</b> <b>plant</b> species were determined to assess the level of grazing and degradation, as well as the respective steppe sub-type. The conservation status of all recorded plant species was assessed in accordance with the IUCN Red List. In total, 106 vascular plant species belonging to 73 genera and 26 families were recorded. Four endemic plant species were observed. All locations were classifi ed into three steppe sub-types: Desert-steppe, dry-steppe and mountain-steppe. A large number of degradation <b>indicator</b> <b>plant</b> species were observed in almost all locations. No endangered species in the Mongolian IUCN Red List were observed.
