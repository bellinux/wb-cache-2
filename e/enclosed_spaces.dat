5|$|Battling the Flood, Covenant, {{and human}} forces are the Sentinels: robotic drones {{designed}} by an extinct race called the Forerunners {{to protect their}} structures and prevent Flood outbreaks. Sentinels are able to hover around in <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces</b> and produce an energy shield when under attack. They lack durability, but use powerful laser beam weapons and are immune to infection by the Flood.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces</b> such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} saucers positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces</b> of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Thomas' group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.|$|E

5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology anchored to a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down, some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces.</b>|$|E

25|$|Two basic {{types of}} {{entrapment}} are significant hazards for scuba divers: Inability to navigate {{out of an}} enclosed space, and physical entrapment which prevents the diver from leaving a location. The first case can usually be avoided by staying out of <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces,</b> and when {{the objective of the}} dive includes penetration of <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces,</b> taking precautions {{such as the use of}} lights and guidelines. The most common form of physical entrapment is getting snagged on ropes, lines or nets, and use of a cutting implement is the standard method of dealing with the problem. The risk of entanglement can be reduced by careful configuration of equipment to minimise those parts which can easily be snagged, and allow easier disentanglement. Other forms of entrapment such as getting wedged into tight spaces can often be avoided, but must otherwise be dealt with as they happen. The assistance of a buddy may be helpful where possible.|$|E
25|$|Public {{transport}} ceased, {{apart from}} the London Underground, and the ambulance service stopped functioning, forcing users to transport themselves to hospital. The smog was so dense that it even seeped indoors, resulting in the cancellation or abandonment of concerts and film screenings as visibility decreased in large <b>enclosed</b> <b>spaces,</b> and stages and screens became harder to see from the seats. Outdoor sports events were also cancelled.|$|E
25|$|With a {{flash point}} of 35°C, {{n-butanol}} presents a moderate fire hazard: it is slightly more flammable than kerosene or diesel fuel but less flammable {{than many other}} common organic solvents.

Post-remediation verification of moisture content and fungal growth is required for successful remediation.

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{outbreak}} {{was found to be}} a previously unknown hantavirus, which causes a new form of illness known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome or HPS.
