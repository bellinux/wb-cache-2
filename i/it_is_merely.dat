5|$|Critics {{also note}} Flagg’s penchant for evil. Tony Magistrale, author of Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre to The Dark Half sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain {{comparing}} him to Iago, Edmund and Richard III, contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg’s evil {{is based on}} his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction.|$|E

During Michael's anti-drug meeting, he misidentifies hookah as an illegal drug; Toby points {{out the fact that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a pipe. Dwight {{notes that he}}'ll have to bring in his bō staff, a long staff weapon used in Okinawa and feudal Japan, to protect the office. Jim later notes that Dwight was dressed like a member of the disco group the Village People.|$|E
5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process the packet should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E
60|$|For see, my friends. If we were {{training}} a young animal, {{how should we}} treat <b>it?</b> If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>merely</b> weak, we should strengthen and exercise <b>it.</b> If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>merely</b> ignorant, we should teach <b>it.</b> If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> lazy, we should begin to punish it; but gently, that it might still have confidence, faith in us, and pleasure in its work.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> the side effects of increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the MOT inspection provides an irrefutable record of a vehicle's mileage. However, although the mileage is recorded during the test, {{no part of the}} inspection requires the test station to verify that this is indeed the actual mileage. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> recorded, and any tampering of an odometer would not be discovered as part of the MOT inspection.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if Ray had offered {{access to the}} bridge and {{driveway}} after selling Joe the land, {{there may not be}} an easement by estoppel. In this instance, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> inconvenient if Ray revokes access to the driveway. Joe did not purchase the land and build the house in reliance on access to the driveway and bridge. Joe will need to find a separate theory to justify an easement.|$|E

25|$|Airbnb is {{an online}} {{marketplace}} and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. The {{company does not}} own any lodging; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in conjunction with every booking. It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries, {{and the cost of}} lodging is set by the host.|$|E
25|$|In addition, w is {{sometimes}} listed separately and after v, although officially <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> {{a variant of}} the latter and can be alphabetized as v. Similarly, š and ž are variants of s and z, but they are often overlooked, as they are only used in some relatively new loanwords and foreign names, and may be replaced with sh and zh, respectively, if it is technically impossible to reproduce š and ž. The Finnish keyboard layout doesn't include š or ž; thus, in practice, only highly formal sources such as official texts, encyclopedias or Helsingin Sanomat use them.|$|E
25|$|A rationalistic or purely sociological {{understanding}} of the church, according to which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a human organization with structures and activities, is mistaken. The visible church and its structures do exist but the church is more, as it is guided by the Holy Spirit: Although the juridical principles, on which the Church rests and is established, derive from the divine constitution given to it by Christ {{and contribute to the}} attaining of its supernatural end, nevertheless that which lifts the Society of Christians far above the whole natural order is the Spirit of our Redeemer who penetrates and fills every part of the Church.|$|E

25|$|The term heterophobia is {{confusing}} {{for some people}} for several reasons. On the one hand, some {{look at it as}} just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.|$|E
25|$|The {{route is}} one of a handful of state-maintained {{highways}} in New York to culminate in a traffic circle or roundabout at one end of the route. NY635, in neighboring Onondaga County, ends at NY298 and exit35 of the New York State Thruway via Carrier Circle, a large traffic circle in Syracuse. NY140 west of Albany ends at a roundabout with NY85 at its western end. Interstate587 outside Kingston also ends at a roundabout with NY28 and exit19 of the Thruway. NY27 also ends in an apparent traffic circle at its eastern terminus on Montauk Point; however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> a closed loop created by the highway running back into itself (the same feature is present on U.S. Route9 just short of the Canadian border).|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the two {{disagreed}} {{about the}} extent to which the deepest elements of Chassidic wisdom should be taught openly. Rabbi Dovber, in his magnum opus Sha'ar HaYichud (The Gate of Unity), explains the entire spiritual superstructure of creation. Rabbi Aharon, on the other hand, argued that it was dangerous to discuss certain aspects of creation because it could lead a person to inadvertently view God anthropomorphically. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>merely</b> enough for a person to know that God is so great that His Existence precludes the existence of any created beings, but that created beings exist, nonetheless. This very paradox is a testimony to the greatness of God. While Rabbi Aharon's teachings involve some of the deepest aspects of Kabbalistic wisdom, they nonetheless entreat the reader to use the deep intellectual wisdom of Kabbala in order to inspire simple love and fear for God. This was the foundation of Rabbi Dovber's doctrine as well, and in fact a cornerstone in Rabbi Shneur Zalman's own Tanya. The difference lay primarily in the outer (Chitzonius) emotional conduct Rabbi Aharon expected of his followers, and the intense manifestation of self-effacement Rabbi Dovber expected of his.|$|E
