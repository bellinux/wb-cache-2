By the end of the season the BT49 was [...] "arguably the fastest Cosworth-powered car", but Piquet lost the title to Jones at the penultimate race of the year, the Canadian Grand Prix, when a development engine failed while he was leading the race. The BT49s driven by the team's second drivers—Zunino and then from mid-season Mexican Héctor Rebaque—either retired or finished outside the points, with the exception of Rebaque's sixth place at the Canadian race. The team finished third in the constructors' championship behind Williams and Ligier, unable to compete with only one car scoring points.|$|E

50|$|Monza, being another <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{would prove}} to be another McLaren {{dominated}} race, with both sitting on the front row, again with both Ferrari's behind. The race fell into regular routine as Senna lead from the start and Prost close behind. Prost had actually won the start, but as he changed gear from 1st to 2nd his Honda engine began to misfire allowing Senna to power past before the Retifillo chicane. At {{the end of the first}} lap with Senna holding a 2-second lead, Prost, correctly believing the misfire was bad enough that he wouldn't finish the race, turned his turbo boost up to full and gave chase. However, on lap 35 of 51, Prost's championship hopes seemed to evaporate when his Honda engine finally blew. The tifosi cheered as their drivers were shifted to second and third, albeit some 30 seconds behind Senna, and Honda were left embarrassed with one of their engines expiring on their main rivals (Ferrari) home track. Unfortunately for McLaren though, what Prost had done was force Senna to use too much fuel in his desire to stay in the lead (many in the pits, including his former Lotus team boss Peter Warr believed that Senna had effectively been suckered by Prost and should have realised that if he was using too much fuel then Prost was also, something Prost did not usually do). This forced Senna to back off over the last 16 laps in order to ensure a finish, and it allowed the Ferrari's to close the gap from 30 seconds when Prost retired, to just over 5 seconds with just two laps remaining as Senna came up to lap the Williams of Jean-Louis Schlesser, standing in for the still unwell Nigel Mansell.|$|E
50|$|The prestigious French {{event was}} held {{for the first time}} at the Rouen-Les-Essarts circuit in 1952, where it would be held four more times over the next 16 years. Rouen was a very <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>circuit</b> located in the {{northern}} part of the country that was made up mostly of high speed bends. But the race returned to Reims in 1953, where the circuit, which was originally made up of 3 straights (with a few slight kinks) and 3 slow corners had been modified to bypass the town of Gueux, making it even faster. Reims now had 2 straights (including the even longer back straight), 2 very fast bends and 2 slow corners. This race was a classic, with Fangio in a Maserati and Briton Mike Hawthorn in a Ferrari having a race-long battle for the lead, with Hawthorn taking the checkered flag. 1954 was another special event, and this marked Mercedes's return to top-flight road racing led by Alfred Neubauer, 20 years after their first return to Grand Prix racing- in France. After 2 wins for the works Maserati team that year at Buenos Aires and Spa, Fangio was now driving for the 3-pointed star of Stuttgart and he and teammate Karl Kling effectively dominated the race from start to finish with their advanced W196's. It was not a popular win- Mercedes, a German car manufacturer, had won on French soil- only 9 years after the German occupation of France had ended. The French Grand Prix was cancelled in 1955 because of the Le Mans disaster, and Mercedes withdrew from all racing at the end of that year. The race continued to be held at Reims in 1956, another spell at a lengthened Rouen-Les-Essarts in 1957 and back to Reims again from 1958-1961, 1963 and one last event in 1966. The 1958 race was marred by the fatal accident of Italian Luigi Musso, driving a works Ferrari, and it was also Fangio's last Formula One race. Hawthorn, who like many other F1 drivers at the time, held Fangio in very high regard; and was about to lap Fangio (driving in an outdated Maserati) on the last lap on the pit straight when, he slowed down and let Fangio cross the line before him so the respected Argentine driver could complete the whole race distance. Hawthorn won, and Fangio finished 4th.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{new type}} of {{microwave}} transmission line structure is proposed {{in order to reduce}} the crosstalk between transmission line circuits. In this structure, the edge of the metal strip line is periodically corrugated with subwavelength grooves of appropriate geometric parameters, and thus the transmission lines can support highly localized spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at microwave frequencies. The theoretical simulation shows that the crosstalk between such a transmission line and a conventional strip line is very low at microwave frequencies, and this is further verified experimentally. This type of transmission line structures has great potential applications in <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>circuit</b> systems. 1...|$|E
