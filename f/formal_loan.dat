Using a household survey from Indonesia, we estimate the impact of having a land title on formal credit access {{and the effect of}} using a land title as collateral on size of a <b>formal</b> <b>loan.</b> The lengthy and costly process of titling suggests that possession alone could signal important personal characteristics to the bank. Our data set lets us separate the effect of actually offering the title as collateral from the effect of merely possessing the title because 60 % of titled households with formal loans do not use the title as collateral. Using instrumental variables to control for the endo-geneity of possessing a title, we find that having a formal title significantly increases the household’s probability of having had a <b>formal</b> <b>loan.</b> Offering the title as security, not just being titled, has a positive significant effect on the average loan size. However when we study first time borrowers, we find that the effect of offering the title as collat-eral is not significantly larger than the positive effect one gets simply for being titled. We attribute this reversal to the increased importance of signaling when banks know less about potential borrowers. JEL Codes G 21 O 12 O 17 and Keywords: credit access, Indonesia, land title...|$|E

But formal lenders provide {{much more in}} production lending, than do informal lenders, often at a higher cost than what they can recover. The Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP), for example, providing about 90 percent of <b>formal</b> <b>loans</b> in rural areas, incurs high costs on loan defaults. Like other governments, the Government of Pakistan subsidized the formal scheme {{on the grounds that}} lending to agriculture is a high-risk activity, because of covariate risk. Because farm credit schemes are subsidized, policymakers must know if these schemes are worth supporting. Using recent data from a large household survey from rural Pakistan, the authors estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ADBP loans. To estimate credit's impact, they use a two-stage method, which takes into account the endogeneity of borrowing. Clearly, formal lenders are biased toward larger farmers with collateral. Large landowners, who tend to represent only four percent of rural households, get 42 percent of <b>formal</b> <b>loans.</b> Landless, and subsistence farmers, who represent more than 69 percent of rural households, receive only 23 percent of <b>formal</b> <b>loans.</b> ADBP loans improve household welfare but, although large farmers receive most of ADBP finance, the impact of credit is greater for small farmers than for large farmers.

Using data from the 2006 Rural Household Survey, this paper investigates farmers’ borrowings from both formal and informal sources with higher/lower interest, by looking into both demand and supply of loan. Consistent with the theory and previous studies, age follows an inverted U-shaped pattern in its relationship with the probability of borrowing from informal loan with higher interest. Our study shows that the impact of age disappears for the <b>formal</b> <b>loan</b> participation. In addition, high income and saving imply lower credit constraints.

40|$|It is a truism that {{households}} {{in developing countries}} that face idiosyncratic income/expenditure shocks may face difficulties in smoothing consumption through formal credit institutions, and hence rely, at least partially, on informal ties. While this issue has been explored extensively in the literature for rural areas, the picture reflecting the urban setting remains relatively uninvestigated. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting an exclusively designed survey implemented in Istanbul. The results of a multi-stage logit estimation of the survey data indicate that monetary transfers from social networks and formal loans are complements, while general usage of network help implies an increased likelihood of asking for network help for easy and/or favorable access to credit. In addition, material security emerges as the key determinant of both eligibility for and use of a <b>formal</b> <b>loan,</b> and of having network help available in easing the loan approval process by banks. ...|$|E

Farmers - both those who exclusively use <b>formal</b> <b>loans</b> and those who also use informal loans - remain credit-constrained; both types overutilize labour {{in order to reduce the}} need for working capital. However, the credit constraint is actually milder for the informal borrowers: the implicit shadow price of working capital is substantially higher in the group that only takes <b>formal</b> <b>loans</b> than in the group that also uses informal loans. These results suggest that informal lenders - with their closer ties to the individual farmers - remain more successful in identifying those smallholder farmers that are most likely to use the borrowed funds successfully. Informal lenders have an information advantage that formal microlenders lack: the latter need to find routes to access this information in order for formal microcredit schemes to succeed. ...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of {{participation}} in agricultural value chains on the welfare of smallholders? Contract farming, wherein a processing firm delegates its production of agricultural commodities to growers, is often viewed as a means of increasing smallholder welfare in developing countries. Because the problem posed by the nonrandom participation of grower smallholders in contract farming has so far not been dealt with convincingly, however, whether participation in contract farming actually increases smallholder welfare is still up for debate. This paper uses an experimentally derived nonparametric measure of willingness to pay to enter contract farming to control for actual participation in contract farming. Using data from Madagascar, results indicate that participation in contract farming is associated with a 10 - to 16 -percent increase in income; a 15 -percent decrease in income volatility; a two-month decrease in the duration of the hungry season; and a 31 -percent increase in the likelihood of receiving a <b>formal</b> <b>loan.</b> ...|$|E

Second, female entrepreneurs only apply when they expect to be successful. Since they “perceive” access to finance to be more problematic for women,female entrepreneurs are discouraged from applying. Third, female entrepreneurs “perceive” they have insufficient access to financial knowledge which again will prevent them from applying.

40|$|This paper compares lending {{policies}} of formal, informal and semiformal lenders {{with respect to}} household lending in Vietnam. The analysis suggests that the probability of using formal or semiformal credit increases if borrowers provide collateral, a guarantor and/or borrow for business-related activities. The probability of using informal credit increases for female borrowers. It also appears that the probability of using formal credit increases in household welfare {{up to a certain}} threshold, but at a decreasing rate. In addition, the paper discerns the determinants of probability of default across lender types. Default risk of formal credit appears to be strongly affected by <b>formal</b> <b>loan</b> contract terms, e. g., loan interest rate and form of loan repayment, whereas default risk on informal loans is significantly related to the presence of propinquity and other internal characteristics of the borrowing household. Overall, the study raises several important implications for the screening, monitoring and enforcement instruments that may be employed by different types of lenders.

40|$|Although housing {{can be a}} {{powerful}} channel of monetary policy transmission this channel can be weakened by social customs and financial liberalization as well as accompanying innovation that create alternatives to bank mortgages controlled by a central bank. This paper utilizes some unique questions in the 1999 and 2002 Cyprus Surveys of Consumer Finances, as well as data from the 1998 and 2001 US Surveys of Consumer Finances, in order to study the role of social customs (in the form of parental housing gifts) and financial liberalization for the incidence of homeownership rates, mortgage debt and borrowing constraints. Unlike existing studies of financially developed countries, the data from the Cyprus Surveys suggest that only a very small proportion of Cypriot households are credit constrained and that a number of important economic characteristics of the household are irrelevant for homeownership and for the use of mortgages. Our findings suggest that the presence of such customs may interfere with the monetary transmission mechanism by limiting the sensitivity of housing investment to changes in credit market conditions.

40|$|Most {{microfinance}} {{institutions have}} assumed that positive second-generation effects follow involvement in microcredit, but {{the nature of these}} effects has been unclear since few scholars have directly focused their attention on them. To address this gap in the literature I conducted exploratory survey research in Western Guatemala in January 2011. I returned with 97 interviews conducted with 68 Guatemalans who had received a microloan {{at some point in their}} lives, and 29 who had never received a <b>formal</b> <b>loan.</b> In the sample of their 306 children, the parents of 94 had never received a loan, while the parents of 212 had received a loan at some point. I investigated eight hypotheses using quantitative analysis of these data. Preliminary results show that involvement in microcredit leads to first-generation increases in economic well-being and contact with the formal economy, but also show that the second-generation effects are quite mixed. The effects of microcredit on children depend on the gender of the loan-receiving parent, and being a female recipient negatively affects the second generation. When borrowers are male, positive second-generation effects of microcredit can apparently be harnessed. Involvement of a male parent in microcredit leads to higher levels of child education, lowers child propensity to serious illness, and lowers the birth rate of the male borrower 2 ̆ 7 s children. All of these results flip for female borrowers; receiving loans increases child birth rate, increases illness propensity and decreases child education level. The only finding that does not depend on parent gender concerns child career path. The children of loan recipients appear to be more likely to take high-skill jobs in the formal economy, an effect that is stronger when the parent has received business loans in particular. At present microcredit organizations actively encourage female participation, and far more women than men take part in microcredit around the world. More study on the second-generation effects of microcredit must be conducted so that policy makers can make informed choices based on the long-term consequences of involvement in microcredit. ...|$|E

40|$|The housing {{situation}} in Ghana {{been described by}} various bodies as a sector in crisis. There {{is an increase in}} demand, especially in the affordable housing bracket where high and middle income earners mainly engage in self finance or take advantage of the few mortgage facilities available. This is {{beyond the reach of the}} majority of the population who are outside these income brackets. Housing finance plays an important role in urban shelter development and it is believed that expansion of credit programmes will have beneficial effects on low and moderate-income (LMI) groups. It is also key to poverty alleviation, livelihood and diversification. In Ghana, low and moderate-income groups source their loans mostly from informal lenders or from their personal savings, thus access to <b>formal</b> <b>loans</b> remains low. There is a need to further examine LMI groups’ access to loans and investigate their preferences and perceptions regarding loans that their access can be improved and how their needs through credit can be more effectively met. Determining the problems and the loan needs of LMI groups are important considerations in designing housing finance systems that are appropriate for them. The study is conducted in a typical case study area like Accra where accessibility of LMI groups is examined, with the primary objective of exploring the use of and access to housing finance. This research attempts to explore and understand the perceptions of LMI earners toward housing finance, and to collect information in proposing an appropriate credit system for them. Two types of respondents were interviewed for the research; a sample of 75 respondents were drawn to reflect the typical characteristics of the LMI population and the contribution of formal and informal financial institutions to provide affordable housing finance packages to LMI earners. The research focused on how LMI groups perceived the housing finance products, their preferences, their reasons for borrowing, and their problems in accessing credit. A mixed methods research design representing field surveys in the form of questionnaires (quantitative) and theoretical in the form of multiple case studies for methods of analysis (qualitative), approach is adopted to draw characteristic conclusions from the chosen LMI sample population. Access to housing finance by LMI groups is limited to available credit services in the research area, thus LMI groups’ choices and preferences were not well served which led to borrowing from informal lenders. Credit restrictions such as commodity specific credit programmes, credit that requires collateral, lengthy and complicated procedures restricted the LMIs from accessing <b>formal</b> <b>loans</b> for housing. It is recommended that accessibility to housing finance loans by LMIs could be improved by providing innovative financing schemes that address problems of LMIs who lack collateral and minimise long processing of documents and other requirements. In this way LMIs may be encouraged to better utilise formal credit and decrease their reliance on informal lenders and personal savings, thus avoiding higher interest rates and thereby increasing their household incomes.

It is also resilient to volatility of interest rates and allows prepayments without any additional charges. Finally, we verify the assertions of Besley et al. (1994), and Hart and Moore (1998) that cooperative mortgages are pareto-superior to formal mortgages in special cases...|$|R
