40|$|Colloidal {{particles}} of two sizes have been co-deposited from mixed suspensions by vertical transfer to prepare binary colloidal crystals (bCC) and inverse opals (IO) with long-range ordering, as deduced from structural characterization by SEM and Vis-NIR spectroscopy. As such, the described procedure allows hierarchical structure formation with colloidal particle mixtures by vertical lifting deposition {{in a single}} step. The particular features of the lattice geometries in these binary structures was theoretically analyzed. From the obtained silica IO templates, gold-silica hybrid IOs and <b>gold</b> <b>opal</b> replicas with hierarchical pore structures were fabricated. The gold-silica hybrid IOs showed in their Vis-NIR spectra a plasmonic response upon refractive index changes of the surrounding medium, which may be exploited for chemo- and biosensing applications.

40|$|Transport in nanostructured {{materials}} {{is of great}} interest for scientists in various fields, including molecular sequestration, catalysis, artificial photosynthesis and energy storage. This thesis will present work on the transport of molecular and ionic species in mesoporous materials (materials with pore sizes between 2 and 50 nm). Initially, discussion {{will focus on the}} synthesis of mesoporous ZnS nanorattles and the size selected mass transport of small molecules through the mesopores. Discussion will then shift of exploration of cation exchange and electroless plating of metals to alter the mesoporous hollow sphere (MHS) materials and properties. The focus of discussion will then shift to the transport of ions into and out of a hierarchically structured gold electrode. Finally, a model λ-bactiophage was developed to study the electromigration of charged molecules into and out of a confined geometry. A catalytically active biomolecular species was encapsulated within the central cavity of ZnS MHS. Both the activity of the encapsulated enzyme and the size-selective transport through the wall of the MHS were verified {{through the use of a}} common fluorogen, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium azide. Additionally, the protection of the enzyme was shown through size-selected blocking of a protease. The mesoporous hollow sphere system introduces size-selectivity to catalyzed chemical reactions; future work may include variations in pore sizes, and pore wall chemical functionalization. The pore size in ZnS mesoporous hollow spheres is controlled between 2. 5 and 4. 1 nm through swelling of the lyotropic liquid crystal template. The incorporation of a swelling agent is shown to linearly vary the hexagonal lyotropic liquid crystalline phase, which templates the mesopores, while allowing the high fidelity synthesis of mesoporous hollow spheres. Fluorescnently labeled ssDNA was utilized as a probe to explore the change in mesopore permeability afforded by the swollen template relative to the unswollen template. 	Electroless plating and cation exchange were explored as methods to vary the shell material of MHS. Mesoporous Ni MHS were obtained by the reduction of Ni 2 + with dimethylamine borane onto a CML latex core. However, the resultant MHS were damaged due to core swelling during etch. To successfully obtain undeformed MHS, a silica core must be utilized; one possible route to explore, in order to reach this goal, is the surface chemistry/ligand effects on Ni 2 +. Cation exchange was performed in order to obtain CuS MHS; however, it proved an unsuccessful route to PbS, S and HgS. CdS-ZnS, Bi 2 S 3 and Ag 2 S MHS were obtained only with significant defects. A novel hierarchically structured material, porous opal, was prepared using a colloidal crystal template and the dealloying of silver from gold and possed porosity on length scales range from 10 s of nanometers (due to the colloidal crystal template) down to ca. 10 nm (due to dealloying). The transport properties of the material were studied using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The porous opal was found to posses enhanced charge transport properties relative to a unimodal porous gold film and a higher surface area than a <b>gold</b> <b>opal.</b> An equivalent circuit model was presented to explain the enhanced charge transport properties. 	A biomimetic system for studying the translocation of polymers through a channel and into a spherical cavity was developed based on inspiration from the λ-bacteriophage. The nanocavity system was synthesized using two template length scales: 250 nm and 1. 2 μm. Fabrication challenges that arose when using 1. 2 μm colloidal templates were addressed, and the system was optimized for confinement studies of plasmid dsDNA...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The high {{surface area}} of {{nanoporous}} electrodes makes them promising for use in electrochemical double-layer supercapacitors, desalination and pollution remediation, and drug delivery applications. When designed well and operating near their peak power, their charging rates are limited by ion transport through their long, narrow pores. This can be alleviated by creating pores of intermediate diameter that penetrate the electrode. We have fabricated electrodes featuring these by creating colloidal crystal-templated <b>opals</b> of nanoporous <b>gold</b> formed by dealloying. The resulting electrodes contain a bimodal pore-size distribution, with large pores {{on the order of}} several 100 nm and small pores on the order of 10 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectrometry shows that porous <b>gold</b> <b>opals</b> sacrifice some capacitance, but possess a lower internal resistance, when compared to a porous gold electrode with only the smaller-diameter pores. The architectural flexibility of this approach provides a greater ability to design a balance between power density and energy density...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gold</b> inverse <b>opal</b> (Au-IO) {{thin films}} are active for CO[subscript 2] {{reduction}} to CO with high efficiency at modest overpotentials and high selectivity relative to hydrogen evolution. The specific activity for hydrogen evolution diminishes by 10 -fold with increasing porous film thickness, while CO evolution activity is largely unchanged. We {{demonstrate that the}} origin of hydrogen suppression in Au-IO films stems from the generation of diffusional gradients within the pores of the mesostructured electrode rather than changes in surface faceting or Au grain size. For electrodes with optimal mesoporosity, 99 % selectivity for CO evolution can be obtained at overpotentials as low as 0. 4 V. These results establish electrode mesostructuring as a complementary method for tuning selectivity in CO[subscript 2] -to-fuels catalysis...|$|R

50|$|Most of the municipality’s {{economy is}} still based on agriculture, {{employing}} about 47% of its people. Despite the very visible growing {{of the blue}} agave plant, most acres here are still devoted to corn. Other crops include sorghum, beans, mangos, oranges, avocados and squash. Livestock includes beef cattle, dairy cattle, pigs, goats, horses, fowl and bees. The making of tequila employs about 25% of the municipality’s population, but brings in the most money. It accounts for almost all the municipality’s industrial base. Tourism, such as that related to tequila and ecotourism sites are a growing part of the economy. One example of ecotourism here is the Balneario La Toma, which is located on very rugged terrain with cliffs, promoting rappelling, paragliding and other similar sports. There is some mining here, mostly of <b>opals,</b> <b>gold</b> and silver.|$|R

40|$|Strain driven micro and nanoroll {{fabrication}} {{is generally}} restricted to multilayer and multiprocessing systems, limiting {{the ability to}} exploit self-organization at different length scales. We have designed a hybrid organic-inorganic single-layered film with a surface that responds selectively to external stimuli, resulting in mechanical strain and self-rolling in one-step fabrication. The scrolling is initiated by water and any aqueous solution of molecules or colloidal particles. During scrolling, the different species in solution remain entrapped in the rolls; the constrained environment at the interface of the roll walls pushes the particles to organize into ordered structures. We used this rolling process to create self-assembled hybrid films with well-ordered layers of <b>gold</b> nanoparticles and <b>opals</b> of polystyrene nanospheres. These films also respond selectively to solvents, allowing the easy release of molecules/particles entrapped at the interface.

India's very rich history brought upon all of the beautiful pieces that Gem Palace offered. Vibrant colors and regal pieces were draped on the countries wealthiest. As he received more press many would stop at the Gem Palace just to spend the day marveling at his collections. Kasliwal was impressive. Kasliwal used intricate enamel work called kundan. Kundan showed the mastery Kasliwal had achieved. He learned from a young age to be intrigues by precious things. Instead of being mainstream, Kasliwal did the opposite hence why he was considered a secret until one found out about him and his various collections. Kasliwal did the most he could to obtain precious gems to work with for his pieces. He once rode through the mines of Golconda accompanied by winding roads to acquire a rare stone.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the ores {{from the new}} hydrothermal sulfide cluster named Semenov (13 ° 31 ´N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge) composed of several hydrothermal fields. Ores from the Semyenov- 1, - 3 and - 4 hydrothermal fields show marcasite-pyrite composition with fine-grained, colloform, and clastic textures. Ores from the Semyenov- 2 hydrothermal site are characterized by isocubanite-chalcopyrite-sphalerite-wurtzite mineral assemblage with fine-grained aggregates. They are uniquely enriched in Au (up to 188 ppm) and Ag (up to 1787 ppm) and conatin visible <b>gold</b> associated with <b>opal,</b> sphalerite and chalcopyrite. Ore textural analyses of ores from the Semenov hydrothermal sulfide cluster allowed us to reveal several ore facies (cf. Maslennikov and Zaykov, 2006) : subseafloor hydrothermal, seafloor hydrothermal and clastic. The veinlet-disseminated ores from the Semyenov- 2 and - 4 hydrothermal fields belong to the subseafloor hydrothermal facies which is formed below the seafloor simultaneously with seafloor hydrothermal processes. Seafloor hydrothermal facies, formed on the seafloor surface near the hydrothermal vents, was found at the Semenov- 1 and - 2 hydrothermal fields and includes fine-grained and colloform ores. Clastic facies resulted from destruction of sulfide ores occurs at the Semenov- 3 field as colluvial pyrite breccia. Textural and mineralogical features of ore facies from the Semenov hydrothermal cluster are comparable with those from massive sulfide deposits of the Urals...|$|R
