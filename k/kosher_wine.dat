5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} and often difficult jobs of a mashgiach, however, is the checking in and verification of shipments. The mashgiach must ensure that every food product that arrives at the facility has a reliable hekhsher before it is used. Suppliers often substitute products {{that are out of}} stock with non-kosher products. Non-kosher establishments would generally not mind these substitutions. For a kosher establishment, however, these substitutions can cause major problems. If a product arrives without a hekhsher, the mashgiach must make sure the product is clearly marked as non-kosher and is not used, but returned to the supplier. Sometimes a product arrives that is purportedly kosher, but no hekhsher can be found. In this case, the mashgiach obtains a valid letter of certification from the certifying rabbi or kashrut agency, usually by contacting the manufacturer. In addition to checking hekhsherim, the mashgiach must also check that all meat products that arrive are double sealed, usually by inner and outer plastic bags or an inner plastic bag and a sealed box, and that all wine is <b>kosher</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E

50|$|In recent times, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} demand for <b>kosher</b> <b>wines</b> and a number of wine producing countries now produce a wide variety of sophisticated <b>kosher</b> <b>wines</b> under strict rabbinical supervision, particularly in Israel, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Chile and Australia.

2500|$|To be {{considered}} kosher, a wine {{may only be}} handled by observant Jews {{from the time the}} grapes are crushed. If, however, the wine is boiled or pasteurized, it may subsequently be handled by anyone without losing its kosher status. [...] Additionally, <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> cannot contain any non-kosher ingredients or fining agents such as isinglass, gelatin or casein. [...] Although not all Israeli wine is kosher, virtually all of the large producers in Israel have kosher certification.|$|E
2500|$|Consequently, modern Orthodox Jews {{generally}} believe wine, certain cooked foods, {{and sometimes}} even dairy products, should be prepared only by Jews. The prohibition against drinking non-Jewish wine, traditionally called yayin nesekh (literally meaning [...] "wine for offering [...] "), is not absolute. Cooked wine (Hebrew: יין מבושל, yayin mevushal), meaning wine which has been heated, is regarded as drinkable {{on the basis that}} heated wine was not historically used as a religious libation; thus <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> includes mulled wine, and pasteurised wine, regardless of producer, but Orthodox Judaism regards other forms of wine as kosher only if prepared by a Jew.|$|E
2500|$|Pasteurization gives a <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> of {{the type}} called mevushal, {{literally}} [...] "cooked" [...] or [...] "boiled", that can be handled by non-Jews and non-observant Jews without losing its kosher status. Typically, the wine is heated to 185°F (85°C) for a minute, then cooled to 122°F (50°C), at which temperature it remains {{for up to three}} days, killing all yeast and bacteria. It may then be allowed to cool, or be bottled [...] "hot" [...] and cooled by water sprays. Since pasteurization affects a wine's flavor and aging potential it is not used for premium wines. A gentler procedure known as flash pasteurization involves heating to 205°F (95°C) for a few seconds, followed by rapid cooling.|$|E
5000|$|Many wine writers praise Hagafen wines, {{writing for}} example that the winery makes [...] "a broad {{selection}} of highly recommended kosher wines".

50|$|The Herzog {{family first}} {{operated}} a winery in Czechoslovakia. The winery was the exclusive wine supplier to Emperor Franz Joseph, who granted {{one of the}} early Herzogs the title of Baron.

2500|$|The Golan Heights, {{occupied}} by Israel since the Six-Day War in 1967, are located northeast of Israel proper, though Israel considers it a sub-region of the Galilee. The political {{status of the}} Golan Heights has resulted in controversy on the export market. In one example, following domestic demand for <b>kosher</b> <b>wine,</b> a number of Golan Heights wines were marketed by Systembolaget, Sweden's state-owned monopoly alcohol retailer, as [...] "Made in Israel" [...] on shelves and in the sales catalogue. Following customer complaints and consultation with Sweden's foreign ministry, Systembolaget changed the shelf labelling to read, [...] "Made in Israeli-occupied Syrian territories." [...] However this prompted further complaints, from some customers and a Member of Parliament. Systembolaget's solution was to simply remove all reference to the product's country of origin on shelves and in catalogues, classifying the wine as of [...] "other origins." [...] The actual bottles remained unchanged throughout the controversy, and carried the producer's English-language labels.|$|E
50|$|Indeed, so {{well known}} is the sweet Manischewitz variety in the U.S. that the {{existence}} of a thriving <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> industry anchored by vineyards in France and Israel, along with a growing U.S. industry, is often a surprise to Americans unaccustomed to taking <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> seriously.|$|E

50|$|Mogen David Concord Red wine is {{made from}} must of no less than 51% Concord grapes, an American grape variety, which is {{typically}} used for grape juices, jellies, and preserves, but also used for <b>Kosher</b> <b>wines.</b> This makes the wine less expensive, averaging $5 per bottle.In addition to Concord red, Mogen David also markets Blackberry and Pomegranate wines.|$|R
50|$|Although he is Jewish, Weir's {{level of}} {{religious}} observance does {{not comply with}} Orthodox Jewish standards, and only such Jews are allowed to do the physical work of producing <b>kosher</b> <b>wines.</b> Accordingly, Weir has to direct and monitor temporary Orthodox Jewish employees on the exact steps to take during production, but he can't {{do any of the}} hands-on work himself.|$|R
5000|$|Jewish {{law also}} {{requires}} that <b>kosher</b> <b>wines</b> {{that are to}} be served to observant Jews by non-Jewish waiters must be mevushal, which means [...] "boiled" [...] in Hebrew. Israeli wine critic Daniel Rogov described the common wisdom about the shortcomings of mevushal kosher wines: [...] "nearly everyone knows that that after a few months in bottle, most mevushal (flash pasteurized) wines tend to offer cooked aromas and flavors, and too often remind one more of oxidized fruit compote than of fine wine." [...] Rogov praises Weir's success at the process: [...] "No one is quite sure how Hagafen winemaker Ernie Weir does it, but his are among the very few flash pasteurized wines to have escaped this fate, and his wines, frequently earning scores of 90 or above, tend to be rather long lived. Some may think that shipping <b>kosher</b> <b>wines</b> to Israel is somewhat akin to selling ice to Eskimos, but in this case the Hagafen wines are a most welcome addition to local shelves." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{sweetness}} of Manischewitz wine and other kosher wines {{is often the}} fodder of jokes. However, <b>Kosher</b> <b>wine</b> {{does not have to}} be sweet. One of the reasons for the prevalence of sweet <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> in the U.S., and in the Americas generally, dates back to the early days of Jews in America, when there was the need to locally produce <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> for the Kiddush ritual on the Shabbat and holidays. The combination of a limited choice of grape varieties that could grow in the areas where Jews had settled, along with limited time available to produce the wine and a market dominated by hard cider, yielded a bitter wine that had to be sweetened to make it palatable.|$|E

50|$|Rogov wrote {{several books}} on food, wine, and travel. Amongst them, Rogov's guide to Israeli wine is {{considered}} to be the authoritative guide to Israeli wines. First published in 2005, the final volume was released posthumously in 2011, and now sells about 10,000 copies a year. The bulk of the book contains Rogov's tasting notes on 2500 wines from over 150 Israeli wineries. The guide also contains a history of winemaking in Israel, discussions of Israel's wine regions and vintage years, and coverage of what makes <b>wines</b> <b>kosher.</b> In 2010 and 2011, Rogov also authored Rogov’s Guide to World <b>Kosher</b> <b>Wines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|First of all, [...] "the High Holy Days often fall in {{the middle}} of peak {{harvesting}} and crush periods", and that is by far the busiest time of year for Napa Valley winemakers.

5000|$|Because of wine's {{special role}} in many non-Jewish religions, the kashrut laws specify that wine cannot be {{considered}} kosher {{if it might}} have been used for idolatry. These laws include Yayin Nesekh (...) , wine that has been poured to an idol, and Stam Yainom, wine that has been touched by someone who believes in idolatry or produced by non-Jews. When <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> is yayin mevushal ( [...] - [...] "cooked" [...] or [...] "boiled"), it becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> even if subsequently touched by an idolater.|$|E

50|$|Isinglass finings {{are also}} used in the {{production}} of <b>kosher</b> <b>wines,</b> although for reasons of kashrut, they are not derived from the beluga sturgeon, because this fish is not kosher. Whether the use of a nonkosher isinglass renders a beverage nonkosher is a matter of debate in Jewish law. Rabbi Yehezkel Landau, in Noda B'Yehuda, first edition, Yore Deah 26, for example, permits such beverages. This is the position followed by many kashrut-observant Jews today.|$|R
50|$|The Herzog varietals are Kosher {{versions}} of various wines, including Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. Several {{of these have}} won various wine competitions. The company was {{also part of the}} collaboration that created the first <b>kosher</b> Rothschild <b>wine,</b> in 1988.|$|R
50|$|Grapes {{were first}} {{cultivated}} {{in the area}} in the early 19th century, and many wineries survived Prohibition in the 20th century by legally selling grapes to home winemakers, marketing their products solely for religious purposes such as <b>kosher</b> <b>wines</b> (which continues to the present day), converting to grape juice production for local companies such as Welch's, or illegally selling wine to consumers in Canada. The wine industry in the Lake Erie region did not thrive after the repeal of Prohibition, however, and by 1967 there were fewer than 20 commercial wineries in the area. Recently, Lake Erie wineries have begun planting and vinifying Vitis vinifera varieties in an attempt to improve wine quality.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, when <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> is mevushal ("cooked" [...] or [...] "boiled"), it thereby becomes {{unfit for}} idolatrous use and {{will keep the}} status of <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> even if subsequently touched by an idolater. It is not known whence the ancient Jewish authorities derived this claim; there are no records concerning [...] "boiled wine" [...] and its fitness {{for use in the}} cults of any of the religions of the peoples surrounding ancient Israel. Indeed, in Orthodox Christianity, it is common to add boiling water to the sacramental wine. Another opinion holds that mevushal wine {{was not included in the}} rabbinic edict against drinking wine touched by an idolater simply because such wine was uncommon in those times.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{practice}} when producing <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> is to render it yayin mevushal (יין מבושל, [...] "cooked wine"); {{this is done}} in order to permit it to be handled by a non-Shabbat observer, whether Jew or gentile. [...] While this cooking process used to be accomplished by bringing the wine or grape juice to a boil, recent technological advances have allowed for flash pasteurization to substitute for this procedure. [...] According to one <b>kosher</b> <b>wine</b> maker, all of its mevushal wine is flash pasteurized to at least 185°F, well above the stringent 160°F of Rabbi Feinstein. However, there are more stringent authorities than Rabbi Feinstein in this matter, with some requiring 190°F.|$|E

5000|$|Like many Napa Valley wineries, Hagafen {{emphasizes}} Cabernet Sauvignon, {{and those}} wines have been favorably received by wine critics and writers for decades.

2500|$|For most of {{its history}} in the modern era, the Israeli wine {{industry}} was based predominantly on the production of <b>Kosher</b> <b>wines</b> which were exported worldwide to Jewish communities. The quality of these wines were varied, with many being produced from high-yielding vineyards that valued quantity over quality. Many of these wines were also somewhat sweet. In the late 1960s, Carmel Winery was the first Israeli winery to make a dry table wine. It {{was not until the}} 1980s that the industry at large saw a revival in quality winemaking, when an influx of winemaking talent from Australia, California and France brought modern technology and technical know-how to the growing Israeli wine industry. In 1989, the first boutique winery in Israel, Margalit Winery, was founded. By the 1990s, Israeli estates such as Golan Heights Winery and Domaine du Castel were winning awards at international wine competitions.
