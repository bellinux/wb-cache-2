25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, radial tyres, reversing lights, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and reclining front seats.|$|E
2500|$|Innovations in 1969 {{included}} a radio antenna {{embedded in the}} windshield, flush-mounted [...] "pop-open" [...] exterior door handles, side-impact beams inside the doors, and an optional built-in electrically <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> defogger.|$|E
2500|$|The new more {{aerodynamic}} body {{looked a}} bit more plain than its sharp predecessor, but the fastback shape echoed Giugiaro's original design. The headlights were square, there was more glass than on the SS20 (but with a broad B-pillar) and the larger rear glass hatch (still not a proper hatch) now offered better access to a much more usable luggage space. The rear seat folded; some versions even offered a remote opening mechanism and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> The SS40 {{was also the first}} Cervo to offer automatic transmission, a two-speed. This all reflected a steady move away from the original [...] "mini Gran Turismo" [...] concept towards a much softer [...] "Personal Car".|$|E
50|$|Until the 1960s, {{automobiles}} used DC dynamo generators with commutators. With {{the availability}} of affordable silicon diode rectifiers, alternators were used instead. This was encouraged by the increasing electrical power required for cars in this period, with increasing loads from larger headlamps, electric wipers, <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> and other accessories.|$|R
50|$|The MR2 Spyder {{featured}} a <b>heated</b> glass <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> A hard top was also available from Toyota in Japan and Europe.|$|R

50|$|Volvo's {{first modern}} convertible, the C70 was {{manufactured}} in Uddevalla, Sweden {{on a separate}} assembly line from the 70-series sedan and station wagon. The four-seater convertible featured an electrically <b>heated</b> glass <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> automatic (pop-up) rollover hoops system ROPS, seat belt pre-tensioners, boron steel reinforced A-pillars, front and side airbags, and a safety cage — a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment.|$|R

5000|$|The {{convertible}} version, {{named the}} Golf Cabriolet (or Typ 155) in Europe and Canada ("Rabbit Convertible" [...] in America originally and renamed in 1985 to [...] "Cabriolet"), was sold from 1980 to 1993. It had a reinforced body, transverse roll bar, {{and a high}} level of trim, and kept the pre-1980 style of rear lamp clusters. The Mk1 Cabriolet is of unibody construction built entirely at the factory of Karmann, from stamping to final assembly; Volkswagen supplied the engine, suspension, interior, etc. for Karmann to install. The vinyl or cloth tops were heavily insulated and manually - or beginning in 1991, electrically - operated, with a <b>heated</b> glass <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 1966 a {{dashboard}} switch was {{provided for the}} <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> which had previously remained [...] "on" [...] {{as long as the}} ignition was on, leading to instances of flat batteries.|$|E
5000|$|In Japan, the Pulsar EXA {{convertible}} was {{a limited}} edition model {{was designed to}} commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Nissan Cherry Japanese dealership chain, and sold as a companion to the Nissan Pulsar. It appeared in Japan {{the same year as}} the Honda CR-X in the same marketing segment, replacing the Nissan Pulsar N10 series coupe. It was launched in May 1985, and just 100 vehicles were made available for the whole of Japan. The vehicle sports numerous special accessories, including a soft top made from a special insulating material to keep out the rain and <b>heat,</b> and a <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> made from organic glass to ensure high visibility.|$|R
50|$|The Visa's rear {{parcel shelf}} was in two hinged sections, one in the car, {{the other on the}} tailgate, to allow objects that were {{slightly}} too tall to still fit without removing the shelf. When carrying larger loads, the part of the shelf attached to the tailgate could be folded up, and fixed with the elasticated support strings, to protect the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> screen elements.|$|R
50|$|The first Ford Special, was the Capri Vista Orange Special.The Capri Special was {{launched}} in November 1971 and {{was based on the}} 1600 GT, and 2000 GT models. It was only available in vista orange and was optional dealer fitted with a Ford Rally Sport boot mounted spoiler and <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> slats - a direct link to the Mustang.

50|$|The {{specification}} gradually improved {{over the}} years. In October 1972 front disc brakes were {{fitted as standard}} on both models and a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> became standard equipment by late 1973 / early 1974.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Rekord C's {{production}} run, in July 1971, {{a special}} edition [...] "Rekord Holiday" [...] appeared in the showrooms, attractively priced and laden with a package of (normally optional) extras including a steel panel sunroof, supplementary front lights and even a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
50|$|Side {{windows were}} not {{existent}} in open cars, {{which may have}} detachable side screens, or manually or power-operated glass side windows as in a saloon or sedan. <b>Rear</b> <b>windows</b> have evolved similarly, with plastic <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> appearing {{as late as the}} first-generation Porsche Boxster. Contemporary convertibles and retractable hardtops feature heatable glass <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> to maximize visibility - though <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> often can compromise visibility by their size, as with the case of the very small <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and restricted visibility of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. Plastic windows can degrade, fade, yellow, and crack over time, diminishing visibility.|$|R

5000|$|A rare {{option for}} the Phantom was a <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> Monterey-Salinas Transit and King County Metro {{are the only two}} transit {{authorities}} known to have ordered Phantoms with a <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 1967 the Diplomat (along {{with its}} less {{expensive}} siblings) received a work-over consisting of rub strips on its flanks, new recirculating ball steering by ZF and <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> At {{the same time}} a HL (Hochleistung or high performance) version of the 2.8-liter six became available (140 PS/138 hp) for the Kapitän and Admiral models.|$|E
50|$|In February 1983, Mitsubishi {{launched}} {{a special edition}} Sigma GL Satellite. Priced $1,000 below the GL luxury level, the Satellite was built in sedan and wagon versions, with air conditioning, five-speed manual or automatic transmission all as options. However, two-tone paintwork, a laminated windscreen, AM/FM radio, adjustable steering column, intermittent windscreen wipers and a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> were fitted as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of its launch in October 1969 at the Paris Motor Show, the Renault 12 was only {{available}} as a 4-door saloon, in L and TL specifications. The more expensive TL featured two separate reclining front seats instead of one front bench seat, armrests on the doors, lights in the boot and glovebox, a <b>heated</b> <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> and extra warning lights.|$|E
5000|$|They {{have also}} been {{extensively}} applied to <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> as well, where legislative measures have not banned such use. For instance in Sweden that is the normal place to put them and the bumper sticker is actually called [...] "bakrutedekal" [...] (<b>rear</b> <b>window</b> decal).|$|R
50|$|In 1970 a {{flow-through}} ventilation system, where vents {{were added}} towards {{the rear of}} the car (on the exterior under the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> on the 142 and 144 and as a grille next to the right side taillight of the 145) and electrically defrosted <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> were introduced.

50|$|In 1957, Mercury {{introduced}} the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, featuring a roofline with a retractable <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> From 1958 to 1960, the feature made its {{return on the}} Continental Mark-series line, with a reverse-slant <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> (on both hardtops and convertibles). For 1963, Mercury re{{introduced the}} feature as an option for the Monterey; to streamline production, elements of the window design were shared with Ford station wagons. From 1963 to 1966, the optional reverse-slant roofline with retracting <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was unique to Mercury, featured by no other American brand.|$|R
