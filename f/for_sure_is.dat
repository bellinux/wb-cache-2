5|$|Bjaðmunjo was a {{daughter}} of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1119). In the late eleventh century, {{following the death of}} his father, Muirchertach seized control of the Kingdom of Munster and moved to extend his authority throughout Ireland as High King of Ireland. In so doing, he gained control of the Norse-Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin, and as a result began to extend his influence into the nearby Kingdom of the Isles. There is uncertainty concerning the political situation in the Isles in {{the last decade of the}} eleventh century. What is known <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> that, before the end of the century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Irish Sea region, where he held power until his death in 1103.|$|E
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{concerning the}} political situation in the Isles {{in the last decade}} of the eleventh century. What is known <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> that, before the end of the century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Isles, seized control of the kingdom, and held onto power in the Irish Sea region until his death in 1103. According to the Chronicle of Mann, when Guðrøðr died in 1095, Lǫgmaðr succeeded him as his eldest son, and went on to reign for seven years. The numerical calculations and chronology of this source are suspect, and it is uncertain if Lǫgmaðr's reign began before Magnús' arrival, during Magnús' overlordship, or even after Magnús' death. One possibility is that Lǫgmaðr commenced his reign in the Isles immediately after his father assumed the kingship of Dublin in 1091. If so, this transfer of power would seem to evidence the eminent status of Dublin's kinship amongst the Norse-Gaelic elite.|$|E

In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fire many [...] "theories" [...] about the {{cause of the}} fire abounded. One theory pointed to disgruntled Confederate sympathizers or infiltrators. The followers of the Southern cause were implicated in setting the fire as vengeance for their loss in the American Civil War which had just ended 6-years prior.

2500|$|The Parthenon's façade {{as well as}} {{elements}} of its façade and elsewhere are said {{by some to be}} circumscribed by golden rectangles. Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, [...] "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the Elements (308 BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and decagons was duly observed, {{as well as in the}} dodecahedron (a regular polyhedron whose twelve faces are regular pentagons). It is indeed exemplary that the great Euclid, contrary to generations of mystics who followed, would soberly treat that number for what it is, without attaching to it other than its factual properties." [...] And Keith Devlin says, [...] "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing we know <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> that Euclid, in his famous textbook Elements, written around 300 BC, showed how to calculate its value." [...] Later sources like Vitruvius exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions.|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with Bleeding Cool, Galligan again spoke {{about a third}} film saying that [...] "Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus {{wants to do it}} because he’d like to undo the Gremlins 2 thing as he wasn’t thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to do it I imagine – because he’s Spielberg – and why wouldn’t he want to do it." [...] He said that Columbus was now in control of the franchise and once confirmed {{that there will be no}} remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that that Columbus [...] "has been aggressively working on a Gremlins 3" [...] and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. Gremlins 3 takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – I guess in the style of a [...] type sequel. One thing we know <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>is</b> they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between Gremlins and Gremlins 2; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was ‘gremlins in Vegas.’ They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I’m working for Donald Trump, our new President! That took six years to happen. Carl Ellsworth has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now." [...] Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.|$|E

Meanwhile, I have my distractions, my little agréments--my gardens, my music, my birds, my native friends, my coquetries, my aviary.
