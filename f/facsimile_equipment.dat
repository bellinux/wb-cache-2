40|$|The {{substitution}} of transportation by telecommunications {{has long been}} advocated as an approach that might eventually alleviate the demand placed on transportation facilities and thereby reduce fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions. With increasing penetration of telecommunications in individual homes and businesses, coupled with the widespread availability of computing <b>equipment,</b> <b>facsimile</b> capabilities and the like, there is renewed inter~st in exploring and encouraging telecommuting arrangements. These include work-at-home schemes and workplace decentralization with satellite work centers, {{as well as many}} other non-traditional approaches to structuring workplace activities and worker responsibilities. The aim of this project is to address the travel behavior implications of telecommuting, and determine the potential of telecommuting to improve urban mobility and reduce fuel consumption. The following objectives will be addressed: (1) prepare a synthesis of existing experience with telecommutin...|$|R

These include work-at-home schemes and workplace decentralization with satellite work centers, {{as well as many}} other non-traditional approaches to structure workplace activities and worker responsibilities. The aim of this report is to propose a comprehensive framework of the interactions between telecommuting and travel behavior, and to develop a mathematical model of the telecommuting adoption process. The framework identifies two principal actors in the decision process, the employee and the employer. The employee faces a decision of whether to participate in a telecommuting program given the program features and his/her personal and household whether to characteristics and circumstances. The employer decides whether to offer a telecommuting program to employees an...|$|R

By [...] "effective recorded spot dimension" [...] is meant the largest center-to-center spacing between recorded spots, which gives minimum peak-to-peak variation of density of the recorded line. [...] "X-dimension {{of recorded}} spot" [...] implies that the <b>facsimile</b> <b>equipment</b> response to a constant density in the object (original) is a succession of discrete recorded spots.|$|E
40|$|A Ku-band {{satellite}} {{earth terminal}} {{capable of providing}} two way voice/facsimile teleconferencing, 128 Kbps data, telephone, and high-speed imagery services is proposed. Optimized terminal cost and configuration are presented {{as a function of}} FDMA and TDMA approaches to multiple access. The entire terminal from the antenna to microphones, speakers and <b>facsimile</b> <b>equipment</b> is considered. Component cost versus performance has been projected as a function of size of the procurement and predicted hardware innovations and production techniques through 1985. The lowest cost combinations of components has been determined in a computer optimization algorithm. The system requirements including terminal EIRP and G/T, satellite size, power per spacecraft transponder, satellite antenna characteristics, and link propagation outage were selected using a computerized system cost/performance optimization algorithm. System cost and terminal cost and performance requirements are presented {{as a function of the}} size of a nationwide U. S. network. Service costs are compared with typical conference travel costs to show the viability of the proposed terminal...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper introduces {{the reader to}} facsimile communication by defining in simple terms the general modus operandi of facsimile communication and then comparing the capabilities of record (teletypewriter) communication with facsimile communication. The present Department of Defense (DOD) communication system is predominantly a "two dimensional" system consisting of voice and alpha-numeric/special character record communications. The thesis discusses the inherent advantages of facsimile communication along with the limitations of analog facsimile technology. The requirement for facsimile communication in the Marine Corps is discussed, noting {{that there is a}} requirement for this "third dimension" in tactical communications. A detailed discussion of recent digital facsimile technology is provided delineating the advantages of digital facsimile technology over existing analog <b>facsimile</b> <b>equipment.</b> Alternative facsimile applications in the Fleet Marine Force are outlined and a broad concept of digital facsimile employment is proposed. Conclusions based on the overall discussion are drawn, and recommendations in the form of steps that the Marine Corps should take toward implementation of a tactical digital facsimile system are provided.
