50|$|Liguria {{is known}} for herbs and {{vegetables}} (as well as seafood) in its cuisine. Savory pies are popular, mixing <b>greens</b> and <b>artichokes</b> along with cheeses, milk curds and eggs. Onions and olive oil are used. Because {{of a lack of}} land suitable for wheat, the Ligurians use chickpeas in farinata and polenta-like panissa. The former is served plain or topped with onions, artichokes, sausage, cheese or young anchovies.|$|R

25|$|Brittany, {{apart from}} some {{areas such as}} Lorient, Nantes and Saint-Nazaire, has never been heavily industrialised. Today, fishing and {{agriculture}} remain important activities. Brittany has more than 40,000 agricultural exploitations, mostly oriented towards cattle, pig and poultry breeding, and cereals and vegetables production. The number of exploitations tends to diminish, but as a result, they are merged into very large estates. Brittany is the first producer in France for vegetables (<b>green</b> beans, onions, <b>artichokes,</b> potatoes, tomatoes...). Cereals are mostly grown for cattle feeding. Wine, especially muscadet, is made in a small region south of Nantes. Brittany is the first region in France for fishing. The activity employs around 9,000 people, and more than 60 firms work in fish and seafood processing.|$|R
500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen {{called for the}} salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: [...] "never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise." [...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple <b>artichokes,</b> <b>green</b> peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|R
40|$|Cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) is a {{herbaceous}} perennial {{plant in}} the vegetable, artichoke, wild or garden, which belongs to the Compositae family (Asteraceae Compositae-and more precisely Cynara species) and is grown specifically {{for the production of}} biomass (solid bio fuel as a pellet, or solid and liquid bio fuel, bio diesel). In this paper I have tried to highlight the profitability and economic efficiency of growing of this plant. Production capacity exceeding 2 tonnes dry matter/ 1000 mp. The yield depends on climatic conditions, adequate soil moisture, soil nutrients, and range from 1 to 3 t/ 1000 mp, dry. Cardoon seed contains on average 24 % oil (category: 19 - 32 %), with the same qualities as the sunflower. Quantity of seed production to 480 kgs/ 1000 mp, while ordinary productivities range 70 to 330 kg/ 1000 mp, always depending on the total biomass production. Growing cardooncan replace traditional crops, partly by ensuring a good profit for the farmer (double the wheat and rapeseed) and bio fuel production with high energy content. Solid bio fuels (pellets, briquettes, artichokes, etc.) can reach the enduser, at prices up to 30 - 40 % lower than the price of oil. Because cardoon is a perennial plant which grows once every 10 - 12 years, and preparing the ground and sowing it will be carried out at intervals so large (this plant is harvested annually),it is remarkable cost reduction efficiency of growing this plant. In addition to the obvious environmental advantages by producing <b>green</b> energy, growing <b>artichokes</b> garden preserves the soil covered for the most part of the year, thereby minimizing the risk of soil erosion and limit the pollution of soil and groundwater with agrochemical products, especially in areas with intensive agriculture, because it does not require additional fertilization and/or with the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides...|$|R
