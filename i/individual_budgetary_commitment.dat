40|$|Much {{consideration}} {{has been}} given {{over the years to}} what may be described as the 'negative' aspect of budgeting; that budgets may constrain innovation and learning, and that budgetary pressure may lead to unintended behavioural side effects. In contrast to this, the present study examines the extent to which budgets have a more positive, 'comforting' role to play in the individual's work experiences. We argue that managers confronted with uncertainties associated with role ambiguity may respond by becoming positively committed to achieving budgetary targets as budgets offer a source of structure and certainty. We find that the use of budgets as an antidote to role ambiguity is a powerful influence on the manager's budgeting behaviour. We test the strength of this effect and we find that <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment</b> brought on by the experience of role ambiguity may over-ride the potential for recognised explanatory variables such as leadership style, the expectations of the superior, and occupational socialisation, to inform managers' budgeting behaviours in these circumstances.

This paper measures comprehensively for the first time housing affordability of tenants in the Netherlands with respect to rent and fuel in order to gain insight in the ways this ongoing <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment</b> can be calculated. Starting point is the expenditure-to-income ratio, which is usually used in the Netherlands to represent the affordability of housing consumption. For 2012 its components-incomes, rents and fuel costs-are separated out. The absence of a socially acceptable benchmark for &# 039;affordable&# 039; versus &# 039;unaffordable&# 039; housing and the fact that lower-income households pay relatively more on rent and energy than those with a higher income (Engel&# 039;s Law) call for an alternative method to measure affordability. The residual income approach is shown to be useful in identifying households with housing and energy affordability problems, once social norms have been established for the relationship between income, rent and energy expenses.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{document}} the process by which decisions are made in California about implementing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) projects, and to consider ways for "mainstreaming" ITS in the sense of evaluating ITS projects alongside non-ITS projects. The transportation planning and decision process is reviewed and described as a base for judging the efficacy of decisions with respect to the adoption of (ITS) projects. The decision process is complex and varied, involving government agencies at federal, State, regional, and local levels, but the process seems to be workable and suitable. In practice, however, critical information for making decisions does not appear to be available to decisionmakers at the points in the process when they need it. In particular, information on the impacts of ITS projects and the expected benefits appears to be missing from planning and project information documents such as Project Study Reports. Although generic claims for benefits in the form of delay savings, accident reductions, and other user or environmental benefits are sometimes provided, they are not quantified and are not specific to the particular project. Costs, on the other hand, are usually very specific, because they represent a <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment.</b> Good decisions, however, call for better information on what benefits the specific costs will generate. Providing better information on benefits does not need to take major effort, and precise answers are not essential; any estimates would be better than what is provided currently, and the processes and methods for generating the information can be improved with experience and streamlined at the same time. A few examples of the type of analysis that would be helpful are presented in the context of two California ITS projects. Some recommendations are offered for moving toward improved information for making decisions about ITS projects, allowing them to be compared with other transportation investment on an equal footing. ...|$|R

Our model takes {{the advantages of}} the dataset and models retirement decisions in terms of monetary and leisure incentives, which reflect the complex welfare system in Ireland. The household extension version of the model adapts a collective modelling approach, where the intra-household bargaining is considered. We further incorporate complimentary leisure, which allows us to analyse the interactions of spouses' retirement timing. This methodology enables us to capture the dynamics of retirement and tax-benefit policies and can be used to simulate the effect of policy reform on household retirement behaviours. The paper, in addition, applies the model to assess <b>individual</b> <b>budgetary</b> implications and the labour market impact of rising the minimum retirement age. Our simulation shows that increasing the minimum age for state pension entitlement to 70 would only delay the retirement by less than 2 years according to the individual based model. When we consider the intra-household bargaining and the higher preference of leisure found in the dual career households, the effect of postponing retirement further declines. The result suggests barely postponing the minimum retirement age for state pension without redefining the occupation and private pension rules will only have limited impact for household retirement behaviour in Ireland. retirement, choice modelling, microsimulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Researchers {{have long}} {{recognized}} the importance of a central government’s political “commitment” in order to mount an effective response to HIV. The concept of political commitment remains ill-defined, however, and little guidance has been given on how to measure this construct and its relationship with HIV-related outcomes. Several countries have experienced declines in HIV infection rates, but conceptual difficulties arise in linking these declines to political commitment as opposed to underlying social and behavioural factors. Methods This paper first presents a critical review of the literature on existing efforts to conceptualize and measure political commitment to respond to HIV and the linkages between political commitment and HIV-related outcomes. Based on the elements identified in this review, the paper then develops and presents a framework to assist researchers in making choices about how to assess a government's level of political commitment to respond to HIV and how to link political commitment to HIV-related outcomes. Results The review of existing studies identifies three components of commitment (expressed, institutional and <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitment)</b> as different dimensions along which commitment can be measured. The review also identifies normative and ideological aspects of commitment and a set of variables that mediate and moderate political commitment that need to be accounted for in order to draw valid inferences about the relationship between political commitment and HIV-related outcomes. The framework summarizes a set of steps that researchers can follow in order to assess a government's level of commitment to respond to HIV and suggests ways to apply the framework to country cases. Conclusions Whereas existing studies have adopted a limited and often ambiguous conception of political commitment, we argue that conceiving of political commitment along a greater number of dimensions will allow researchers to draw a more complete picture of political commitment to respond to HIV that avoids making invalid inferences about the relationship between political commitment and HIV outcomes. </p...|$|R

We focus on the monitoring period commencing with the adoption of the Revised Action Plan in August 2011 until March 2013. Where necessary, we have included policy development prior to the reporting period. The report is based on a data set and information gathered through desk research, information requests directed to the relevant agencies and interviews with public officials, including mayors, and NGOs. In addition, we have prepared case studies of five policies {{to assess the impact of}} key flagship policies on the ground: Individual integration in education, activation works, municipal firms, Roma health mediators and the programme of lower-standard housing. The cases studies draw on desk research complemented with qualitative empirical research in four localities in eastern and central Slovakia. The report finds that the implementation of NRIS and Revised Action Plan greatly suffered from administrative and personal changes brought by the early parliamentary elections in March 2012. Both documents were prepared by the previous administration.

There are, however, {{a number of problems}} of theoretical and practical interest where a designer may have a different objective than maximization of the SoU. One motivation for this is the desire for more equitable allocation of resources among agents. A second, more subtle, motivation is the fact that a fairer allocation indirectly implies less variation in taxes which can be desirable in a situation where (implicit) <b>individual</b> agent <b>budgetary</b> constraints make payment of large taxes unrealistic. In this paper we study a family of social utilities that provide fair allocation (with SoU being subsumed as an extreme case) and derive conditions under which Bayesian and Dominant strategy implementation is possible. Furthermore, it is shown how a simple modification of the above mechanism can guarantee full Bayesian implementation. Through a numerical example it is shown that the proposed method can result in significant gains both in allocation fairness and tax reduction...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{budgetary}} process and with the specific situation of small municipalities. The small municipalities are defined to be municipalities with less than one thousand residents, which are not further divided into <b>individual</b> departments. The <b>budgetary</b> process is outlined based on {{an example of a}} particular municipality in the region of Karlovy Vary. At the same time some differences compared to the previous development are highlighted as in 2009 the economic position of the local municipalities was affected by the impacts of the financial crisis. Finally, the recommendations are provided both to the particular municipality and to the general approach to the budgetary process as such...|$|R
40|$|Initially {{off to a}} slow start, European Union (EU) {{consular}} crisis management cooperation eventually developed as a response to exogenous factors. Given that guaranteeing the safety of one’s citizens is seen as one of the core responsibilities of the nation state, however, the EU’s Member States still seem reluctant to transfer this responsibility to the European level and the EU institutions. At times equated with propaganda, both the terminology and practice surrounding public diplomacy has received increased attention recently. Though not always labelled as such, public diplomacy efforts have gradually been stepped up by national foreign ministries and the EU institutions. Against the backdrop of this renaissance for consular affairs and public diplomacy, the current study examines EU action in the field of {{consular crisis}} management cooperation as a means of EU public diplomacy, potentially affecting the alleged (internal) lack of support for the project of an ever closed Union among the EU citizens, as well as serving the EU’s public diplomacy purposes vis-à-vis foreign audiences. On the basis of legal provisions, budget allocations and proven action thus far in the field of public diplomacy efforts related to EU consular crisis management cooperation, a number of conclusions are suggested: According to existing legal provisions, there is considerable scope for EU efforts in this field. Though it could potentially later be challenged by Member States and/or other EU institutions, the so-called institutional prerogative – which is often used as the legal basis for <b>budgetary</b> <b>commitments</b> in the field of information and communications by the European Commission – could be applied also to EU public diplomacy efforts in this area, i. e. (increasingly) funded through the Community budget. Though the enabling legal conditions are in place, and a number of budget lines exist {{that could be used to}} this end, to date a very limited number of initiatives have been realised. Looking at existing data regarding public opinion and EU consular cooperation, it seems that EU citizens (though to a varying degree, depending on the EU Member State and other demographical variations) would welcome an increased role for the EU in the area. Regarding public diplomacy, recent developments cannot be confined to the EU alone, but tend to be part of a broader trend which can be labelled the “societization” of traditional diplomacy, characterised by closer links between diplomacy and society. In terms of the limits of EU consular crisis management cooperation as a means of EU public diplomacy, constraints include the issue of responsibility, the distribution of credit and blame, national sensitivities, and differences in Member States’ resources and representation. Finally, arguing that the potential for European efforts in the field of consular crisis management as a tool of effective EU public diplomacy (both within the Union and outside) is great, it is surprising that not more attention is given to the area – especially in light of the Commission’s discourse on delivering tangible benefits to the EU’s citizens. To move from action as a mere response to exogenous factors to a situation where it is part of an EU policy of deliberate public diplomacy, the Union still has a long way to go...|$|R
