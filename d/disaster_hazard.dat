50|$|A <b>disaster</b> <b>hazard</b> is {{an extreme}} {{geophysical}} event {{that is capable of}} causing a disaster. 'Extreme' in this case means a substantial variation in either the positive or the negative direction from the normal trend; flood disasters can result from exceptionally high precipitation and river discharge, and drought is caused by exceptionally low values. The fundamental determinants of hazard and the risk of such hazards occurring is timing, location, magnitude and frequency. For example, magnitudes of earthquakes are measured on the Richter scale from 1 to 10, whereby each increment of 1 indicates a tenfold increase in severity. The magnitude-frequency rule states that over a significant period of time many small events and a few large ones will occur. Hurricanes and typhoons on the other hand occur between 5 degrees and 25 degrees north and south of the equator, tending to be seasonal phenomena which are thus largely recurrent in time and predictable in location due to the specific climate variables necessary for their formation.|$|E

The objective of WIFIRE is to build a cyberinfrastructure for real-time and data-driven simulation, prediction and visualization of wildfire behavior (see [URL] WIFIRE is funded by NSF Award # 1331615 as part of the Interdisciplinary Research in <b>Hazards</b> and <b>Disasters</b> (<b>Hazards</b> SEES) program. The objectives of the WIFIRE workshop were: (1) to identify technical barriers and milestones that need to be overcome in order to develop validated data-driven wildfire spread models and make them operational; and (2) to bring together leading representatives of the wildfire research community, the geosciences community and the fire science community. The wildfire research community has relevant expertise on wildfire operations; the geosciences community has relevant expertise on large-scale effects in wildfires (e. g., the coupling with atmospheric phenomena); the fire science community has relevant expertise on flame-scale effects in wildfires (e. g., the response of the fire to changing local conditions). The workshop was organized around four main topical areas and corresponding breakout groups, including operational rate-of-spread models for wildfire spread, CFD models, wildfire data, and data assimilation (see Appendix A for a description of the WIFIRE workshop program). Our goal in this report is to document and share the substance and scope of the workshop discussions and to thereby invite the wider research community to support, engage in, and contribute to the general effort to develop operational data-driven tools for wildfire spread predictions.

Even though the developed countries have made tremendous advances in the improvement of {{disaster management}}, the same cannot be said of the underdeveloped world and Ghana particularly the Builsa District. Most of the time, when disasters occur, victims try to manage them from within their communities based on existing capacities while efforts are made to seek external assistance. The Builsa Community Vulnerabilities and Capacity Assessment (VCAs) therefore aimed at co-documentation and re-invigoration of community knowledge and experiences in disaster management and building the capacity of communities to address the most urgent situations of vulnerability. VCAs were held in five communities that were most affected by the 2007 drought and floods. The exercise involved community analysis of their <b>disaster</b> <b>hazard</b> experiences, disaster trends, traditional coping strategies and the identification of the most vulnerable groups in each <b>disaster</b> <b>hazard</b> scenario.

30|$|The most poignant lesson echoing {{across the}} decades {{is perhaps the}} {{foundational}} disaster risk science statement that almost all disasters are caused by vulnerabilities, even though both vulnerability and hazard input into disaster risk. No matter what metric is used for <b>disaster,</b> <b>hazard</b> parameters do not necessarily correlate well with disaster outcome (Hewitt 1997). As one example, on 22 December 2003, central California experienced an earthquake of moment magnitude 6.5 at 8  km depth, which killed two people when a clock tower collapsed. Four days later, southeast Iran experienced an earthquake of similar parameters, moment magnitude 6.6 at 10  km depth, yet approximately 25, 000 people died. The different outcome from similar hazard parameters is attributed to only vulnerabilities affecting the disaster risk and causing the disaster.|$|E

30|$|What does {{disaster}} risk reduction (DRR) mean {{to public health}} professionals? Disaster Risk Reduction activities are broad and aim to reduce the impacts from disasters with respect to loss of life, injury, and other health impacts {{as well as on}} the wider socioeconomic determinants that affect population health including property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, and environmental damage. The use of scientific evidence to inform policy priorities and formulate effective initiatives and interventions is crucial to DRR, as it has been to public health in reducing the global burden of infectious diseases, including HIV, as well as improving maternal and child mortality globally (CDC 2011). To build knowledge that can be useful and usable in the broad and complex landscape that links environmental and societal impacts to population health, “science” should be considered in its widest sense to include the natural, environmental, social, economic, population health, and engineering sciences, and scientific capacities should be interpreted broadly to include all relevant resources and skills of a scientific and technical nature that can reduce the impact of <b>disaster</b> <b>hazards</b> (Basher 2013).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Landslides are {{significant}} geological hazards {{that can have}} destructive effectives on human life and property. Mostly people living in mountainous areas, and their properties, face crit ical danger from landslide disasters. Landslides are triggered due to unsustainable anthropogenic activities like mining, road cutting, urbanization, as well as natural causes like earthquakes and rainfall. Thus, landslide detection is an essential requirement in p re and post <b>disaster</b> <b>hazard</b> analysis. In earlier studies, landslide detection was often ach ieved through time consuming, cost intensive field surveys and visual orthophoto interpretation. Recent studies show that Earth Observation (EO) data offer new opportunities for fast, reliable and accurate landslide identification at smaller scales. This can contribute for effective landslide monitoring and hazard management. Sir Lanka is a tropical island comprising a heavy mountainous region in the centre. A combination of geology, unsafe land use practices and heavy rainfall from two monsoons have caused irregular landslides throughout th is central hilly region. From the 65, 000 km 2 of land in Sri Lanka, nearly 20, 000 k...|$|E

40|$|Owing to the {{difference}} of the sequences’ orders and the surface structure in the current panel grey relational models, research results will not be unique. In addition, individual measurement of indicators and objects and the subjectivity of combined weight would significantly weaken the effective information of panel data and reduce the reliability and accuracy of research results. Therefore, we propose the concept and calculation method of dispersion of panel data, establish the grey relational model based on dispersion of panel data (DPGRA), and prove that DPGRA exhibits the effective properties of uniqueness, symmetry, and normality. To demonstrate its applicability, the proposed DPGRA model is used to research on storm-tide disaster losses in China’s coastal areas. Comparing research results of three models, which are DPGRA, Euclidean distance grey relational model, and grey grid relational model, it was shown that DPGRA is more effective, feasible, and stable. It is indicated that DPGRA can entirely utilize the effective information of panel data; what’s more, it can not only handle the non-uniqueness of the grey relational model’s results but also improve the reliability and accuracy of research results.
