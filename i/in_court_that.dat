5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out <b>in</b> <b>court.</b> <b>That,</b> and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.|$|E
5|$|The defense, {{to support}} their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse. Conley claimed <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> he saw Frank place the purse in his office safe, {{although}} he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open {{and there was no}} purse in it. The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.|$|E
5|$|As {{the trial}} progressed however, Le Gris' {{testimony}} suffered several blows. The unwavering accusations directed at him by Marguerite and the shame such accusations brought to her were, {{in the eyes}} of the court, a powerful reason why the charges were not invented. Then, even as the trial progressed, one of the men providing Le Gris' alibi, named Jean Beloteau, was arrested in Paris and charged with rape. This charge seriously undermined Beloteau's testimony and Le Gris' defence. Finally, Carrouges himself offered counter-testimony <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> a healthy, strong man with long experience of horsemanship and a stable full of horses like Le Gris could certainly have made the 50mile trip without difficulty, even accounting for the snow.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|Protesters {{continued}} {{to delay the}} destruction of the tree. Solicitors for the campaign had even argued <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> receipt of a letter addressed to the tree itself gave it the status of a legal dwelling, causing a further delay,. In the early morning of 7 December 1993, several hundred police arrived to evict the protesters, which took ten hours to carry out. Protesters made numerous complaints against the police; police, in turn, denied these allegations, attributing any misbehaviour to the protesters. Media attention started to increase regarding the protest, with several daily newspapers putting pictures of the tree on their front pages.|$|E

5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E
5|$|In Britain, Seymour's {{victory was}} rewarded: Seymour himself was {{presented}} with a commemorative medal, £100 (with £625 to share among the wounded) and the freedoms of Cork and Limerick, although there were suggestions that he should receive a knighthood. In addition, first lieutenant Goddard Blennerhasset was promoted to commander, the junior officers were advanced and Thétis was purchased by the Royal Navy as HMS Brune, the crews of Emerald and Amethyst profiting from the prize money. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. Amethyst had been severely damaged in the engagement and repairs took 71 days to complete at Plymouth. Five months later, Seymour and Maitland were specially selected to hunt the Niémen, en route to Île de France, in the Bay of Biscay. Again, Emerald was absent when the frigate was brought to action and again Seymour was able to capture his opponent after a fierce encounter in the Action of 6 April 1809. Although Seymour praised the bravery of Thétis surviving French officer, Lieutenant Joseph Dedé, Dedé later swore <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> Thétis had not surrendered until after Triumph and Shannon arrived, a statement that contradicts not only British testimony, but also Dedé's own insistence {{on the night of}} the battle that he had not seen any other ships during the action. Historian William James suggests that this was a deliberate attempt to appeal to the French naval authorities to avoid responsibility for the defeat.|$|E

25|$|The case came {{to court}} in January 2008 where Hodgson denied taking Nicholl {{to any of}} his {{ramshackle}} huts hidden in the Sandbeck Plantation near to the A6136 road, south of Richmond. DNA evidence contradicted this as did the discovery of Nicholl's nightdress, teddy bear and cassette player at the same location. Police believed that Hodgson became jealous of his brother's relationship with Nicholl and he killed her on the night she disappeared. Hodgson's elder daughter, stated <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> Nicholl was seen alive in Richmond two days after her disappearance and had been staying with her uncle (Hodgson's elder brother). Robert Hodgson denied this claim and stated <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> {{he had not seen}} Nicholl for some time.|$|E

25|$|The {{battered}} person {{defense is}} a defense used <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> the person accused of an assault/murder {{was suffering from}} battered person syndrome at the material time.

25|$|The appeal trial {{concluded}} on 15 October 2010, and {{the verdict}} was announced on 26 November.

Neij's sentence was reduced to 10 months, Sunde's to eight, and Lundström's to four. However, the fine was increased from 32 to 46million kronor.|$|E
