At Riverrun, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) unsuccessfully negotiates Sansa's request for help from the Blackfish (Clive Russell), and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) to the castle, with Edmure commanding they throw down their arms and surrender to the Lannisters.

500|$|The last {{significant}} work {{to treat}} the existence of pig-faced women as fact was Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful by ghost hunter and supernatural researcher Elliott O'Donnell, published in 1924. O'Donnell alleged that {{the ghost of a}} pig-faced lady haunted a house in Chelsea. O'Donnell claimed that the ghost was a [...] "Vice Elemental, the most harmful of all the denizens of the Spirit World". He describes how a clergyman, [...] "The Rev.MrH." [...] and his family, who resided in the house, were tempted by the ghost. The ghost, keeping her face concealed, led [...] "The Rev.MrH." [...] into drunkenness, and his children into cruelty towards animals, until they themselves behaved like pigs. She then revealed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shocked family, who moved out of the house immediately.|$|E
2500|$|The Māori {{name for}} Stratford is Whakaahurangi, meaning {{face to the}} sky. The name is taken from {{a story of a}} Patea chieftainess named Ruapu-tahanga who, {{returning}} from a visit to Kawhia, camped overnight near the location of the current town. [...] Being a clear night, Ruaputahanga lay contemplating the stars when slumber overtook her. [...] Withdrawing in respect, her followers observed that their chieftainess slept [...] "with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sky". [...] The site continued {{to be used as a}} camping place for Māori along what became known as the Whakaahurangi track, linking the south Taranaki tribes to those in north Taranaki, and further north to Kawhia. [...] Each traveling party would recollect the story of Ruapu-tahanga sleeping with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sky. The name is fitting, given the exposure of the area to a broad horizon on the face of the mountain’s ring plain.|$|E

2500|$|The poem may {{allude to}} {{the myth of}} Clytie and Hyperion (as {{described}} in Ovid's Metamorphoses) [...] Clytie, a girl or nymph, [...] {{was in love with}} Hyperion, (in some classical writers also identified with Helios or Apollo), the Sun god, who in turn was in love with Leucothoe (or Leucothea). Hyperion/Helios and Leucothoe met in secret, but Clytie, possessed by jealousy, betrayed the lovers and Leucothoe was killed by her angry father. As a result, Hyperion scorned Clytie, who, still a virgin, pined away, went mad, sat rooted to the ground and turned (i.e.: metamorphosed) into a Sunflower or possibly a Heliotropium, condemned, or fated, by her love, to always turn <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun (Hyperion/Helios) as it/he moves across the sky.(Note that, in actuality, there is no evidence for Sunflower heliotropism. See: Heliotropism misconception).|$|E
2500|$|In The End of Time, {{a mysterious}} individual, {{referred}} to {{only in the}} credits as [...] "The Woman", appears unexpectedly to Wilfred Mott throughout both episodes. She is later revealed to be a dissident Time Lady, who opposed the Time Lord High Council's plan to escape the Time War. When she reveals <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Doctor, his reaction indicates that he recognises her. Julie Gardner, in the episode's commentary, states that while some have speculated that the Time Lady is the Doctor's mother, neither she nor Russell T. Davies are willing to comment on her identity. When later asked by Wilfred who she was, the Doctor evades answering the question, making their connection unclear. In Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale – The Final Chapter, Russell T Davies states that he created the character to be the Doctor's mother {{and this is what}} actress Claire Bloom was told when she was cast.|$|E
2500|$|Queen Dowager Sophie Amalie died in February 1685. On {{the morning}} of 19 May 1685 Leonora Christina was {{informed}} that a royal order had been issued by Chancellor Frederick von Ahlfeldt (he who had reluctantly escorted her into the Tower) for her release. But she refused the guard's offer to unlock her cell until, at 10 o'clock that night, denied a final private audience with the Queen and fetched by Sophie Amalie Lindenov, the daughter of her long-dead sister Elisabeth Augusta Lindenov, the destitute Countess left the Blue Tower forever {{under cover of darkness}} and a veil, denying even a glimpse of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> curious crowd that had gathered in the courtyard (the Queen and her ladies watched from the palace balcony). For them Leonora Christina had already entered into legend [...] a royal adventuress who had been first regaled then held captive by the kings of England, Sweden and Denmark. She was sixty-three years old, and had spent twenty-one years, nine months and eleven days in the Tower. She lived her last years quietly on the grounds of Maribo Monastery, where she occupied her time editing her prison notebooks.|$|E

2500|$|Colbert was {{a stickler}} for {{perfection}} regarding the way she appeared on screen. She believed that her face was difficult to light and photograph, and was obsessed with not showing {{the right side of}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera, because of a small bump resulting from a childhood broken nose. She often refused to be filmed from the right side of her face, and this sometimes necessitated redesigning movie sets. During the filming of Tovarich in 1937, one of her favored cameramen was dismissed by the director, Anatole Litvak. After seeing the rushes filmed by the replacement, Colbert refused to continue. She insisted on hiring her own cameraman, and offered to waive her salary if the film went over budget as a result. Gary Cooper was terrified at the prospect of working with Colbert in his first comedy, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938), which was the year's 15th domestic box-office success. [...] Cooper respected [...] Colbert to be an expert in the genre. She learned about lighting and cinematography, and refused to begin filming until she was satisfied that she would be shown to her best advantage. [...] Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) with Henry Fonda was Colbert's first color film, which was the year's 6th domestic box-office success. However, she distrusted the relatively new Technicolor process and feared that she would not photograph well, preferring thereafter to be filmed in black and white.|$|E
