It shows Bhairava, or Virabhadra, a ferocious form of Shiva killing the demon Andhaka (literally, [...] "blind, darkness"). The relief is much ruined below the waist, is [...] high and posed in action.

There are no plans [...] at the moment but I definitely wouldn't rule it out. I love the show and I love the character. I miss the character enormously." [...] On 17 May 2013, show bosses announced that Womack would return to EastEnders as Ronnie for six months. It was said that Ronnie's return will form a major part of summer and autumn storylines. Speaking of her comeback, Womack said: [...] "I am thrilled to be returning to the role of Ronnie for the next six months. Ronnie <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison and her reappearance in [...] Square is going to create havoc. I can't wait to be a Mitchell once again!" [...] EastEnders executive producer Lorraine Newman added: [...] "We're delighted to announce Samantha Womack's return to Albert Square. The Mitchell sisters are a fabulous pairing and it will be an absolute delight to have Ronnie and Roxy back together on screen.

Each corner of the tomb had a tragic mask on it, with that captivating expression of countenance which belongs to the tragic masks generally.
