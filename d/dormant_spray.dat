40|$|This {{memorandum}} provides {{results of}} water sampling {{conducted on the}} San Joaquin River (SJR) by the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) for the <b>Dormant</b> <b>Spray</b> Water Quality Program. Information presented is from December 7, 1998 to March 5, 1999 and includes results from chemical analyses conducted by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and bioassays conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG). This memorandum summarizes one-year of a five-year study begun in 1996, designed to monitor <b>dormant</b> <b>spray</b> insecticides (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and methidathion) in the SJR watershed. In an effort to obtain more information about pesticide residues in surface water, samples were analyzed for additional insecticides as well as selected herbicides. This memorandum does not include an in-depth interpretation of the data which will be provided in the final report. BACKGROUND: The SJR flows west from the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, then flow heads north through the San Joaquin Valley and terminates in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The river extends approximately 134 miles from Friant Dam to Stevinson where flows are intermittent, and from Stevinson to Vernalis (about 60 miles) where flows are perennial (Figure 1).

40|$|Diazinon is an {{organophosphate}} (OP) insecticide {{currently used}} {{on a wide variety}} of crops during California's irrigation season, as well as on dormant orchard trees during the winter season. Detections of diazinon in surface water have been reported in several areas of the state during all times of the year. The objective of this analysis was to assess recent (2003 - 2008) irrigation season surface water monitoring data from agricultural areas of California in order to determine the extent to which diazinon moves offsite into surface waters after irrigation season use. Monitoring data from sample sites that could potentially receive runoff from <b>dormant</b> <b>spray</b> applications of diazinon, or from urban sources, were identified and eliminated from the analysis in order to focus the analysis on irrigation season uses and sources. Monitoring data were from a variety of sources, including the Department of Pesticide Regulation, US Geological Survey...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the trends and {{regional}} patterns of organophosphate (OP) use in California almond orchards from 1992 to 2000, and to identify factors that may have influenced those trends, including weather, pest pressure, and use of alternative practices to control pests. Background Growers use OP pesticides to control arthropod pests in almonds. An OP may be applied to dormant orchards during the winter (called a <b>dormant</b> OP <b>spray).</b> These <b>dormant</b> OPs are usually applied with a narrow-range oil, which is added to improve the effectiveness of the OP and because the oil itself kills some arthropods by suffocating them. Dormant OPs with oils are used primarily to control peach twig borer (PTB), San Jose scale (SJS), European red mite, and brown mite. <b>Dormant</b> <b>sprays</b> have traditionally been considered the most effective way to control all these pests. Applications during the winter are considered less disruptive to non-target organisms, such as natural enemies, than applications during the spring and summer since most organisms are less active during the winter. Thus, in the past a <b>dormant</b> OP <b>spray</b> was routinely applied. However, recen...|$|R

40|$|Board tested {{water quality}} in the San Joaquin River (SJR) {{watershed}} using toxicity tests. They found that water samples from {{certain areas of the}} watershed caused a species of water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia) to die. Ceriodaphnia dubia is used in these toxicity tests because it is sensitive to insecticides and represents aquatic arthropods (one of the components of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency three-species toxicity test). Based on these results, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board suggested pesticides as the possible cause. The Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), which is responsible for preventing pesticide contamination of surface water and ground water, conducted a study in the SJR watershed. This report summarizes data collected during the winter <b>dormant</b> <b>spray</b> seasons of 199 1 - 92 and 1992 - 93. Subsequent reports will summarize results from other periods of high insecticide use.

They also sampled many other sites throughout the watershed during several storms to determine mass loading of insecticides in the watershed...|$|E
40|$|DPR) {{recently}} completed {{an analysis of}} diazinon and chlorpyrifos surface water monitoring data in DPR’s surface water database (SURF) (Spurlock, 2002). DPR subsequently placed diazinon-containing <b>dormant</b> <b>spray</b> pesticides into re-evaluation because of ongoing dormant season exceedances of Department of Fish and Game (DFG) diazinon water quality criteria (WQC) (DPR, 2003 a). The analysis also concluded that (a) {{there was only one}} chlorpyrifos detection reported in SURF since 1997, (b) that single detection occurred during DPR’s winter dormant season monitoring, (c) the peak use periods for chlorpyrifos were the spring and summer months, and (d) that there were no recent chlorpyrifos monitoring data in SURF for the peak-use spring or summer months (Spurlock, 2002). Consequently, the SURF data available at that time were inadequate to determine whether chlorpyrifos was present in California surface water at levels that might exceed WQC. The availability of recent monitoring data during the use season was critical from a regulatory standpoint because use of chlorpyrifos had been steadily decreasing. Therefore, the available older historical data were not representative of current water quality conditions. To address DPR’s lack of recent chlorpyrifos monitoring data, the Department’s Surface Water Protection Program conducted monitoring studies in 2002 and 2003 (Bacey, 2001...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that some organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) move from application sites to non-target crops. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if aerial movement and deposition of three organophosphate insecticides (chlorpyrifos, diazinon and parathion or their oxygen analogs) occur on non-target crops as a result of agricultural applications during the summer months in two agricultural regions of California. BACKGROUND During the winters of 1989 and 1990 the California Department of Pesticide Regulation monitored the aerial movement of three OPs used as <b>dormant</b> <b>sprays</b> in California orchards. This monitoring demonstrated that during the winter, OPs are regionally transported and deposited on non-target vegetation during fog and dry weather as a result of drift either during or after application. The results suggested that pesticides contained in fog may have come from applications made outside a 400 meter zone as well as from closer applications. If inadvertent OP residues occur on non-target vegetation durin...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 This thesis {{addressed}} {{the potential of}} endemic predaceous and parasitic arthropods of the Hood River Valley, Oregon to suppress the pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola F 8 rster. Natural enemies adequately suppressed psylla in three of seven unsprayed orchards of differing vegetational settings, orchard age, and size. Relatively few psylla natural enemies dispersed to unsprayed pear mini-orchards, dspite abundant populations on surrounding noncultivated vegetation. Pear psylla natural enemies were more abundant on arboreal rather than herbaceous non-pear hosts. Selective programs of pear pest control based on diflubenzuron were moderately successful in controlling the pear psylla, with natural enemies aiding in suppression in six of fourteen commercial trials of selective programs. In both unsprayed and commercial pear orchards, late-season psylla densities appeared to be best suppressed when levels of natural enemies were high during early-season. Classification analysis confirmed that orchard site, chemical regime, type (mini- or commercial), and season affected proportions of natural enemies and their pear psylla prey. Complexes of natural enemies and pear psylla immatures from commercial orchards where biological control was successfully demonstrated were taxonomically similar. Effective natural enemy complexes in commercial orchards were characterized by earwigs, lacewing larvae, and moderate proportions of pear psylla immatures during early season and Deraeocoris brevis, earwigs, and lacewings during mid-season. Plagiognathous guttatipes (Uhler) or Diaphnocoris provancheri (Burque) dominated effective natural enemy seasonal complexes at each of two mini-orchards. The functional response to pear psylla eggs was measured for five predaceous mirids. Functional response parameters differed among species and their life-stages, but all destroyed large numbers of psylla eggs. Further experimental directions {{for the implementation of}} pear psylla biological control are proposed. General investigative strategies include: (1) augment natural enemies on non-pear vegetation adjacent to the target orchard, and (2) modify the orchard habitat to both encourage natural enemy colonization and allow permanent complexes of natural enemies to develop. Specific tactics include: plant hedgerows of filbert or willow, cultivate snakeflies, introduce Anthocoris nemoralis, adjust early season psylla densities with suitable timing and kind of delayed <b>dormant</b> <b>sprays,</b> using a more effective selective psyllacide, and reduce winter pruning to allow development of natural enemies which overwinter in the egg stage...|$|R
40|$|DPR) conducts {{surface water}} {{monitoring}} for pesticide active ingredients (AIs) {{for which there}} are limited or no recent California monitoring data. The objective of this memorandum is to identify a prioritized list of candidate AIs and associated surface water monitoring locations based on detailed analysis of acute aquatic toxicity data and recent agricultural pesticide use data. Approximately 125 agricultural use AIs served as the base set of pesticides for this surface water screening procedure. Sufficient aquatic toxicity data were available to classify 39 of these AIs into 5 broad relative aquatic toxicity categories ranging from “very low ” to “very high. ” Spatial and temporal characteristics of agricultural pesticide use for the 23 AIs with the highest aquatic toxicity ranking were determined from analysis of recent agricultural use data. Prioritized monitoring recommendations were then developed for these 23 pesticide AIs. Pesticide AIs currently undergoing reevaluation by DPR (pyrethroid insecticides, chlorpyrifos, and diazinon <b>dormant</b> <b>spray</b> use) {{are not included in}} this assessment. PROCEDURE Pesticide Use Assessment Using DPR’s Pesticide Use Reporting database (DPR 2006 a), a list was developed of all AIs with at least 5, 000 pounds of agricultural use in at least one county during 2003. The choice of this amount as a cut off point was chosen in order to capture all AIs with significant use, based on agricultural use patterns in California. Pesticide use in all counties statewide was included in this assessment. This initial list included approximately 125 AIs (Table A- 1, Appendix A) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and potential}} effects of current-use pesticides are {{of concern in}} the San Francisco Estuary watershed but {{our understanding of the}} spatial and temporal distribution of contamination is limited. This paper summarizes almost two decades of historical data and uses it to describe our current knowledge of the processes controlling the occurrence of current-use pesticides in the watershed. Monitoring studies analyze fewer than half of the pesticides applied in the watershed and most of our knowledge is about inputs of dissolved pesticides in the upper watershed. The four major seasonal patterns of riverine inputs of pesticides to the estuary can be identified by usage and transport mechanism. <b>Dormant</b> <b>spray</b> insecticides applied to orchards and herbicides applied to a variety of crops are transported by rainfall during the winter. Alfalfa pesticides are detected following rainfall and irrigation return flow in the spring, and rice pesticides are detected following release of rice field water in the summer. Irrigation return flows transport a variety of herbicides during the summer. In addition, pesticides applied on Delta islands can cause elevated pesticide concentrations in localized areas. Although not as well characterized, urban creeks appear to have their own patterns of insecticide concentrations causing toxicity throughout most of the year. Current-use pesticides have also been detected on suspended and bed sediments throughout the watershed but limited data make it difficult to determine occurrence patterns. Data gaps include the lack of analysis of many pesticides (or degradates), changing pesticide use, limited information on pesticide transport within the Delta, and an incomplete understanding of the transport and persistence of sediment-associated pesticides. Future monitoring programs should be designed to address these data gaps...|$|E

5000|$|Tajikistan Orchard Management: Akmal Dekhan Farm sits on 21 {{hectares}} in Sughd province, producing sweet apricot {{varieties that}} are in high demand in local markets. It is located in Tajikistan’s portion of the Fergana Valley, a large triangular and very fertile valley in what is an often dry part of Central Asia. Sughd province is the country’s breadbasket, with the most productive farmland {{in a country with}} only six percent arable land. However, agricultural practices remain antiquated, leaving productivity well below its full potential. F2F staff analyzed Akmal Dekhan Farm and determined that its major challenge was low productivity as a result of outdated orchard management techniques, which kept sales and income for the farm low. F2F volunteer Brian Flanagan, an international agriculture and rural development specialist from New York, visited Sughd province for two weeks to train a group of orchard farmers on proper pruning and grafting techniques. Mr. Flanagan also trained owners on the importance of soil testing and collected a number of soil samples from Akmal Farm, sharing the results and recommendations on proper fertilization once tests results returned. Finally, the volunteer demonstrated an inexpensive, non-toxic <b>dormant</b> oil <b>spray</b> that can be easily mixed using readily available ingredients and is highly effective at controlling many diseases and pests that afflict fruit trees. Mr. Flanagan’s time with Akmal was well spent. Over the course of one growing season, gross sales increased 32 percent, while productivity jumped nearly 30 percent to 66,800 kilos. F2F assistance in orchard management and improved production practices has helped farmers satisfy local demand while increasing incomes and sustainability for their businesses.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY- A {{study on}} the effects of Hydrogen-Cyanamide (Dormex®) and urea {{treatments}} onto vegetative and reproductive Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) cycle was carried out on bearing and non-bearing 15 year-old trees of cv Bianca grafted onto P. terebinthus, in a commercial Pistachio orchard located at Caltanissetta (Sicily). The aim of the study, was to extend and improve leaf functionality by anticipating time of bud break and by sustaining leaf nitrogen level. On March 2002 and February 2003 vegetative terminal <b>dormant</b> buds were <b>sprayed</b> with 3 % and 4 % solution of Hydrogen-Cyanamide (Dormex®), respectively. Foliar applications of urea (0. 25 %) were executed early in the summer. The timing of budbreak was not affected by the Dormex ® treatment in 2002, however shoot growing rate, number of nodes and leaf area per shoot were significantly higher on the shoots treated with Hydrogen-Cyanamid in comparison with the control. Nitrogen foliar applications increased leaf CO 2 assimilation rate and shell dehiscence and decreased the percentage of blank nuts and fruit abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1960 More than {{one-fourth of}} the forest land in the Pacific Northwest is growing timber at reduced {{capacity}} {{as the result of}} brush encroachment. Increasing use of chemicals in brush control requires that more information be available regarding their use. Bigleaf maple, Oregon oak and vine maple are among the more noxious brush species in the Willamette Valley area. This thesis summarizes the progress which has been made in the control of these species by the Forest Research Division. Aerial sprays have been found satisfactory in many areas for broadcast spraying of low brush cover. Basal sprays and ground level foliage sprays are used on weed trees and tall brush. Topography is also a major consideration in choice of method. Effectiveness of the herbicide is determined by climate, season, species, specific chemical, formulation, diluent, concentration, and many unknown factors. Most of the treatments in this project were applied to individual stems. Many of the tests were established in order to find the most effective chemical for a given situation; others expand on information gained in earlier trials. On large trees, applications were made both basally and in frills; also in bands around the boles at breast height with paste type herbicides. Smaller shrubs were treated with foliage <b>sprays,</b> <b>dormant</b> cane <b>sprays,</b> and individual stem sprays. The treatments were located on Bureau of Land Management land near Scio, Oregon, and in the McDonald Forest. Aerial spray projects conducted by the Bureau of Land Management in the Cascades and in the Coast Range have been included in these observations. Bigleaf maple was killed very successfully with basal sprays of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in oil in a mixture of 32 ahg. It is very likely that much lower dosages will prove adequate. Maple stems up to eight inches d. b. h. were well controlled with 2, 4, 5 -T applied in a similar manner. Girdling has not proved to be an adequate method of control because of basal resprouting and delayed top-kill. Frilling followed with a dilute spray (22 ahg) of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in kerosene gave good control. However, the cost of application is higher than for a similar basal spray. Paste herbicides were largely rather ineffective except for kilbrush applied in September. Oregon oak has proven more difficult to kill with basal sprays than maple. However, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and 2, 4 -D amine in frills have both provided complete top killing. 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) gave the better sprout control. Kilbrush gave good results on small stems when applied in August. Scarification of the bark prior to treatment proved to be the most dependable method. Vine maple has been top-killed by 2, 4, 5 -T, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and brushkiller mixtures in many forms and concentrations. Sprouting has not been controlled completely by any of these but 2, 4, 5 -T is the most effective in this respect. Aerial sprays of four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T in some cases have caused nearly complete top-kill, and considerable sprout retardation. Snowbrush has been completely killed by 2, 4, 5 -T with foliage and with step sprays. A Bureau of Land Management aerial spray project using four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T gave 100 per cent kill of this species. Cherry, elderberry, thimbleberry, poison oak and madrone can be effectively top-killed with 2, 4, 5 -T as basal or foliage spray. Sprout control has been relatively poor on most of these species. Grass competition to young seedlings can be reduced with several chemicals. Tree survival is consistently higher, however, when the minimum amount of grass herbicide is applied which will reduce grass density to approximately 60 per cent of normal. Soil sterilization reduces tree survival. The use of herbicides as a forest management tool has increased rapidly in recent years. Public acceptance of the value of this tool and further refinements in techniques can provide much needed relief for the brush problem in out forests...|$|R
