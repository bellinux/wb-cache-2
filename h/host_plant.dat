5|$|Predators {{including}} Cactoblastis cactorum (mentioned above) {{can also}} be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, the poison hemlock moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) can be used to control poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its <b>host</b> <b>plant,</b> poison hemlock, and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual <b>host</b> <b>plant,</b> destroying large swathes of the hemlock.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Both {{adults and}} larvae {{use the same}} <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> during their life cycle. As tansy often grows in {{discrete}} clumps, {{the total population of}} C. graminis in an area may be divided and individuals may spend their entire life cycle within an area of a few square metres.|$|E
40|$|<b>Host</b> <b>plants</b> of Cerambycidae and Vesperidae (Coleoptera, Chrysomeloidea) from South America. This {{paper offers}} a {{contribution}} to the knowledge on <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> of Cerambycidae and Vesperidae (Coleoptera, Chrysomeloidea) from South America. A total of 211 species of longhorn beetles belonging to 111 genera, 49 tribes, five subfamilies and two families are presented with records of <b>host</b> <b>plants.</b> Data on 259 species of <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> distributed among 188 genera and 69 families are listed with the beetle species...|$|R
50|$|This {{is a brief}} list of {{some common}} <b>host</b> <b>plants.</b> Most {{agricultural}} crops will benefit from Rhizophagus irregularis inoculation. Generally <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> must be vascular plants, but not always.|$|R
50|$|Identification of the larval <b>host</b> <b>plant(s)</b> of Castiarina allensundholmi {{would assist}} {{delineating}} its geographic range and habitat requirements. Identification of the larval <b>host</b> <b>plant(s)</b> {{of the two}} other known species in the Castiarina balteata species group may also be of help. However, there are currently no public resources allocated to identifying the larval <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> of any Australian Buprestid species.|$|R
5|$|Like {{many other}} {{strictly}} mycorrhizal fungi, B.edulis has to date eluded cultivation attempts. The results of {{some studies suggest}} that unknown components of the soil microflora might be required for B.edulis to successfully establish a mycorrhizal relationship with the <b>host</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the <b>host</b> <b>plant,</b> a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation {{to blend in with}} the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E
5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their <b>host</b> <b>plant,</b> or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Habitat== H. glabra is a {{widespread}} species, It has various <b>host</b> <b>plants,</b> particularly buttercups. Creeping buttercup and meadow buttercup' are especially prevalent as <b>host</b> <b>plants.</b> Adults overwinter in grass tussocks.|$|R
25|$|The {{eggs are}} often {{laid on the}} ground or on dry twigs near the <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> rather than on them. On {{hatching}} the larvae find their way to the <b>host</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Host</b> <b>plants</b> {{including}} {{a total of}} 22 families representing 45 species were recorded for 16 fruit flies of the tribe Dacini in Sri Lanka. Bactrocera kandiensis {{was found to be}} highly polyphagous, and its host range was as wide as that of B. dorsalis. Some <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> of B. dorsalis, B. kandiensis, B. correcta, B. cucurbitae, and B. trilineata were newly recorded. In addition, <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> of B. gavisa, B. sp. near nigrotibialis, B. sp. near tau, Dacus discophorus, and D. keiseri were recorded for the first time. <b>Host</b> <b>plants</b> of 46 % Sri Lankan Dacini are now known...|$|R
5|$|Armillaria gallica {{can produce}} cyclobutane-containing {{metabolites}} such as arnamiol, a natural {{product that is}} classified as a sesquiterpenoid aryl ester. Although the specific function of arnamiol is not definitively known, similar chemicals present in other Armillaria species are thought {{to play a role}} in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> prior to infection.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their <b>host</b> <b>plant.</b> Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E
5|$|Fungus-growing ants {{that make}} up the tribe Attini, {{including}} leafcutter ants, cultivate certain species of fungus in the Leucoagaricus or Leucocoprinus genera of the Agaricaceae family. In this ant-fungus mutualism, both species depend on each other for survival. The ant Allomerus decemarticulatus has evolved a three-way association with the <b>host</b> <b>plant,</b> Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), and a sticky fungus which is used to trap their insect prey.|$|E
50|$|Larval {{biology and}} <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> are not known, but <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> {{are likely to}} be one or more species of the plant groups common in {{peatland}} habitats such as Salix and various Ericaceae.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{work has}} the {{objective}} to catalogue the information of Chrysodeixis includens (Walker, [1858]) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae: Plusiinae) <b>host</b> <b>plants.</b> The list of plants comprehends new reports of <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> in Brazil and information from literature review around the world. It is listed 174 plants which are from 39 botanic families. The {{higher number of}} <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> of C. includens are in Asteraceae (29), Solanaceae (21), Fabaceae (18) and Lamiaceae (12) ...|$|R
50|$|They feed on plant sap, {{mostly of}} Chenopodiaceae and Caryophyllaceae. Piesma linnavouri' {{have been found}} on Acacia (Fabaceae). Mcateella' have been found on many <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> but mostly Acacia and Proteaceae. The <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> of Miespa remain unknown.|$|R
5|$|Like DNA, RNA {{can carry}} genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> cell's polymerase.|$|E
5|$|Numerous nectar-feeding {{insects are}} {{attracted}} to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{cochineal}} {{lives on}} herbaceous plants growing in sandy and arid, infertile soils. Its primary <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> is the perennial knawel (Scleranthus perennis), {{but it has}} also been known to feed on plants of 20 other genera, including mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella), bladder campion (Silene inflata), velvet bent (Agrostis canina), Caragana, smooth rupturewort (Herniaria glabra), strawberry (Fragaria), and cinquefoil (Potentilla).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hosts</b> <b>plants</b> are unknown.|$|R
50|$|The {{mistletoe}} is a leafless {{plant that}} attaches to <b>host</b> <b>plants,</b> often leguminous woody desert trees such as Cercidium and Prosopis. Desert mistletoe takes water and minerals from its <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> {{but it does}} its own photosynthesis, making it a hemiparasite.|$|R
50|$|At the larval stage, common tussock {{caterpillars}} {{are able}} to camouflage themselves amongst various tall and short grasses which serve as the <b>host</b> <b>plants.</b> This ability to camouflage against <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> continues when A. antipodum develop into pupae, or reach the chrysalis stage of development.|$|R
5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{mitigate}} damage by camas pocket gophers to sensitive habitat, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Institute for Applied Ecology trap and relocate the animals. At a site south of Philomath, Oregon, the IAE is working to protect a small but viable population of Kincaid's lupine (Lupinus sulphureus). This threatened flower is the primary <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> for the endangered Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi), which is endemic to the Willamette Valley. The gophers are relocated to a nearby location distant from the lupines.|$|E
25|$|The {{caterpillar}} {{feeds on}} <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> {{of many different}} families. Common <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> used {{are those of the}} Magnoliaceae and Rosaceae families, with species including tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), sweet bay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and wild black cherry (Prunus serotina). It also feeds on other members of the family Rosaceae, as well as members from the families Lauraceae, Oleaceae, Rutaceae, and Tilioideae. Aspens (Populus sect. Populus), birches (Betula), and willows (Salix) have been recorded in older literature as <b>host</b> <b>plants,</b> but these are used by P. canadensis.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} {{affecting}} species distribution {{and at what}} scale a species respond to these factors is a major challenge in conservation biology. I studied the distribution and abundance of a monophagous shield bug Canthophorus impressus at three spatial scales: <b>host</b> <b>plants,</b> patches and circular landscapes (area ca. 3 km 2), to determine {{the relative importance of}} the different spatial scales and how habitat quality, amount and spatial configuration affect the distribution of C. impressus. Influence of habitat characteristics on occurrence and abundance of the bug was analysed with separate generalised linear mixed models. The data show that effects of habitat quality and amount dominate over configuration in determining the distribution of C. impressus. The bug prefers large <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> in warm conditions on a plant scale and abundant <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> in a landscape scale, whereas patch scale was not important for the distribution of the bug. Management should aim to preserve sites with abundant <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> and promote large <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> with low to moderate grazing. To secure sufficient number of <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> in the landscape, high densities of suitable habitat such as semi-natural grasslands should be preserved. This study suggests that analyses of multiple spatial scales are crucial for identifying appropriate actions for successful conservation of species living in fragmented habitats...|$|R

5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E
5|$|Omphalea, {{like many}} {{other members of the}} Euphorbiaceae, {{possesses}} leaf nectaries that attract polistine wasps, which are predators of early instar caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also attract ants. The ants usually protect their <b>host</b> <b>plant,</b> eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, they generally completely ignore Chrysiridia caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence. This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. Omphalea species contain polyhydroxy alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Lepidoptera utilise {{the leaves of}} {{ailanthus}} as food, including the Indian moon moth (Actias selene) and the common grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). In North America the tree is the <b>host</b> <b>plant</b> for the ailanthus webworm (Atteva aurea), though this ermine moth is native to Central and South America and originally used {{other members of the}} mostly tropical Simaroubaceae as its hosts. In its native range A. altissima is associated with at least 32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspected}} <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> are Phragmites species.|$|R
50|$|The known <b>host</b> <b>plants</b> include Krukoviella obovata.|$|R
