Nowadays, {{manipulation}} of liquids in miniaturised environments finds applica-tions in many fields in biology and medicine such as diagnostics, toxicity analysis, drug delivery and so on. In those domains, the use of disposable devices has the great advantage of removing any surface contamination which could results in de-vice malfunction. In this context, the present work revolves around {{the use of a}} thermoexpandable material, composed of <b>expandable</b> <b>beads</b> in an elastomeric ma-trix, used as actuator for liquids. is material is expandable only once, providing a good actuation for disposable devices. It also allows to keep the material inflated without additional energy input. is thesis has three main goals: understanding the expansion properties of this material through characterisation and modelling, proposing implementation of the heating source, and investigating possible appli-cations...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} is one {{of critical}} parameters with regards to an anti-frost fill. This study presented the effects of mixing ratio and frost action on the thermal conductivity of a newly developed antifrost fill, which comprises mixture of waste foundry sand (WFS), fly ash (FA), <b>expandable</b> polystyrene (EPS) <b>beads,</b> Portland cement and water. Test {{results show that the}} increase of EPS, FA or cement results in the decrease of mixture thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity of the mixture is favorably less than that of conventional geomaterial, which leads the mixture an attractive geomaterial if frost mitigation is desirable. A.

40|$|A {{frost-resistant}} earth fill {{was proposed}} by mixing waste foundry sand (WFS), fly ash (FA), <b>expandable</b> polystyrene (EPS) <b>beads,</b> Portland cement {{and water in}} proportions, which was known as WFS-FA-EPS fill. This study examined the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) weakening susceptibility {{of a range of}} WFS-FA-EPS specimens prepared at designated compositions which were exposed to freeze-thaw (F-T) cycling from 20 ºC to − 15 ºC and up to 5 times. It was found that the inclusion of EPS reduced the unit weight of the fill materials by 20 - 40 %. The majority of UCS loss was found suffered in the first F-T impact. Cement component clearly enhanced the anti-frost capability of materials. Components of EPS and FA also improved the F-T resistance of materials. Water was the main factor leading to F-T impairment, and should be prudentially added into the mixture. Inclusion of EPS beads was able to mitigate the frost impact by the means of reducing UCS loss. The optimal contents were 1. 08 % for EPS bead and 30 % for FA. An Deng, Zhongyi He, and Haibo Wang[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Polymer bead foams are {{manufactured}} through a sintering process using foamed polymer beads. It is worth emphasis that the bead foam {{technology is the}} only process that can produce 3 -dimensionally shaped foam products with ultra-low densities. This unique feature of bead foam process has been attracting enormous attentions from various foam industries. However the conventional bead foam processes still have some limitations associated with manufacturing productivity and safety during the treatment. This thesis deals with novel approaches to innovative and cost-effective manufacturing processes for polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) bead foam materials, based on thorough understanding of the scientific issues in bead foam technologies. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of new processes by conducting a series of foaming experiments such as batch foaming and continuous extrusion foaming as well as steam chest molding which is a critical common process for all bead foam products. In addition, this study aimed at developing new bead foam processes based {{on the relationship between}} the cellular structure and processing/material parameters. When it comes to <b>expandable</b> PS (EPS) <b>bead</b> process, research efforts have been made to eliminate n-pentan...|$|R
40|$|English title: Influence of {{freeze-thaw}} cycles on {{compression strength}} characteristics of WFS-FA-EPS beads lightweight fillersA lightweight fillers studied include waste foundry sand, fly ash, <b>expandable</b> polystyrene (EPS) <b>beads.</b> Utilization of lightweight fillers as industrial solid wastes {{is not only}} beneficial to environment protection, but also takes advantages of low density, thermal insulation and anti-freeze/thaw behavior that the fillers possess, which put the materials favorably applicable to various backfilling infrastructure works at cold regions. Unconfined compressive strength tests were conducted on 13 sets of samples with different mix proportions that were subjected to changeable freeze-thaw cycles. The purpose is to analyze the compressive strength and deformation characteristics of the lightweight fillers under freeze-thaw conditions. It is found that materials maintain acceptable mechanical behavior after subject to freeze-thaw cycles. Mixture components play different roles in affecting the strength characteristics of materials. Cement component clearly enhances anti-freeze capability of the materials. Components of EPS and fly ash may improve the freeze-thaw resistance of the materials. Water is the main source causing freeze-thaw failure. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} water content be prudentially controlled as long as adequate water supply for cement hydration is provided. The mechanism of materials' freeze/thaw resistance is also discussed. = 通过对不同配合比的 13 组试样在不同冻融循环次数下的无侧限抗压强度试验,研究了冻融循环对轻质填料抗压强度与变形特性的影响. 结果表明,轻质填料经历冻融循环后仍具有良好的力学性能,各组分对轻质填料抗冻融特性的影响程度不同,掺加水泥可有效抵抗冻胀力,EPS颗粒和粉煤灰在掺量适中的情况下,可显著提高轻质填料的抗冻融性能,水分是造成轻质填料冻融破坏的主要因素,在满足水泥水化所需水分的前提下,寒区工程中应用轻质填料需适当降低含水率. 另外,在分析不同控制强度下轻质填料冻融破坏特点的基础上,分析了该轻质填料抗冻融破坏机理.
