50|$|An unintentional {{perforated}} <b>eardrum</b> (<b>rupture)</b> {{has been}} described in blast injuries during conflict and air travel, usually when the congestion of an upper respiratory infection has prevented equalization of pressure in the middle ear. It happens in sport and recreation, such as swimming, diving with a poor entry into the water, scuba diving, and martial arts. In the published literature, 80% to 95% have recovered completely without intervention in two to four weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Boat {{crew was}} divided into six categories: the pilot (nukhada; النوخدة), his assistant, divers, pullers, {{apprentices}} and servants. While in the sea, the pilot who was usually of tribal origin and owned the boat {{had the authority to}} try and punish wrongdoers and to resolve disputes. Unless they were beyond his knowledge, crimes on boat were dealt with on the basis of [...] "eye for eye and tooth for tooth", otherwise they were dealt with after returning to land. The rest of crew were southern Persians, Baluchis or slaves and only few of them were native Shia. Divers and pullers worked as a team; divers stayed at bottom of sea collecting pearl oysters until they were short of breath, after which they would pull the rope attached to them and the more numbered pullers would pull them back to boat. Good divers lasted longer underwater and could make 100 dives a day. They had more prestige than pullers, but were also exposed to hazards such as <b>eardrum</b> <b>rupture</b> and blindness.|$|E
40|$|In Malaysia, {{there has}} been rapidly {{increasing}} usage in amount of explosives due to widely expansion in quarrying and mining industries. The explosives are usually stored in the storage where the safety precaution had given high attention. As the storage of large quantity of explosive can be hazardous to workers and nearby residents in the events of accidental denotation of explosives, a risk assessment study for storage explosive (magazine) had been carried out. Risk assessment study had been conducted in Kimanis Quarry Sdn. Bhd, located in Sabah. Risk assessment study had been carried out with the identification of hazards and failure scenarios and estimation of the failure frequency of occurrence. Analysis of possible consequences of failure {{and the effects of}} blast waves due to the explosion was evaluated. The risk had been estimated in term of fatalities and <b>eardrum</b> <b>rupture</b> to the workers and public. The average individual voluntary risk for fatality to the workers at the quarry is calculated to be 5. 75 x 10 - 6 per person per year, which is much lower than the acceptable level. <b>Eardrum</b> <b>rupture</b> risk calculated to be 3. 15 x 10 - 6 per person per year for voluntary risk.

40|$|The {{rail-bound}} {{sector has}} become a preferred target of terrorist attacks because of its vulnerability, and the most frequent way to carry out these attacks has been the use of explosive devices. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effectiveness of modelling detonation effects inside train carriages using explicit ﬁnite element techniques. The numerical simulations consider ﬂuid-structure interaction phenomena and several parametric studies are conducted. Carriage damage and injuries to the passengers are examined. Displacements in the model of the carriage structure do not vary greatly for small changes of the charge size, its location, or by open doors. Changing charge size, the location of the detonation, and door setting however had signiﬁcant impact on the risk of <b>eardrum</b> <b>rupture</b> and fatality. Comparison of the simulation and real life data demonstrate a good agreement between the real and calculated displacements of the carriage, whereas the risk of death and <b>eardrum</b> <b>rupture</b> is slightly higher in the calculations. The model presented can reproduce a reliable actual situation if more parameters that inﬂuence injuries of blast waves were considered.

40|$|The European Laboratory for Structural Assessment (ELSA) at JRC Ispra develops, in {{collaboration}} with the French CEA, numerical tools for the simulation of fast transient dynamic phenomena in fluid-structure systems, with emphasis on fluid-structure interaction (FSI) phenomena. In recent years these tools have been applied, within the RailProtect project, to study the vulnerability of critical land mass transport infrastructures (train stations, metro stations, carriages) to blast loading from terrorist attacks. The various approaches available for air blast simulations are briefly reviewed: structure only (applied pressure), fluid only, or full FSI. Models for the simulation of the explosive charge are also shortly discussed. Next, mechanisms of blast injury are introduced and a new model allowing the estimation of various risk, ranging from <b>eardrum</b> <b>rupture</b> to death, is presented. Risk maps can be visualized as a function of maximum overpressure and of impulse in each point of the model, and can help safety authorities in taking decisions. JRC.

40|$|Background. Tympanic {{membrane}} perforation {{may occur}} when ear pressures are excessive, including valsalva maneuver associated with active labor and vaginal delivery. A pressure differential across the eardrum of about 5 [*]psi can cause rupture; the increased intraabdominal pressure spikes repeatedly manifested by “pushing” during second-stage labor easily approach (and may exceed) this level. Material and Method. We describe a healthy 21 -year old nulliparous patient admitted in active labor at 39 -weeks' gestational age. Results. Blood appeared asymptomatically {{in the left}} ear canal at delivery during active, closed-glottis pushing. Otoscopic examination confirmed perforation of the left tympanic membrane. Complete resolution of the <b>eardrum</b> <b>rupture</b> was noted at postpartum check-up six weeks later. Conclusion. While the precise incidence of intrapartum tympanic membrane rupture is not known, it may be unrecognized without gross blood in the ear canal or subjective hearing loss following delivery. Only one prior published report on tympanic membrane perforation during delivery currently appears in the medical literature; {{this is the first}} English language description of the event.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A model has been developed to assess the hazard presented by a condensed phase explosion in a built-up area. The principal application of this model is {{as an aid to}} quantitative risk assessment (QRA) of operations involving the transport of high explosive substances' and articles by road or by rail. The methodology employed is to utilise a consequence model in conjunction with a scenario model. The consequence model is used to establish as a function of distance the intensities of the various explosion phenomena and then to estimate, again as a function of distance, the injuries that are likely to result. This yields probabilities that persons will become casualties of the accident, given that people are exposed to the hazard. This effectively determines the level of individual risk as a function of distance. The scenario model is employed to define the location of the population in terms of its vulnerability (exposure) {{at the time of the}} explosion. This enables the total number of casualties to be estimated and is effectively a measure of societal risk. Elements of the consequence model include submodels for housing damage and. indoor injury; window breakage and injury from flying glass; air blast and injury by lung damage, <b>eardrum</b> <b>rupture</b> and impact as a result of bodily displacement; fireball and bum injury; generation, flight and wounding power of primary fragments; other explosion ejecta; and falling building debris (glass and masonry). The overall model has been implemented as a computer program, 'EXMOD'. The primary fragmentation submodel has been used as the basis of another, 'EXFRAG'. Many of the results presented in this thesis have been obtained with the aid of these computer programs...|$|E

50|$|OSHA, NIOSH, MSHA, and FRA {{were all}} created in {{response}} to an increase in noise induced hearing loss resulting from hazardous sound levels in industrial work environments. Noise can cause detrimental effects to the outer, middle, and inner ear, as well as the auditory nerve and central auditory system. In the outer ear, with high noise exposure the <b>eardrum</b> can <b>rupture</b> and bleed. In the middle ear, dislocation of the bones that reside in the middle ear (the ossicles) can occur. These problems occur when exposed to extremely high sound levels. In the inner ear, low, middle, and high sound levels can all cause damage to structures residing in the cochlea. This damage can cause what is called a 'noise notch' and hearing loss is evident at 3000 - 6000 Hz frequencies.|$|R
50|$|A {{perforated}} eardrum or punctured <b>eardrum</b> is a <b>rupture</b> or perforation (hole) of the eardrum {{which can}} {{occur as a}} result of otitis media (ear infection), trauma (e.g. by trying to clean the ear with sharp instruments), explosion, loud noise or surgery (accidental creation of a rupture).
