40|$|Key-based routing enables massive, {{networked}} {{systems to}} direct messages to a node {{responsible for a}} resource and its key. Our thesis is that key-based routing (KBR) is a reliable primitive for large Internet services. Four issues are addressed. Firstly, most KBR schemes do not support strong routing consistency: routing is consistent when one and only one node delivers messages for a given key to the application layer. Inconsistent routing can cause application-layer performance problems and faults. The faulttolerant active rings (ftar) algorithm of this dissertation is unique {{in that it is}} fault-tolerant and it guarantees strong routing consistency: other algorithms either support probabilistic routing consistency or are not fault-tolerant. Routing tables are updated only after a joining or leaving node and its two immediate neighbors agree to the topology change. We formally specify, refine and prove the algorithm using the B Method. Secondly, algorithms are required to maintain one-hop KBR topologies reliably. One-hop topologies can give lower message latency and loss than topologies with small routing tables. Existing one-hop topologies with full routing tables have expensive repair mechanisms or critical points of failure. To avoid these problems, we contribute anti-entropy multicast (aecast), a reliable multicasting algorithm for one-hop topology maintenance. Aecast is compared with another epidemic multicasting algorithm, pbcast, by analysis and simulation; aecast gives at least fivefold fewer out-of-date nodes on average within one round of a topology update; faster updates improve routing performance. Thirdly, accurate analysis of lazy replica repair algorithms is required. Whereas the above algorithms maintain the topology, replication algorithms maintain data stored on the topology. One algorithm lazily repairs replicas when there is a membership timeout for failed nodes; the analysis ignored replica repair times and therefore overestimates availability. The Markov analysis here is more accurate. Fourthly, hierarchic topologies are reliable in that they protect the local topology from <b>remote</b> <b>failures</b> and network partitions; in existing designs, topology changes burden the top of the hierarchy. We devise a hierarchic architecture that avoids this problem...|$|R

40|$|Several {{pathophysiological}} {{mechanisms are}} involved {{in the development of the}} inflammatory necrotizing process that takes place in the retroperitoneal area during the early phase of acute pancreatitis. They include premature intraglandular activation of pancreatic proenzymes (zymogens) and in particular trypsin, early microcirculatory impairment with subsequent ischaemia/reperfusion and overstimulation of immune effector cells. Although intra-acinar or interstitial activation of trypsinogen is most probably the trigger of acute pancreatitis, in recent years much emphasis has been put on the role of leukocytes. Based on numerous experimental and human data several pro-inflammatory mediators including cytokines, arachidonic acid derivatives, activated oxygen species and proteases are released locally by overactivated neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages among other cells. They are now believed to play a central role in the development of pancreatic necrosis and, once they gain access to the systemic circulation, in the emergence of early multisystem organ failure. However the sequential and relative contribution of each of these 3 pathophysiological mechanisms remain controversial and the precise identification of the mediators incriminated in local and remote tissue injury is still awaited. Severe acute pancreatitis still carries a mortality of 20 % to 30 %. With advances in intensive care management 80 % of the deaths occur somewhat late in the attack due to infected pancreatic necrosis. Nevertheless early <b>remote</b> organ <b>failures</b> still remain a lifethreatening condition for most of these patients. A peritoneal exudate rich in activated lipolytic and proteolytic enzymes, vasoactive substances and several other pro-inflammatory mediators collect in over 60 % of the patients with severe acute pancreatitis. On the basis of favourable animal experiments early percutaneous or surgical peritoneal lavage with or without the addition of antiproteases has been carried out in human acute pancreatitis. The rationale behind this procedure was the washout of potential toxic mediators from the peritoneal cavity before they gain access to the systemic circulation. Contrary to animal and uncontrolled human data no prospective randomized study could ever demonstrated a significant effect of peritoneal lavage neither in the prevention and control of <b>remote</b> organ <b>failures</b> or in early mortality and ultimate survival after severe acute pancreatitis in humans. Differences between experimentally-induced pancreatitis, difference in the timing of the initiation of lavage and a type II error in controlled human studies may account for the discrepancy in the outcome between these studies. Anyway, this disparity should raise the question as whether the peritoneal cavity acts simply as a reservoir or as a route of transfer of toxic mediators to the systemic circulation. Although data are scarce, conflicting and limited to animal experiments and to a few molecules, peripancreatic veins and lymphatics seem to be the major routes of transfer whereas transperitoneal absorption is trivial. Nevertheless early peritoneal aspiration of ascitic fluid in acute pancreatitis and measurement of trypsinogen activation peptides may be used as a means of severity assessment and identification of pancreatic necrosis. This implies that even if not taking part actively in the emergence of <b>remote</b> organ <b>failures</b> ascitic fluid may reflect the peripancreatic necrotizing process. So careful comparative analysis of peritoneal exudate, plasma and lymph with regards to putative mediators of local and remote injury may provide essential pathophysiological clues. At the time of trials of antimediator therapy early in the attack this kind of insight is essential...|$|R

40|$|High voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) grid {{protection}} must clear dc faults within a time-frame of milliseconds to avoid damages to power electronic components due to fast rising dc fault currents. If the breaker {{associated with the}} primary protection fails, backup must be provided to clear the faults which would otherwise persist. Backup relaying algorithms originally developed for ac systems delay the detection of primary protection failure until the expected primary fault clearance instant. Application of similar algorithms to HVDC grids results in a long fault clearing time, which requires converters and breakers to withstand unrealistically large currents. To reduce the fault clearing time, this paper proposes two fast backup relaying algorithms which detect local and <b>remote</b> breaker <b>failure</b> before the expected primary fault clearance instant. The proposed algorithms use thresholds on the voltage and current measurements to detect breaker failure. They are evaluated using a four-terminal HVDC grid test system implemented in PSCAD. The study {{results show that the}} proposed algorithms can reliably detect breaker failure within few milliseconds after fault inception. Furthermore, the algorithms provide faster backup protection compared to methods based on ac backup protection philosophy.

The back up power is needed to control circuit breakers and for communication equipment. If the outage time is extensive the back up power might run out and the ability to control the circuit breakers is lost and this will extend the restoration time even further.

40|$|Acute necrotizing {{pancreatitis}} {{induced by}} infusion of bile salt into the pancreatic duct in rats is consistently associated with acute lung injury {{similar to the}} adult respiratory distress syndrome. The role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in this pancreatitis-associated <b>remote</b> organ <b>failure</b> (lung injury) was investigated. Pulmonary tissue levels of PAF were increased gradually and reached a level of 1345 +/- 455 pg/g (6 times the control level) at 12 hours after induction of pancreatitis, whereas pancreatic PAF levels were undetectable and blood PAF remained unchanged. This local pulmonary PAF accumulation occurred at approximately {{the same time as}} the progression of lung injury. Pulmonary responses detected (i. e., eicosanoid production, leukocytic infiltration, Evan's blue extravasation, beta-glucuronidase release) were attenuated to varying degrees by treatment of rats in which pancreatitis was initiated with the PAF receptor antagonists (WEB 2170 and BN 52021). Rat lung lavages were examined after a 12 -hour course of pancreatitis and no changes in PAF concentration, surfactant content, and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activity were noted. Intravenous administration of PLA 2 promoted pulmonary PAF production in experimental rats with pancreatitis but not in normal rats. This observation indicates that PLA 2, which was determined to be elevated in plasma during pancreatitis, may be responsible for the accumulation of PAF in the lung.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the combined insults of hemorrhagic shock and aortic clamping simulating ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair had a synergistic effect on the production of pulmonary injury, indicating remote organ injury. Methods: Animals were randomized to one of three groups, infrarenal clamp plus 1 hour of shock, infrarenal clamp plus 2 hours of shock, and supramesenteric clamp plus 1 hour of shock. Each of these groups had four subgroups; sham, shock (mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg), clamp, or combined [shock plus clamp]). All animals had a laparotomy with aortic clamping in only the clamp and combined groups. Five hours after clamp removal lung permeability index and neutrophil sequestration were quantified. Results: Lung permeability index (6. 60 ± 0. 63, p < 0. 05 vs all other groups) and neutrophil sequestration (3. 72 ± 0. 45 vs sham and clamp, p < 0. 05) were significantly increased when shock and supramesenteric clamp were combined. After 1 or 2 hours of shock and infrarenal clamping, no increase in lung permeability index was noted, although neutrophil sequestration was increased in the 2 -hour shock group. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the additive effect of shock and supramesenteric clamping, which initiated a cascade of injurious events that resulted in a rapid pulmonary injury. The high mortality rate related to <b>remote</b> organ <b>failure</b> in ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm may be related to the synergy of these two injurious processes.

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} can nowadays deliver 99. 9 % {{of their}} data with duty cycles below 1 %. This remarkable performance is, however, dependent on some important underlying assumptions: low traffic rates, medium size densities and static nodes. In this thesis, we investigate {{the performance of}} these same resource-constrained devices, but under scenarios that present extreme conditions: high traffic rates, high densities and mobility: the so-called ExtremeWireless Sensor Networks (EWSNs). From a networking perspective, communicating in these extreme scenarios is very challenging. The combined effect of high network densities and dynamics makes the network’s characteristics fluctuate drastically both in space and time. Traditional mechanisms struggle to cope with these sudden changes, resulting in a continuous exchange of information that saturates the bandwidth and increases the energy consumption. Once this saturation threshold is reached, mechanisms take decisions based on wrong, outdated information and soon stop working. Even flexible mechanisms have difficulties adapting their settings to the fickly conditions of EWSNs and result in poor performance. To efficiently communicate in EWSNs, mechanisms must therefore comply {{to a set of}} requirements i. e., design principles, which are explained next. First, they need to be resilient to local and <b>remote</b> <b>failures</b> and operate as independent as possible from the status of other nodes (state-less principle). Second, because in EWSNs bandwidth is a scarce resource, it should be mainly used for the transmission of the actual data. Mechanisms should not be artificially orchestrated and should exploit each other in a cross-layer fashion to reduce as much as possible their communication overhead (opportunistic principle). Third, mechanisms should support extreme network conditions from their inception. Adapting traditional mechanisms, which are designed for milder conditions, would otherwise result in complex and fragile mechanisms (anti-fragile principle). Fourth, in the case the resources saturate, mechanisms should operate in a conservative fashion, so that performance degrades gracefully without drastic disruptions (robustness principle). Inspired by these four principles, this thesis detaches from traditional communication primitives – which are deterministic and based on rigid structures – and proposes a novel communication stack based on opportunistic anycast. According to this primitive, nodes communicate with the first available neighbor, independently of its location and identity. The more neighbors, themore efficient the communication. At the foundation of this communication stack lays SOFA, a medium access control (MAC) protocol that exploits opportunistic anycast to handle extreme densities in an efficient manner. Its implementation details are presented in Chapter 2. On top of the SOFA layer, this thesis builds two essential network services: neighborhood cardinality (density) estimation and data collection. The former service is provided by Estreme, a mechanism presented in Chapter 3, which exploits the rendezvous time of SOFA to estimate the number of neighbors with almost zero overhead. The latter service is provided by Staffetta in Chapter 4, a mechanism that adapts the wake-up frequency of nodes to bias the opportunistic neighbor-selection of SOFA towards the desired direction e. g., towards the sink node collecting all data. Finally, this thesis presents an extensive evaluation of a complete opportunistic stack on simulations, testbeds and a challenging real-world deployment in the formof the NEMO science museumin Amsterdam. Results showthat opportunistic behavior can lead to mechanisms that are both lightweight and robust and, thus, are able to scale to EWSNs. Embedded Softwar...|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} avionics interface exploits the constrained {{nature of}} data networks in flight systems {{to use a}} lightweight routing method. This simplified routing means that a processor is not required, and the logic can be implemented as an intellectual property (IP) core in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA can be shared with the flight subsystem application. In addition, the router is aware of redundant subsystems, and can be configured to provide hot standby support {{as part of the}} interface. This simplifies implementation of flight applications requiring hot stand - by support. When a valid inbound packet is received from the network, the destination node address is inspected to determine whether the packet is to be processed by this node. Each node has routing tables for the next neighbor node to guide the packet to the destination node. If it is to be processed, the final packet destination is inspected to determine whether the packet is to be forwarded to another node, or routed locally. If the packet is local, it is sent to an Applications Data Interface (ADI), which is attached to a local flight application. Under this scheme, an interface can support many applications in a subsystem supporting a high level of subsystem integration. If the packet is to be forwarded to another node, it is sent to the outbound packet router. The outbound packet router receives packets from an ADI or a packet to be forwarded. It then uses a lookup table to determine the next destination for the packet. Upon detecting a <b>remote</b> subsystem <b>failure,</b> the routing table can be updated to autonomously bypass the failed subsystem...|$|R

Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter–defibrillators (ICDs) store diagnostic informa-tion about device and lead integrity, the occurrence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and parameters that may reflect on a patient’s heart failure status.

The study is powered to detect a clinically-meaningful reduction in all cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalisation as the primary endpoint, with secondary endpoints that include cost effectiveness. The results of this study could potentially change NHS practice for many tens of thousands of patients with heart failure, facilitating an integration of modern technology with evidence-based treatment to optimise health gain and value for money in the health service...|$|R
40|$|The iPhone SDK {{provides}} a powerful {{platform for the}} development of applications that make use of iPhone capabilities such as sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity. Thus far we observe that the development of iPhone applications is mostly restricted to using Objective-C. However, developing applications in plain Objective-C on the iPhone OS suffers from limitations such as the need for explicit memory management and lack of syntactic extension mechanism. Moreover, when developing distributed applications in Objective-C, programmers have to manually deal with distribution concerns such as service discovery, <b>remote</b> communication, and <b>failure</b> handling. In this paper, we discuss our experience on porting the Scheme programming language to the iPhone OS and how it can be used together with Objective-C to develop iPhone applications. To support the interaction between Scheme programs and the underlying iPhone APIs, we have implemented a language symbiosis layer that enables programmers to access the iPhone SDK libraries from Scheme. In addition, we have designed high-level distribution constructs to ease the development of distributed iPhone applications in an event-driven style. We validate and discuss these constructs with a series of examples including a...|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{there were}} three watermill-driven lace {{producers}} in the region. In 1896, the founders of these companies pooled their resources and bought factory equipment {{for the production of}} woollen cloth from the German Empire. This was the first factory {{on the outskirts of the}} town. In 1903, a factory for hemp processing was built on the riverbank north of the old town centre. Amidst the First Serbian Uprising of the Serbian revolution (1804-1815), a forbidden Serbian Orthodox church was built in the town, through tricking the Turkish lords that the building would instead serve as a residence for the town-priest, and added a chimney, hence its name Odžaklija (Chimney). In 1922, the Teokarević family opened a wool cloth factory in the small town of Vučje near Leskovac. By 1938, the private textile factories of Leskovac town employed 2,560 workers. In the 1870s, there were thousands of hemp-processors in Leskovac, producing up to 150,000 cartloads per year.The city was once known as [...] "Little Manchester", because of its 19th-century textile industry which was second only to that of Manchester, England. The city continued to be a major textile center until the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, but due to the economic isolation of Serbia resulting from ethnic wars, its <b>remote</b> location, and <b>failure</b> to privatize the mills, the industry collapsed resulting in depression of the economy in the area.|$|R
40|$|A {{robotic arm}} for a lunar surface vehicle {{that can help}} in {{handling}} cargo and equipment, and remove obstacles from {{the path of the}} vehicle is defined as a support to NASA's intention to establish a lunar based colony by the year 2010. Its mission would include, but not limited to the following: exploration, lunar sampling, replace and remove equipment, and setup equipment (e. g. microwave repeater stations). Performance objectives for the robotic arm include a reach of 3 m, accuracy of 1 cm, arm mass of 100 kg, and lifting capability of 50 kg. The end effectors must grip various sizes and shapes of cargo; push, pull, turn, lift, or lower various types of equipment; and clear a path on the lunar surface by shoveling, sweeping aside, or gripping the obstacle present in the desired path. The arm can safely complete a task within a reasonable amount of time; the actual time is dependent upon the task to be performed. The positioning of the arm includes a manual backup system such that the arm can be safely stored in case of <b>failure.</b> <b>Remote</b> viewing and proximity and positioning sensors are incorporated {{in the design of the}} arm. The following specific topic are addressed in this report: mission and requirements, system design and integration, mechanical structure, modified wrist, structure-to-end-effector interface, end-effectors, and system controls...|$|R
