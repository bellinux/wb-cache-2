25|$|Modern {{microwave}} ovens use either an analog dial-type timer or a digital control panel for operation. Control panels feature an LED, liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display, in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions, numeric buttons for entering the cook time, a power level selection feature and other possible {{functions such as}} a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types, such as meat, fish, poultry, vegetables, <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables,</b> frozen dinners, and popcorn. In most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. As such, the choice of power level {{does not affect the}} intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale duty cycle. Newer models have inverter power supplies that use pulse-width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.|$|E
25|$|Although {{only about}} one-quarter of Taiwan's land area is {{suitable}} for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by {{the small size of}} farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses. Taiwan's agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern farm management, provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems. Promotion of farm mechanization has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar cane production are completely mechanized. Taiwan's main crops are rice, sugar cane, fruits (many of them tropical), and vegetables. Although self-sufficient in rice production, Taiwan imports large amounts of wheat, mostly from the United States. Meat production and consumption has risen sharply, reflecting a high standard of living. Taiwan has exported large amounts of frozen pork, although this was affected by an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 1997. Other agricultural exports include fish, aquaculture and sea products, canned and <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and grain products. Imports of agriculture products are expected to increase due to the WTO accession, which is opening previously protected agricultural markets.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent to {{the passage}} of the typhoon in Taiwan, large {{quantities}} of mud and impurities entered and polluted the Shihmen Reservoir in Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City), the county's primary source of water. Severe cloudiness occurred in the water, and at one time the reservoir recorded 25,000 nephelometric turbidity units. Such facilities are unable to operate with mud in the water, and in response, the Taiwan Water Corporation established temporary water stations to alleviate the situation, and the Pingting Water Treatment Plant worked to treat the problem. Furthermore, officials drilled wells to accommodate the shortage. Water supply in the southern portion of Taoyuan County was restored by fivedays after the storm, with supply restored to the northern portion of the county by ten days after the passage of the typhoon. The same problem had occurred previously after Typhoon Mindulle in July 2004. As a result of the crop damage, the Taiwan Council of Agriculture opened its reserve of <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> to prevent overharvesting of the existing crops. Despite the measures, crop prices reached record levels, which led to groups calling out for the government to stabilize the price of foods. In reaction, a member of the Council of Agriculture remarked that [...] "vegetable prices [...] expected to go back to normal gradually ... as supplies increase." [...] The passage of the typhoon left hundreds of residents in Hsinchu County isolated from the outside world for four days. As a result, officials deployed helicopters with rescue supplies and returned with the injured. Aid from one internal organization totaled $NT300,000 (2005 TWD, $9,500 2005USD). Shortly after the effects of the typhoon ended on the island, work began to repair and rebuild the impacted bridges and roads. Electricians quickly began restoring power across northern Taiwan; by the day after the typhoon's passage, the number of houses without power decreased by 90%.|$|E

50|$|Over the years, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} as to whether <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> are better or worse than fresh ones. Generally, reports show that <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> are as nutritionally beneficial when compared to fresh ones.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there may}} be some risk in eating poorly cooked <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables.</b> For example, a 2007 Australian study found that <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetables</b> may contain a {{bacterium}} called Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) which is resistant to extreme cold and hot temperatures.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{consists}} {{of the study and}} optimising of the cold cycle in a <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetable</b> plant in La Rioja (Spain).

The paper describes the procedure for determining the operating parameters of the cold cycle, the data obtained and a series of improvement proposals, applied to an actual case study in a <b>frozen</b> <b>vegetable</b> plant in La Rioja (Spain). The study reveals the fragility of the production system insofar as it depends on atmospheric conditions to condense the ammonia in the cold cycle. The analysis of the existing production processes and the products and sub-products generated revealed a heat sink that could be used, based on treated waste water. The study also provides an analysis procedure specific to this type of industry...|$|R
