40|$|The {{novelty of}} this study was to produce humic acids by {{submerged}} fermentation of empty fruit bunch (EFB) with Trichoderma viride and to investigate the effects of the cellulosic substrates and the organic sources of nitrogen on the biotechnological production of these acids. The results obtained indicate the potential application of EFB, a waste of oil palm processing, for humic acids production. Because EFB contains cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, fermentations were also performed using these polymers as carbon sources, separately or in combination. After 120 h of fermentation, significant production of humic acids was observed only in cultures containing either EFB or a mixture of the three polymers. Use of either potato peptone or yeast extract as a nitrogen source yielded nearly identical patterns of fungal growth and production of humic acids.

Contrast in the FIESTA sequence <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 2 /T 1 ratio and FIESTA can be acquired in a 3 D format, allowing T 2 information to be spatially matched to T 1 -weighted contrast enhanced MR images (CE-MRI). We performed a preliminary investigation using the combined information from FIESTA and CE-MRI to characterize breast tumors (invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas, DCIS) in a group of 10 patients. Introduction: CE-MR imaging is highly sensitive for the detection of neoplasms in the breast. CE-MR imaging methods have been developed to characterize tumors according to their contrast enhancement dynamics following injection of a contrast agent [1, 2]. T 2 weighted sequences are valuable for the demonstration of vessels, cysts and cystic lesions [3] in the breast. Additionally, T 2 -weighted images of the breast show significant heterogeneity in both tumors and surrounding breast tissue. However T 2 has not been found to provide specificity in cancer diagnosis, although this has not been rigorously explored. While other techniques such as the FSE sequence can provide T 2 information, they are acquired with a 2 D format...|$|E
40|$|Possible {{effects of}} the color {{screened}} confinement potential are investigated. Color screened linear potential with a large string tension T = (0. 26 − 0. 32) GeV 2 is suggested by {{a study of the}} c¯c and b¯b spectra. The ψ(4160) and ψ(4415) are respectively assigned as the ψ(4 S) -dominated and the ψ(5 S) c¯c states. Satisfactory results for the masses and leptonic widths (with QCD radiative corrections) of c¯c and b ¯ b states are obtained. 1 The string tension is a most fundamental physical quantity in quark confinement. It is argued based on a rotating string picture that the string tension T is related to the Regge slope α ′ by [1] T = 1 2 πα ′ = 0. 18 GeV 2, (1) with the experimental value for α ′ = 0. 9 (GeV) − 2. This result is supported phenomenologically by the heavy quarkonium spectrum when identifying the string tension with the slope of the linear confinement potential between a heavy quarkantiquark (QQ) pair [2]. Lattice QCD calculations for the string tension is not conclusive, because one needs to estimate the lattice scale ΛL in physical units, even if one has obtained from lattice calculations the value for c which <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> via c = ΛL √T.

Results: A total of 112 (80. 5 %) patients were HTLV- 1, 26 (18. 7 %) were HTLV- 2 +. About 35. 2 % of patients had myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), with 48 of them being HTLV- 1 + and one patient was seropositive for HTLV- 1 and - 2. The most common oral manifestations were: xerostomia (26. 8 %), candidiasis (20. 8 %), fissured tongue (17. 9 %), and loss of tongue papillae (10. 0 %).

However, continuous measurement of transpiration is still difficult, {{and the effect of}} vegetation on ET partitioning is unclear. The concept of underlying water use efficiency (uWUE) was used to develop a new method for ET partitioning by assuming that the maximum, or the potential uWUE <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> while the averaged or apparent uWUE is related to ET. T/ET was thus estimated as the ratio of the apparent over the potential uWUE using half-hourly flux data from 17 AmeriFlux sites. The estimated potential uWUE was shown to be essentially constant for 14 of the 17 sites, and was broadly consistent with the uWUE evaluated at the leaf scale. The annual T/ET was the highest for croplands, i. e., 0. 69 for corn and 0. 62 for soybean, followed by grasslands (0. 60) and evergreen needle leaf forests (0. 56), and was the lowest for deciduous broadleaf forests (0. 52). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was shown to be significantly correlated with T/ET and could explain about 75 % of the variation in T/ET among the 71 site-years. The coefficients of determination between EVI and T/ET were 0. 84 and 0. 82 for corn and soybean, respectively, and 0. 77 for deciduous broadleaf forests and grasslands, but only 0. 37 for evergreen needle leaf forests.

Sle 3 tri-congenic mice), and how they integrate in our present understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. In particular, we focus on (autoreactive) T cell activation patterns in lupus-prone mice. Break of T cell tolerance to chromatin constituents (histone peptides) {{is key to the}} development of the disease and <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> cell intrinsic defects, contributed by genetic susceptibility factors and by extrinsic amplificatory mechanisms, in particular over-stimulation by antigen-presenting cells.

B cell activation mechanisms in SLE are both T cell-dependent (break of tolerance and production of specific autoantibodies) and -independent (polyclonal B cell activation, production of autoantibodies by long-lived plasma cells). By providing a comprehensive evaluation of B and T cell surface markers in two major mouse models of SLE and a description of their changes before and after disease onset, this review illustrates how the study of lymphoid cell phenotype delivers key information regarding pathogenic pathways and supplies tools to assess the beneficial effects of novel therapeutic interventions...|$|E
40|$|Abstractl-Ornithine cyclodeaminase (OCD) is {{involved}} in l-proline biosynthesis and catalyzes the unique deaminating cyclization of l-ornithine to l-proline via a Δ 1 -pyrroline- 2 -carboxyrate (Pyr 2 C) intermediate. Although this pathway functions {{in only a few}} bacteria, many archaea possess OCD-like genes (proteins), among which only AF 1665 protein (gene) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus has been characterized as an NAD+-dependent l-alanine dehydrogenase (AfAlaDH). However, the physiological role of OCD-like proteins from archaea has been unclear. Recently, we revealed that Pyr 2 C reductase, involved in trans- 3 -hydroxy-l-proline (T 3 LHyp) metabolism of bacteria, belongs to the OCD protein superfamily and catalyzes only the reduction of Pyr 2 C to l-proline (no OCD activity) [FEBS Open Bio (2014) 4, 240 – 250]. In this study, based on bioinformatics analysis, we assumed that the OCD-like gene from Thermococcus litoralis DSM 5473 <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3 LHyp and/or proline metabolism (TlLhpI). Interestingly, TlLhpI showed three different enzymatic activities: AlaDH; N-methyl-l-alanine dehydrogenase; Pyr 2 C reductase. Kinetic analysis suggested strongly that Pyr 2 C is the preferred substrate. In spite of their similar activity, TlLhpI had a poor phylogenetic relationship to the bacterial and mammalian reductases for Pyr 2 C and formed a close but distinct subfamily to AfAlaDH, indicating convergent evolution. Introduction of several specific amino acid residues for OCD and/or AfAlaDH by site-directed mutagenesis had marked effects on both AlaDH and Pyr 2 C reductase activities. The OCC_ 00387 gene, clustered with the TlLhpI gene on the genome, encoded T 3 LHyp dehydratase, homologous to the bacterial and mammalian enzymes.

Overall, from 2009 to 2011, we collected sera from 525 seagull chicks (Yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) and Audouin ' s gull (L. audouinii)) from 6 breeding colonies in Spain and tested them using the modified agglutination test (MAT) {{for the presence of}} antibodies against T. gondii. Chick age was estimated from bill length. Main food source of seagull chicks was evaluated using stable isotope analyses from growing scapular feathers. Overall T. gondii seroprevalence was 21. 0 % (IC 95 % 17. 5 - 24. 4). A generalized linear mixed-effects model indicated that year (2009) and food source (freshwater) were risk factors associated to the individual risk of infection by T. gondii, while age (days) was close to significance. Freshwa- ter food origin was related to the highest seroprevalence levels, followed by marine origin, supporting freshwater and sewages as important routes of dispersion of T. gondii. Year dif- ferences could indicate fluctuating rates of exposure of seagull chicks to T. gondii.

40|$|Abstract Introduction We have {{demonstrated}} previously that the intravenous delivery of multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) after {{traumatic brain injury}} affords neuroprotection via interaction with splenocytes, leading {{to an increase in}} systemic anti-inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that the observed modulation of the systemic inflammatory milieu <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> regulatory cells and a subsequent increase in the locoregional neuroprotective M 2 macrophage population. Methods C 57 B 6 mice were injected with intravenous MAPC 2 and 24 hours after controlled cortical impact injury. Animals were euthanized 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours after injury. In vivo, the proportion of CD 4 + /CD 25 + /FOXP 3 + T-regulatory cells were measured in the splenocyte population and plasma. In addition, the brain CD 86 + M 1 and CD 206 + M 2 macrophage populations were quantified. A series of in vitro co-cultures were completed to investigate the need for direct MAPC:splenocyte contact as well as the effect of MAPC therapy on M 1 and M 2 macrophage subtype apoptosis and proliferation. Results Significant increases in the splenocyte and plasma T regulatory cell populations were observed with MAPC therapy at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. In addition, MAPC therapy was associated with an increase in the brain M 2 /M 1 macrophage ratio at 24, 48 and 120 hours after cortical injury. In vitro cultures of activated microglia with supernatant derived from MAPC:splenocyte co-cultures also demonstrated an increase in the M 2 /M 1 ratio. The observed changes were secondary to an increase in M 1 macrophage apoptosis. Conclusions The data show that the intravenous delivery of MAPC after cortical injury results in increases in T regulatory cells in splenocytes and plasma with a concordant increase in the locoregional M 2 /M 1 macrophage ratio. Direct contact between the MAPC and splenocytes is required to modulate activated microglia, adding further evidence to the central role of the spleen in MAPC-mediated neuroprotection. </p...|$|E

P 22 lysozyme <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 4 lysozymein its mode of action, substrate specificities, and in its structure. Gene 19 was located on the phage genome, subcloned, and then sequenced. lysozyme was produced in large quantities and purified for biochemical characterization and for crystallograpic studies. Gene 19 consists of 146 codons, and encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 16, 117. Amber mutations were created in gene 19 by in vitro primer-directed mutagenesis. The mutations were crossed by homologous recombination onto the phage genome. The phages bearing the amber mutations in gene 19 were screened for the ability to grow on six different amber suppressor strains. Amino acid substitutions that resulted in nonfunctional or less functional lysozyme were determined. Of 60 possible amino acid substitutions at 11 different sites in P 22 lysozyme, 20 are deleterious. The phage bearing amber mutations in gene 19 that failed to grow on given suppressor strains were reverted and second site intragenic revertants were obtained. The mutations were sequenced. A substitution of serine for glutamine at residue 82 is compensated for by changing residue 46 from serine to leucine. This single change enables the phage to form a plaque at 300 C but not at 400 C. When the triple change asn 42 - 3 ̆elys; ser 46 - 3 ̆eleu; and ser 43 - 3 ̆epro is present the lysozyme produced is no longer temperature sensitive. The crystal structure of P 22 lysozyme is not yet solved.

The spatial arrangement of the residues changed by the secondary site mutations and the original substitution can then be visualized.

40|$|The mid- {{to lower}} {{reaches of the}} Yangtze River valley are located within the typical East Asian monsoon zone. Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and {{development}} of agriculture have led to fast and complicated land use and land cover change in this region. To investigate land–atmosphere interaction in this region where human activities and monsoon climate have considerable interaction with each other, micrometeorological elements over four sites with different surface types around Nanjing, including urban surface at Dangxiao (hereafter DX-urban), suburban surface at Xianling (XL-suburb), and grassland and farmland at Lishui County (LS-grass and LS-crop), are analyzed and their differences are revealed. The impacts of surface parameters of different surface types on the radiation budget and land surface–atmosphere heat, water, and mass exchanges are investigated and compared. The results indicate the following. (1)  The largest differences in daily average surface air temperature (T a), surface skin temperature (T s), and relative humidity (RH), which are found during the dry periods between DX-urban and LS-crop, can be up to 3. 21  °C, 7. 26  °C, and 22. 79  %, respectively. The diurnal ranges of the above three elements are the smallest at DX-urban and the largest at LS-grass, XL-suburb, and LS-crop. (2)  Differences in radiative fluxes are mainly reflected in upward shortwave radiation (USR) that is related to surface albedo and upward longwave radiation (ULR) that <b>is</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> s. When comparing four sites, {{it can be found}} that both the smallest USR and the largest ULR occur at the DX-urban site. The diurnal variation in ULR is same as that of T s at all four sites. (3)  The differences in daily average sensible heat (H) and latent heat (LE) between DX-urban and LS-crop are larger than 45 and 95  Wm − 2, respectively. The proportion of latent heat flux in the net radiation (LE/ R n) keeps increasing with the change in season from the spring to summer. (4)  Human activities have obvious effects on microclimate. The urban heat island (UHI) effect results in a T a 2  °C higher at the urban site than other sites in the nighttime. At the crop site, LE is dominant due to irrigation, and negative H is observed since evaporation cooling leads to low T s. Although T s is higher at XL-suburb than that at LS-grass, there is no large difference in T a between the two sites due to the distinct effects of the planted forest...|$|E

30|$|In parallel, {{most of the}} top 10 gene {{families}} suppressed after septic shock <b>were</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>T</b> cell signaling and antigen-mediated response (Figure  2 B). For example, expressions of gene part of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex such as CD 247, CD 3 E, CD 3 G, and CD 3 D were markedly decreased, as well as antigen-presentation genes like HLA-DMA, HLA-DOA, HLA-DRA, HLA-DQA 1, CIITA, HLA-DRB 1, HLA-DOB, HLA-DMB, CD 74, HLA-DPB 1, TAP 2, and HLA-DPA 1. Importantly, the transcriptional modulation observed was very consistent over the time period {{as illustrated by the}} fold change of these selected genes (Additional file 1 : Table S 1).|$|R
