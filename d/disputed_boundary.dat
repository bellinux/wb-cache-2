5|$|Mercator {{was welcomed}} by Duke Wilhelm who {{appointed}} him as court Cosmographer. There is no precise definition of this term {{other than that}} it certainly comprehends the disciplines of geography and astronomy {{but at that time}} it would also include astrology and chronology (as a history of the world from the creation). All of these were among Mercator's accomplishments but his patron's first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of the <b>disputed</b> <b>boundary</b> between the Duke's territory of the County of Mark and the Duchy of Westphalia.|$|E

Laws were also passed requiring at least three months of school attendance by children and local option legislation allowed Kent and Sussex Counties prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages. And T.

2500|$|The other legend {{concerns}} the <b>disputed</b> <b>boundary</b> of four parishes in East Devon which she, as Countess, was {{called upon to}} settle. She {{is said to have}} done this by arranging to meet the disputants on top of a marshy hill near the site whereupon she took off a ring from her finger and threw it {{into the middle of the}} bog declaring [...] "that shall be the boundary". The place where these four parishes meet is called [...] "Ring in the Mire".|$|E
2500|$|The {{area was}} part of a [...] tract of land in Massachusetts called [...] "Dunstable", which had been awarded to Edward Tyng of Dunstable, England. Nashua lies {{approximately}} {{in the center of the}} original 1673 grant. [...] In 1732, Dunstable was split along the Merrimack River, with the town of Nottingham (now the town of Hudson, New Hampshire) created out of the eastern portion. [...] The previously <b>disputed</b> <b>boundary</b> between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed in 1741 when the governorships of the two provinces were separated. As a consequence, the township of Dunstable was divided in two. Tyngsborough and some of Dunstable remained in Massachusetts, while Dunstable, New Hampshire, was incorporated in 1746 from the northern section of the town.|$|E
2500|$|Cranston {{had very}} little {{political}} experience {{when he was first}} elected as governor of the colony upon the resignation of Walter Clarke in March 1698. [...] The issues that he dealt with during his first three years in office were so critical, that the continued existence of the Rhode Island colony was at stake. [...] One of the major issues of his early tenure was that of piracy, as many privateers who were active in the recent war with France turned to piracy. [...] The crown wanted piracy stopped, while many colonists were sympathetic to the pirates, and Cranston had to make difficult political decisions to satisfy the home country on this issue. [...] Another ongoing issue was the <b>disputed</b> <b>boundary</b> between the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies. [...] The Narragansett country was given to both colonies by their respective charters, creating many decades of friction. [...] During Cranston's tenure as governor, the dispute was finally ended, entirely in Rhode Island's favor.|$|E
40|$|The zeal {{with which}} the several states guard their {{respective}} claims of sovereignty arises from a unique blend of governance imperatives and pride. When the sovereignty of one state is exercised {{in a manner that}} reaches into affairs that a sister state claims to be within her sole authority, there is usually a prompt joining of the issue by the state that feels its sovereignty is being impinged. Many of these cases involve <b>disputed</b> state <b>boundaries,</b> and these tend to be more frequent when the <b>disputed</b> <b>boundaries</b> are demarked by rivers.

40|$|Modern {{economic}} analysis {{of property rights}} suggests that insecurity of property rights inhibits earnings and investment. By implication, it could be expected that <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> between states, by questioning the property rights regime, would be a key disincentive to investment. From this perspective, the oil industry in Africa presents a puzzle. Oil companies have continued, or even expanded, their investments in areas subject to <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> between states. This paper attempts to explain why <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> may not necessarily present a major obstacle to investment by utilising {{the example of the}} oil industry in Africa. It suggests that the willingness of firms to invest in areas with <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> can partly be explained on the basis of shifting public international law. The paper postulates that developments in international law and legal institutional arrangements have {{played a key role in}} resolving <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> in Africa and elsewhere and have enhanced the confidence of potential investors. We start with a brief examination of <b>boundary</b> <b>disputes</b> in Africa and their relationship with oil company investment. This is followed by an analysis of three aspects o...|$|R

60|$|The great Q.C., a big, {{overbearing}} man, {{with a pair}} of huge burly {{hands that}} somehow seemed to form his chief feature, was a little bit blustering in his talk, as usual; the more so because he had just learned incidentally that something had gone wrong between his daughter Gwendoline and Granville Kelmscott. For though that little episode of private wooing had run its course nominally without the knowledge or consent of either family, Mr. Gilbert Gildersleeve, at least, had none the less been aware for many weeks past of the frequent meetings between Gwendoline and Granville in the dell just beyond the <b>disputed</b> <b>boundary</b> line. And as Mr. Gildersleeve disliked Colonel Kelmscott of Tilgate Park, for a pig-headed esquire, almost as cordially as Colonel Kelmscott disliked Mr. Gildersleeve in return for a rascally lawyer, it had given the great Q.C. no little secret satisfaction in his own soul to learn that his daughter Gwendoline was likely to marry the Colonel's son and heir, directly against the wishes and consent of his father.|$|E

"You are surprised," [...] {{said his}} companion, [...] "that I should long thus for {{escape from the}} warring passions of men, but if you knew what reason I have for hating war, you would not wonder. Listen! Many years ago I went {{with my wife and}} child to visit a kinsman in the Scottish Highlands. I need {{scarcely}} tell you that it was not my present wife and child. She was young, fair, faultless in person and disposition. Our little daughter resembled her in all respects. There chanced to be a miserable feud existing between my relative and a neighbouring chief. It originated in some <b>disputed</b> <b>boundary,</b> and always smouldered, like a subdued volcano, but occasionally broke forth in open warfare. At the time of my visit my kinsman, who was a bachelor, had gone to transact some business at a town not far distant, leaving a message for me to follow him as he required my assistance in some family arrangements, and meant to return home the same night. I went, leaving my wife and child in the castle. That very night my kinsman's foe--knowing nothing of my arrival--came to the castle, took the small body of defenders by surprise, overcame them, and set the place on fire. Fiendish and revengeful though the marauders were, I believe they would not wantonly have murdered the helpless ones, had they known of their being in the place, but they knew it not until too late.|$|E
