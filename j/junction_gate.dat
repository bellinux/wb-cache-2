As opposed to BJTs, they are called unipolar because they involve single carrier type operationeither N-channel or P-channel.

5000|$|Basic OperationAs {{shown in}} Fig.2, the FJG device {{generally}} consists of one floating gate NMOS and one MOS gated diode. The floating gate NMOS has different threshold voltages at different logic states. By charging or discharging the floating gate via the current {{path through the}} gated diode, the threshold voltage of the floating gate NMOS is changed. Since the floating gate is connected to a p-n junction, this cell is called a [...] "floating <b>junction</b> <b>gate</b> (FJG)" [...] cell. When reading the cell, with the same voltage conditions on the control gate, the NMOS has different sense current at different logic states. The sense current can then be amplified by a sense amplifier. Thus, {{the state of the}} cell can be determined.|$|E

5000|$|Other cooling {{methods are}} forced {{convection}} and phase transition cooling {{which is used}} in refrigerators and can be adapted for computer use. Liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, and dry ice are used as coolants in extreme cases, such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system. In June 2006, IBM and Georgia Institute of Technology jointly announced a new record in silicon-based chip clock rate (the rate a transistor can be switched at, not the CPU clock rate) above 500 GHz, which was done by cooling the chip to 4.5 K using liquid helium. CPU Frequency World Record is 8.429 GHz as of September 2011. These extreme methods are generally impractical in the long term, as they require refilling reservoirs of vaporizing coolant, and condensation can be formed on chilled components. Moreover, silicon-based <b>junction</b> <b>gate</b> field-effect transistors (JFET) will degrade below temperatures of roughly 100 K and eventually cease to function or [...] "freeze out" [...] at 40 K since the silicon ceases to be semiconducting so using extremely cold coolants may cause devices to fail.|$|E

For this study, ageing has been obtained using repetitive short-circuit operations. Among monitored parameters during ageing, on-state resistance and short-circuit current level are those, which have the strongest evolution. The top-metal degradation has been characterized via the on-state resistance measurement during ageing. In particular, we clearly show that the top-metal restructuration due to ageing leads to an additional voltage drop between gate and source terminals and results to a lower gate-source junction voltage...|$|E
40|$|GaAs Junction Field Effect Transistors (JFETs) have {{attracted}} renewed attention for low-power, low-voltage electronics. JFETs {{have a significant}} advantage over MESFETs for low-power operation due to their higher gate barrier to current flow resulting from p/n <b>junction</b> <b>gate.</b> This paper reports recent advances in an all ion implanted self-aligned GaAs JFET with a gate length down to 0. 3 {mu}m. By employing shallopw SiF implants next to the gate, dielectric sidewall spacers, and 50 keV source and drain implants, JFETs with a f{sub t} up to 49 GHz with good pinchoff and subthreshold characteristics have been realized.

40|$|Electrostatically Formed Nanowire (EFN) based {{transistors}} {{have been}} suggested {{in the past as}} gas sensing devices. These transistors are multiple gate transistors in which the source to drain conduction path is determined by the bias applied to the back <b>gate,</b> and two <b>junction</b> <b>gates.</b> If a specific bias is applied to the side gates, the conduction band electrons between them are confined to a well-defined area forming a narrow channel- the Electrostatically Formed Nanowire. Recent work has shown that by applying non-symmetric bias on the side gates, the lateral position of the EFN can be controlled. We propose a novel Multiple State EFN Transistor (MSET) that utilizes this degree of freedom for the implementation of complete multiplexer functionality in a single transistor like device. The multiplexer functionality allows a very simple implementation of binary and multiple valued logic functions...|$|R

40|$|GaAs-based Metal Semiconductor Field Effect {{transistors}} (MESFETs) and High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) {{have been}} the focus of research for high-temperature operation due to the 1. 42 eV band gap of GaAs that reduces thermal carrier generation as compared to 1. 1 eV silicon-based electronics. Although schemes have been proposed to minimize substrate currents at elevated temperatures, high-temperature operation of these devices is ultimately limited by the gate leakage current of the Schottky gate contact. Since a Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET) has a higher gate barrier to current flow than a Schottky barrier MESFET {{as a result of the}} p/n <b>junction</b> <b>gate,</b> JFETs should have superior performance at elevated temperatures. This paper compares the high-temperature performance of a self-aligned GaAs MESFET and JFET.

5000|$|Junctionless {{nanowire}} transistor (JNT), {{developed at}} Tyndall National Institute in Ireland, is a nanowire-based transistor {{that has no}} <b>gate</b> <b>junction.</b> (Even MOSFET has a <b>gate</b> <b>junction,</b> although its <b>gate</b> is electrically insulated from the controlled region.)

The JNT uses a simple nanowire of silicon surrounded by an electrically isolated [...] "wedding ring" [...] that acts to gate the flow of electrons through the wire. This method has been described as akin to squeezing a garden hose to gate the flow of water through the hose. The nanowire is heavily n-doped, making it an excellent conductor. Crucially the gate, comprising silicon, is heavily p-doped; and its presence depletes the underlying silicon nanowire thereby preventing carrier flow past the gate.|$|R
