40|$|Background-Structural and {{phenotypic}} {{changes of}} cardiomyocytes characterize atrial fibrillation. We investigated whether {{changes in the}} glucose-regulated protein GRP 94, which is essential for cell viability, occur {{in the presence of}} chronic atrial fibrillation. Methods and Results-Samples of <b>fibrillating</b> atrial myocardium obtained from both goat and human hearts were analyzed for GRP 94 expression by an immunologic approach. In goats, atrial fibrillation was induced and maintained for 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks. After 16 weeks of atrial fibrillation, cardioversion was applied and followed by 8 weeks of sinus rhythm. GRP 94 levels doubled in goat atrial myocytes after 4 to 16 weeks of fibrillation with respect to normal atria and returned to control levels in atrial myocardium of cardioverted goats. Immunohistochemical analyses confirm that GRP 94 increase occurred within cardiomyocytes. Significantly, increased levels of GRP 94 were also observed in samples from human <b>fibrillating</b> atria. In the absence of signs of myocyte irreversible damage, the GRP 94 increase in <b>fibrillating</b> atria is comparable to GRP 94 levels observed in perinatal goat myocardium. However, calreticulin, another endoplasmic reticulum protein highly expressed in perinatal hearts, does not increase in <b>fibrillating</b> atria, whereas inducible HSP 70, a cytoplasm stress protein that is expressed in perinatal goat hearts at levels comparable to those observed in the adult heart, shows a significant increase in chronic <b>fibrillating</b> atria.

40|$|AbstractAtrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), {{the most}} common cardiac arrhythmia, is frequently accompanied by atrial interstitial fibrosis. Angiotensin II (Ang II) dependent signaling pathways have been implicated in interstitial fibrosis during the development of AF. However, Ang II could be further degraded by angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE 2). We examined expression of ACE 2 in the <b>fibrillating</b> atria of pigs and its involvement in fibrotic pathogenesis during AF. Nine adult pigs underwent continuous rapid atrial pacing to induce sustained AF and six pigs were sham controls (i. e., sinus rhythm; SR). In the histological examinations, extensive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the interstitial space of the atria, as evidenced by Masson’s trichrome stain, were found in <b>fibrillating</b> atria. The relative amount of collagen type I in the atria with AF was significantly increased as compared with that in the SR. Local ACE activity in the <b>fibrillating</b> atria was also markedly higher than that in the SR subjects. ACE 2 gene and protein expression in the AF subjects were significantly decreased compared {{with those in the}} SR subjects, whereas expression of mitogen-activated/ERK kinase 1 / 2 (MEK 1 / 2), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK 2), and activated ERK 2 were significantly greater in the AF subjects. We propose that decreasing ACE 2 expression during AF may affect the Ang II-dependent signaling pathway. In addition, our results suggest that atrial fibrosis in AF may be induced by antagonistic regulation between ACE and ACE 2 expression...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) {{depends on the}} capacity of the inflow cannula to drain blood into the pump. Left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) sites are compared in an animal model mimicking different hemodynamic situations. Three calves (56. 3 ± 5. 0 kg) monitored with ECG, arterial pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) were equipped with a Thoratec LVAD used in fill-empty mode. A regular CPB pump was used as a RVAD (jugular vein/pulmonary artery). CVP was adjusted to defined preload conditions by storage (or perfusion) of blood into (or from) the venous reservoir. We compared the LA and LV inflow cannulation sites, used separately or simultaneously, on the output of the LVAD, tested alone on a beating heart, and with the CPB (BiVAD) on a beating then <b>fibrillating</b> heart. In every conditions, increase of CVP highlighted the differences of LVAD's performance due to the sites of inflow cannulation. For a CVP of 14 mmHG, LVAD used on a beating heart was better with the LV (4. 5 ± 0. 4 l/min) as compared to the LA cannulation (3. 9 ± 0. 4 l/min, p < 0. 01). Results were similar with a BiVAD used on a beating heart (4. 9 ± 0. 2 1 /min for LV vs. 3. 8 ± 0. 6 l/min for LA cannulation, p < 0. 001). However, with a <b>fibrillating</b> heart, LA cannulation allowed better LVAD performance (2. 9 ± 0. 3 vs. 2. 4 ± 0. 1 l/min, p < 0. 001). Using both LV and LA inflow cannulae simultaneously, did not improve the LVAD output in none of the situations. LV cannulation increases LVAD performance in beating hearts. However, because the <b>fibrillating</b> heart represents the extreme of a failing heart, the use of a LA site for inflow cannulation must be considered for a better BiVAD performance...|$|R

40|$|The cardiac {{metabolism}} of the <b>fibrillating</b> {{left ventricle}} {{of the dog}} heart with and without mainte-nance of left coronary artery inflow was investigated. During ventricular fibrillation without maintenance of coronary flow, myocardial adenosine triphosphate and glycogen fell progressively, and in vitro oxygen consumption of biopsied tissue initially increased, but with adequate coronary perfusion these elements were maintained. With reinstitution of coronary flow after 30 to 40 minutes of fibrillation without flow, resynthesis of high energy phosphate occurred. The coronary artery-coronary sinus oxygen difference and left ventricular oxygen usage both decreased in the perfused <b>fibrillating</b> heart {{as compared with the}} values in the beating heart. THE frequent experimental and clinicaloccurrence of ventricular fibrillation hasstimulated much effort in resuscitation methodology and many investigations of the mechanism of fibrillation. 1 More recently, ventricular fibrillation has been induced pur-posely to facilitate animal intracardiac surgery. 2 - 3 Few experimental studies, however, have been concerned with the metabolic changes associated with this state. In 1933, Hooker and Kehar 4 concluded from measure-ments of dextrose consumption and carbon dioxide output that the carbohydrate metab-olism of the dog heart in ventricular fibrillation is increased. Senning, 3 however, recently reported that the cardiac oxygen consumption is the same during ventricular fibrillation and regular sinus rhythm when the coronary and systemic circulations are maintained by an extra-corporeal pump.

We use a technique that allows full revascularization for this cohort of patients, while minimizing cerebral embolic risk. MethodsIntraoperative epiaortic ultrasound was used to screen for moderate or severe atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta and to precisely identify safe areas for cannulation and proximal anastomoses. By using a mildly hypothermic <b>fibrillating</b> technique, distal revascularization was then performed without clamping the aorta. Proximal anastomoses were accomplished under brief periods of circulatory arrest. ResultsWe routinely use this technique and examined our results in 71 consecutive patients found to have grade 3 or greater atherosclerotic plaque of the ascending aorta. This represented approximately 10. 0 % of our total population who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting over a 32 -month period from January 2007 to September 2009. One patient (1. 4 %) had a mild stroke that resolved, and there were no other neurologic complications.
