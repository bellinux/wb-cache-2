25|$|The {{earliest}} known use of <b>irrational</b> <b>numbers</b> {{was in the}} Indian Sulba Sutras composed between 800 and 500BC.

However Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of <b>irrational</b> <b>numbers.</b> He could not disprove their existence through logic, {{but he could not}} accept <b>irrational</b> <b>numbers,</b> and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.|$|R

40|$|The ancient Greeks {{discovered}} them, but it wasn’t {{until the}} nineteenth century that <b>irrational</b> <b>numbers</b> were properly understood and rigorously defined, and even today not all their mysteries have been revealed.

25|$|As for irrational numbers, none of {{them have}} a finite {{representation}} in any of the rational-based positional number systems (such as the decimal and duodecimal ones); this is because a rational-based positional number system is essentially nothing but a way of expressing quantities as a sum of fractions whose denominators are powers of the base, and by definition no finite sum of rational numbers can ever result in an <b>irrational</b> <b>number.</b> For example, 123.456 = 1 × 102 + 2 × 101 + 3 × 100 + 4 × 1/101 + 5 × 1/102 + 6 × 1/103 (this is also the reason why fractions that contain prime factors in their denominator not in common with those of the base do not have a terminating representation in that base). Moreover, the infinite series of digits of an <b>irrational</b> <b>number</b> does not exhibit a strictly repeating pattern; instead, the different digits often succeed in a seemingly random fashion. The following chart compares the first few digits of the decimal and duodecimal representation of several of the most important algebraic and transcendental irrational numbers. Some of these numbers may be perceived as having fortuitous patterns, making them easier to memorize, when represented in one base or the other.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was taken by Eudoxus of Cnidus, who formalized a new theory of {{proportion}} that took into account commensurable as well as incommensurable quantities. Central to his idea was the distinction between magnitude and number. A magnitude “...was not a number but stood for entities such as line segments, angles, areas, volumes, and time which could vary, as we would say, continuously. Magnitudes were opposed to numbers, which jumped from one value to another, as from 4 to 5.” Numbers are composed of some smallest, indivisible unit, whereas magnitudes are infinitely reducible. Because no quantitative values were assigned to magnitudes, Eudoxus was then able to account for both commensurable and incommensurable ratios by defining a ratio {{in terms of its}} magnitude, and proportion as an equality between two ratios. By taking quantitative values (numbers) out of the equation, he avoided the trap of having to express an <b>irrational</b> <b>number</b> as a number. “Eudoxus’ theory enabled the Greek mathematicians to make tremendous progress in geometry by supplying the necessary logical foundation for incommensurable ratios.” This incommensurability is dealt with in Euclid's Elements, Book X, Proposition 9.|$|E
