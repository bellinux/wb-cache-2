5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral <b>diphosphine</b> and diarsine complexes +.|$|E

50|$|Due to the chelate effect, ligands {{with two}} {{phosphine}} groups bind more tightly to metal centers than do two monodentate phosphines.

25|$|In 1844, Paul Thénard, {{son of the}} French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, used a {{cold trap}} to {{separate}} <b>diphosphine</b> from phosphine that had been generated from calcium phosphide, thereby demonstrating that P2H4 is responsible for spontaneous flammability associated with PH3, and also for the characteristic orange/brown color that can form on surfaces, which is a polymerisation product. He considered diphosphine’s formula to be PH2, and thus an intermediate between elemental phosphorus, the higher polymers, and phosphine. Calcium phosphide (nominally Ca3P2) produces more P2H4 than other phosphides because of the preponderance of P-P bonds in the starting material.|$|E

40|$|Chiral <b>diphosphines</b> {{have become}} an {{important}} class of ligands for asymmetric catalysis. It is the success itself of enantioselective catalysis that has enhanced the demand for new chiral ligands for essentially two reasons. The first one is that no class of ligands can be considered universal anymore, as it is linked to a finite however broad scope of substrates and reactions. The second reason is the proprietary protection of established ligands. Based on these considerations, the range of chelating <b>diphosphines</b> based on [(h 6 -benzene) Cr(CO) 3] complexes which has recently become accessible through {{the implementation of a}} stereocontrolled synthetic strategy has been extended. These ligands, which are endowed with central and planar chirality, offer a range of possibilities for their steric, electronic and conformational properties to be modulated. The new ligands have been prepared starting from [(h 6 -arene) Cr(CO) 3] complexes derived from commercially available optically active benzylamines bearing a para-substituent other than hydrogen, in order to asses the influence of such a substituent on the electronic properties of the final <b>diphosphines.</b> The synthetic challenges posed by such a substituent are reviewed. <b>Diphosphines</b> supported by a more rigid scaffold have been prepared as well starting from optically pure (S) -N,N-dimethylaminoindane. By proper choice of reaction conditions, complexation of this amine to the Cr(CO) 3 moiety turns out to be highly diastereoselective. The efficiency of the new ligands has been tested in the rhodium promoted asymmetric homogeneous hydrogenation of (Z) -N-acetylaminocinnamic acid methylester and dimethyl itaconate. All the new <b>diphosphines</b> provide rhodium catalyst precursors which promote complete conversion of the substrates. Catalytic performances are dependent on the electron richness and steric demands of the phosphorous substituents and enantioselectivities between 87 and 91 % ee are obtained with the more electron rich ligands. No dramatic changes in chiral induction are observed by changing the substituent on the Cr-coordinated arene: likely, the electron-withdrawing nature of the Cr(CO) 3 group levels out any contribution these substituents bring about on the electron dowry of the [(h 6 -arene) Cr(CO) 3] moiety as a whole.
