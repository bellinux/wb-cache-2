"Monsieur de Merouville, {{here is a}} document, {{signed by}} these nine gentlemen, <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> <b>undertaking</b> that you and Madame shall be, in future, {{permitted}} to reside in your chateau without the slightest let or hindrance; and that you shall suffer no molestation, whatever, either on account of this affair, or {{on the question of}} religion. I have a duplicate of this document; and have, on my part, <b>given</b> <b>an</b> undertaking that, if its terms are broken I will, at whatever inconvenience to myself, return to this neighbourhood, hang these ten gentlemen if I can catch them, and at any rate burn their chateaux to the ground. Therefore I think, as you have their undertaking and mine, you can without fear return home; but this, of course, I leave to yourself to decide.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} {{appointed}} to the Order of the Garter, taking the stall vacated by the executed Lord Hastings. This commitment bore further fruit {{in the autumn of}} 1483, when a series of plots against the King coalesced into Buckingham's rebellion, a rising in southern and western England under the loose leadership of the Duke of Buckingham. When Richard rose to suppress the rebellion, Stanley and his brother William were at the King's side and were richly rewarded from the forfeited estates of the rebels and Stanley was appointed to Buckingham’s position as Lord High Constable of England. Whilst Stanley might have had no other option than to act as Richard’s loyal subject, it is conceivable that he may himself have become involved in the uprising. His wife, Margaret Beaufort, was a key conspirator, having brokered the marriage alliance between Edward IV’s daughter Elizabeth of York and her son Henry Tudor. Indeed, it was only by <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> <b>undertaking</b> to Richard to keep his wife in custody and to end her intrigues that Stanley saved her from attainder and disgrace and presumably his own position at the same time. Richard was evidently well aware of the threat from this quarter since in the summer of 1485, when Stanley sought permission to leave the court and return to his northern fastness of Lathom, the king insisted that his son, George Stanley, Lord Strange, take his place at court as a token for his father’s good behaviour.|$|R

"If {{these terms}} are refused," [...] Toussaint went on, [...] "and your people invade the island, we shall leave {{you and the}} French to fight it out until we {{perceive}} which is the stronger, {{and as soon as}} we do so, shall aid the weaker. I do not say that we shall stand aloof up to that time, we shall fight against both, they would be equally our enemies; but if one were so far getting the better of it as to be likely to drive the other out, then in self-defence we should unite our forces against it. I may say that although we and the mulattoes are both fighting against the French, the alliance {{is not likely to be}} a long one. We all know that if they got the upper hand they would be far more cruel and more tyrannous than the whites have been. They have ever looked down upon us, and have treated us with far greater contempt than have the whites, who, to do them justice, were kindly masters, and especially treated their house servants well. There will therefore be four parties here all hostile to each other. You and the French will be striving for mastery, we for liberty, the mulattoes for the domination of the island and for their personal interest. The way I have pointed out is, in my opinion, the only one that can bring about peace. If your government and people will <b>give</b> us <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> <b>undertaking</b> that in no case shall slavery ever be re-established, and that all men shall have equal rights, we will join you heart and soul. When I say equal rights I do not mean that they shall have votes. We are at present absolutely unfit to have votes or to exercise political power. I only mean that the law shall be the same for us as for the whites, that we shall be taxed on the same scale in proportion to our means, that the assembly shall have no power to make separate laws concerning us, and that, should they attempt to make such laws, they should be at once dissolved by the white authorities of the island." ...|$|R

5000|$|Acontius (Ἀκόντιος), was in Greek mythology a {{beautiful}} {{youth of the}} island of Ceos, the hero of a love-story told by Callimachus in a poem of which only fragments remain, and which forms the subject of two of Ovid's Heroides (xx, xxi). During the festival of Artemis at Delos, Acontius saw Cydippe, a well-born Athenian maiden of whom he was enamoured, sitting in {{the temple of the}} goddess. He wrote on an apple the words, [...] "I swear by Artemis that I will marry Acontius", and threw it at her feet. She picked it up, and mechanically read the words aloud, which amounted to <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> <b>undertaking</b> to carry them out. Unaware of this, she treated Acontius with contempt; but, although she was betrothed more than once, she always fell ill before the wedding took place. The Delphic oracle at last declared the cause of her illnesses to be the wrath of the offended goddess; whereupon her father consented to her marriage with Acontius (Aristaenetus, Epistolae, i.10; Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses, i, tells the story with different names; see Ctesylla).|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War Britain set up the Protectorate of Egypt and imposed martial law, at the same time <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> pledge to defend Egypt and not call on the Egyptian people to aid them in the conflict.

50|$|The Schedule {{sets out}} {{the wording of}} the oath and the {{affirmation}} of allegiance. The Governor-General and members of parliament are required to make <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> <b>undertaking</b> of allegiance, by oath or affirmation as prescribed by the Constitution. In addition, when taking office, the Governor-General is required to take an oath of office, currently: I, (name), do swear that I will well and truly serve Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Her heirs and successors according to law, in the office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and I will do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of the Commonwealth of Australia, without fear or favour, affection or ill will. So help me God! The oath or affirmation of office made by a prime minister, ministers and parliamentary secretaries when entering office is in wording that is not prescribed in the Constitution but determined by the prime minister of the day, and administered to them by the Governor-General. While there is no legal requirement for this, it has been the practice from the inauguration of the Commonwealth in 1901.|$|R
5000|$|At {{a series}} of {{meetings}} in 17-26 June 1940, during and after the Battle of France, British envoy Malcolm MacDonald brought a proposal to end the partition of Ireland and offered <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> <b>undertaking</b> to accept [...] "the principle of a United Ireland" [...] if Ireland would abandon its neutrality and immediately join the war against Germany and Italy. However, the reality of unity would have to be agreed by the [...] "representatives of the government of Éire and the government of Northern Ireland", each of which distrusted the other intensely. De Valera therefore rejected the amended proposals on 4 July, worried that there was [...] "no guarantee that in the end we would have a united Ireland" [...] and that it [...] "would commit us definitely to an immediate abandonment of our neutrality". De Valera had campaigned against partition and the 1937 Constitution drafted by him had an irredentist clause describing the State as the [...] "whole island of Ireland". After the war he again called repeatedly for the ending of partition. The offer and his rejection remained secret until a biography was published in 1970.|$|R

In 1166, to attempt to achieve a diplomatic settlement with his neighbours, Mac Lochlainn arranged a truce and took hostages from many of the families in Ulaid. In return he had <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> oath to the Bishop of Armagh and many other notables for his good behaviour. In violation of the oath, he had Eochaid mac Con Ulad Mac Duinn Sléibe, king of Ulaid, seized and blinded.|$|R
60|$|But {{the news}} of this resolve reached the ears of Don Frederick. He knew now what the burghers of Haarlem were capable of, and thought that they would {{probably}} fire the city before they left, and thus leaving nothing but a heap of ashes as a trophy of his victory. He therefore {{sent a letter to}} the magistrates, in the name of Count Overstein, commander of the German forces in the besieging army, <b>giving</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> assurance that if they surrendered at discretion no punishment should be inflicted except upon those who, in the judgment of the citizens themselves, had deserved it.|$|R

2500|$|On 2 May 1989, {{the first}} visible {{cracks in the}} Iron Curtain {{appeared}} when Hungary began dismantling its [...] long border fence with Austria. This increasingly destabilized the GDR and Czechoslovakia over the summer and autumn as thousands of their citizens illegally crossed over to the West through the Hungarian-Austrian border. On 1 June 1989 the Communist Party admitted that former Prime Minister Imre Nagy, hanged for treason {{for his role in}} the 1956 Hungarian uprising, was executed illegally after a show trial. On 16 June 1989 Nagy was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> funeral on Budapest's largest square in front of crowds of at least 100,000, followed by a hero's burial.|$|R
60|$|Bunyan's {{conversion}} {{from being}} a pest to the neighbourhood to becoming a pious man, might have been pardoned had he conformed to the Directory; but for him to appear as a Dissenter and a public teacher, without going through the usual course of education and ordination, was an unpardonable offence. The opinions of man gave him no concern; all his anxiety {{was to have the}} approbation of his God, and then to walk accordingly, braving all the dangers, the obloquy, and contempt that might arise from his conscientious discharge of duties, for the performance of which he knew that he alone must <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> account at the great day.|$|R
50|$|By the Treaty of Frederiksborg or Copenhagen on 3 July 1720 {{peace was}} also signed between Denmark and Sweden, Denmark {{returning}} Rügen, Further Pomerania {{as far as}} the Peene, and Wismar to Sweden, in exchange for an indemnity of 600,000 Riksdaler, while Sweden would pay the Sound tolls and her protectorate over Holstein-Gottorp. The prospect of coercing Russia by means of the British fleet had alone induced Sweden to consent to such sacrifices; but when the last demands of Britain and her allies had been complied with, Sweden was left to come to terms as best she could with the tsar. Negotiations were reopened with Russia at Nystad, in May 1720, but peace was not concluded till 30 August 1721 and then only under the direst pressure. By the Treaty of Nystad Sweden ceded to Russia Ingria and Estonia, Livonia, the Finnish province of Kexholm and Viborg Castle. Finland west of Viborg and north of Käkisalmi was restored to Sweden. She also received an indemnity of two million Riksdaler and <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> <b>undertaking</b> of non-interference in her domestic affairs. It was not the least of Sweden's misfortunes after the Great Northern War that the new constitution, which was to compensate her for all her past sacrifices, should contain within it the elements of many of her future calamities.|$|R

However, the British quickly came to realise they desperately needed the support of Egyptian labour, camel drivers and their camels in a land that was so inhospitable to Europeans.

60|$|I bade Ulick {{go out of}} town on any pretext he chose, and put {{a letter}} into a post-office near Castle Lyndon, which I {{prepared}} in a feigned hand, and in which I <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> warning to Lord George Poynings to quit the country; saying that the great prize was never meant for the likes of him, and that there were heiresses enough in England, without coming to rob them out of the domains of Captain Fireball. The letter was written on a dirty piece of paper, in the worst of spelling: it came to my Lord by the post-conveyance, and, being a high-spirited young man, he of course laughed at it.|$|R

50|$|During {{the course}} of the filming, a large number of mysterious {{accidents}} and odd events were taking place on the set, and the cast and crew were increasingly nervous. Eventually, the director, William Friedkin, approached Bermingham and asked him to exorcise the set, which held the construction of the Georgetown townhouse and was located in a warehouse. Bermingham said no, telling Friedkin there was not enough evidence of demonic activity and that an exorcism would only increase anxiety. The next day, the set burned to the ground. Bermingham then <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> <b>solemn</b> blessing and said a few words of reassurance in an event attended by the entire cast and crew, from Friedkin to Max von Sydow, who played Father Merrin.|$|R
