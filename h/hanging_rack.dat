50|$|The {{type and}} size of the objects in the {{collection}} also help to determine where and how the storage space is set up. If the collection has many large heavy items, like furniture, the storage spaces typically have low shelving for these items, and require wide isles to move the objects, especially if they require large equipment like a forklift to be moved. In these cases, the doorways must be large enough to accommodate these large objects, and the floor structure must be reinforced to hold the weight of the collection. If a collection consists of mostly small objects, then cabinets and shelving are a practical solution, while a collection of two-dimensional works might require flat drawers and <b>hanging</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R

Three days before her wedding, Owaka is in her room, looking over wedding gifts, {{as well as a}} splendid kimono, <b>hanging</b> on a <b>rack.</b> In her despair, she throws a folded fan across the room, where it lands inside a standing lamp.

The fire spreads through the building, and quickly engulfs the entire neighborhood. Firefighters, among them Matsukichi, rush to the scene, and begin demolishing surrounding buildings in an attempt to confine the conflagration. Matsukichi sees Owaka standing on top of a roof, covering herself with the splendid kimono. He calls out to her, warning her not to climb a nearby tower. But, surrounded by fire, Owaka had no choice, and climbs it anyway. The fire reaches her, and the tower goes up in a burst of flame. The splendid kimono is sent flying into the sky, still burning.|$|R

60|$|They {{walked on}} the gravel across a green court, where the snow still lay in islets on the grass, and in masses on the boughs of the great cedar and the crenelated coping of the stone walls, and then into a larger court, where there was another cedar, to find the {{beautiful}} choir long ago turned into stables, {{in the first instance}} perhaps after an impromptu fashion by troopers, who had a pious satisfaction in insulting the priests of Baal and the images of Ashtoreth, the queen of heaven. The exterior--its west end, save for the stable door, walled in with brick and covered with ivy--was much defaced, maimed of finial and gurgoyle, the friable limestone broken and fretted, and lending its soft gray to a powdery dark lichen; the long windows, too, were filled in with brick as far as the springing of the arches, the broad clerestory windows with wire or ventilating blinds. With the low wintry afternoon sun upon it, sending shadows from the cedar boughs, and lighting up the touches of snow remaining on every ledge, it had still a scarcely disturbed aspect of antique solemnity, which gave the scene in the interior rather a startling effect; though, ecclesiastical or reverential indignation apart, the eyes could hardly help dwelling with pleasure on its piquant picturesqueness. Each finely-arched chapel was turned into a stall, where in the dusty glazing of the windows there still gleamed patches of crimson, orange, blue, and palest violet; for the rest, the choir had been gutted, the floor leveled, paved, and drained according to the most approved fashion, and a line of loose boxes erected in the middle: a soft light fell from the upper windows on sleek brown or gray flanks and haunches; on mild equine faces looking out with active nostrils over the varnished brown boarding; on the hay <b>hanging</b> from <b>racks</b> where the saints once looked down from the altar-pieces, and on the pale golden straw scattered or in heaps; on a little white-and-liver-colored spaniel making his bed on the back of an elderly hackney, and on four ancient angels, still showing signs of devotion like mutilated martyrs--while over all, the grand pointed roof, untouched by reforming wash, showed its lines and colors mysteriously through veiling shadow and cobweb, and a hoof now and then striking against the boards seemed to fill the vault with thunder, while outside there was the answering bay of the blood-hounds.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{schedule}} of shooting, {{which was the}} longest and most important, began on April 2011 in parts of Siberia, St Petersburg and Murmansk. For the shooting in Siberia, the directors {{had a lot of}} difficulty acquiring permission. Similarly they had also faced several problems during the shooting in new Zealand. Describing this ordeal Mustan Burmawalla said [...] "We had to seek lot of permissions for a traffic jam scene to be shot in New Zealand and that took a long time. While, in Russia we faced language problem, we appointed about 25 interpreters. We needed them to help us about basic things like where to go to eat etc,". Due to the difficulty allotting dates, Bachchan had to leave another project by Ram Gopal Varma titled Department, whom Varma would later blame for the dismal performance of the film at the box office. The sequences involving the train were directed by Filmfare award winning, stunt director Allan Amin. Bachchan refused to have a body double for the scenes and performed all the dangerous stunts himself. During the sequence, he had to balance himself atop two trains which were travelling at approximately 100 km/h. He hit his head on a rod on top of the train, but still managed to complete the scene. During another scene Bachchan was left <b>hanging</b> by a <b>rack</b> on the train for around 20 hours. While filming took place there, a group of Russian soldiers learnt that an Indian film was shooting nearby and joined the crew on the sets and requested to meet all the stars.|$|R
40|$|The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, {{recently}} acquired a remarkable group of over thirty-five Japanese textiles, {{the majority of}} which are probably pieces from kosode robes of the Edo period (1615 - 1868). This paper {{will serve as a}} brief introduction to the collection, which will be on view next summer in the Museum’s Japanese galleries. This introduction to the recent acquisition consists of three parts. The first part discusses a few of the pieces from the {{recently acquired}} group that have companions in the Nomura collection of the National Museum of Japanese History (Kokuritsu Rekishi Minzoku Hakubutsukan) in Sakura, Chiba, Japan. The second part presents two of the earliest pieces in the group, one in comparison with a similar design in a kosode order book, and the other with special attention to technique. The final part focuses on early examples of the yūzen technique. Comparisons with the Nomura Collection Several of the fragments in the collection correspond to textiles used in the kosode screens of Nomura Shōjirō’s famous collection, which is in the National Museum of Japanese History in Sakura, Chiba prefecture, Japan. Nomura Shōjirō (1879 – 1943) was a dealer in Japanese art of all types and a collector and connoisseur of Japanese textiles. He had an almost incalculable influence on the collecting of Japanese textiles, especially in this country, where museum collections from Los Angeles to New York benefited from patrons who had purchased textiles from him. In the early twentieth century, as Japanese textile collections were being sold, Nomura acquired fine robes and fragments of robes dating from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries. Many of the garments were no longer complete, having been cut up into pieces for various purposes—perhaps for religious use, perhaps for mounting paintings, perhaps for other uses. Patiently, Nomura gathered fragments and slowly reassembled kosode. In one hundred instances where he could not recreate a complete garment, he hit upon the idea of making kosode screens in which the robe fragments were pasted to Japanese screens in the form of complete kosode <b>hanging</b> on robe <b>racks.</b> The kosode screens echoed a Japanese tradition of painted screens depicting robes on robe racks; however, Nomura’s screens were not painted but made from actual kosode fragments. All together, twelve of the Metropolitan Museum’s new textiles, about one third, correspond with screens from the Nomura collection. 2 A few of the correspondences will be discussed here...|$|R
5000|$|We {{cut to a}} pair of shoes, hopping {{about to}} the music and {{sticking}} out their tongues at each other. Springing from his stool, the dummy zips away, his broad, circular feet conveniently becoming wheels for ease of transport; spreading wide his legs, he spins about, with the aid of his wheels, in a great circle. Jettisoning his old headgear, the dummy dons a straw hat <b>hanging</b> from a <b>rack</b> standing by. Bending knee and elbow, he croons the title song après Chevalier. Many toys present clap and cheer; a cash register chimes, a dog barks its approval; clocks, cuckoo or otherwise, ring in rapture. Tossing aside the tossed straw hat, donning a silken one and picking up a clarinet from off of a nearby chest, our wooden friend asks, in the fashion of Ted Lewis, [...] "Is everybody happy?" [...] Cheers! Stepping lively, he awakens his woodwind with a merry melody: a grandfather clock, bent over with age but filled with the spirit of song, dances about, finding himself a maypole around which little alarm clocks gaily prance; three little soldiers newly animated march in array, aiming and firing their pop-guns at opposing glass bottles and marching onward as the vessels burst into oblivion. They fire at the little ship in a discarded (mirror image-)print of Washington Crossing the Delaware; soggy but undaunted, the General and his men march out of the river and onto land, the commander himself bearing the stars and stripes, one man hymning [...] "Yankee Doodle" [...] to his fife, the other dutifully at his snare drum, as the little warriors stand at attention. The dummy has been marching in step; coming upon a bath towel, which he declares a magic carpet, he flies off to another space in the dump, where mannequins and a bust (perhaps of Mozart) stand at the ready, their hands on a trombone, another clarinet, a saxophone, and a violin. The dummy conducts for a moment with his hands before returning to his instrument; another grandfather clock swings its pendulum back and forth to strike two opposing wash bins; another doll has become the drummer, hanging bottles his chimes, another basin his bass drum, and, as he pulls a chain to activate a shower, he decides to use the individual streams of water as the strings of a harp. Three female display-mannequins, each embracing another's shoulder or hip, sing the title song: [...] "A little whoozits, a little whatzits, and a great big bunch of you!" [...] An owl scats, two hat racks, hats on head and canes in hand, dance. The dummy has taken to conducting his band with his clarinet; he plays a vacuum cleaner {{as though it were a}} set of bagpipes. The rusted frame of a car fires its exhaust in rhythm as the doll prances his way back to the makeshift clavier to sing a few last bars; as he finishes, an avalanche of junk tumbles down and buries him.
