5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and <b>electrospray</b> mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} ESI methods that require {{little to no}} sample preparation. One such method is a method termed {{extractive}} <b>electrospray</b> ionization (EESI). This method involves having an <b>electrospray</b> of solvent directed at an angle against a different spray of the sample solution, produced by a separate nebulizer. This method requires no sample preparation in that the <b>electrospray</b> of solvent extracts the sample from the complex mixture, effectively removing any background contaminants. Another particularly powerful variation on ESI is desorption <b>electrospray</b> ionization (DESI), which involves directing an <b>electrospray</b> at a surface with the sample deposited on top of it. The sample is ionized in the <b>electrospray</b> as it splashes off the surface, then traveling to the mass spectrometer. This method is important {{because of the fact}} that no sample preparation is needed for this method. A sample simply needs to be deposited on a surface, such as paper. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) is similar to ESI in that the sample is nebulized in droplets that are then evaporated, leaving behind a charged ion to be analyzed. APCI experiences few of the negative matrix effects experienced by ESI due to the fact that ionization occurs in the gas phase in this method rather than the within the liquid droplets as in ESI and the fact that in APCI there is an overabundance of reaction gas, thus minimizing the effect of the matrix on the ionization process.|$|E

40|$|PVDF, Poly(vinylidene fluoride), is a polymer {{that has}} been studied for over four decades due to its good {{electromechanical}} properties, stability, and durability in various environments. Currently, PVDF is the only commercially available piezoelectric polymer. PVDF is a polymorph, which indicates the presence of several crystalline phases such as α, β, γ, and δ-phase. Oriented β-phase PVDF exhibits ferroelectric properties and displays the largest piezoelectricity amongst the four phases, which makes it the most desirable phase. Preparing oriented β-phase PVDF is a multi-step process, which is cost intensive, due to the time, labor and energy utilized. The main goal of this work is to prepare oriented β-phase PVDF using the <b>electrospraying</b> technique in a one step process. During the <b>electrospraying</b> process a polymer jet is ejected. This jet disintegrates into droplets due to overwhelming surface tension, resulting in a sprayed coating on the collector substrate. Because of the combination of jet ejection and the high voltage applied between the needle tip and the substrate, the droplets can be stretched and the polymer chains can be oriented. Both the stretching and the high electric field are required for the transformation of α-phase to the oriented β-phase. This study proposes that by using the <b>electrospraying</b> technique {{it is possible to}} transform the α-phase to the β-phase in a one step process starting from solution. This research focuses on the processing and characterization of <b>electrosprayed</b> PVDF as well as <b>electrosprayed</b> PVDF/carbon nanotubes (PVDF/CNT) nanocomposites. The specific tasks are to determine the changes to the PVDF phases due to the <b>electrospraying</b> technique, and to determine the changes in the PVDF morphology due to the addition of carbon nanotubes to the polymer matrix. PVDF with two different molecular weights were <b>electrosprayed</b> using different solvents and parameters. Initial observations after <b>electrospraying</b> were that, high boiling point solvents resulted in the spraying of the solution and forming films, whereas a low boiling point volatile solvent such as acetone resulted in the spinning of the solution thus forming non-woven fiber mats. The thermal and electrical properties of the <b>electrosprayed</b> PVDF and PVDF/CNT composites are measured using several characterization techniques, including Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC), Dielectric spectroscopy, Thermally Stimulated Current (TSC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). MDSC results show that <b>electrosprayed</b> PVDF has a lower melting point temperature than that of PVDF commercially available pellets. In addition, <b>electrosprayed</b> PVDF/CNT nanocomposites show a linear increase in the percentage of crystallinity with the increase of CNT concentration in the composite. Dielectric spectroscopy results indicate that by increasing the CNT concentration in the composite, the dielectric constant and the polymer conductivity increase. From the four characterizing techniques used, two of them, FT-IR and XRD, show {{that it is possible to}} transform α-phase to β-phase PVDF in a one-step process using <b>electrospraying.</b> The other two techniques, TSC and dielectric spectroscopy, show α-phase for the <b>electrosprayed</b> samples without CNT, and some β-phase formation with samples <b>electrosprayed</b> with CNT. These last two techniques; TSC and dielectric spectroscopy have results that differ from the FT-IR and XRD techniques. This contradiction may be a result of the small amounts of β-phase in the sample, which cannot be detected using these techniques. Another reason may be due to the difference in the probing levels between these techniques. XRD and FT-IR probe at the molecular level, whereas TSC and dielectric probe at a much larger scale, which may make it hard to detect small amounts of β-phase...|$|R

25|$|The {{interface}} between a liquid phase technique (HPLC) with a continuously flowing eluate, and a gas phase technique {{carried out in}} a vacuum was difficult for a long time. The advent of <b>electrospray</b> ionization changed this. Currently, the most common LC-MS interfaces are <b>electrospray</b> ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI). These are newer MS ion sources that facilitate {{the transition from a}} high pressure environment (HPLC) to high vacuum conditions needed at the MS analyzer. Although these interfaces are described individually, they can also be commercially available as dual ESI/APCI, ESI/APPI, or APCI/APPI ion sources. Various deposition and drying techniques were used in the past (e.g., moving belts) but the most common of these was the off-line MALDI deposition. A new approach still under development called direct-EI LC-MS interface, couples a nano HPLC system and an electron ionization equipped mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|Different {{types of}} ion source result in {{different}} arrays of fragments produced {{from the original}} molecules. An electron ionization source produces many fragments and mostly single-charged (1-) radicals (odd number of electrons), whereas an <b>electrospray</b> source usually produces non-radical quasimolecular ions that are frequently multiply charged.
