[...] It indicates as inspiration [...] "...Israeli reservists who, at great personal risk, declare 'there IS a limit' and refuse to serve in the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza", the abolitionists, and [...] "those who defied the Vietnam war" [...] and concludes, [...] "we will resist the machinery of war and repression and rally others {{to do everything possible to}} stop it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2012, it was {{reported}} that Clem had filmed his then-wife Heather Clem and Hulk Hogan having sex in his bedroom. Subsequently, on October 4, 2012, Gawker released a short clip of the video. In this video, Clem can be heard saying that the couple can [...] "do their thing" [...] and he will be in his office. [...] Furthermore, {{at the end of the}} video, Clem can also be heard telling Heather, [...] "If we ever need to retire, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> ticket". [...] Hogan filed a lawsuit against Clem and his now ex-wife for invading his privacy on October 15, 2012. Hogan later settled the lawsuit on October 29, 2012. Following the settlement, Clem also publicly apologized to Hogan. [...] Hogan sued Gawker Media for publishing the tape, and a jury of six awarded Hogan more than $140 million in March 2016. Gawker announced it would appeal as they were [...] "disappointed" [...] that the jury was unable to hear Clem's testimony, but ultimately reached a $31 million settlement with Hogan in November 2016.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, a sex tape between Hogan and Heather Clem, the {{estranged wife}} of radio {{personality}} Bubba the Love Sponge, emerged online. On October 4, 2012, Gawker released a short clip of the video. In the video, Bubba {{can be heard}} saying that the couple can [...] "do their thing" [...] {{and he will be}} in his office. At the end of the video, he can also be heard telling Heather, [...] "If we ever need to retire, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> ticket". Hogan later told Howard Stern on his satellite radio show that, [...] "it was a bad choice and a very low point" [...] and [...] "I was with some friends and made a wrong choice. It has devastated me, I have never been this hurt". On October 15, 2012, Hogan filed a lawsuit against Bubba and Heather Clem for invading his privacy. A settlement with Bubba was announced on October 29, 2012. Afterwards, Clem publicly apologized to Hogan. In December 2012, a federal court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, found that Gawker's publication of the video snippet did not violate U.S. copyright law. Hogan then joined Gawker to the ongoing action against Heather Clem in state court in Florida, alleging invasion of privacy, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeking $100 million in damages.|$|E
