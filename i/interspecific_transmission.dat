While most of the retroviruses are pathogenous, endogenous retroviruses have rarely been shown as such. Endogenous retroviruses, {{as most of the}} retroviruses, are able to cross 'species barriers'. Porcine endogenous retroviruses were described in 1974. They are expressed in tissues and cells involved in transplantation, endothelial cells, for instance. They are capable of <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission,</b> expressed in vitro in human cells; no evidence of in vivo <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> has been reported so far. As far as xenotransplantation is concerned, porcine endogenous retroviruses represent a risk of adaptation to humans of a new form of retrovirus. Such a risk mandates a close monitoring of recipients and their partners. This risk has already been taken with the use of tissues and stable blood-derived products from animals harboring in their genomes endogenous retroviruses...|$|E

Little is known, however, about <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> of the pathogen between different American crayfish species, although evidence from trade of ornamental crayfish suggests this may happen in captivity. We screened signal and virile crayfish for A. astaci at allopatric and sympatric sites in a UK river. Whilst the pathogen was detected in signal crayfish from both sites, infected virile crayfish were only found in sympatry. Genotyping of A. astaci from virile crayfish suggested {{the presence of a}} strain related to one infecting British signal crayfish.

We used laboratory assays to determine whether H. axyridis or Olla v-nigrum (Mulsant) harboring H. virescens (i. e., source beetles) transmit the fungus to noninfected target beetles H. axyridis, O. v-nigrum, Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleomegilla maculata (De Geer), or Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville.

40|$|Restoration of American bison (Bison bison) to montane environments {{where they}} once {{occurred}} requires information on ecological relationships with domestic cattle (Bos taurus) that now live there. Comparisons of the foraging distributions of sympatric bison and cattle in a 375 -ha basin revealed that cattle were constrained by slope and distance from water, especially vertical distance, whereas bison responded mostly to forage availability. Cattle {{appeared to be}} central place foragers oriented around water and followed a strategy of meeting their energetic needs with the least cost. Bison, in contrast, appeared to be energy maximizers that moved often in response to forage availability. The result was relatively little overlap (29 %) in spatial distributions.

Observations were performed in alpine regions of four Swiss cantons during the 1997 and 1998 mountain summer grazing season. In the main study area, Val Chamuera (canton of Grisons), a consistent {{reduction in the number of}} ibexes was observed after the arrival of sheep on the pasture. Some ibexes remained for a longer time in the area, but in general, ibexes and sheep did not use the same compartments of the area simultaneously. However, a salt lick for sheep attracted the ibexes, and several encounters were recorded in the compartments close to this salt lick. Several encounters registered in other areas of the Swiss Alps also occurred in the neighbourhood of a salt lick; however, in other cases different species were attracted by rich pastures. The study indicates that encounters (0 - 50 m) between free-ranging individuals of different Caprinae species, domestic and wild, are not uncommon events in the Alps. Therefore, encounters can be considered to be a predisposing factor for <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> of infectious agents such as Mycoplasma conjunctivae, causing keratoconjunctivitis in chamois, ibex, domestic sheep and goats...|$|E

Re-establishment of viable populations within the species' inferred pre-European geographic range is proving difficult due, in part, to predation by exotic and native carnivores. We monitored the health of western ringtail possums {{both before and after}} translocation to determine whether individual health components or population-level disease status contributes to the low translocation success. Common brushtail possums already resident at the release sites were also health-screened to investigate the likelihood of <b>interspecific</b> disease <b>transmission.</b> No evidence of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii or Leptospira serovars was found; neither was infection with Salmonella spp. or Chlamydiales spp demonstrated. One brushtail possum tested positive for Cryptococcus antigen. Survivorship modelling revealed a negative relationship between lymphocyte counts and translocation success for western ringtail possums. Moreover, site differences in haematological parameters suggested habitat quality for this species may be lower at the translocation sites than at the sites where possums are being displaced by clearing for land development. The numbers of brushtail possums resident at the release sites also affected survival of translocated ringtails. Implications of these results for future management of the western ringtail possum are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli is a {{zoonotic}} bacterium {{that is important}} to both public health and livestock economics. To date, most studies of zoonotic E. coli transmission have been conducted in developed nations with industrialized agricultural economies. In this study, E. coli bacteria were collected from people and livestock in two communities in rural western Uganda in order to investigate patterns of <b>interspecific</b> bacterial <b>transmission</b> in a developing rural economy characterized by very close human-livestock associations. Six hundred seventy-two E. coli isolates were genotyped using repetitive element-PCR (Rep-PCR) fingerprinting, and genetic distances between populations of bacteria from different hosts and locations were calculated. Genetic distances between human and livestock bacteria were generally very low, indicating high rates of bacterial gene flow among host species. Bacteria from humans and livestock in the same communities were virtually indistinguishable genetically. Data from surveys administered at the time of sample collection showed that people who did not regularly wash their hands before eating harbored bacteria approximately twice as similar genetically to bacteria of their livestock as did people who regularly washed their hands before eating. These results suggest that both rates of human-livestock interactions and patterns of human hygiene affect human-livestock bacterial transmission in this setting. This conclusion has implications not only for human and livestock health in subsistence-based agricultural economies but also for the emergence of zoonotic diseases out of such areas as a result of increasing globalization...|$|R

Our objectives were to determine landscape characteristics selected by female elk and identify publicly owned land within the Pine Ridge for potential redistribution of elk. We found distance to edge of cover influenced selection of resources by female elk most and that in areas with light hunting pressure, such as ours, this selection was not driven by an avoidance of roads. Female elk selected resources positioned near ponderosa pine cover types during all seasons, exhibited a slight avoidance of roads during spring and fall, selected areas with increased slope during winter and spring, and selected north- and east-facing aspects over flat areas and areas with south-facing slopes during winter months. We used our models to identified a potential elk redistribution area that had {{a higher proportion of}} landcover with characteristics selected by elk in our study area than the current herd areas and more landcover that was publicly owned.

Because of its unique transmission behavior, the PSR chromosome may be easily transmitted between species. This study tests whether the <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> of PSR between Trichogramma kaykai Pinto and Stouthamer and Trichogramma deion Pinto and Oatman (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is affected by two types of postzygotic reproductive isolation, i. e., hybrid inviability and hybrid sterility.

Mortality patterns changed between the years before (1976 – 1988) and coincident with (1989 – 1999) the dramatic increases in lesser snow goose abundance and mortality.

Lesser snow geese appeared to be the species most affected by avian cholera during 1989 – 1999; however, mortality in several other waterfowl species was positively correlated with lesser snow goose mortality. Coincident with increased lesser snow goose mortality, spring avian cholera outbreaks were detected earlier and ended earlier compared to 1976 – 1988.

40|$|Wildlife is a {{maintenance}} host for several significant livestock diseases. <b>Interspecific</b> pathogen <b>transmission</b> may occur in complex socio-ecological systems at wild-domestic interfaces that {{have so far}} been seldom studied. We investigated {{the relationship between the}} dynamics of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle populations with respect to frequency of contacts with African buffalo at different buffalo-cattle interfaces. A total of 36 GPS collars were deployed on African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and cattle (Bos taurus, Bos indicus) to assess contact patterns at the periphery of 3 protected areas in Zimbabwe. Simultaneously, a longitudinal survey of 300 cattle with five repeated sampling sessions on known individuals during 16 months was undertaken. Immunological assays (ELISAs), that allowed tracking the production of antibodies following infection or vaccination, were used to assess serological transitions (i. e., incidence and reversion) in the surveyed cattle. Variation in rates of serological transitions across seasons, sites and {{as a function of the}} frequency of contact with buffalo was analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. The incidence in the cattle populations of FMD antibodies produced following infection varied among sites and as a function of contact rates with African buffalo. The incidence was higher for sites with higher contact rates between the two species. The serological incidence was also related to seasons, being higher during the dry or rainy seasons depending on sites. The reversion rate pattern was the opposite of this incidence rate pattern. Vaccination seemed partly efficient at the individual level, but it did not prevent the diffusion of FMD viruses from the wild reservoir host to the domestic cattle population. Furthermore, antibodies were detected in areas where cattle had not been vaccinated, suggesting that the virus may have spread without being detected in domestic populations. Access to resources shared by buffalo and livestock, particularly water and grazing areas during the dry season, could partly explain the observed patterns of FMD transmission. We discuss how insights on ecological processes leading to wildlife-livestock contacts may provide some innovative solutions to improve FMD management, including surveillance, prevention or control of buffalo-borne outbreaks, by adopting strategies targeting risky areas and periods.

40|$|Background: Host {{specificity}} is {{a fundamental}} determinant of tick population and pathogen transmission dynamics, and therefore {{has important implications for}} human health. Tick host specificity is expected to be particularly high in the tropics, where communities of ticks, hosts and pathogens are most diverse. Yet the degree to which tropical tick species are host-specific remains poorly understood. Combining new field data with published records, we assessed the specificity of tick-host associations in Panama, a diverse Neotropical region. Methods: The resulting dataset includes 5, 298 adult ticks belonging to 41 species of eight genera that were directly collected from 68 vertebrate host species of 17 orders. We considered three important aspects of tick host specificity: (i) the relative ecological importance of each host species (structural specificity); (ii) relatedness among host species (phylogenetic specificity); and (iii) spatial scale-dependence of tick-host relationships (geographical specificity). Applying quantitative network analyses and phylogenetic tools with null model comparisons, we assessed the structural and phylogenetic specificity across three spatial scales, ranging from central Panama to countrywide. Further, we tested whether species-rich tick genera parasitized a wider variety of hosts than species-poor genera, as expected when ticks specialize on different host species. Results: Most tick species showed high structural and/or phylogenetic specificity in the adult stage. However, after correcting for sampling effort, we found little support for geographical specificity. Across the three scales, adult ticks tended to be specific to a limited number of host species that were phylogenetically closely related. These host species in turn, were parasitized by tick species from distinct genera, suggesting switching among distantly related hosts is common at evolutionary timescales. Further, there was a strong positive relationship between the taxonomic richness of the tick genera and that of their hosts, consistent with distinct tick species being relatively specific to different host species. Conclusions: Our results indicate that in the adult stage, most ticks in the diverse Neotropical community studied are host specialists. This contrasts with earlier assessments, but agrees with findings from other host-parasite systems. High host specificity in adult ticks implies high susceptibility to local tick-host co-extirpation, limited ability to colonize new habitats and limited potential for <b>interspecific</b> pathogen <b>transmission.</b> <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of a pathogen's host range is shaped by the ecology of its hosts and by the physiological traits that determine host specificity. For many pathogen traits, there is a trade-off: a phenotype suitable for infecting one set of hosts poorly infects another. Introducing and analysing a simple evo-epidemiological model, here we study how such a trade-off is expected to affect {{evolution of}} the host ranges of influenza viruses. We examine a quantitative trait underlying host specificity, given by an influenza virus's degree of adaptation to certain conformations of sialic acid receptors, and investigate how this receptor preference evolves in a minimal network of host species, including humans, that differ in life history and receptor physiology. Using adaptive dynamics theory, we establish thresholds in <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> rates and host population sizes that govern the emergence and persistence of human-adapted viruses.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{examined}} of two hosts sharing a directly transmitted pathogen where {{for the first}} time both hosts are also subject to self-regulation. The model provides insights into the manner in which self- and pathogen regulation combine in determining the coexistence or otherwise of hosts and the structure of biological communities generally. A number of outcomes are possible: coexistence of both hosts with the pathogen, coexistence of both hosts without the pathogen, the predictable elimination of one host by the other, which then remains with the pathogen, and the elimination of either host by the other, contingent on initial densities. However, whereas without self-regulation coexistence of both hosts with their shared pathogen can only be achieved by the partitioning of enemy-free space, with self-regulation there is a wider range of paths, including coexistence mediated by the hosts' resources (analogous to "exploiter-mediated coexistence"), coexistence mediated by <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission,</b> and coexistence arising when elements of these other mechanisms are combined. Also, a more affected, "regulated-alone" host can eliminate a less affected, "nonregulated-alone" host, but not vice versa; whereas without self-regulation only the opposite outcome is possible.

Here, we examine the distribution of a natural plant-to-plant nuclear transgene in relation to environmental variation within a wild population. Festuca ovina is polymorphic for an extra (second) expressed copy of the nuclear gene (PgiC) encoding cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase, with the extra PgiC locus having been acquired horizontally from the distantly related grass genus Poa. We investigated variation at PgiC in samples of F. ovina from a fine-scale, repeating patchwork of grassland microhabitats, replicated within spatially separated sites. Even after accounting for spatial effects, the distributions of F. ovina individuals carrying the additional PgiC locus, and one of the enzyme products encoded by the locus, are significantly associated with fine-scale habitat variation. Our results suggest that the PgiC transgene contributes, together with the unlinked 'native' PgiC locus, to local adaptation to a fine-scale mosaic of edaphic and biotic grassland microhabitats...|$|E
40|$|The {{amphibian}} disease chytridiomycosis, {{caused by}} the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has been implicated in mass mortalities, population declines and extinctions of amphibians around the world. In almost all cases, amphibian species that have disappeared or declined due to chytridiomycosis coexist with non-declining species. One reason why some species decline from chytridiomycosis and others do not may be interspecific differences in behaviour. Host behaviour could either facilitate or hinder pathogen transmission, and transmission rates {{in the field are}} likely to vary among species according the frequency of factors such as physical contact between frogs, contact with infected water and contact with environmental substrates containing B. dendrobatidis. We tracked 117 frogs (28 Litoria nannotis, 27 L. genimaculata and 62 L. lesueuri) at 5 sites where B. dendrobatidis is endemic in the rainforest of tropical northern Queensland and recorded the frequency of frog-to-frog contact and the frequency of contact with stream water and environmental substrates. Frequency of contact with other frogs and with water were highest in L. nannotis, intermediate in L. genimaculata and lowest in L. lesueueri. Environmental substrate use also differed among species. These species-specific opportunities for disease transmission were correlated with conservation status: L. nannotis is the species most susceptible to chytridiomycosis-related declines and L. lesueuri is the least susceptible. <b>Interspecific</b> variation in <b>transmission</b> probability may, therefore, play a large role in determining why chytridiomycosis drives some populations to extinction and not others...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Infectious {{diseases}} {{have contributed}} to the decline and local extinction of several wildlife species, including African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus). Mitigating such disease threats is challenging, partly because uncertainty about disease dynamics makes it difficult to identify the best management approaches. Serious impacts on susceptible populations most frequently occur when generalist pathogens are maintained within populations of abundant (often domestic) "reservoir" hosts, and spill over into less abundant host species. If this is the case, disease control directed at the reservoir host might be most appropriate. However, pathogen transmission within threatened host populations may also be important, and may not be controllable by managing another host species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated <b>interspecific</b> and intraspecific <b>transmission</b> routes, by comparing African wild dogs' exposure to six canine pathogens with behavioural measures of their opportunities for contact with domestic dogs and with other wild dogs. Domestic dog contact was associated with exposure to canine parvovirus, Ehrlichia canis, Neospora caninum and perhaps rabies virus, but not with exposure to canine distemper virus or canine coronavirus. Contact with other wild dogs appeared not to increase the risk of exposure to any of the pathogens. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings, combined with other data, suggest that management directed at domestic dogs might help to protect wild dog populations from rabies virus, but not from canine distemper virus. However, further analyses are needed to determine the management approaches [...] including no intervention [...] which are most appropriate for each pathogen...|$|R

The {{study of}} host {{aggregation}} is relevant {{in the study}} of the transmission of diseases in ungulates, both from epidemiological andmanagement perspectives. Ungulates in South Spain are frequently exposed to mycobacteria. Population demography and behavior, as well as environmental exposure may play an important role for intra- and inter-specific pathogen transmission. We hypothesized that Mycobacterium bovis infection prevalence in wild ungulates depends on host ecology and variations in prevalence will reflect variation in the interaction between hosts and environmental aggregation risk factors, namely water points during the dry season. We aimed to study the role of water sources (water holes and marsh-shrub ecotone) relative to natural resources and other hosts in ungulate distribution and environmental TB infection risk in Doñana National Park (DNP, South western Spain). For this purpose, and by using a novel approach (unmanned aerial systems), we mapped the spatial distribution and aggregation pattern of ungulates respect to potential environmental risk factors (environmental water sources) and the distribution of other hosts during the period of the year when water resources becomes more limiting, i. e., drought. Drought severely reduces foodavailability,and therefore aggregation around water resources is expected to be maximal This study revealed that spatial aggregation is significant risk factor for mycobacterial infection in wild ungulates, reflecting both <b>interspecific</b> and intraspecific <b>transmission.</b> Modeling revealed that environmental water sources could act not only as important environmental sources ofmycobacteria, but also by favoring closer contactbetween the species in DNP.

40|$|Bats are {{the natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{of a number}} of high-impact viral zoonoses. We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparisonwith rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, therewas evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats andmore viruses shared between bat species suggests that <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats hostmore zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs...|$|E

CLRV is a well-defined virus {{species of the}} genus Nepovirus, for which the entire genome sequence and molecular detection assays are available. CLRV is transmitted by vegetative multiplication of infected hosts and is also seed- and pollen-transmitted (both horizontally and vertically) in many of its hosts.

CLRV has a wide host range, which contains both woody and herbaceous hosts, {{many of which are}} largely present in natural environments.

CLRV can spread through efficient seed- and pollen-mediated transmission mechanisms and through the movement of vegetatively propagated plants for planting of numerous hosts. However, the existence of efficient and widely adopted certification systems for some of these hosts constitutes a limitation to CLRV spread.

We aimed simply to detect the presence of the parasites, encompassing vectoring as well as actual infections. Many pollinators of all types were positive for Ascosphaera fungi, while Microsporidia were rarer, being most frequently found in bumblebees. We also detected that most pollinators were positive for Wolbachia, most probably indicating infection with this intracellular symbiont, and raising the possibility that it may be an important factor in influencing host sex ratios or fitness in a diversity of pollinators. Importantly, we found that about a third of bumblebees (Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris) and a third of wasps (Vespula vulgaris), as well as all honey bees, were positive for deformed wing virus, but that this virus was not present in other pollinators. Deformed wing virus therefore does not appear to be a general parasite of pollinators, but does interact significantly with at least three species of bumblebee and wasp.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} fitness of a prey {{is directly}} affected by its ability to detect and avoid predators. However, predator avoidance is costly as it reduces the time and energy available for other fitness related activities. Prey must therefore continually modify and update their behaviour towards predators {{through the process of}} learning. As a variety of information sources are available to individuals at any one time, knowledge on how animals make decisions is essential for our understanding of animal behaviour. Often an individual's decisions are affected by the presence of others. This thesis investigates the importance of social interactions to the assessment of predation risk, using coral reef fish as model organisms. Ignoring accurate information on predation risk could lead to death; therefore prey individuals are likely to have evolved the ability to incorporate multiple sources of information, extract important components and respond accordingly. Chapter 2 explored how juvenile reef fish incorporate multiple sources of information to mediate their risk response and how information sources are prioritised. Naïve anemonefish (Amphiprion percula) were exposed to damage-released chemical cues of conspecifics and closely related congenerics (Amphiprion melanopus), along with additional control cues in the presence and absence of a shoal (conspecifics, congenerics or no shoal). A. percula responded with anti-predator behaviour to the chemical cues from both conspecifics and congenerics, with visual cues dramatically influencing the response elicited. These findings emphasise the ability of coral reef fish to incorporate multiple sources of information into their decision making process, allowing individuals to reduce any uncertainty. Information can be gained through the process of social learning, where less experienced individuals learn from observing and/or interacting with experienced group members. Chapter 3 examined the role of social learning in predator recognition in relation to the survival of newly settled juvenile reef fish. Naïve damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi) were tested for their ability to socially transmit the recognition of a predator odour to conspecifics. Along with this, the study also determined whether there was a difference in the rate of survival between individuals that directly learnt the predator odour and those who acquired the information through social learning. Results showed that P. wardi are capable of using social learning to transmit information, with the survival outcome not significantly different from those who directly experienced predator conditioning. As such, this study demonstrates that experience plays a vital role in the outcome of predator-prey interactions, with social learning improving the ability of prey to avoid and/or escape predation. In a natural setting social learning is likely to occur between more than 2 individuals, as such investigating the effect that group size has on the learning process is vital. Chapter 4 determined the effect of group size on the ability of the damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis to socially learn to recognise an unknown predator. Specifically, individuals were tested to see if social learning occurred when the number of less experienced individuals (observers) was increased from 1 to 5, and if the intensity of the anti-predator response differed {{depending on the size of}} the group. Regardless of group size, P. amboinensis individuals were capable of socially transmitting the recognition of an unknown predator to conspecifics, with the intensity of the response not significantly different between predator-naïve observers who learnt when they were alone compared to when they were one of five observers. Social learning is therefore an important method of acquiring information about predators in aquatic ecosystems, ensuring that the value of the information is transferred in its entirety. Along with intraspecific social learning (transmission of information between conspecifics), <b>interspecific</b> social learning (<b>transmission</b> of information between species) is likely to be commonplace in biologically complex environments such as coral reefs. Therefore, Chapter 5 tested if social learning of predator recognition occurs among three species of coral reef fishes. Individuals of both Pomacentrus moluccensis and Apogon trimaculatus were tested for their ability to socially learn from P. wardi. Based on a single conditioning event, individuals of both species were able to learn a predator's identity from experienced P. wardi individuals. This ability to utilise social information from heterospecifics is likely to confer a significant survival advantage, especially for coral reef fishes as they are faced with constant and unpredictable predation pressures. Predation pressure is highest during critical life history transitions where the suite of predators one encounters is both diverse and variable. For coral reef fishes, one of the most significant transitions occurs following a planktonic larval stage; settlement into a benthic life. As this stage occurs at night, Chapter 6 explored whether social learning of predator recognition can occur in total darkness. Results demonstrated that predator-naïve anemonefish, A. percula, are capable of socially learning to recognise a novel predator when paired with a predator-experienced conspecific under both light and dark conditions. These results show that visual cues are unlikely to be the sole sensory system responsible, therefore, the study also tested whether when threatened individuals release chemical cues known as disturbance cues into the water. A. percula did release disturbance cues following exposure to predator odour; however these cues did not facilitate learnt recognition. It is likely that another sensory modality, possibly mechano-sensory in origin, is responsible for information transfer in the dark, with this study highlighting the diversity of sensory cues available to coral reef fishes. This thesis demonstrates the use of social learning as an anti-predator mechanism, highlighting the importance of olfactory cues for predator recognition in biologically complex ecosystems. Obtaining accurate information on local predator identities is essential to the decision process of individuals, with the choices made ultimately determining the outcome of predator-prey interactions. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the speed with which information can spread through a local prey population without a dilution of importance; highlighting the role of social interactions in the cognitive processes of coral reef fishes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sarcoptic mange, a {{parasitic}} disease {{caused by the}} mite Sarcoptes scabiei, is regularly reported on wolves Canis lupus in Scandinavia. We describe the distribution and transmission of this parasite within the small but recovering wolf population by analysing 269 necropsy reports and performing a serological survey on 198 serum samples collected from free-ranging wolves between 1998 and 2013. Results: The serological survey among 145 individual captured Scandinavian wolves (53 recaptures) shows a consistent presence of antibodies against sarcoptic mange. Seropositivity among all captured wolves was 10. 1 % (CI. 6. 4 % – 15. 1 %). Sarcoptic mange-related mortality reported at necropsy was 5. 6 % and due to secondary causes, predominantly starvation. In the southern range of the population, seroprevalence was higher, consistent with higher red fox densities. Female wolves had a lower probability of being seropositive than males, but for both sexes the probability increased with pack size. Recaptured individuals changing from seropositive to seronegative suggest recovery from sarcoptic mange. The lack of seropositive pups (8 – 10 months, N = 56) and the occurrence of seropositive and seronegative individuals in the same pack indicates <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> of S. scabiei into this wolf population. Conclusions: We consider sarcoptic mange to have {{little effect on the}} recovery of the Scandinavian wolf population. Heterogenic infection patterns on the pack level in combination with the importance of individual- based factors (sex, pack size) and the north – south gradient for seroprevalence suggests low probability of wolf-to-wolf transmission of S. scabiei in Scandinavia...|$|E
40|$|Background: Arthropods are {{infected}} {{by a wide}} diversity of maternally transmitted microbes. Some of these manipulate host reproduction to facilitate population invasion and persistence. Such parasites transmit vertically on an ecological timescale, but rare horizontal transmission events have permitted colonisation of new species. Here we report the first systematic investigation into {{the influence of the}} phylogenetic distance between arthropod species on the potential for reproductive parasite interspecific transfer. Results: We employed a well characterised reproductive parasite, a coccinellid beetle male-killer, and artificially injected the bacterium into a series of novel species. Genetic distances between native and novel hosts were ascertained by sequencing sections of the 16 S and 12 S mitochondrial rDNA genes. The bacterium colonised host tissues and transmitted vertically in all cases tested. However, whilst transmission efficiency was perfect within the native genus, this was reduced following some transfers of greater phylogenetic distance. The bacterium's ability to distort offspring sex ratios in novel hosts was negatively correlated with the genetic distance of transfers. Male-killing occurred with full penetrance following within-genus transfers; but whilst sex ratio distortion generally occurred, it was incomplete in more distantly related species. Conclusion: This study indicates that the natural <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> of reproductive parasites might be constrained by their ability to tolerate the physiology or genetics of novel hosts. Our data suggest that horizontal transfers are more likely between closely related species. Successful bacterial transfer across large phylogenetic distances may require rapid adaptive evolution in the new species. This finding has applied relevance regarding selection of suitable bacteria to manipulate insect pest and vector populations by symbiont gene-drive systems...|$|E

Cully, Jr. Black-tailed {{prairie dogs}} (Cynomys ludovicianus) are {{epizootic}} hosts for plague (Yersinia pestis); however, alternate enzootic hosts {{are important for}} the maintenance of the pathogen. We determined small rodents and prairie dog associations and quantified rodent and flea relationships in the presence and absence of prairie dog colonies and plague. We identified potential alternate hosts and flea vectors for the maintenance and transmission of plague in the prairie ecosystem. This is the first multi-year study to investigate associations between prairie dogs, rodents and fleas across the range of the black-tailed prairie dog. Few rodent species associated with black-tailed prairie dogs and were found to be highly abundant on colonies. Rodent species implicated in plague were present at study areas with and without plague. Peromyscus maniculatus and Onychomus leucogaster, two widely occurring species, were more abundant in areas with a recent history of plague. Flea community characteristics varied within each study area in the presence and absence of prairie dogs. Based on flea diversity on rodents, and the role of rodents and fleas in plague, we identified P. maniculatus and O. leucogaster and their associated fleas, Aetheca wagneri, Malareus telchinus, Orchopeas leucopus, Peromyscopsylla hesperomys, and Pleochaetis exilis to be important for the dynamics of sylvatic plague in our study areas. Peromyscus maniculatus and O. leucogaster were consistently infected with Bartonella spp., another blood parasite. Presence of prairie dog fleas on other rodents at both off and on prairie dog colonies suggests the potential for intra and <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> of fleas between rodent hosts, and between other small rodents and prairie dogs...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{urbanisation}} {{is often}} cited {{as a cause of}} declining biodiversity, but for bumblebees there is evidence that urban populations of some species such as Bombus terrestris L. may be more dense than those found in agricultural landscapes, perhaps because gardens provide plentiful floral resources and nesting opportunities. Here we examine the influence of urbanisation on the prevalence of the main protozoan parasites of bumblebees in west central Scotland. We would expect transmission rates and prevalence of parasites to be higher in high density host populations, all else being equal. Workers of two bee species, B. terrestris and B. pascuorum, were sampled over a 45 -day period in mid to late summer, and parasites were detected in faeces and via dissection. A comparison of the two methods suggests that faecal sampling is considerably less sensitive than dissection, failing to detect infection in 27. 8 %, 55. 1 %, and 80 % of cases of infection with the parasites Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, and Apicystis bombi, respectively. For all three parasites, broad patterns of prevalence were similar, with prevalence tending to increase with urbanisation in B. terrestris but not in B. pascuorum. The different patterns of seasonal prevalence in the two bee species suggest that intraspecific transmission is more important that <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission.</b> Our observation of greater parasite prevalence among B. terrestris in urban compared with rural areas suggests that urban habitats may present greater opportunities for parasite transmission. Greater bee densities in urban areas may be the driving factor; however, further study is still needed. For example, differences in disease prevalence between habitats could be driven by differences in the types and abundance of flowers that are available, or in exposure to environmental stressors. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|Hepatitis E is an {{infectious}} viral disease with clinical and morphological features of acute hepatitis. The aetiological agent is the Hepatitis E virus (HEV). The disease represents an important Public Health problem {{in developing countries}} where is frequently epidemic and primarily transmitted by fecal-oral route. In the last few years, {{a certain number of}} sporadic cases have been also described in industrialized countries, Italy included. A swine HEV was first identified in 1997 and is now considered an ubiquitous virus. Human and swine strains from the same geographical region have shown to have a high level of nucleotidic omology and in experimental infections, the possibility of <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> of swine strains to humans and of human strains to non-human primates has been demonstrated. Furthermore, some seroepidemiological studies have demonstrated that people working in contact with swine have a higher risk to get infected than normal blood donors. Recently, cases of HEV hepatitis have been directly associated to the ingestion of uncooked tissues from pigs, wild boar or deer and today the disease is considered an emerging zoonosis. The aims of this thesis were: evaluate HEV prevalence in Italian swine herds (both in fattening and in breeding animals); investigate the possibility of finding HEV in livers used for human consumption; investigate if there is any correlation between HEV infection and the presence of macroscopical lesions; investigate HEV prevalence in a demographic managed wild boar population; phylogenetically analyse viral strains identified. During an internship period at Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge, UK), furthermore, swine samples at different stages of production and slurry lagoons have been analysed.

40|$|Host-pathogen interactions, {{especially}} those involving RNA viruses and bacteria, are often {{characterized by a}} convergence of ecological and evolutionary time scales. This work explores how such convergence affects the diversity of a fast-evolving RNA virus, influenza, in different host populations. The first study evaluates molecular evidence for a theory of H 3 N 2 dynamics in humans. There is support for episodically strong, continuous positive selection on the hemagglutinin protein, and previously described punctuated changes in antigenicity are not driven {{by the addition of}} glycosylation sites. The neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix 2 proteins also show evidence of positive selection. The second study analyzes time series of serologically confirmed cases of H 3 N 2, H 1 N 1, and influenza B in patients in present-day St. Petersburg, Russia, from 1969 to 1991 to determine whether there is cross-immunity between heterologous strains. Results suggest a role for cross-immunity, but further investigation is necessary. Differences in intrinsic growth rates and rates of antigenic evolution might explain age-related patterns in incidence by virus type and subtype. The third study investigates the effects of heterogeneity in hosts’ immune responses on the outcome of strain competition. When immunodominance is skewed toward a single epitope, coexistence inevitably results. When multiple epitopes can be immunodominant, coexistence, limit cycling, chaotic dynamics, and competitive exclusion can occur. Increasing the diversity and breadth of host responses increases the range of cyclic, chaotic, and exclusive dynamics. The last study considers how host ecology affects the long term evolution of influenza’s host range, assuming a tradeoff in the virus’s preference for certain forms of host sialic acid receptor. A common outcome is the coexistence of specialists, and this outcome is more sensitive to <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> rates and host population densities than the strength of the tradeoff. Finally, I map three areas of future inquiry: the ability of spatial dynamics and constant antigenic evolution alone to restrict influenza virus diversity, implications of antibody affinity versus neutralization ability for vaccine development, and long-term strategies to manage influenza virus evolution. These studies show that a phylodynamic perspective will be invaluable in developing better predictive models of influenza...|$|E
40|$|Heritable {{bacterial}} endosymbionts are {{a diverse}} group of microbes, widespread across insect taxa. They have evolved numerous phenotypes that promote their own persistence through host generations, ranging from beneficial mutualisms to manipulations of their host’s reproduction. These phenotypes are often highly diverse within closely related groups of symbionts and can have profound effects upon their host’s biology. However, the impact of their phenotype on host populations is dependent upon their prevalence, a trait that is highly variable between symbiont strains and the causative factors of which remain enigmatic. In this thesis I address the factors affecting spread and persistence of the male-killing endosymbiont Arsenophonus nasoniae in populations of its host Nasonia vitripennis. I present a model of A. nasoniae dynamics in which I incorporate the capacity to infectiously transmit as well as direct costs of infection – factors often ignored in treaties on symbiont dynamics. I show that infectious transmission may {{play a vital role in}} the epidemiology of otherwise heritable microbes and allows costly symbionts to invade host populations. I then support these conclusions empirically by showing that: a) A. nasoniae exerts a tangible cost to female N. vitripennis it infects, b) it only invades, spreads and persists in populations that allow for both infectious and heritable transmission. I also show that, when allowed to reach high prevalence, male-killers can have terminal effects upon their host population. Secondly, I examine the phenotypic and genetic differences of a novel strain of Arsenophonus that has recently diverged from the male-killer following a host-shift event. I show that <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission</b> can lead to rapid changes in symbiont biology, shifting away from reproductive parasitism and reliance upon mixed transmission towards mutualism, pure heritability and host-specialisation. I also show that these transitions are underpinned by specific genomic diversification. These findings have important implications for the way in which we view symbiont dynamics in nature and predict their outcome in terms of virulence and phenotype evolution. Further, it highlights the rapid directed selection pressures that symbionts are regularly exposed to following a host-shift and how this may be responsible for the diversity seen in nature...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about making {{inference}} on the host status of feral ferrets in New Zealand for Mycobacterium bovis, the aetiological agent of bovine tuberculosis. The central question addressed {{is whether the}} rate of intra-specific transmission of M. bovis among ferrets is sufficient for the disease to persist in ferret populations {{in the absence of}} external, non-ferret sources of infection (inter-specific transmission). The question is tackled in three parts-firstly using model selection to identify suitable models for estimating the force of M. bovis infection in ferret populations; secondly applying statistical hypothesis testing to the results of planned manipulative field experiments to test the relationship between M. bovis infection in brushtail possums and that in ferrets; and thirdly using modelling to estimate intra-specific disease transmission rates and the basic reproductive rate (Ro) of M. bovis infection in ferrets. The model selection approach clearly identified the hypothesis of oral infection related to diet was, as modelled by a constant force of infection from the age of weaning, the best approximation of how M. bovis infection was transmitted to ferrets. No other form of transmission (e. g., during fighting, mating, or routine social interaction) was supported in comparison. The force of infection () ranged from 0. 14 yr- 1 to 5. 77 yr- 1, and was significantly higher (2. 2 times) in male than female ferrets. Statistical hypothesis testing revealed transmission of M. bovis to ferrets occurred from both brushtail possums and ferrets. The force of M. bovis infection in ferrets was reduced by 88 % (= 0. 3 yr- 1 vs. = 2. 5 yr- 1) at sites with reductions in the population density of sympatric brushtail possum populations. A smaller decline in the force of infection resulting from the lethal cross-sectional sampling of the ferret populations was also demonstrated. The modelling approach estimated the basic reproductive rate (Ro) of M. bovis infection in ferrets in New Zealand to vary from 0. 17 at the lowest population density (0. 5 km- 2) recorded to 1. 6 at the highest population density (3. 4 km- 2) recorded. The estimates of Ro were moderately imprecise, with a coefficient of variation of 76 %. Despite this imprecision, the Ro for M. bovis infection in ferrets was significantly less than unity for all North Island sites surveyed. Hence it is inferred ferrets are spillover hosts (0 Kt), the rate of intra-specific transmission of M. bovis among ferrets is sufficient for the disease to establish in ferrets in the absence of <b>interspecific</b> <b>transmission.</b> In these areas, ferrets would be considered maintenance hosts for the disease. Active management (e. g., density reduction or vaccination) of ferrets would be required to eradicate M. bovis from ferret populations in these areas, in addition to the elimination of sources of inter-specific transmission, particularly brushtail possums...|$|E
