2500|$|Mrs. Shouse bought Wolf Trap {{to offer}} her {{children}} a weekend retreat {{from their home in}} Georgetown, Washington DC. There they grew corn, wheat, alfalfa, and oats to feed their chickens, ducks, turkeys, and milk cows. They bred horses, built a stable and a hay barn, and opened a <b>dog-breeding</b> kennel, producing champion boxers, miniature pinschers, and Weimaraners. [...] During this time, Shouse and her husband, Jouett Shouse, would frequently host large social gatherings for friends, family, and prominent public figures, including World War II Generals Omar Bradley and George C. Marshall and several members of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944.|$|E
5000|$|The {{portrayal}} of dragon-breeders (such as Lady Sybil Ramkin) {{in the books}} is a parody of [...] "horsey" [...] upper-class people, although there are also similarities to pedigree <b>dog-breeding</b> (in particular, the Ankh-Morpork Cavern Club is a parody of Kennel clubs.) However, {{due to the nature}} of the creatures, a dragon house is typically constructed as one would an ammunition dump.|$|E
50|$|During the 1920s Dawson {{continued}} to write novels including Peter of Monkslease, His Mortal Tenement and The Emergence of Marie, {{as well as}} the centenary celebration book about the Royal National Life-Boat Institution Britain's Life-Boats. It was during the 1920s and 1930s that his interest in <b>dog-breeding,</b> as well as his participation as both a judge and competitive entrant in dog-shows, is very apparent. He may be glimpsed on film in 1933 in two surviving items from his series 'Our Dogs' in the Pathé News archive, where he is described as Kennel Expert to the Daily Herald.|$|E

50|$|On November 21, 1947, Katharine Winthrop married Quincy Adams Shawn Mckean (November 1, 1891 - August 1971), a polo-playing, <b>dog-breeding</b> Boston aristocrat {{and owner}} of an estate called Prides. They met at a {{cocktail}} party while Mckean was still married to his first wife. In 1920 Shawn Mckean bought the Samuel Corning House in Beverly, Massachusetts, and made it a part of Prides, a Colonial Revival complex {{he and his wife had}} built on their 54-acre (22 ha) estate. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Shawn Mckean's first wife was painter Margarett Sargent (1892-1978).|$|E
5000|$|Each episode {{follows the}} guys trying {{different}} scams to earn money. These schemes vary from nobbling pigeon-racing to <b>dog-breeding,</b> and always with something funny {{happening to the}} group. They are joined by other various characters, including [...] "Hoker," [...] an anti-social element who can get anything from stolen cars to lost dogs for the crowd. Wardrobe doesn't like this guy, but Hoker {{is a friend of}} Shay's, and he's useful now and again. Crazy Horse is the local wino, he's always drunk and sitting outside the butcher's shop, and finally, Tiny Tim, who owns a pet salon, who the guys help out now and again.|$|E
50|$|In August 2008, BBC1 {{televised}} {{a documentary}} film titled Pedigree Dogs Exposed, which investigated {{the subject of}} health issues affecting pedigree dogs in the United Kingdom, with a particular emphasis on dogs bred for showing. The programme provoked an unprecedented response from {{both the public and}} the <b>dog-breeding</b> community, with widespread criticism directed at the Kennel Club. Since the broadcast, the BBC has withdrawn its television coverage of Crufts dog show in 2009, with other sponsors and partners also withdrawing their support, including Pedigree Petfoods, the RSPCA, PDSA and the Dog's Trust. In response to the programme, the Kennel Club in the UK announced a review of all breed standards, with the long-term goal being to eradicate hereditary health concerns. Most notably, they will impose a ban on breeding between dogs that are closely related and will impose greater monitoring to prevent unhealthy dogs from being entered for and winning awards at dog shows.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{technique}} of proven efficiency no Toxocara canis eggs were {{recovered from a}} total of 266 sand samples collected from “dog beaches” and parks in the Perth urban area. This observation emphasises that the major risk to humans is from {{an environment in which}} puppies are found. Other observations, made at a heavily contaminated site, showed that the eggs of T. canis disappeared from sandy soil over about 6 months during a period in which it would have been expected that conditions were favourable for egg survival. Other data are also presented indicating that the prevalence of T. canis in adult dogs in Perth is quite low. However, T. canis eggs were recovered in large numbers from the majority of soil samples collected from Perth <b>dog-breeding</b> establishments...|$|E
40|$|Parvoviral {{infections are}} a big medical and {{economic}} problem, in particular in large <b>dog-breeding</b> facilities. Having in mind {{the manner in which}} this infection is spread (fecal-oral pathways), and the strong resistence of parvoviruses to the outer environment, general and immunoprophylaxis have {{a significant role in the}} control of this dangerous disease. This work examines the humoral immunological response of pregnant bitches, vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine against parvoviral infection in dogs. An experiment was performed on 10 pregnant bitches which were vaccinated on the 42 nd day of gravidity with an inactivated vaccine, and an IHA test proved the lowest titer of antibodies was 1 : 1280, and the highest 1 : 20480. The titer of pregnant bitches before vaccination ranged from 1 : 80 to 1 : 320. These investigations indicate that puppies of vaccinated bitches receive the corresponding level of immunoglobulin through colostrum, and are protected from parvoviral infection in the first 6 - 7 weeks of life...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop a “narrative ethology,” a theory that {{accounts}} for transformations of images of animals into animal subjectivities in modern and contemporary narratives. The project proceeds from an overlooked connection: animals in twentieth-century narratives have changed from naturalistic emblems to nonhuman agents. How do these shifting images of the animal intersect with the changing narratives of social agency? By connecting the development of ethology, the scientific study of animal behavior, with the widespread circulation of photographic technologies, the present study argues that animal images are central to the production of narratives of animals as historical subjects, as both capable of expression and capable of being understood by humans. Through this textual transformation, animal narratives frame questions of agency more broadly in terms of social groups, rather than individuals, offering crucial sites for investigating how human anxieties about species boundaries rest within larger questions of representation. Tracing the interdisciplinary implications of recent literary, scientific, and cultural critiques of the subject, chapters focus on the development of a narrative ethology by exploring a variety of topics, genres, and texts—gendered and nationalized intimacy in girl-horse romances, racial marking and animal masking in ape-man stories, interspecific (between species) imaging and replication in <b>dog-breeding</b> tales, and technologies of the collective subject in barnyard fables. ...|$|E
40|$|Familial subvalvular aortic {{stenosis}} (SAS) {{is one of}} the most common congenital heart defects in dogs and is an inherited defect of Newfoundlands, golden retrievers and human children. Although SAS is known to be inherited, specific genes involved in Newfoundlands with SAS have not been defined. We hypothesized that SAS in Newfoundlands is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and caused by a single genetic variant. We studied 93 prospectively recruited Newfoundland dogs, and 180 control dogs of 30 breeds. By providing cardiac screening evaluations for Newfoundlands we conducted a pedigree evaluation, genome-wide association study and RNA sequence analysis to identify a proposed pattern of inheritance and genetic loci associated with the development of SAS. We identified a three-nucleotide exonic insertion in phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) that is associated with the development of SAS in Newfoundlands. Pedigree evaluation best supported an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and provided evidence that equivocally affected individuals may pass on SAS in their progeny. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of PICALM in the canine myocardium and area of the subvalvular ridge. Additionally, small molecule inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulted in developmental abnormalities within the outflow tract (OFT) of Xenopus laevis embryos. The ability to test for presence of this PICALM insertion may impact <b>dog-breeding</b> decisions and facilitate reduction of SAS disease prevalence in Newfoundland dogs. Understanding the role of PICALM in OFT development may aid in future molecular and genetic investigations into other congenital heart defects of various species...|$|E
