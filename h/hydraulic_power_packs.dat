50|$|The A380's 350 bar (35 MPa or 5,000 psi) {{hydraulic}} {{system is a}} significant difference from the typical 210 bar (21 MPa or 3,000 psi) hydraulics used on most commercial aircraft since the 1940s. First used in military aircraft, high-pressure hydraulics reduce the weight and size of pipelines, actuators and related components. The 350 bar pressure is generated by eight de-clutchable hydraulic pumps. The hydraulic lines are typically made from titanium; the system features both fuel- and air-cooled heat exchangers. Self-contained electrically powered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>packs</b> serve as backups for the primary systems, instead of a secondary {{hydraulic system}}, saving weight and reducing maintenance.|$|E
50|$|A Spring Starter uses {{potential}} energy {{stored in a}} spring {{wound up with a}} crank to start an engine without a battery or alternator. Turning the crank moves the pinion into mesh with the engine’s ring gear, then winds up the spring. Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine. The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation. Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance. This is achieved by operating the trip lever just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel. Subsequent turning of the winding handle during this operation will not load the starter. Spring starters can be found in engine-generators, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>packs,</b> and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The water {{hydraulic}} reciprocating {{plunger pump}} driven by linear motor is suitable to deep sea application with high efficiency and variable control. Aiming {{to study the}} principle structure and working characteristics of the pump, two patterns of valve and piston distribution were designed. And the control method and the performance were analyzed by simulation based on the AMESim model. The {{results show that the}} pressure and flow pulsation of piston type pump are much smaller than the valve type, even though the piston type is large in scale and works at low flow rate. Compared with a valve distribution tri-linear-motor reciprocating plunger pump(VDTLMP), as the flow rate of the piston distribution double linear motor reciprocating plunger pump(PDDLMP) is decreased from 36. 7 L/min to 21. 2 L/min theoretically, the pressure pulsation amplitude is decreased from 46 % to 2 %, and the flow pulsation rate is also decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 007.

40|$|Air-driven {{hydraulic}} pumps {{are widely used}} to pump highpressure oil for small hydraulic systems, where it is uneconomic {{to set up a}} conventional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>pack.</b> To obtain good performance of a small hydraulic system, input air flow and output oil flow characteristics of the air-driven hydraulic pump should be properly understood. In this paper, based on a mathematical model which has been experimentally verified, the model of an air-driven hydraulic pump is proposed. Using the software MATLAB/Simulink for simulation, the dynamic characteristics of the pumps are obtained. To set a foundation for the optimization of the pump, the influence of key parameters on the output characteristics of the pump was studied. Through analysis, it can be obtained that, firstly, with an increase in the input air pressure, output oil pressure and area ratio, the ratio of output to input volume flow rate decrease approximately linearly. Moreover, when the output oil pressure was fixed, an energy-saving method to enhance the output oil flow is to enlarge the area ratio of the pump. Furthermore, the output oil flow can be increased rapidly through increasing the input air pressure, but that may result in an increase in compressed air consumption. This research is of use in the performance and design optimization of air-driven {{hydraulic pumps}}...|$|R
50|$|Standing Stem Harvesting, a {{selective}} harvesting method within Heli-Logging, {{was invented by}} Philip Jarman of Port Alberni, British Columbia between May and October 1997. The initial harvesting equipment used wire rope or chokers to rig the stem and a modified external hook to engage the choker and lift the stem clear of the stump. In this way, the process of harvesting, which includes climbing, measuring, cutting, rigging, and lifting was pioneered by a single pilot flying a light utility helicopter. In 1998, the inventor supervised the building of an experimental grapple {{which was to be}} operated by a K-Max Lift Truck helicopter. However, because the K-Max had no hydraulics, it was necessary to design and install an externally mounted, jettisonable sled carrying a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>pack,</b> to operate the grapple.Initial flight trials were carried out using the external hook and wire rope configuration on the 25th of April 1998. In late October 1998, a successful full-scale harvesting trial using a grapple designed by the inventor and funded by the timber licensee was carried out at Lunchtime Lake on Vancouver Island. Press releases and logging industry recognition followed. Patent applications in the United States and Canada were submitted and granted in 2001 and 2002 respectively.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the results obtained}} {{by a series of}} tests carried out on an hydraulic actuator for a ship roll stabilizing system, suitable to be fitted on medium size pleasure crafts. These systems are constituted by 2 or 4 fins fitted on hull sides, in a proper position; the hydrodynamic forces, generated by interacting with the water flow due to ship speed, can be controlled to obtain a momentum that counteract the wave action. So reducing the effects of roll motion on people onboard and on ship structures. A full scale fin hydraulic actuator has been installed in our hydraulic test bench where an <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> and some <b>hydraulic</b> valves group allow to performs various tests. Reproducing the dynamic behaviour of the fin actuator system it is possible to evaluate the influence of some hydraulic component (i. e. a proportional valve) on the system performance and the feasibility of the adoption of less expensive components. Moreover an hydraulic accumulator has been added to the plant in order to improve the fin actuation speed and to reduce the pressure spikes in order to reduce hydraulic noise. In fact noise reduction represents a very important aspect onboard pleasure boats, where every effort is made to assure a high comfort level to passengers; in particular, noise is important when the boat is anchored and the fins work; in that condition the propulsion engines are stopped, the gensets are generally well insulated, and the hydrodynamic noise is absent because the speed is zero, so the stabilizing plant {{is one of the main}} noise source onboard, with the air conditioning plant of course...|$|R

Trunk shaking is not an adequate option {{due to lack of}} space and intense strain in labour and machinery. Continuous canopy shaking is the obvious approach, not only increasing working capacity but also overcoming the problem of scarce and expensive labour. Continuous canopy shaking harvesting equipment available today are adapted over-the-row grape or coffee-beans harvesters. Recently purposely built, rotor type, large over-the-row olive harvesters, mainly of South American and Australian design, are too heavy and expensive, hardly suitable to the difficult wet soil conditions encountered in the Mediterranean countries. Tree growth is a limitation for the over-the-row concept. These harvesters may be used for a considerable number of harvest campaigns in groves of the limited growth Arbequina cultivar, but only up to the third production year in groves based on normal growth local cultivars. Tree growth limitation can only be adequately dealt with the side-row concept. Furthermore the side-row concept tends to be simpler and less expensive, meaning lower running costs. In 2009, the SIDE-ROW CONTINUOS CANOPY SHAKING FRUIT HARVESTER project was set to develop such technology. This paper describes a prototype and gives an account of the different stages of its development. The equipment comprises two symmetrical harvesters that follow a tree row one at each side.

The row side of the harvester is bordered along the edge by flexible synthetic interface with the tree trunk. After two harvesting campaigns the basic concept is now set.
