500|$|Kristine Sutherland {{appears as}} Joyce Summers, Buffy's mother. Whedon enjoyed {{that she got}} [...] "to play just {{completely}} sexy , because when you play the mom on a show you're sort of relegated to momhood, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to see that side of her." ...|$|E
500|$|Guest star Ed Lauter had {{previously}} {{worked with the}} episode's director, William A. Graham, on the film [...] On {{his role in the}} episode, Lauter has stated [...] "I don’t really have {{a lot to say about}} that, except I thought I did a nice job, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> working up there in Vancouver with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson".|$|E

500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post {{praised the}} scene in which Yang broke down to Meredith, noting the {{exceptional}} chemistry between them. Pascua was positive of the storyline between Torres, Carlos, and Robbins, writing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to see {{an emphasis on the}} gay storyline. Adam Bryant of TV Guide wrote that Baker's character [...] "seems like the only decent guy in the bunch", though PopSugar asserted that Williams' character [...] "proves to be most likable of the new doctors".|$|E
500|$|Compared to [...] "Colonel Homer", Lurleen's {{comeback}} episode [...] "Papa Don't Leech" [...] received rather negative {{reviews from}} television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad expressed dislike for the episode, stating {{that he hopes}} the show will reconsider {{the next time they}} decide to give a [...] "solo opportunity" [...] to a one-off character [...] "many people don't remember". Robert Canning of IGN said, [...] "there were too few laugh-out-loud moments in this lackluster episode. Overall, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to see Lurleen again, but she'd probably get more laughs in future cameos than in carrying an entire episode." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came up to me and said 'I should have capped you'. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one." ...|$|E

500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you know how I feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E
500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to {{get that kind of}} space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E
500|$|The album's title {{comes from}} a lyric on the album's final song, [...] "Home". Grohl stated that as he {{struggled}} to think of a title given the musical variety of the album, even considering the title [...] "The One With That Song On It", he looked at the song lyrics and after reading the ones from [...] "Home" [...] Grohl [...] "thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> because it's open to interpretation and it's a beautiful title and I think the album is beautiful in its diversity and its melody and its musicality – it goes from delicate acoustic moments to the heaviest shit we’ve ever done." ...|$|E

500|$|Several film reviewers drew precise {{parallels}} between the film and certain superhero comic books, like Powers, Watchmen, Fantastic Four, and The Avengers. Indeed, the producers of the 2005 adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles. Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being [...] "the most well-trod turf on the planet," [...] but noted {{that he had not}} been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of Watchmen. He did comment that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to be compared to it, since [...] "if you're going to be compared to something, it's nice if it's something good".|$|E
500|$|... "Jon Bernthal is a {{tremendous}} talent and he’s {{got a lot of}} professionalism. A lot of the actors came in to the room as we were starting this season and Bernthal was one of those actors. He was aware {{of a lot of the}} things that were coming up and we talked to him about his character and what we had planned for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff were}} {{concerned}} over the animation of the characters' {{eyes in the}} episode, as the pupils were larger than normal, making the characters look [...] "stoned", and the eyeballs were [...] "too round" [...] and large. The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea, {{where much of the}} animation process takes place, had begun stenciling the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in [...] "strangely round eyes which look a little too big sometimes and much too perfect. Which is very un-Simpsons like." [...] Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger. Lynch thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to see Marge in a [...] "younger, more attractive mode, and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy." ...|$|E

500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick. Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role".|$|E
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought {{it sounded like}} a title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] because he liked [...] "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] give us any time, they would see that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E
500|$|Instead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive {{producer}} David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet {{because he}} was [...] "such a good sport" [...] and had [...] "a great sense of humor". Oakley thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> that Goulet was willing {{to make fun of}} himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on The Simpsons. This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. The Simpsons production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was [...] "bound to happen" [...] sooner or later. The Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as [...] "Senator" [...] by Homer.|$|E

500|$|After meeting Brian, they recruit {{him to be}} a contestant. He signs up for {{the free}} martinis and food, but ends up falling in love with the reality starlet, Brooke Roberts. Quagmire and Brian are the final two contestants on The Bachelorette. Brooke's visits to the Griffin house is catastrophic, but not nearly as bad as the dinner she had with Quagmire and his mom. Brian wins her heart and the final rose, but when the cameras are turned off, Brooke tells Brian that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> [...] "working with him", and it is {{apparent}} that the show really is scripted, as Brian thought. Brian quickly becomes obsessed with Brooke and leaves several messages on her answering machine, even though she never gets back to him. Brooke gets angry at Brian for stalking her and throws her telephone at him when he attempts to serenade her outside her apartment. Brian is upset that he became the very thing he was mocking in the beginning.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Cindy White {{praised the}} writing for Deangelo's character saying that [...] "Ferrell {{is much better}} carrying the show on his own than being second banana to Carell. It seemed like he was having more fun with the role in this episode". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. New Yorks Phoebe Reilly wrote that [...] "while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> to see the staff responding to someone new, it didn't feel like enough to make an audience antsy to come back after a long summer." [...] Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly also gave the episode a mediocre review commenting that [...] "judging by tonight's episode alone, {{the transition from the}} Carell era to the post-Carell era is going to be shaky, to say the least". [...] "The Inner Circle" [...] was voted the fourth lowest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally. In another poll, the episode was voted the third lowest-rated episode out of 24 episode out of 24 from the seventh season and was rated 6.86 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E
