40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if a reduction in proton radiation dose from the standard dose of 70 <b>cobalt</b> <b>gray</b> equivalents (CGE) to 50 CGE would decrease radiation-induced complications, thereby improving visual prognosis, without compromising local tumor control for patients with uveal melanoma {{at high risk of}} these complications. DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 188 patients with small or medium-sized choroidal melanomas (height) near the optic disc or macula (within 4 disc diameters of either structure). METHODS: Patients were treated with proton beam therapy at doses of either 50 CGE or 70 CGE between October 1989 and July 1994, and followed up biannually through April 1998. Outcomes included visual acuity, radiation complications, melanoma recurrence, and metastasis. RESULTS: Proportions of patients retaining visual acuity of at least 20 / 200 were similar in the 2 dose groups at 5 years after radiation (approximately 55...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: A {{retrospective}} study evaluating {{the role of}} hypofractionated stereotactic proton beam therapy for acoustic neuromas. Materials and methods: The data of 51 patients treated with hypofractionation (3 fractions) and followed up {{for a minimum of}} 2 years, were analyzed. Mean dose prescribed to ICRU reference point (isocenter) was 26 <b>cobalt</b> <b>gray</b> equivalent (CGyE) in 3 fractions. Mean minimum tumor dose was 21. 4 CGyE/ 3. Cranial nerve functions were evaluated clinically. Serial MR Scans were used to evaluate local control. Results: With a mean clinical and radiological follow-up of 72 and 60 months respectively, the 5 -year results showed a 98 % local control, with a hearing preservation of 42 %, a facial nerve preservation of 90. 5 % and a trigeminal nerve preservation of 93 %. Conclusion: For those patients harboring large acoustic neuromas that are inoperable, hypofractionated stereotactic proton beam offers long-term control with minimal side-effects. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ciliary body {{location}} is an established prognostic factor for metastasis-related death from uveal melanoma. We evaluated alternative approaches for classifying this covariate when constructing predictive models of patient survival. METHODS AND DESIGN: The analyses {{were based on}} a consecutive series of 1848 primary choroidal and/or ciliary body melanoma patients treated with proton beam irradiation (70 <b>cobalt</b> <b>gray</b> equivalent in 5 fractions) at the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory, Boston, Mass, between July 1975 and December 1995. For each patient, the anatomic site of the tumor was classified according to an estimate of the proportion of the tumor base lying anterior to the ora serrata. Using proportional hazards regression, we estimated relative risk ratios and death rates from melanoma metastasis according to the extent of ciliary body involvement. All estimates were adjusted for other established prognostic factors. RESULTS: Patients were followed up through April 30, 1998; none were lost to follow-up. Of 1848 patients analyzed, 378 died of melanoma metastasis. The median follow-up period among survivors was 9. 5 years. Ciliary body origin (3 ̆e 50...|$|R
40|$|Background In June 1998 {{proton beam therapy}} of ocular tumors {{started at}} the Hahn Meitner Institut Berlin, Germany. Purpose {{of the present study}} is to {{evaluate}} treatment outcome for uveal melanomas. Material and Methods 245 consecutive patients with primary melanoma of the uvea were treated from June 1998 to April 2003 with a 68 MeV proton beam. In 96. 2 of all pts. a uniform fractionation scheme was applied single dose 15 CGE <b>Cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> Equivalent, total dose 60 CGE on 4 consecutive days. Follow up is available in 229 patients. Results At the time of median follow up 18, 4 months local control is 96. 4 and 95. 5 at 3 years. Eye retention rate is 92. 6 at 20 months median follow up and 87. 5 at 3 years. Conclusions Proton beam irradiation of uveal melanomas at the Hahn Meitner Institut after the first 5 years of its initiation reveals local tumor control and eye retention rates in the range of other centers with larger experience. Delivering high treatment quality in hadron therapy from the beginning has been achieved. Key Words Uveal melanoma proton therap...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{aim of this}} {{treatment}} planning {{study was to investigate}} the potential advantages of intensity-modulated (IM) proton therapy (IMPT) compared with IM photon therapy (IMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods Eight NPC patients were chosen. The dose prescriptions in <b>cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> equivalent (Gy E) for gross tumor volumes of the primary tumor (GTV-T), planning target volumes of GTV-T and metastatic (PTV-TN) and elective (PTV-N) lymph node stations were 72. 6 Gy E, 66 Gy E, and 52. 8 Gy E, respectively. For each patient, nine coplanar fields IMRT with step-and-shoot technique and 3 D spot-scanned three coplanar fields IMPT plans were prepared. Both modalities were planned in 33 fractions to be delivered with a simultaneous integrated boost technique. All plans were prepared and optimized by using the research version of the inverse treatment planning system KonRad (DKFZ, Heidelberg). Results Both treatment techniques were equal in terms of averaged mean dose to target volumes. IMPT plans significantly improved the tumor coverage and conformation (P E) were more than doubled by IMRT plans. Conclusion In radiotherapy of NPC patients, three-field IMPT has greater potential than nine-field IMRT with respect to tumor coverage and reduction of the integral dose to OARs and non-specific normal tissues. The practicality of IMPT in NPC deserves further exploration when this technique becomes available on wider clinical scale. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the temporal lobe (TL) damage rate in 96 patients treated with high-dose proton and photon irradiation for chordomas and chondrosarcomas {{of the base}} of the skull. Methods and Materials: The records of 96 consecutive patients treated at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL) between June 1984 and 1993, for chordomas and chondro-sarcomas of {{the base of the}} skull were reviewed. All the patients had undergone some degree of resection of the tumor prior to radiation therapy. Seventy-five patients were classified as “primary tumors ” and 21 as recurrent or regrowing tumors after one or more surgical procedures. All the patients were randomized to receive 66. 6 or 72 <b>cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> equivalent (CGE) on a prospective dose-searching study by proton and photon irradiation (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group # 85 - 26) with conventional fractionation (1. 8 CGE/day, 5 fractions/week). All treatments were planned using the three-dimensional (3 D) planning system developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the dose was delivered using opposed lateral fields for the photon component and a noncoplanar isocentric technique for the proton component. Clinical symptoms of TL damage were classified into 4 grades. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were evaluated for white matter changes. Abnormalities associated with persistent or recurrent tumor were distinguished from radiation-induced changes. TLs were delineated on the original scans of the 10 patients with damage and thos...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} postoperative spot-scanning proton {{radiation therapy}} (PT) and intensity-modulated PT (IMPT) for chordoma and chondrosarcoma in pediatric patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2000 and 2005, 10 patients (six male patients, four female patients; six chordomas, four chondrosarcomas), aged 10 - 20 years (median, 16 years), were treated at our institute. Tumor sites {{were in the}} brain (one case), skull base (five cases), cervical (three cases), and lumbar spine (one case). Three children had complete resections. In seven children, resection was incomplete, leaving residual tumor behind (range, 2. 3 - 46. 3 mL). PT was delivered using spot scanning, with (three patients) or without (seven patients) IMPT. Total dose was 74. 0 <b>cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> equivalents (CGE) for chordoma, and 63. 2 - 68. 0 CGE for chondrosarcoma (median, 66. 0), depending on histopathological grading and whether the patient had concurrent chemotherapy. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 36 months (range, 8 - 77 months). Radiation treatment was well tolerated. All patients remained failure-free at their last follow-up. Late adverse events were reported in three patients and were mild (neurosensory in one patient; alopecia and hypoaccusis in one patient) to moderate (one patient, Grade 2 pituitary insufficiency). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative spot-scanning PT, delivered in combination with and without IMPT, for chordoma and chondrosarcoma {{in children and adolescents}} was tolerated without unacceptable adverse event and initial outcome is perfectly satisfactory in this small cohort. Longer follow-up time and larger cohort are needed to more fully assess tumor control, adverse events, as well as functional and cosmetic outcome...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcomes of}} a second course of proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) in patients with recurrent uveal melanoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients received a second course of PBRT. The mean interval {{between the first and}} the second PBRT course was 50. 2 months (range, 8 - 165 months). Most patients (87 %) received 70 <b>cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> equivalent (CGE) for both courses. Visual acuity was 20 / 200 or better in 30 patients initially and in 22 patients at the second treatment. The mean follow-up time after the second treatment was 50 months (range, 6 - 164 months). RESULTS: At the time of the last follow-up, 20 patients were classified as having no evidence of disease, defined as tumor regression or an absence of tumor progression. Nine eyes (29 %) were enucleated because of local recurrence (n = 5) or intractable pain (n = 4). The 5 -year eye retention rate was 55 % (95 % confidence interval: 25. 2 - 77. 4). Six of the 22 patients who retained the eye (27 %) had useful vision (20 / 200 or better). CONCLUSIONS: A second course of PBRT for recurrent uveal melanoma to total doses between 118 and 140 CGE was associated with a relatively good probability of local control and a low enucleation rate. Although most patients lost vision, the majority were able to retain the reirradiated eye. Further evaluation is needed to assess metastasis-free survival of additional proton irradiation vs. enucleation after local recurrence...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} hypofractionated stereotactic {{proton therapy}} of predominantly large intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) by analyzing retrospectively {{the results from}} a cohort of patients. Methods and Materials: Since 1993, a total of 85 patients with vascular lesions have been treated. Of those, 64 patients fulfilled the criteria of having an arteriovenous malformation and sufficient follow-up. The AVMs were grouped by volume: < 14 cc (26 patients) and < 14 cc (38 patients). Treatment was delivered with a fixed horizontal 200 MeV proton beam under stereotactic conditions, using a stereophotogrammetric positioning system. The majority of patients were hypofractionated (2 or 3 fractions), and the proton doses are presented as single-fraction equivalent <b>cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> equivalent doses (SFEcGyE). The overall mean minimum target volume dose was 17. 37 SFEcGyE, ranging from 10. 38 - 22. 05 SFEcGyE. Results: Analysis by volume group showed obliteration in 67 % for volumes < 14 cc and 43 % for volumes < 14 cc. Grade IV acute complications were observed in 3 % of patients. Transient delayed effects were seen in 15 patients (23 %), becoming permanent in 3 patients. One patient also developed a cyst 8 years after therapy. Conclusions: Stereotactic proton beam therapy applied in a hypofractionated schedule allows for the safe treatment of large AVMs, with acceptable results. It is an alternative to other treatment strategies for large AVMs. AVMs are likely not static entities, but probably undergo vascular remodeling. Factors influencing angiogenesis could play a new role in a form of adjuvant therapy to improve on the radiosurgical results. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{study was to determine}} the efficacy of proton beam irradiation in choroidal hemangioma in a long term follow up. Patients and methods A total dose of 20 <b>Cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> equivalent CGE was administered to 50 eyes of 50 patients from September 1998 to September 2010. All treated patients presented with a symptomatic tumor. Nine patients were pre treated by photodynamic therapy PDT. Visual outcome, tumor regression, and complications resulting from radiation were investigated. Results The mean follow up was 55. 4 months range 13 132. Tumor thickness decreased in all patients. Retinal re attachment was achieved without evidence of tumor leakage. Visual acuity improved by two lines after one year in 43. 4 of patients and after two years in 36. 8 of patients. During the 55. 4 months of long term follow up the visual acuity improved from 6 15 to 6 12 after proton therapy. Twenty three patients 46. 0 developed radiation retinopathy. According to the Finger classification of 2004, 21 patients 42. 0 showed a stage 1 or 2 functionally not relevant retinopathy, and two patients 4. 0 presented a stage 3 or 4 functionally relevant retinopathy. Further complications included sicca syndrome in nine cases, cataract formation in 10 cases, and radiation optic neuropathy in four cases. Conclusion Proton therapy with 20 CGE is an efficient primary therapy in choroidal hemangioma and is very effective as a secondary treatment after PDT.

40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} {{long term}} outcomes of proton beam radiotherapy {{in the treatment}} of choroidal melanoma of the intermediate zone of the fundus. Design Retrospective interventional single center study. Methods The study was a retrospective analysis with long term follow up of 62 patients with a minimum tumor to disc and tumor to fovea distance of 2 mm of choroidal melanoma in the intermediate zone of the fundus. Mean values of tumor prominence, largest basal diameter, and tumor distances to the optic disc and fovea were 7. 6, 12. 8, 5. 2, and 4. 6 mm, respectively. All patients were irradiated with a total proton dose of 60 <b>cobalt</b> <b>gray</b> equivalents. Results After proton beam radiotherapy, 71. 0 of the patients received subsequent endoresection of the tumor. Only 18 patients 29. 0 did not require additional tumor resection and were analyzed as a separate group. For the total of patients, the median follow up time was 70. 3 months. The 5 year Kaplan Meier rates of local tumor relapse, enucleation, and distant metastasis were 3. 9, 3. 7, and 13. 4, respectively. Cataract surgery was the most frequent secondary treatment in our cohort. Conclusions In this study we demonstrate the effectiveness of proton beam irradiation in tumor control and preservation of the globe in the analyzed patients. The rate of metastasis was not higher than previously described. Nevertheless, consecutive tumor surgery is frequently required to maintain the eye in patients with large sized choroidal melanomas. In conclusion, proton beam radiotherapy allows preservation of the eye in mid zone choroidal melanomas.

40|$|Purpose: To review {{outcomes}} {{for patients with}} skull base meningiomas treated using the stereotactic proton beam at the National Accelerator Center (NAC), Republic of South Africa. Methods and Materials: Since 1993, 27 patients with intracranial meningiomas have been treated stereotactically with protons at NAC. Of those, 23 were located on the skull base, were large or had complex shapes, and were treated with radical intent. Both stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT, 16 or more fractions) and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT, 3 fractions) were used. Eighteen patients underwent proton HSRT, while 5 patients were treated with SRT. The mean target volume for the HSRT group was 15. 6 cm 3 (range 2. 6 - 63 cm 3). The mean ICRU reference dose was 20. 3 <b>cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> equivalent (CGyE), and the mean minimum planning target dose was 16. 3 CGyE. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up periods were 40 and 31 months respectively. The mean volume in the SRT group was 43. 7 cm 3, with ICRU reference doses ranging from 54 CGyE in 27 fractions to 61. 6 CGyE in 16 fractions. Results: In the HSRT group, 16 / 18 (89 %) of patients remained clinically stable or improved, while 2 / 18 (11 %) deteriorated. Radiologic control was achieved in 88 % of patients, while 2 patients had a marginal failure. Among the 5 SRT patients, 2 were clinically better, and 3 remained stable. All SRT patients achieved radiologic control. Three patients (13 %), 2 {{of them in the}} HSRT group, suffered permanent neurologic deficits. Analyzing different dose/fractionation schedules, an α/β value of 3. 7 Gy for meningiomas is estimated. Conclusion: Proton irradiation is effective and safe in controlling large and complex-shaped skull base meningiomas. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{analyze the}} {{functional}} outcome {{with regard to}} the development of visual acuity and radiation induced optic neuropathy of patients with parapapillary choroidal melanoma treated with proton beam therapy. Design Clinical case series, retrospective study. Methods We evaluated 147 consecutive patients with parapapillary choroidal melanoma who received proton beam therapy as primary tumor treatment at the Helmholtz Center in Berlin from 1998 to 2005. A cumulative dose of 60 <b>Cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> Equivalents CGE was delivered to the tumor and the optic disc received a minimum of 50 CGE. Kaplan Meier analysis was used to assess ocular outcome and survival rates. For trend analysis of functional development, Wilcoxon Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the medians of 2 groups and Kruskal Wallis test was used in the case of more than 2 groups. Results The mean follow up time was 6. 5 years range 0. 3 11. 7 years. The most common side effects were radiation induced optic neuropathy, retinopathy, and cataract. The median visual acuity before and within the first year after therapy was 0. 4 logMAR 20 50, lapsing to 1. 3 logMAR 20 400 after 3 years and 1. 4 logMAR 20 500 after 5 years. During follow up, no light perception developed in 17 cases 11. 6, mostly attributed to radiation induced retinopathy, optic neuropathy, and secondary glaucoma. Enucleation was carried out in 14 patients 9. 5 because of local recurrence or severe side effects. Conclusion Radiation induced optic neuropathy is an expected issue after proton beam therapy of parapapillary choroidal melanoma, and visual impairment is common during long term follow up, but some useful vision can be preserved in a considerable number of patients.

40|$|Abstract Purpose To compare on a {{retrospective}} basis {{the results of}} therapy in patients with uveal hemangioma treated with photon or proton irradiation at a single center. Methods From 1993 to 2002 in total 44 patients were treated. Until 1998 radiotherapy was given with 6 MV photons in standard fractionation of 2. 0 Gy five times a week. In 1998 proton therapy became available and was used since then. A dose of 20 22. 5 CGE <b>Cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> Equivalent 68 MeV protons were given on four consecutive days. Progressive symptoms or deterioration of vision were the indications for therapy. Results Of the total of 44 patients treated, 36 had circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas CCH and 8 had diffuse hemangiomas DCH and Sturge Weber syndrom. 19 patients were treated with photons with a total dose {{in the range of}} 16 30 Gy. 25 patients were irradiated with protons. All but one patient with DCH were treated with photons. Stabilization of visual acuity was achieved in 93. 2 of all patients. Tumorthickness decreased in 95. 4 and retinal detachment resolved in 92. 9. Late effects although in general mild or moderate, were detected frequently. 40. 9 showed radiation induced optic neuropathy RON maximum grade I. Retinopathy was found in 29. 5, but only one patient experienced more than grade II. Retinopathy and RON were reversible in some of the patients and in part resolved completely. No differences could be detected between CCH patients treated with protons and photons. Treatment was less effective in DCH patients 75 Conclusions Radiotherapy is effective in treating choroidal hemangiomas with respect to visual acuity and tumor thickness but a benefit of proton therapy could not be detected. Side effects are moderate but careful monitoring for side effects {{should be part of the}} follow up procedure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Osteosarcoma is {{the most}} common primary {{malignant}} bone tumor in children and adolescents. For effective treatment, local control of the tumor is absolutely critical, because the chances of long term survival are EURAMOS 1. Local photon radiotherapy has previously been used in small series and in an uncontrolled, highly individualized fashion, which, however, documented that high dose radiotherapy can, in principle, be used to achieve local control. Generally the radiation dose that is necessary for a curative approach can hardly be achieved with conventional photon radiotherapy in patients with non-resectable tumors that are usually located near radiosensitive critical organs such as the brain, the spine or the pelvis. In these cases particle Radiotherapy (proton therapy (PT) /heavy ion therapy (HIT) may offer a promising new alternative. Moreover, compared with photons, heavy ion beams provide a higher physical selectivity because of their finite depth coverage in tissue. They achieve a higher relative biological effectiveness. Phase I/II dose escalation studies of HIT in adults with non-resectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas have already shown favorable results. Methods/Design This is a monocenter, single-arm study for patients ≥ 6 years of age with non-resectable osteosarcoma. Desired target dose is 60 - 66 <b>Cobalt</b> <b>Gray</b> Equivalent (Gy E) with 45 Gy PT (proton therapy) and a carbon ion boost of 15 - 21 GyE. Weekly fractionation of 5 - 6 × 3 Gy E is used. PT/HIT will be administered exclusively at the Ion Radiotherapy Center in Heidelberg. Furthermore, FDG-PET imaging characteristics of non-resectable osteosarcoma before and after PT/HIT will be investigated prospectively. Systemic disease before and after PT/HIT is targeted by standard chemotherapy protocols and is not part of this trial. Discussion The primary objectives of this trial are the determination of feasibility and toxicity of HIT. Secondary objectives are tumor response, disease free survival and overall survival. The aim is to improve outcome for patients with non-resectable osteosarcoma. Trail Registration Registration number (ClinicalTrials. gov) : NCT 01005043 </p...|$|R
