500|$|At the 2012 Golden Globe ceremony, when Dinklage won {{the award}} for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, he told the {{audience}} {{that he had been}} thinking about [...] "a gentleman, his name is Martin Henderson", and suggested that they Google his name. Henderson is a person with dwarfism from England, who was badly injured by being tossed by a rugby fan in a bar. The speech by Dinklage brought media and public attention to the act of dwarf-tossing with Henderson's name being trended worldwide on social media. Dinklage turned down offers from talk shows to discuss the topic. He later explained that 20 years earlier he might have accepted these offers but that he's a [...] "little bit more at peace with things now and I—said what I wanted to say. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> says the world doesn't need another angry dwarf." ...|$|E

"By {{the throne}} of Cæsar, lady," [...] he exclaimed {{in a voice that}} carried a {{conviction}} of his earnestness, staring hard at the bust of Ithiel before him, [...] "as it chances, although I am not an artist, I do know something of sculpture, since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> is held to be the best of our day, and often for my sins have sat as model to him.

6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} needs {{polishing}} and practice and all that; but I'm {{sure it is}} oceans better than half the sentimental twaddle {{we see in the}} papers, and I know that some of those pieces are paid for, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> is in a newspaper office, and he told me so. Yours are quaint and simple and some very original. I'm sure that ballad of the old house is lovely, and I want to send it to Whittier. Mamma knows him; it's the sort he likes, and he is so kind to every one, he will criticise it, and be interested when she tells him about you. Do let me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely, yes. It {{is great}} folly and {{waste of time}} and money; yet I have known one man who found some good in it, or, rather, brought good out of it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> has a mania for giving. His own fortune was spent in helping needy {{students}} at the University, and poor professors. This displeased his father, and he refused supplies, except enough for his simple personal wants. Sigismund chafed at this, and being skilful at all games, as a gentleman may be in the way of amusement, he resolved to play with those whose money was wasted on frivolities, and give his winnings to his band of paupers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So that is settled, {{as far as}} it can be settled. Fortunately {{the club}} does not meet this evening, so there is no fear of a demand being made, by it, for my arrest tomorrow. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> belongs to it--not, I think, because he at all agrees with its views; but because, like many others, he deems it prudent to appear to do so. It was from him that I heard what had passed there, and he promised to give me warning of {{anything}} that might be said, or done, against me. I shall go down to the lugger early, and remain on board all day, seeing to the stowage of the cargo we are taking on board, so that no suspicion can arise that I am thinking of leaving for the country." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> {{was never}} a church member, but was, and is, a millionaire-a generous benevolent millionaire-who once went about doing good by stealth, but with a natural {{preference}} for doing it at his office. One day he took it into his thoughtful noddle {{that he would like}} to assist in the erection of a new church edifice, to replace the inadequate and shabby structure in which a certain small congregation in his town then worshipped. So he drew up a subscription paper, modestly headed the list with [...] "Christian, 2000 dollars," [...] and started one of the Deacons about with it. In a few days the Deacon came back to him, like the dove to the ark, saying he had succeeded in procuring a few names, but the press of his private business was such that he had felt compelled to intrust the paper to Deacon Smith.|$|E

So I will not die. Nor shall you, my friend; cheer up; cease to weep, I entreat you. Are you not young, and fair, and good? Why should you despair? Or if you must for yourself, why for others? If {{you can never be}} happy, can you never bestow {{happiness}}[?] Oh! believe me, if you beheld on lips pale with grief one smile of joy and gratitude, and knew that you were parent of that smile, and that without you it had never been, you would feel so pure and warm a happiness that you would wish to live for ever again and again to enjoy the same pleasure[.] ...|$|E
60|$|My dear Mr. Westwood,--I {{send you}} the {{manuscript}} you ask for, and also my certificate that, although I certainly {{was once a}} little girl, yet I {{never in my life}} had fair hair, or received lessons when you mention. I think a cousin of mine, now dead, may have done it. The 'Barrett Barrett' seems to specify my family. I have a little cousin with bright fair hair at this moment who is an Elizabeth Barrett (the subject of my 'Portrait'[108]), but then she is a 'Georgiana' besides, and your friend must refer to times past. My hair is very dark indeed, and always was, as long as I remember, and also <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> makes serious affidavit that I have never changed (except by being rather taller) since I was a year old. Altogether, you cannot make a case of identity out, and I am forced to give up the glory of being so long remembered for my cleverness.|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> was the confidant of a {{large number}} of his kindred and of many other people besides. It was said of him that {{everybody}} went to him for sympathy and advice. I can well believe it, for he never spoke about himself at all that I can remember. He was not unusually wise or superlatively clever, but he had [...] "a heart at leisure from itself to soothe and sympathise." [...] The consequence was that, in spite of a good many faults, he was greatly beloved. And it is certain, reader, that to gain the affection of your fellow-men is one of the surest steps in the direction of success in life. To be too much concerned in conversation about yourself, your affairs and your opinions will prove to be a mighty obstruction in your way. Perhaps one of the best methods of fighting against this tendency is to resolve, when meeting with friends, never to begin with self, but always with them. But it is hard to crucify self! This mode of procedure, be it observed, would not be a hypocritical exhibition of interest where none was felt, but an honest attempt to snub self by deliberately putting your friends' interests before your own.|$|E
6000|$|Confucius said: [...] "To {{contract}} ties of Friendship {{with any}} one, is to contract Friendship with his virtue. There {{ought not to}} be any other motive in Friendship." [...] But men wish us to contract Friendship with their vice also. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Friend</b> <b>who</b> wishes me to see that to be right which I know to be wrong. But if Friendship is to rob me of my eyes, if it is to darken the day, I will have none of it. It should be expansive and inconceivably liberalizing in its effects. True Friendship can afford true knowledge. It does not depend on darkness and ignorance. A want of discernment cannot be an ingredient in it. If I can see my Friend's virtues more distinctly than another's, his faults too are made more conspicuous by contrast. We have not so good a right to hate any as our Friend. Faults are not the less faults because they are invariably balanced by corresponding virtues, and for a fault there is no excuse, though it may appear greater than it is in many ways. I have never known one who could bear criticism, who could not be flattered, who would not bribe his judge, or was content that the truth should be loved always better than himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell me 'if it could'--it must be done. Do {{you think}} I could sleep under this roof, propped {{up by the}} timbers of that ruined tienda? Do you think I could wear those {{diamonds}} again, while that termagant shop-woman can say that her money bought them? No! If you are my husband's friend you will do this--for--for his sake." [...] She stopped, locked and interlocked her cold fingers before her, and said, hesitating and mechanically, [...] "You meant well, Captain Poindexter, in bringing me here, I know! You must not think that I blame you for it, or for the miserable result of it that you have just witnessed. But if I have gained anything by it, for God's sake let me reap it quickly, that I may give it to these people and go! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> can aid me {{to get to my}} husband or to my home in Kentucky, where Spencer will yet find me, I know. I want nothing more." [...] She stopped again. With another woman the pause would have been one of tears. But she kept her head above the flood that filled her heart, and the clear eyes fixed upon Poindexter, albeit pained, were undimmed.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{art of the}} raconteur," [...] {{observed}} the Philosopher, [...] "consists in avoiding the unessential. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> never yet to my knowledge {{reached the end of}} a story. It is intensely unimportant whether the name of the man who said the thing or did the deed be Brown or Jones or Robinson. But she will worry herself into a fever trying to recollect. 'Dear, dear me!' she will leave off to exclaim; 'I know his name so well. How stupid of me!' She will tell you why she ought to recollect his name, how she always has recollected his name till this precise moment. She will appeal to half the people in the room to help her. It is hopeless to try and induce her to proceed, the idea has taken possession of her mind. After a world of unnecessary trouble she recollects that it was Tomkins, and is delighted; only to be plunged again into despair on discovery that she has forgotten his address. This makes her so ashamed of herself she declines to continue, and full of self- reproach she retires to her own room. Later she re-enters, beaming, with the street and number pat. But by that time she has forgotten the anecdote." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now all {{was ready}} and Woodville came. I {{received}} {{him at the}} door of my cottage and leading him solemnly into the room, I said: [...] "My friend, I wish to die. I am quite weary of enduring the misery which hourly I do endure, and I will throw it off. What slave will not, if he may, escape from his chains? Look, I weep: {{for more than two years}} I have never enjoyed one moment free from anguish. I have often desired to die; but I am a very coward. It is hard for one so young who was once so happy as I was; [sic] voluntarily to divest themselves of all sensation and to go alone to the dreary grave; I dare not. I must die, yet my fear chills me; I pause and shudder and then for months I endure my excess of wretchedness. But now the time is come when I may quit life, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> will not refuse to accompany me in this dark journey; such is my request:[69] earnestly do I entreat and implore you to die with me.

60|$|Fra Giuliano himself divided {{his life}} into two parts: {{the one he}} named the Time of Honey, being the period of expectation; the other the Time of Gall, being that of realisation. The second half commences with his arrival at the town of Forli, in the year 1488, {{and it is this}} part which we have decided to publish; for, {{notwithstanding}} its brevity, this was the most eventful period of his life, and the account of it seems to hang together in a sufficiently lucid fashion, centring round the conspiracy which resulted in the assassination of Girolamo Riario, and finishing with the author's admission to the Order of St Francis. This, then, I have given exactly as he wrote it, neither adding nor suppressing a word. I do not deny that it would have pleased me a little to falsify the history, for the Anglo-Saxons are a race of idealists, as is shown in all their dealing, international and commercial; and truth they have always found a little ugly. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> lately wrote a story of the London poor, and his critics were properly disgusted because his characters dropped their aitches and often used bad language, and did not behave as elegantly as might be expected from the example they were continually receiving from their betters; while some of his readers were shocked to find that people existed in this world who did not possess the delicacy and refinement which they felt palpitating in their own bosoms. The author forgot that Truth is a naked lady, and that nudity is always shameful, unless it points a moral. If Truth has taken up her abode {{at the bottom of a}} well, it is clearly because she is conscious that she is no fit companion for decent people.|$|E
