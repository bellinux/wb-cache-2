Estimates for that period place {{the total population of}} Bukovinan and Transylvanian Romanians in such facilities, throughout Russia, at 120,000 or 130,000. Meanwhile, in Romania itself there were several thousand Romanian refugees from Austria-Hungary who immediately signed up for service in the Romanian Armed Forces.|$|E

Nevertheless, although referencing the personal union with Scotland and Ireland, the Royal Arms of England remained distinct from the Royal Arms of Scotland, until the two realms were joined in a political union in 1707, leading to a unified Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.|$|E
