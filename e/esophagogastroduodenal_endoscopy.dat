40|$|Background: Bamboo joint-like {{appearance}} {{is a common}} yet easy-to-miss endoscopic finding in the stomach of patients with Crohn’s disease (CD). Bamboo joint-like appearance (BJA) is characterized by swollen longitudinal folds transversed by erosive fissures or linear furrows. However, whether BJA is observed during the remission stage of CD and during the active stage is unclear. In particular, {{the relationship between the}} course of BJA and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α has not been studied. We aimed to evaluate the course of BJA in CD patients treated with anti-TNF α therapy. Material/Methods: We examined 22 CD patients who underwent <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> before undergoing anti- TNF a treatment. We evaluated the changes in BJA, clinical activity using the CD activity index (CDAI), and endoscopic activity using the simple endoscopic score for CD (SES-CD) from 6 months to 1 year after anti-TNF α. Results: Fifteen of 22 patients (68. 1 %) presented with BJA in the stomach, 13 of whom received follow-up <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> after anti-TNF α. The mean CDAI and SES-CD scores significantly improved after anti-TNF α (P< 0. 01). Despite the marked improvements in clinical and endoscopic findings, the BJA of the stomach remained unchanged in all the patients. Conclusions: The findings indicate that BJA is frequently observed in the stomach of CD patients, regardless of whether the patient has active disease or is in remission, even after anti-TNF α. Thus, BJA may be a stable endoscopic landmark in CD...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAbdominal aortic {{aneurysm}}s (AAAs) {{can cause}} aortoenteric fistulae (AEF). AEF {{can either be}} primary, arising from the aneurysm or other diseases, causing the aorta to erode into the bowel, or secondary, from previous aortic grafting. Primary aortoduodenal fistula (ADF) is a rare clinical entity that usually presents with gastrointestinal bleeding that can be occult, intermittent, or massive. We report a 71 -year-old woman with acute onset of abdominal pain and massive hematemesis. <b>Esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> (EGD) and arteriography were nondiagnostic. The patient's condition became unstable, and she was brought emergently {{to the operating room}} where the diagnosis of an ADF was made. The ADF and AAA were surgically repaired, and the patient recovered without complications. This case represents an example of a rare complication of AAA with the unusual presentation of multiple aortic aneurysms. We will address the pathophysiology, diagnostic evaluation, and management of AEF. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 686 - 9. ...|$|E
40|$|An 80 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to our hospital because of tarry stool with iron deficiency anemia. Her past history included autoimmune hepatitis. <b>Esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> was performed to investigate the bleeding source and revealed multiple linear gastric vascular malformations in the antrum and cardia, compatible with Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE). Endoscopic ablation was carried out {{with the tip of}} the hot biopsy forceps without opening at soft coagulation mode of 80 W. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications associated with endoscopic therapies. After two sessions of endoscopic ablation her anemia improved to around 10 g/dL, an increase of 3. 6 g/dL. Various endoscopic treatments have been described to manage GAVE. The most popular is argon plasma coagulation (APC), although APC is associated with over-distension induced by the argon plasma gas. To avoid over-distension and to reduce the abdominal discomfort/pain of this patient, we have used hot biopsy forceps instead of APC. Our case suggests that this procedure is effective, easy and convenient, as no special equipment or skill is necessary...|$|E

40|$|A 9 -year-old girl {{presented}} with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. <b>Esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> (EGD) identified a long and large gastric trichobezoar extending into the duodenum. We attempted endoscopic retrieval after {{informed consent was obtained}} from the patient’s mother. Initially, a gasper with 5 -prolongs, commonly used for retrieval of endoscopically excised polyps, failed to remove the whole trichobezoar. When a net was used instead, it proved impossible to remove the trichobezoar completely. Therefore, we withdrew the scope from the mouth, leaving the net grasping the tricobezoar firmly in the stomach. Subsequently, we were able to retrieve about 70 % of the trichobezoar manually by grasping the snare part of the net directly. A second pass found no deep laceration or perforation endoscopically. The remaining trichobezoar was completely retrieved with the net. The procedure was completed within 15 min. The retrieved specimens were 34 cm in length and 100 g in weight. The patient was discharged uneventfully 5 d thereafter. She was advised to visit a psychiatrist to avoid suffering from a relapse. Follow-up EGD showed no trichobezoar, and the patient’s frontal hair grew back...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal metaplasia (IM) in concomitant gastric and duodenal ulcer (CGDU) disease by retrospec-tively reviewing consecutive patients who had undergone <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy.</b> Patients who received the endoscopic diagnosis of CGDU disease were selected for analysis and the recorded demographic, endoscopic, clinical and outcome data, including data on the development of IM, were extracted. Associations of the various parameters with IM were estimated by logistic regression analysis and described by the odds ratio (OR) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI). Among the total 204, 073 consecutive patients screened, 2, 397 (1. 2 %) were diagnosed with CGDU disease. Following application of the exclusion criteria, a total of 2, 149 cases were included in the study. The IM prevalence was 8. 4 %, represented by 153 mild cases, 26 moderate cases and one severe case. Multivariate analysis identified age ≥ 50 years (OR= 2. 606, 95 % CI= 1. 889 - 3. 597, χ 2 = 34. 000, P< 0. 001), ulcer at the gastric incisura (OR= 2. 644, 95 % CI= 1. 926 - 3. 630...|$|E
40|$|<b>Esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> (EGDE) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} performed endoscopic procedure in Canada and represents 51 [...] 65 % of all gastrointestinal procedures performed in teaching hospitals. The routine use of conscious sedation during EGDE has facilitated its diffusion, ensured patient and physician satisfaction and has increased the potential risk of cardiorespiratory morbidity. It remains unclear if all adult ambulatory patients require routine conscious sedation prior to diagnostic EGDE, as the efficacy and safety of such a policy has not been rigorously studied in a North American population. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} sedation or placebo in a double-blind trial. So far 360 patients of the anticipated patients have been enrolled, (182 randomized to sedation, 178 randomized to placebo). Groups were similar for all baseline characteristics. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to placebo were able to complete EGDE without sedation. The major determinant of "successful endoscopy" was the use of sedation (OR = 7. 52; 95 % CI: 4. 61 [...] 12. 26). Preliminary subgroup analysis suggested that among patients greater than 55 yrs and with decreased pharyngeal sensitivity, there was a greater likelihood of successful unsedated endoscopy, when compared to other subsets (45 % successful vs. 39 % successful among the unstratified placebo population; 98 % power). The use of sedation does not improve technical adequacy. However, the use of sedation in the performance of EGDE is the strongest predictor of a successful endoscopy, patient self-reported satisfaction and willingness to repeat the procedure...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{carcinoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently diagnosed malignancies in men. 1 Common sites of metastasis include the lymph nodes and bone; rarely has metastatic prostate carcinoma been reported to involve the stomach 2 - 8 or other sites of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 9 - 12 Here we describe two unusual cases of prostate carcinoma metastatic to the stomach. Case 1 An 89 -year-old Caucasian man presented with declining health, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Comorbidities included hypertension, history of colon polyps, total colectomy following gastrointestinal bleed post-colonoscopy, congestive heart failure, aortic valve replacement, coronary artery disease, and congestive obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient had a 15 -year history of elevated and rising prostatic specific antigen (PSA). His PSA a year before presentation was 1565 units. Family history was significant for a brother with prostate carcinoma. The conservative course of annual follow-up had been decided due to the patient’s advanced age, two negative prostate biopsies, and lack of symptoms. At the time of presentation the patient’s physical health had deteriorated to the extent that he was unable to live independently and had moved into an assisted living facility. Central to the evaluation of his illness, an <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> showed a poorly distensible stomach with prominent rugal folds and ulcerations distal to the gastroesophageal junction and along the lesser curvature. Due to the markedly elevated serum PSA of 1660 units, the case was discussed with the pathologist. The gastric biopsy (figure 1 A) revealed the lamina propria to harbo...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our study}} was to detect bile acids and total {{bilirubin}} in saliva of gastrectomized patients, to confirm objectively presence of biliary laryngopharyngeal reflux and its relationship with laryngeal mucosa damage. Summary Background Data: Recently, it has been hypothesized that biliary-reflux may reach the upper aerodigestive tract and enhance development of laryngeal malignancies; nevertheless, the presence of duodenogastric contents in this region has never been revealed. Methods: We carried out a prospective observational case-control study on 52 patients (cases) previously submitted to gastric surgery, mainly to subtotal Billroth II resection, and on 51 healthy volunteers (controls). Patients were submitted to clinical interview, <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy,</b> endoscopic laryngeal evaluation, and saliva collection. In all saliva samples, bile acids, total bilirubin, and pepsinogen II were assayed. Results: In cases, group bile acids levels were recorded in 17 of 52 (32. 6 %) patients, while in 35 of 52 (67. 4 %) they were undetectable. All controls were negative to bile acids. In positive cases to bile acids, we found a significant (P < 0. 05) correlation between bile acids, total bilirubin, and pepsinogen II values and a significant (P < 0. 05) higher prevalence of symptoms and findings of laryngeal damage and of previous laryngeal neoplastic lesions. Conclusions: We found detectable levels of bile acids and total bilirubin in saliva of patients submitted to previous gastric surgery, prospecting an intriguing diagnostic role of this dosage {{in the study of}} biliary laryngopharyngeal reflux. We finally revealed a high incidence of laryngeal disorders in patients with positive bile acids in saliva...|$|E
40|$|Objectives:  The {{utility of}} {{nasogastric}} aspiration and lavage {{in the emergency}} management of patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis is controversial. This evidence-based emergency medicine review evaluates the following question: does nasogastric aspiration and lavage in patients with melena or hematochezia and no hematemesis differentiate an upper from lower source of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding? Methods:  MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases were searched. Studies were selected {{for inclusion in the}} review if the authors had performed nasogastric aspiration (with or without lavage) in all patients with hematochezia or melena and performed <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> (EGD) in all patients. Studies were excluded if they enrolled patients with history of esophageal varices or included patients with hematemesis or coffee ground emesis (unless the data for patients without hematemesis or coffee ground emesis could be separated out). The outcome was identifying upper GI hemorrhage (active bleeding or high-risk lesions potentially responsible for hemorrhage) and the rate of complications associated with the nasogastric tube insertion. Quality of the included studies was assessed using standard criteria for diagnostic accuracy studies. Results:  Three retrospective studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The prevalence of an upper GI source for patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis was 32 % to 74 %. According to the included studies, the diagnostic performance of the nasogastric aspiration and lavage for predicting upper GI bleeding is poor. The sensitivity of this test ranged from 42 % to 84 %, the specificity from 54 % to 91 %, and negative likelihood ratios from 0. 62 to 0. 20. Only one study reported the rate complications associated with nasogastric aspiration and lavage (1. 6 %). Conclusions:  Nasogastric aspiration, with or without lavage, has a low sensitivity and poor negative likelihood ratio, which limits its utility in ruling out an upper GI source of bleeding in patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: determinar a freqüência de deficiência da proteína C (PC), proteína S (PS) e antitrombina (AT) e das mutações fator V Leiden (FVL), G 20210 A, no gene da protrombina (PTR), e C 677 T da metileno-tetraidrofolato redutase (MTFR) em crianças e adolescentes com trombose da veia porta (TVP), e definir o padrão hereditário de uma {{eventual}} deficiência. MÉTODOS: durante o período de dois anos, foi investigada a presença de distúrbios trombofílicos em 14 crianças e adolescentes (grupo 1) com TVP, seus pais (grupo 2, n = 25) e dois grupos controles constituídos, o primeiro, por crianças e adolescentes sem hepatopatia, pareados por idade com as crianças do grupo 1 (n = 28), e o outro, por pacientes com cirrose (n = 24). Os pacientes com TVP foram investigados do ponto de vista clínico, laboratorial, endoscópico e com biópsia de fígado. O diagnóstico da trombose foi realizado por ultra-sonografia abdominal com Doppler e/ou estudo angiográfico. RESULTADOS: a freqüência da deficiência de PC, PS e AT nos pacientes com TVP foi de 6 / 14 (42, 9 %) (p 0, 05) e 1 / 14 (7, 1 %) (p > 0, 05), respectivamente. Nos pacientes com cirrose, a freqüência da deficiência de PC, PS e AT foi de 14 / 24 (58, 3 %), 7 / 24 (29, 2 %) e 11 / 24 (45, 8 %), respectivamente (p OBJECTIVE: {{to determine}} the frequency of protein C, protein S and antithrombin deficiency, and factor V Leiden, prothrombin G 20210 A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C 677 T mutations {{in children and adolescents}} with portal vein thrombosis, as well as assessing the hereditary character of this disorders. METHODS: a two-year study was carried out {{to determine the}} frequency of thrombophilic disorders in children and adolescents with portal vein thrombosis (n = 14), their parents (n = 24), and two control groups, one age-matched children and adolescents free of liver disease (n = 28) and another group with cirrhosis (n = 24). The portal vein thrombosis patients were investigated by clinical and laboratory means, <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> <b>endoscopy</b> and liver biopsies. The presence of portal vein thrombosis was assessed by Doppler ultrasonography and/or angiographic analysis. RESULTS: the frequency of protein C, protein S and antithrombin deficiency was 6 / 14 (42. 9 %) (p 0. 05) and 1 / 14 (7. 1 %) (p > 0. 05) of children and adolescents with portal vein thrombosis, respectively. The frequency of protein C, protein S and antithrombin deficiency in cirrhotic patients was 14 / 24 (58. 3 %), 7 / 24 (29. 2 %) and 11 / 24 (45. 8 %), respectively (p < 0. 05 versus controls free of liver disease). None of the portal vein thrombosis parents or controls presented protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency. One portal vein thrombosis patient and one control (p = 0. 999) presented prothrombin G 20210 A mutation. The homozygous form of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C 677 T mutation was observed in 3 / 14 (21. 4 %) patients with portal vein thrombosis and in 5 / 28 (17. 9 %) (p = 0. 356) controls. None of the patients or controls presented the factor V Leiden. CONCLUSIONS: half of the children and adolescents with portal vein thrombosis presented deficiency of one or more coagulation inhibitor proteins, mainly protein C, but this deficiency {{does not seem to be}} an inherited condition. The hereditary prothrombotic disorders do not seem to play a vital role in thrombosis in patients with portal vein thrombosis of this study. In the cirrhotic patients, there was a higher frequency of protein deficiency when the disease was more intense...|$|E
