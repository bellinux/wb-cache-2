Serial concentrations of KF, Dryacide (DA) and Wood ash (Ash) were admixed with 100 g of maize or wheat in ventilated glass jars. Mortality of S. zeamais, P. truncatus and R. dominica was assessed at 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84 days interval after grain treatment. At 28 days, all the three dusts effectively controlled S. zeamais with 95 %- 100 % mortality while only DA was effective against P. truncatus. Both KF and Ash, with 84 % and 92 % mortality, did not reach the threshold required for P. truncatus. Mortality in R. dominica only peaked after 56 days but again only DA treatment was effective at 84 days. The delayed effect of the <b>Diatomaceous</b> <b>earths</b> (DE) and ash treatments appear {{to contribute to the}} higher damage inflicted; hence more weight loss than was expected. At 28 days mean sample weight loss by S. zeamais was 4. 5 % while P. truncatus and R. dominica caused 4. 2 % and 3. 5 % respectively.

40|$|The {{selective}} {{removal of}} several impurities from {{a solution of}} crude olive residue oil in n-hexane (miscella) using batch adsorption by different materials, used separately or in sequence, was investigated. The following adsorbents were tested: activated <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earths,</b> powdered activated carbon and synthetic neutral resins ("Amberlite XAD- 4, XAD- 7, XAD- 16). The adsorption efficiency of every group of compounds depended on the adsorbent and the ratio (amount of adsorbent/amount of oil) used. The activated earths and carbon were very much more effective in the adsorption of the compounds from the miscella than the resins. Results were similar for every resin tested. An effective removal of green pigments (chlorophylls and pheophytins) and carotenoids was achieved with every adsorbent tested. With respect to the adsorption of conjugated hydro-peroxides (HP), a removal of 50 - 60 % was attained with activated carbon and earths, {{in contrast to a}} 20 % removal by the resins.

50|$|Dermanyssid mites in {{the fabric}} of poultry houses are {{controlled}} using equipment that delivers scalding water at high pressure to clean the materials, or by spraying on acaricide in a water based emulsion. Synthetic pyrethroids, or a carbamate chemical such as carbaryl are typical for this treatment. <b>Diatomaceous</b> <b>earths</b> as dust formulations are also used in this context; the dust abrades the waterproof cuticle of the mites which then die of dehydration.The intense infestations with psoroptic, sarcoptic and demodectic mites that build up in some individual animals (often because of reduced immune competence) need special attention because they act as strong sources of infestation to other animals in the same population. Close attention to domestic animals is necessary, including regular hand grooming of companion animals. This enables early signs of infestation to be detected and treatment applied when it likely to have highest effect. Hygiene measures must be appropriate to the type of infestation. Psoroptes mites can live off the host on fomites such as scraps of sheep's wool for several weeks and act as a source of infestation. Close contact between hosts when confined in pens aids spread of these highly contagious mites. Sarcoptic mites are contagious by very close contact and infested animals are kept separate from uninfested ones until treatment is complete. Demodex mites infest all individuals of their natural host species, but it is only those individuals who cannot control the infestations by natural immune defenses that are treated, including not breeding from them. Mites causing asthma and similar conditions are controlled substantially by thorough cleaning and vacuuming of the fabric of affected areas.|$|R

In this study, the selective removal of limonin and naringin from citrus juice by batch adsorption to different materials was investigated.

The following adsorbents were tested: activated <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earths,</b> granulated activated carbon and synthetic neutral resins (Amberlite XAD- 4, XAD- 7 and XAD- 16). Both Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models showed a good fit to the adsorption of limonin to the resins used. Concerning naringin adsorption, a good fit of these models was only observed when the XAD- 7 resin was used. Sigmoidal profiles were obtained for the adsorption of limonin to granular activated carbon. Unfavourable isotherms were also observed for limonin and naringin adsorption to activated earths. These isotherm adsorption profiles can be explained by a multilayer adsorption phenomenon. The highest adsorption efficiency for the bitter compounds was observed when synthetic neutral resin, Amberlite XAD- 7 was used. The separation factor limonin/naringin varied from 16 (with earths) to 57 (with XAD- 7 resin). The adsorption of sugars and pigments to the resins was low.

BACKGROUND: Eight natural products from animal, unicellular algae, brown seaweed and plant origins were chosen according to their theoretical anti-microbial activity: <b>Diatomaceous</b> <b>earths</b> (DE), insoluble chitosan (ICHI), soluble chitosan (CHI), seaweed meal (SWM), Ascophyllum nodosum (ASC), Laminaria digitata (LAM), Neem oil (NOIL) and an Ivy fruit extract rich in saponins (IVY). Dose-response incubations were conducted to determine their effect on rumen fermentation pattern and gas production, while their anti-protozoal activity was tested using (14) C-labelled bacteria. RESULTS: DE, SWM, NOIL and ICHI had very small effects on rumen function when used at inclusion rate up to 2 g L(- 1). ASC had anti-protozoal effects (up to - 23 %) promoting a decrease in gas production and methanogenesis (- 15 %). LAM increased VFA production (+ 7 %) and shifted from butyrate to acetate. CHI also shifted fermentation towards propionate production and lower methane (- 23 %) and protozoal activity (- 56 %). IVY decreased protozoal activity (- 39 %) and ammonia concentration (- 56 %), as well as increased feed fermentation (+ 11 % VFA concentration) and shifted from acetate to propionate production. CONCLUSIONS: ASC, LAM, CHI and IVY showed promising potential in vitro as feed additives to improve rumen function, thus {{more research is needed to}} investigate their mode of action in the rumen microbial ecosystem. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{decided to}} explore whether <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earths</b> (DEs) might meet the grain {{protection}} demands of rural households. These inert dusts are non-toxic to mammals but deadly to insects absorbing the wax from the insect’s cuticle {{which leads to}} water loss and death. Following laboratory studies, promising commercial DEs were trialled collaboratively by researchers and farmers as grain protectants in Zimbabwe. Protect-lt and Dryacide applied at 0. 1 %w/w were {{as effective as the}} synthetic conventional insecticide, Actellic Super dust, in limiting insect damage on stored maize, sorghum and cowpea grains for periods of eight months. However, laboratory studies revealed that the devastating larger grain borer now spread throughout many African countries was more tolerant to DEs than the storage pests found in Zimbabwe. This initiated the testing of DEs in combination with other products. Higher DE application rates of 0. 25 %w/w, a DE-pyrethroid combination and a local African DE were successfully tested by farmers in Tanzania. During this work the importance of the link between a potential technology such as DEs and the wider post-harvest service provision context became clearer. This led to the exploration of this context using: an enquiry approach to learn about post-harvest decision making amongst diverse rural households; and an experimental learning process to empower farmers. As the nature of the different stakeholders within the agricultural innovation system and their information requirements became more central to the work, the importance of the patterns of interaction amongst them and associated attitudes was repeatedly revealed.

Other treatments included three commercially available synthetic chemical dilute dusts, containing 1. 6 % pirimiphos-methyl and 0. 3 % permethrin (Actellic Super and Stocal Super from different manufacturers) and 1 % fenitrothion and 0. 13 % deltamethrin (Shumba Super); traditional protectants; and a locally available DE collected from Kagera in north-west Tanzania. Treatments were applied to maize and sorghum grain and dried beans. Insect pests are the main threat during storage, which in Tanzania includes the devastating larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus. All the grain protectants, except the traditional ones, kept damage incidence well below that of the untreated controls, and usually below 10 % for periods of 40 weeks of storage. Exceptions occurred when grain was badly infested prior to treatment, in which case Actellic Super dust was more effective than the DEs. Very little difference in damage was observed between the DE treatments until 40 weeks of storage. In addition to the commercially available synthetic grain protectants, Protect-Its 0. 25 % w/w or Protect-Its 0. 1 % w/w plus permethrin at 2 mg/kg can be recommended to protect dry un-infested, winnowed maize and sorghum grain that is to be stored on-farm in sacks or woven granary baskets for periods of 4 months or more in Tanzania. Beans can be protected with lower application rates of Protect-Its 0. 05 % w/w or Dryacides 0. 1 % w/w.

Adult Tribolium confusum and Cryptolestes ferrugineus were placed on all surfaces at 15 to 19 °C and 65 - 81 % r. h [...] Mean corrected mortality after 14 d in T. confusum and C. ferrugineus was 94 % and 65 %, respectively. No significantly different mortality was recorded for T. confusum depending on surface type, but in C. ferrugineus significantly less beetles (20 %) died on concrete flagstone compared to natural flagstone, glazed ceramic flagging, plywood and porcelain stoneware. For bulk grain, 10 t of wheat were treated with either 0. 7 kg/t or 2 kg/t DE. Sitophilus granarius, Oryzaephilus surinamensis and C. ferrugineus adults were placed in vials with treated wheat together with data loggers and placed deep within the bulk for 19 d. Corrected mortality was around 90 % for all treatments except for S. granarius at the lower dose where 60 % mortality was achieved only...|$|R
40|$|The {{attached}} document {{is the final}} report of the Defra Project OF 0176. Demand for organic grain continues to grow and currently in the UK much has to be imported to satisfy the market. Expansion of UK production, together with continued imports, will see {{an increase in the}} need for effective grain storage using organic methods to preserve the quality of this valuable commodity. The objectives of this project were to conduct a desk study review to: 1) Highlight the main grain storage problems experienced by organic growers in the UK. 2) Bring together in a more convenient form technical information already available that will enable growers to tackle these problems more successfully. 3) Identify areas of current storage technology requiring a minimum of modification to ensure a smooth transfer from the conventional to the organic sector. 4) Identify areas where appropriate organic alternatives to conventional storage procedures do not exist that will require further research and development to find replacements. 	The following have been identified as areas requiring further research and development that are likely to provide important opportunities for improving the storage of organic grain: •	Store structure cleaning, including the effectiveness of vacuum cleaning and steam treatments, and the feasibility of using <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earths</b> to control invertebrate pests. •	Energy efficient drying and cooling systems, and consider the use of renewable energy sources including solar and wind power or the processing of waste products and energy crops. •	More effective invertebrate pest monitoring through improvements in sampling strategies, together with enhanced trap design and the incorporation of lures. •	Disinfestation using grain cleaners and hot air driers. •	Biological control for store structure treatments. This will require work to assess the effectiveness of naturally occurring biological control agents to treat residual infestations hidden in empty grain store structures. Strategies will need to be developed to encourage the development and conservation of beneficial invertebrates in stores, including the possible use of natural semiochemicals to manipulate their behaviour. •	Biological control for surface infestations of grain. As well as looking at the practicality of using top-dressing or bait trap application techniques to control grain surface infestations in cooled bins, {{there is a need to}} develop effective methods for the removal of beneficial invertebrates from the grain immediately before it is marketed. A more detailed Executive Summary can be found at the top of the main report. ...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{agriculture}} is facing many challenges to provide food security for a constantly growing human population. Unfortunately, it still {{relies heavily on}} fossil fuel-derived inputs, such as pesticides, which affect human health, biodiversity and contribute to global warming. In New Zealand, the endemic grass grub Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Melolonthinae) has been a pasture pest for more than 100 years. By consuming plant roots, its larvae reduce pasture yield, affecting both dairy and meat production. Recently, adults of this species have been found feeding on horticultural crops, such as kiwifruit, avocado, and vines, amongst others. In vineyards, adults damage vines by feeding on leaves, shoots and inflorescences and can produce a substantial defoliation, reaching in some cases 100 %. For this reason, prophylactic use of synthetic pyrethroids is practised as the main approach to control this pest. Pyrethroids are broad-spectrum insecticides, having clear impacts on arthropod diversity, but also their continuous application can have detrimental effects on human health and, like all such chemicals, can lead to pesticide resistance. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} work was to understand C. zealandica adult behaviour as it approaches and feeds on vine foliage and thus evaluate a sustainable approach to reduce its damage in vineyards without using pesticides. For this reason, a range of experiments were carried out on vineyards in Marlborough area of New Zealand, in the Awatere Valley (41 ° 44 ’S; 173 ° 52 ’E) during 2014 and 2015, and in Blenheim (41 ° 33 ’S; 173 ° 55 ’E) during 2015. By studying beetles’ distribution, through adult and larval sampling within vineyard blocks, higher adult and larval numbers were found {{at the edge of the}} vineyard compared to its centre. This distributional pattern was probably an expression of a relict adult behaviour in this species, in which females respond to plant silhouettes against the sky to feed and mate. Is therefore likely that in Marlborough vineyard-dominated landscapes, vines were the most abundant plant silhouettes, which might explain adult and larval abundance at the margin of studied vineyard blocks. In another experiment, by removing adults that landed on the vine foliage at several times after their daily flight activity started, it was demonstrated that females land before males on the vine foliage. Literature suggests that C. zealandica females attract males by releasing their pheromone, phenol. Based on those results, different experiments to evaluate the contribution of feeding and landing deterrents to reducing beetle damage were established at the studied vineyards. A novel, naturally-based approach to reduce adult damage in Marlborough vineyards by applying silica-derived feeding deterrents, such as hydrophobic particle films (HPF) and <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earths</b> (DE) on the vine foliage and secondly, by placing crushed mussel shells (MS) (Perna canaliculus; Mollusca: Mytilidae) under the vine-row as mulch was investigated in this work. A significant reduction in vine damage was produced by HPF and DE compared to control, with a 46 % damage reduction in Pinot Noir variety. MS significantly reduced the number of adults that landed on the vine plants when compared to control in Pinot Noir. To explore potential synergies between HPF and MS, these were combined in another experiment during the 2015 adult flight season at Blenheim. Adult C. zealandica damage was significantly reduced by 33 and 73 % by HPF and MS, respectively. Using infra-red sensitive video cameras it was demonstrated that MS significantly reduced activity of flying adults above treated vine plants (cv. Pinot Noir), which led to a 28 % increase in grape yield. It was suggested that the light reflective properties of MS reduced the necessary plant contrast with the sky, altering adult landing dynamics and subsequently, vine damage. These findings contribute to the reduction of pesticide use within this agro-ecosystem, and also remove the need for disposal of large quantities of these shells, which would otherwise go to the local landfill. There, the proteinaceous parts of the shell waste generate methane, a key contributor to greenhouse gases due to the anaerobic conditions present in the landfill. In addition, this management is in agreement with the cultural perception of kaitiakitanga, which is the spiritual consideration of protecting the land for descendants, rooted in Maori (New Zealand’s indigenous people) cultural heritage. In this work, a sustainable pest management strategy to reduce C. zealandica damage in vineyards was proposed, highlighting the importance of understanding insect behaviour to reduce pesticide applications and thus, promote environmentally-sound agricultural systems...|$|R
