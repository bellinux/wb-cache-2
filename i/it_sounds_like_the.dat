500|$|Beyoncé {{met with}} Polachek's bandmate of Chairlift, Patrick Wimberly, who collaborated {{with her sister}} Solange Knowles {{at that time and}} went with her on tour. During the tour, Beyoncé {{expressed}} her admiration of Wimberly, adding that she would [...] "love to get in the studio some time". Wimberly later contacted Beyoncé's management, and Polachek and himself were later invited to a studio in Manhattan to work on Beyoncé self-titled fifth studio album. They stayed in the studio for a week and when the duo was asked to submit the tracks to Beyoncé's team, Polachek added one song with complete production and a missing verse she had written while being on tour in the United Kingdom. At that time, she felt that the song [...] "could be a good album track for Chairlift, but it would be incredibly sexy if Beyoncé did it". Polachek further elaborated about the differences between her version of [...] "No Angel" [...] and Beyoncé's rendition, saying, [...] "Her groove was different—my vocals were jumpier, and hers were more like panting. And in my version the synths detuned really quickly for a second; she did the same thing but with her voice. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> whole song melts." ...|$|E

The Huffington Post {{described}} the song as a [...] "brassy and soulful tune [...] fits perfectly alongside the work of Shirley Bassey in the oeuvre of James Bond title tracks". RedEye gave the song four out of four stars and declared that it [...] "is a return to form, and if it doesn't get you hyped for the movie, you're not a Bond fan". The Daily Record named [...] "Skyfall" [...] its 'Single of the Week' and gave the song five stars out of five. PopCrush gave the song four-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "wholly satisfying and worth the wait". Idolator wrote that [...] "during the song's final third, Adele does, in fact, make the sky fall, in typical Adele fashion". Consequence of Sound commented that [...] "rousing instrumentation elevates the vocals to soaring heights", while HitFix called the song a [...] "majestic ballad" [...] and a [...] "classic James Bond theme". Newsday was also very positive, writing that [...] "Skyfall" [...] is [...] "unlike anything else she's done in her young career. It's self-assured and grand, drawing inspiration from Dame Shirley Bassey, while adding her own powerful phrasing to make it her own. Adele's style {{so far has been}} to downplay her massive voice with lyrics that are questioning and self-deprecating. On 'Skyfall,' though, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> diva point of view suits her, too".|$|E

[...] Nero also commented that the song sounded insincere compared with the rawly sexual songs on the album. Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes noted the song {{as some of the}} album's generic work, stating, [...] "with its run-of-the-mill lyrics about longing hearts, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work of any middling R singer." [...] Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said [...] "I Need A Girl" [...] was among the album's best songs, that it and [...] "Neighbors Know My Name", [...] "thump as they should." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic noted the song as a standout track from Ready. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that on the track, Songz [...] "displays a more flexible delivery than usual." [...] DJBooth said, [...] "Traditional R depends on three things: vocals, writing, and production. [...] In a nutshell, I Need A Girl has the whole trifecta, and should be just what Trey needs to get Ready a solid release date." [...] Reviewing the remix of the song featuring Teyana Taylor and Fabolous, DJBooth said, [...] "Expect the combo of Taylor’s cooed vocals and Trey and Loso’s time-tested musical chemistry to leave listeners more amped than ever before for the release of Songz’ [...] latest LP—after waiting this long, I think it’s safe to say they’re more than Ready." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following Mullen's {{return and}} the sessions' {{resumption}} in February 1996, the production team of Flood, Howie B, and Hooper spent three months attempting to re-work {{much of the}} band's material to better incorporate loops and samples with their musical ideas from 1995. This period was a difficult one; Mullen, in particular, had to record drum parts to replace loops that Howie B had sampled without permission. Flood said, [...] "We took what we had and got the band to play to it and work it into their own idiom, while incorporating a dance ethic... The groove-orientated way of making music can be a trap when there's no song; you end up just plowing along on one riff. So {{you have to try}} to get the groove and the song, and do it so that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> band, and do it so that it sounds like something new." ...|$|E

Stevie [...] just handed me his guitar {{and walked off}} stage, and I'm like, 'Are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He {{went back to the}} dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, {{and that was the end}} of the show." [...] According to Vaughan: [...] "It wasn't the whole crowd [...] It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz.

[...] In the New Yorker, novelist Nick Hornby criticised the obscured vocals and lack of guitar and wrote: [...] "The album is morbid proof {{that this sort of}} self-indulgence results in a weird kind of anonymity rather that something distinctive and original." [...] Melody Maker critic Mark Beaumont called the album [...] "tubby, ostentatious, self-congratulatory, look-ma-I-can-suck-my-own-cock whiny old rubbish... Are Radiohead trying to push the experimental rock envelope, unaware that they're simply ploughing furrows dug by DJ Shadow and Brian Eno before them?" [...] The Guardian wrote that Kid A sounded [...] "like a score composed for an experimental dance troupe" [...] and that it [...] "fails to sweep away preconceptions about Radiohead, pandering to the worst cliches about their relentless miserabilism".|$|E

6000|$|That {{year was}} a bad year, a year of world-wide {{economic}} disorganization. Through their want of intelligent direction the great [...] "Trust" [...] of American ironmasters, a gang of energetic, narrow-minded furnace owners, had smelted far more iron than the whole world had any demand for. (In those days there existed no means of estimating any need of that sort beforehand.) They had done this without even consulting the ironmasters of any other country. During their period of activity they had drawn into their employment {{a great number of}} workers, and had erected a huge productive plant. It is manifestly just that people who do headlong stupid things of this sort should suffer, but in the old days it was quite possible, it was customary for the real blunderers in such disasters, to shift nearly all the consequences of their incapacity. No one thought it wrong for a light-witted [...] "captain of industry" [...] who had led his workpeople into overproduction, into the disproportionate manufacture, that is to say, of some particular article, to abandon and dismiss them, nor was there anything to prevent the sudden frantic underselling of some trade rival in order to surprise and destroy his trade, secure his customers for one's own destined needs, and shift a portion of one's punishment upon him. This operation of spasmodic underselling was known as [...] "dumping." [...] The American ironmasters were now dumping on the British market. The British employers were, of course, taking their loss out of their workpeople as much as possible, but in addition they were agitating for some legislation that would prevent--not stupid relative excess in production, but [...] "dumping"--not the disease, but the consequences of the disease. The necessary knowledge to prevent either dumping or its causes, the uncorrelated production of commodities, did not exist, but this hardly weighed with them at all, and in answer to their demands there had arisen a curious party of retaliatory-protectionists who combined vague proposals for spasmodic responses to these convulsive attacks from foreign manufacturers, with the very evident intention of achieving financial adventures. The dishonest and reckless elements were indeed so evident in this movement as to add very greatly to the general atmosphere of distrust and insecurity, and in the recoil from the prospect of fiscal {{power in the hands of}} the class of men known as the [...] "New Financiers," [...] one heard frightened old-fashioned statesmen asserting with passion that [...] "dumping" [...] didn't occur, or that it was a very charming sort of thing to happen. Nobody would face and handle the rather intricate truth of the business. The whole effect upon the mind of a cool observer was of a covey of unsubstantial jabbering minds drifting over a series of irrational economic cataclysms, prices and employment tumbled about like towers in an earthquake, and amidst the shifting masses were the common work-people going on with their lives as well as they could, suffering, perplexed, unorganized, and for anything but violent, fruitless protests, impotent. You cannot hope now to understand the infinite want of adjustment in the old order of things. At one time there were people dying of actual starvation in India, while men were burning unsalable wheat in America. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> account of a particularly mad dream, does it not?
