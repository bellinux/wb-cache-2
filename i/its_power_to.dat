Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.|$|E
5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{events of}} the Dismissal led to only minor {{constitutional}} change. The Senate retained <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> block supply, and the Governor-General the power to dismiss government ministers. However, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office. Kerr was widely criticised by ALP supporters for his actions, resigned early as Governor-General, and lived much of his remaining life abroad.|$|E
5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolutionary War, {{city hall}} {{was home to}} the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the {{political}} arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government in 1775 and eventually expanded <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> control all of Albany County (which {{at that time was}} the largest county in the colony, extending far past its current borders). Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in city hall alongside common criminals. Following the war, city hall was an occasional meeting place of the newly formed New York Legislature, in addition to being home to the city and county governments, the jail, courts, and local registry.|$|E

5|$|Epstein accused Seltaeb of not {{accounting}} properly, and cancelled <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> grant licences, {{which started}} a counter-lawsuit by Byrne against Epstein's New York accountant, Walter Hofer, asking for $5,168,000 in damages. Epstein then instructed NEMS employees to {{deal directly with}} American companies, so Byrne instigated court proceedings, which took three years to settle, as it entailed 39 individual claims against NEMS. Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and legal bills himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it null and void. Due to the legal battle, Woolworth's, J. C. Penney, and other companies refused to finalise any merchandising agreements, cancelling orders worth $78 million. The court case and its effect was estimated to have lost NEMS and The Beatles approximately $100,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Kratos recovers Pandora's Box from Ares, opens it, {{and uses}} <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> become godlike. Despite Ares' {{best efforts to}} destroy Kratos {{physically}} and mentally, including stripping him of the Blades of Chaos and all magic, he survives and kills Ares with the Blade of the Gods. Athens is saved, and although Athena tells Kratos his sins are forgiven, the gods refuse to rid him of his nightmares. Forsaken by the gods, he tries to commit suicide by casting himself into the Aegean Sea, but Athena intervenes and transports him to Mount Olympus. As a reward for his services to the gods, she provides Kratos with {{a new set of}} blades and the seat as the new God of War.|$|E
5|$|That conquest was a {{consequence}} of the Augustan imperative of securing the Imperial borders. To effectively control the Alps as the shield of northern Italy, Rome needed to control both flanks of the mountain range. Thus it had to extend <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> the Rhine and Danube, thereby also opening a direct route to Germania and all of Central Europe. The last obstacle in this path were the Raetians. After a first expedition against them by Publius Silius Nerva in 16BC, a more thorough campaign by Drusus and the later emperor Tiberius brought Raetia – and thereby all of Switzerland – firmly under Roman control.|$|E

5|$|The Benedictine priory {{was closed}} in 1424 {{after many years}} of decline. It had long lost <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> the local nobility that were {{gradually}} replaced by the bourgeoisie in the mid-14th century. Nevertheless, Sélestat remained a religious centre even after the closing of the priory. Convents were established in the 13th century by Dominicans, Knights Hospitaller and Franciscans. Several abbeys located outside of the town also had a residence in town. At the beginning of the 16th century, Sélestat was a noted centre of Renaissance humanism thanks to its celebrated Latin school. Reformers Beatus Rhenanus and Martin Bucer were among the school's alumni. This school helped spread Protestant ideas among the population, although the local authorities remained faithful to Rome. Erasmus of Rotterdam visited Sélestat four times between 1515 and 1522.|$|E
5|$|The Yongzheng Emperor succeeded the Kangxi Emperor after {{a crisis}} that pitted many of the Kangxi Emperor's sons against one another. Many Manchu nobles who had sided with the Yongzheng Emperor's rivals during the {{succession}} struggle were still members of the Deliberative Council. To avoid alienating these grandees, the Yongzheng Emperor still made new appointments to the Council and consulted it on various military matters, but he also worked to undermine <b>its</b> <b>power.</b> <b>To</b> bypass the Council, he created smaller parallel bodies which he found more reliable and less entrenched. Slowly, he transferred deliberative powers to these more trusted ministers. Around 1730, these informal institutions crystallized into the Grand Council. Unlike the Deliberative Council, whose membership was almost exclusively Manchu, the Grand Council counted many Chinese among its ranks. This more ethnically mixed privy council served as the empire's main policymaking body {{for the rest of}} the Qing dynasty.|$|E
5|$|While in prison, Jack is {{contacted}} by Henry Turner, {{the son of}} Will and Elizabeth, to seek his aid in finding the Trident of Poseidon. Remembering Elizabeth and Will from his previous misadventures, Jack agrees but not before expressing some hesitation. The next day, Sparrow is sentenced to be executed by guillotine (by Jack's accidental choosing), but is rescued by Henry and his crew. Aided by aspiring astronomer Carina, Jack and Henry attempt to locate the Trident of Poseidon, as both {{are in need of}} <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> break curses related to the sea. Barbossa releases the Pearl from its bottle, giving them a chance to outrun Salazar. Jack and Barbossa discuss the fact that Carina is in truth Barbossa's long-lost daughter, whom he had left at an orphanage in order to give her a chance for a better life. Jack attempts to use the secret to blackmail Barbossa for his compass and 216 barrels of rum, but fails.|$|E

5|$|In 1754, {{representatives of}} seven British North American colonies {{met in the}} Stadt Huys, Albany's city hall, for the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan of Union there, {{which was the first}} formal proposal to unite the colonies. Although it was never adopted by Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. The same year, the French and Indian War, the fourth in a series of wars dating back to 1689, began; it ended in 1763 with French defeat, resolving a situation that had been a constant threat to Albany and held back its growth. In 1775, with the colonies {{in the midst of the}} Revolutionary War, the Stadt Huys became home to the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the political arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government and eventually expanded <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> control all of Albany County. Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in the Stadt Huys alongside common criminals. In 1776, Albany native Philip Livingston signed the Declaration of Independence at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1976 the {{military}} command structure was simple and direct. Major General Samantar {{was not only}} commander of the National Army – and therefore commander of the organizationally subordinated navy and air force- but also {{secretary of state for}} defence and a vice president of SRC and thus a member of the major decision-making body of the government. Holding the two highest.. posts, he stood alone in the command structure between the army and President Siad, the head of state. When in July 1976 the SRC relinquished <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> the newly appointed SSRP, Samantar retained the portfolio of the Ministry of Defense. The country's real power appeared to be in the SSRP's Politburo, of which Samantar became a vice president. Before {{the military}} coup, command channels ran directly from the commander of the National Army to army sector commanders who exercised authority over military forces.. in the field, and by 1986 combat units had been reorganized along Soviet lines. There is no indication that either the chain of command to lower echelons or the organisation of combat units has changed significantly since the coup.|$|E
5|$|Link is told by {{the priest}} in the {{sanctuary}} that Agahnim, a wizard who has usurped the throne, is planning to break a seal made {{hundreds of years ago}} by the Seven Sages. The seal was placed to imprison a dark wizard named Ganon in the Dark World, a near-mirror of Hyrule which was once known as the Sacred Realm before Ganon invaded it, obtained the legendary Triforce held there, and used <b>its</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> turn the realm into a land of darkness. Agahnim intends to break the seal by sending the descendants of the Seven Sages who made the seal into the Dark World. The only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, a sword that can only be wielded by the chosen hero and forged to combat evil. To prove that he is worthy to wield it, Link needs three magic pendants, hidden in dungeons guarded by mythical defenders. On his way to retrieve the first, he meets an elder, Sahasrahla, who becomes Link's mentor, offering hints and advice at key stages of the journey. After retrieving the pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that soldiers of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sanctuary keeper that Zelda has been taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but Agahnim's last act is to send Link to the Dark World as well.|$|E
