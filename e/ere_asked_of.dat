40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the alterations of the pain threshold and tolerance after single, or dual task in athletes. Twenty male athletes and twenty non - athletic, recreationally active college students were participated in the study. Subjects w <b>ere</b> <b>asked</b> to perform Harvard step test (single task), and cognitive task was concurrent performance of an arithmetic task while performing Harvard step test. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) and pressure pain tolerance (PPTO) were assessed from muscle, tendon, bone and myofascial region from the dominant thigh by using a digital algometer. All measurements were repeated at rest, or following single and dual task. Results are presented as mean + standart deviation. Data were analyzed by using repeated measures of ANOVA test. A level of p< 0. 05 was accepted statistical significant. Athletes had higher PPT and PPTO measurements from muscle and myofascial region of thigh at rest. PPT and PPTO values were increased after single, or dual task in sedentary subjects, w hile athletic subjects had increased muscle and myofascial PPT and PPTO values after dual task. In conclusion, our results supports the notion that cognitive functions may interact the pain processing at rest, or following exercise in athletes...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} report focuses on students' {{understandings of the}} limit concept in a first year Calculus course. The study was done in two phases. A concept test based on limits in Calculus was given {{in the first phase}} to all first year Mathematics students (m ostly men) from M edunsa. The students were divided into high, middle and low achievers on the basis of th e ir perform ance in this test. In the second phase three-students were random ly selected from each of the three groups. These subjects were individually interviewed. The interview was devised to obtain more inform ation about the conceptions that students held and the reasoning they used. Students w <b>ere</b> <b>asked</b> about their understanding of the limit concept and the methods they use to solve problem s on limits. Data from the transcripts, capturing essential and relevant bits of student's responses to each question, was collected. The data was analyzed and misconceptions identified. It was found that w hen solving problems on limits students only think of the manipulative aspect and not of the limit concept per se. They have in mind that the limit concept is about m echanical substitution. Also instead o f saying that the function is not defined at a point, they talk of a limit not being defined at a point. M isconceptions can be rem edied if educators are aware of them. The findings of the study are thus Im portant for designing appropriate teaching strategies not only fo r Medunsa students but more generally...|$|R
