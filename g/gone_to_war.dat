5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E

Keyes has stated that troops should stay in Iraq, but also said that he would have turned over operations to the United Nations. However, Keyes has also stated that even while he was an ambassador there he was not a supporter of the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, {{the city}} of Laredo, Texas, issued an arrest warrant for Treviño in {{connection}} with a 2006 double homicide in Texas. In 2008, Treviño Morales and Lazcano Lazcano, the two leaders of Los Zetas, forged an alliance with the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. It had just <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with the Sinaloa Cartel, believing that El Chapo Guzmán, their leader, had betrayed them. Treviño Morales subsequently joined them to kill the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. Government sources said Los Zetas were fighting for control against La Federación (The Federation), an alliance of several drug trafficking groups led by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán and Ismael El Mayo Zambada, two drug lords who used to work for the Beltrán Leyva Cartel.|$|E

40|$|This 11 th {{edition of}} Why nations <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> {{analyses}} ten case studies covering major international wars. The particular focus {{of each of}} the case studies turns upon the personalities of political and military leaders. Stoessinger emphasises that people <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> or precipitate wars. War is not some faceless entity that merely unfolds in some inexplicable way. In a critical stance towards attempts <b>to</b> explain <b>war,</b> the author holds that personalities often do not receive their due recognition in publications on war. Decisions by leaders <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> or leadership decisions that result in warlike acts causing societies or vulnerable sections of society to suffer, receive attention in this updated edition of Why nations <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> It is in the particular focus on people (the leaders who decide <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war)</b> where Stoessinger seeks for “… common truths about war in our time”...|$|R
5|$|Since its {{independence}} in 1947, India has maintained cordial relations with most nations. In the 1950s, it strongly supported decolonisation in Africa and Asia {{and played a}} lead role in the Non-Aligned Movement. In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice intervened abroad {{at the invitation of}} neighbouring countries: a peace-keeping operation in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an armed intervention to prevent a 1988 coup d'état attempt in Maldives. India has tense relations with neighbouring Pakistan; the two nations have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> four times: in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war, followed from India's support for the independence of Bangladesh. After waging the 1962 Sino-Indian War and the 1965 war with Pakistan, India pursued close military and economic ties with the Soviet Union; by the late 1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.|$|E

This paper provides a comparison of the willingness <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> in different OECD countries using World Values Survey data. The empirical findings in the United States, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden and West Germany, using the willingness to fight as a dependent variable, indicate that such factors as pride, trust, and political ideology significantly influence individuals' willingness <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> War, Pride, Trust,...|$|R
50|$|Iran and Iraq usually <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> {{against each}} other; Iran usually wins in the end, {{but this is}} always a {{protracted}} conflict with both sides trying {{to develop nuclear weapons}} — the war between Iran and Iraq is a source of game ends, where their exchange of nuclear weapons triggers a global holocaust. Egypt can sometimes decide <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> against Israel, and Syria sooner or later always decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> against Israel (although it will sometimes mop up Jordan and Lebanon first).|$|R

25|$|In 1890, the Fon {{kingdom of}} Dahomey and the French Third Republic had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> {{in what was}} remembered as the First Franco-Dahomean War over the former's rights to certain territories, {{specifically}} those in the Ouémé Valley. The Fon ceased hostilities with the French after two military defeats, withdrawing their forces and signing a treaty conceding to all of France's demands. However, Dahomey remained a potent force {{in the area and}} quickly re-armed with modern weapons in anticipation of a second, decisive conflict.|$|E
25|$|The Winter War {{also helped}} reaffirm the Swedish position. Aid to Finland {{had been as}} much about aiding a {{neighbour}} as about neutralising the public opinion calling for active intervention in the war. It also helped to establish the political priorities before the events of 9 April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The goal was now fixed on keeping Sweden out of the growing European conflict; {{if they had not}} <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> to defend Finland, {{there was no way that}} they would do it for Norway.|$|E
25|$|During the war, the Italian Royal Army {{increased}} {{in size from}} 15,000 men in 1914 to 160,000 men in 1918, with 5 million recruits in total entering service during the war. This came at a terrible cost: {{by the end of}} the war, Italy had lost 700,000 soldiers and had a budget deficit of twelve billion lira. Italian society was divided between the majority pacifists who opposed Italian involvement in the war and the minority of pro-war nationalists who had condemned the Italian government for not having immediately <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with Austria-Hungary in 1914.|$|E

25|$|After Confederation, and amid much controversy, a {{full-fledged}} Canadian military was created. Canada, however, remained a British dominion, and Canadian forces joined their British {{counterparts in the}} Second Boer War and the First World War. While independence followed the Statute of Westminster, Canada's links to Britain remained strong, and the British once again {{had the support of}} Canadians during the Second World War. Since then, Canada has been committed to multilateralism and has <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> within large multinational coalitions such as in the Korean War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and the Afghan war. Canada has also {{played an important role in}} United Nations peacekeeping operations worldwide and has cumulatively committed more troops than any other country.|$|E
25|$|Nehru {{had promised}} in 1948 {{to hold a}} {{referendum}} in Kashmir {{under the auspices of}} the UN. Kashmir was a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, the two having <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with each other over the state in 1947. However, as Pakistan failed to pull back troops in accordance with the UN resolution and as Nehru grew increasingly wary of the UN, he declined to hold a plebiscite in 1953. His policies on Kashmir and the integration of the state into India was frequently defended in front of the United Nations by his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, a brilliant diplomat who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Boeing built a {{large number}} of B-17 and B-29 bombers. Boeing ranked twelfth among United States {{corporations}} in the value of wartime production contracts. Many of the workers were women whose husbands had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> In the beginning of March 1944, production had been scaled up in such a manner that over 350 planes were built each month. To prevent an attack from the air, the manufacturing plants had been covered with greenery and farmland items. During these years of war the leading aircraft companies of the U.S. cooperated. The Boeing-designed B-17 bomber was assembled also by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and Douglas Aircraft Co., while the B-29 was assembled also by Bell Aircraft Co. and by Glenn L. Martin Company.|$|E

25|$|In 1756 Britain and France had {{formally}} <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> {{after initial}} clashes in North America. The French began the war successfully by capturing Menorca a British {{island in the}} Mediterranean. After this Britain had gained the initiative at sea and had begun a series of naval incursions on the French coast, such as the Raid on Rochefort (1757) and the Raid on Cherbourg (1758), pioneered by the Southern Secretary William Pitt. While the practical success of these was limited, they caused serious alarm throughout France and forced the French government to detach large numbers of troops to guard coastal areas against further British raids. Pitt suspended the campaign in late 1758 following an unsuccessful landing at Saint Cast, while remaining open {{to the idea of}} further operations against the vulnerable French coast.|$|E
25|$|In 1846, the era {{of peace}} was coming to a close. The United States had annexed the Republic of Texas, and the islands of the Caribbean seemed to be likely targets for further expansion. The Republic of Santo Domingo (the present-day Dominican Republic) had broken off from the Republic of Haiti in 1844, and the United States State Department needed to {{determine}} the new nation's social, political, and economic stability. The suitability of the Bay of Samana for U.S. Navy operations was also of interest. To find out, Secretary of State James Buchanan asked Porter to undertake a private investigation. He accepted the assignment, and on March 15, 1846, he left home. He arrived in Santo Domingo after some unexpected delays and spent two weeks mapping the coastline. On May 19, he began a trek through the interior that left him without communication for a month. On June 19, he emerged from the jungle, bitten by insects, but with the information that the State Department wanted. He then discovered {{that while he was}} away the United States had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with Mexico.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} his {{convalescence}} Childers {{returned to}} Molly at the Chelsea flat, but a month later he received an invitation to meet the Sinn Féin leadership in Dublin. Anticipating an offer of a major rôle, Childers hurried to Dublin but, apart from Collins, he found the Irish leadership wary, or even hostile. Arthur Griffith, in particular, looked on him as at best a renegade and traitor to Britain, or at worst as a British spy. He was appointed to join the Irish delegation from the as-yet-unrecognised Irish State to the Paris Peace Conference. This unpromising undertaking, as Childers saw it, was intended to advance the cause of Irish self-rule by reminding official representatives at the conference of the ideals of freedom over which Britain had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> In this they were unsuccessful, and Childers returned once again to London. He rented a house in Dublin, but Molly was reluctant to join him: mindful of her sons' education, and believing {{that she and her husband}} could best serve the cause by influencing opinion in London. She gave up their London home of fifteen years to settle in Dublin, at the end of 1919.|$|E
50|$|Democratic peace {{theory is}} a theory that {{suggests}} {{that the nature of}} democracy means that democratic countries will not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with each other.

25|$|As a {{strategic}} blow {{intended to prevent}} American interference in the Dutch East Indies for six months, the Pearl Harbor attack was a success, but unbeknownst to Yamamoto, it was a pointless one. In 1935, {{in keeping with the}} evolution of War Plan Orange, the US Navy had abandoned any intention of attempting to charge across the Pacific towards the Philippines at the outset of a war with Japan. In 1937, the US Navy had further determined even fully manning the fleet to wartime levels could not be accomplished in less than six months, and myriad other logistic assets needed to execute a trans-Pacific movement simply did not exist and would require two years to construct after the onset of war. In 1940, US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Harold Stark had penned a Plan Dog memorandum, which emphasized a defensive war in the Pacific while the US concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany first, and consigned Admiral Husband Kimmel's Pacific Fleet to merely keeping the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia. Moreover, it is questionable whether the US would have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> at all had Japan attacked only British and Dutch possessions in the Far East.|$|E
25|$|Galitsky's {{followers}} sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka are {{now working}} as gudok-players. They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. They wonder what might happen if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E
