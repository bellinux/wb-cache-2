This event can be produced during <b>installation</b> of <b>Riser</b> or later, due to mechanical fatigue of the riser armor layer. However, riser failure could be prevented by detecting the progressive rupture of the armor wires that compose the riser. This work describes a method for the detection of armor wires rupture.

40|$|Catenary risers {{can present}} during {{installation}} {{a very low}} tension close to seabed, which combined with torsion moment {{can lead to a}} structural instability, resulting in a loop. This is undesirable once {{it is possible that the}} loop turns into a kink, creating damage. This work presents a numerical methodology to analyze the conditions of loop formation in catenary risers. Stability criteria were applied to finite element models, including geometric nonlinearities and contact constraint due to riser-seabed interaction. The classical Greenhill's formula was used to predict the phenomenon and parametric analysis shows a “universal plot” able to predict instability in catenaries using a simple equation that can be applied for typical <b>risers</b> <b>installation</b> conditions and, generically, for catenary lines under torsion.

40|$|A {{waste removal}} program is being {{implemented}} for the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT) Operable Unit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The waste is being removed {{by means of}} remotely operated, in-tank, confined sluicing equipment. The waste removal operations in Tanks W- 3 and W- 4 in the North Tank Farm (NTF) have been completed and the equipment is being moved to the South Tank Farm (STF), {{where it will be}} used to remove the sludges from the six STF tanks (W- 5, W- 6, W- 7, W- 8, W- 9, and W- 10) beginning later this year. During sluicing operations the dry wells adjacent to each of the tanks are instrumented so that potential releases can be detected by means external to the tank. The method of detection is by monitoring the electrical conductivity of the water in the dry well associated with each tank. This report documents the dry well conductivity monitoring data for the period from July 1997 through January 1998. The dry wells monitored during this period include DW- 3, DW- 4, DW- 8, DW- 9, and DW- 10. The conductivity of the water passing through Pump Station 1 (PS 1) was also monitored. The principal activities that occurred during this period were the sluicing of Tanks W- 3 and W- 4 in the NTF, transfer of tank liquids from the NTF to the STF, and the <b>installation</b> of new <b>risers,</b> tank dome leveling, and emplacement of stabilized base backfill in the STF. Presented in this report are the dry well conductivity, rainfall, tank level, and STF construction information that is relevant to the analysis and interpretation of the monitoring data for the reporting period. A thorough analysis of the monitoring results for the period indicates that no releases have occurred from the gunite tanks being monitored...|$|R
40|$|The Oil and Gas (O&G) {{industry}} has recently turned its interest towards deep and ultra-deep offshore installations {{in order to}} address the global increase of energy demand. Pipelines and risers are key components for the production and transportation of oil and gas both in the offshore and onshore environment. The structural integrity and fracture control of pipes, which are major components for the exploration, production and transportation of fossil fuels {{have been the subject of}} extensive analysis in the past decade using classical fracture mechanics approaches, especially for the offshore case. The main driving force for this line of research was the fact that both the cost and the technical challenges increase disproportionally with water depth. In the deep and ultra-deep water environment the technical challenges include higher permanent and operational loads, extreme environmental conditions and the presence of corrosive agents. All the above mentioned parameters demand the use of modern fracture mechanics approaches. At the same time, the inaccessibility to structures located at depths of two to three kilometers, results in extreme repair costs. Due to the magnitude of environmental and financial consequences in the event of failure, the {{industry has}} established extremely conservative safety requirements resulting from outdated approaches for those types of structures. Furthermore, the O&G industry is reluctant to adopt novel fracture models, unlike other industries, such as the automotive and aerospace. Pipelines and risers need to be evaluated both from a structural and a financial perspective. The current thesis is proposing a new physics-inspired technology and computational capability for the prediction of fracture and structural failure of pipelines and risers operating in extreme conditions, such as deep and ultra-deep water environments subjected to extreme conditions and accidental loads. The computational tool employed in the current study is derived from a variational principle, combined with a cumulative measure of damage that is developed to control the fracture initiation. The calibration process of this methodology is achieved through a hybrid numerical experimental procedure. The material selection for this study was chosen naturally from the O&G and pipeline community. Traditionally, the O&G and pipeline industries have been using not only conventional fracture methods, but also conventional low-grades of steels for pipelines and risers, such as X 60 and X 70. However, deep and ultra-deep applications and the demand for increase of daily flow production pose new challenges in terms of harsh environmental conditions, increase of external diameter and higher operational loads. The industry is well aware of the fact that Advance High Strength Steels (AHSS), such as X 100 and X 120, can address those issues, but is not yet ready to introduce them, due to incomplete understanding of their material properties and structural behavior in the plastic and near failure range. Therefore, the current thesis offers a comprehensive study of two representative grades from both categories (X 70 and X 100), comparing their mechanical properties and completing a preliminary analysis quantifying the financial difference between the two for pipeline construction. Pipeline and <b>riser</b> <b>installations</b> are extremely capital intensive. They need to be evaluated both from a structural and a financial perspective, so that operating companies can quantify the integrity of their investments. The proposed thesis will develop a method using representations of oil prices and material costs along with a fracture mechanics model to improve the decision process of the material, the design, and the operating conditions of pipeline installations. This technique will not only attempt to account for the mechanical properties and structural integrity of the tubular component of interest but also to quantify the financial benefit of AHSS in the Oil and Gas community. by Kirki N.

40|$|Material fatigue is {{a failure}} mode that {{has been known to}} {{researchers}} and engineers since the 19 th century. Catastrophic accidents have happened due to fatigue failures of structures, machinery and transport vehicles. The capsizing of the semisubmersible rig Alexander L. Kielland in Norwegians waters in 1980 killed 123 people, and investigations pointed at the fatigue failure of a weld as one of the direct causes. This accident led to a number of improvements to the design of offshore structures. The noticeable safety principle ”No single accident should lead to escalating consequences” has since been adopted in a widespread manner. Since 1992 the Petroleum Safety Authority in Norway has enforced a risk based safety regime. Wells are designed to hold back reservoir pressures and avoid uncontrolled escape of hydrocarbons. In other words a well is a pressure containing vessel. Norwegian safety regulations require a dual barrier construction of wells. This safety principle ensures that one “barrier” is preventing an escalating situation should the other barrier fail. A wellhead is a heavy walled pressure vessel placed {{at the top of the}} well. The wellhead is part of the second well barrier envelope during drilling. The subsea wellheads are located at sea bottom and during subsea drilling the Blow Out Preventer (BOP) is placed on top of the subsea wellhead. The drilling riser is the connection between the BOP and the floating drilling unit. Waves and current forces acting on the drilling riser and drilling unit will cause dynamic movement. Flexible joints at top and bottom of the drilling riser protects the drilling riser from localised bending moments. The subsea wellhead is both a pressure vessel and a structurally load bearing component resisting external loads transmitted from a connected riser. These external loads can be static and cyclic combinations of bending and tension (compression). Cyclic loads will cause fatigue damage to the well. The well can take a certain amount of fatigue damage without failing. A fatigue failure of a WH system may have serious consequences. Should the WH structurally fail its pressure vessel function will be lost and for this reason WH fatigue is a potential threat to well integrity. The structural load bearing function will also be affected. Wellhead fatigue analysis can be used as a tool to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage. Analysis results then compares to a safe fatigue limit. This thesis addresses selected aspects of fatigue damage estimations of subsea wellheads and surface casings. The presented work is a contribution to the fatigue analysis methodology currently being developed within the industry. The well cement role as a boundary condition for surface casings in analytical models is particularly addressed. The majority of research focuses on the casing shoe and formation sealing, which is the primary objective of well cementing. Recent research focus on the cement limits conditions e. g. elevated temperatures. The “near-seabed” conditions of lead cements have seen less scrutiny. Some researchers have shown interest in this issue related to deep water cementing. Deep water bottom temperature is low all year round regardless of location latitude. Low sea water temperatures will depress the normal thermal gradient of the upper parts of the soil. Subsea wells are typically cemented using a lead and tail cement system, and the lead top casing cement will be pumped all the way to seabed. This lead cement will then be left curing in a low temperature environment. Hydration of cement is an exothermic chemical reaction, and the reaction rate is dependent on temperature. Laboratory measurements of low temperature early compressive strength of typical lead cement slurries are presented herein. In the North Sea the duration between placement of surface casing lead cement and <b>installation</b> of BOP/drilling <b>riser</b> will typical be around 24 hrs. Then dynamic riser loads will start acting on the upper part of a subsea well. Bending of the well causes relative motions between the conductor and surface casing. The cement around these casings will experience these relative motions. The combination of delayed cement setting due to low temperature and surface casing motions will cause localized failure of cement bonding in the upper part of the well. In subsea wellhead fatigue analysis finite element models are used. Boundary conditions in analytical models are important in ensuring similar behaviour of model and reality. One boundary condition in wellhead models is the lateral cement support of the surface casing. Modelling this cement support as infinitely stiff with a discrete vertical transition is the existing solution. In this work a modified boundary condition is presented based on low curing temperatures in combination with “premature” loading of the supporting cement. An overall analysis methodology approach has been suggested. Using a detailed local model of the well to define the lower boundary condition for the global riser load analytical model is one of its features. The implementation of a modified cement boundary condition will change the global stiffness of the local well model. The possible effect on global riser load from variations to the lower boundary condition has been studied. The conclusion supports the suggested analysis approach. Overall well ultimate structural strength will be reduced by the presence of a fatigue crack in a non pressurised load bearing part of a subsea well. An analysis methodology with case results are presented and indicate that the location of a fatigue crack affects the reduction in ultimate strength. Cases of significant reduction are expected to impact normal operating limitations. To be able to include the wellhead fatigue failure mode in an overall risk management system, the failure probability needs to be estimated. This can be done by applying a structural reliability analysis methodology to the problem. A suggested structural analysis methodology approach is suggested and notational failure probabilities are presented. Future improvements to wellhead fatigue analysis may emerge from calibrations from measurements of the reality. A comparison between analytical fatigue loading and measured fatigue loading has been presented and results indicate that the analysis results are conservative. This is evidence that analytical estimate on acceptable fatigue limits can be trusted from a safety point of view. It also indicates the monetary potential that measurements can present to the well...|$|R
