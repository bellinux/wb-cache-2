Experimental infections of 36 -day-old herring larvae resulted in 126 hosts infected with 306 H. aduncum larvae. Regression analyses {{showed a significant}} worm emigration from the rectum {{to the head of}} the fish, accompanied by an increase in worm body length. The emigration was independent of worm intensity, which suggests an ontogenetic process. Some worms departed from this pattern by moving posteriorly or by penetrating into the muscle, and in 5 cases, the larvae were observed to leave living fish. This individual variation has not been observed in previous studies and might be explained by host signals related to condition or development stage. Indirect evidence suggested parasite-induced mortality in the tanks due to the emigrations because only 4 of the 126 infected fish survived 8 days postinfection; the emigration of H. aduncum affected vital organs, such as the heart and brain, and the larvae penetrating or leaving the host's tissues can cause extensive damage to the delicate herring larvae.

40|$|Western Baltic {{spring-spawning}} <b>herring</b> (WBSSH, <b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus</b> L.) perform seasonal migrations between feeding {{grounds in}} the Skagerrak and Kattegat and their spawning {{sites in the}} Western Baltic Sea. The Sound, connecting the Kattegat to the Western Baltic Sea, is an important aggregation and transition zone for this herring stock during its spawning migration. We analysed data from the German autumn acoustic surveys of the years 1993 – 2009. These data revealed at least two different distribution patterns of herring in autumn: herring generally aggregated in the Sound, but in some years the majority of herring were detected further south, being outside of the Sound {{by the time of}} the survey. We tested whether observed annual differences in the herring migration can be explained by either stock characteristics (age and size) or hydrographical variables (salinity andoxygen concentration). Our results suggest that rather than being related to stock characteristics, the distribution pattern of herringwas related to environmental conditions, i. e. tomarine inflow events into the Baltic Sea. Barotropic inflow events in late summer and early autumn seem to prevent deoxygenation in the Sound and thereby favour the prolonged aggregation of herring in the Sound...|$|R

Using partial least-squares regression modeling, the sensor responses were correlated with data from chemical analyses (lipid oxidation products and antioxidants) and sensory analyses (odor). Eight of the 16 sensors proved significant in the correlation studies: 6 metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) sensors and 2 Taguchi type sensors. Correlation coefficients for chemical and sensory data ranged from 0. 9 to 0. 98 and from 0. 49 to 0. 92, respectively, with 0. 92 referring to both "sharp/acrid" and "rancid" odors. Prediction errors ranged from 8 to 14 % and from 11 to 25 % for the chemical and sensory measures, respectively. That the prediction errors for oxidation product formation (5 - 9 %) were close to the analytical errors of the chemical reference methods indicated close to "optimum" performance of the gas-sensor system.

40|$|Stock-separation {{of highly}} mobile Clupeids (sprat – Sprattus sprattus and <b>herring</b> – <b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus)</b> using otolith morphometrics was explored. Analysis focused on three stock {{discrimination}} {{problems with the}} aim of reassigning individual otoliths to source populations using experiments undertaken using a machine learning environment known as {WEKA} (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis). Six feature sets encoding combinations of size and shape together with nine learning algorithms were explored. To assess saliency of size/shape features half of the feature sets included size indices, the remainder encoded only shape. Otolith sample sets were partitioned by age so that the impact of age on classification accuracy could be assessed for each method. In total we performed 540 experiments, representing a comprehensive evaluation of otolith morphometrics and learning algorithms. Results show that for juveniles, methods encoding only shape performed well, but those that included size indices held more classification potential. However as fish age, shape encoding methods were more robust than those including size information. This study suggests that methods of stock discrimination based on early incremental growth are likely to be effective, and that automated classification techniques will show little benefit in supplementing early growth information with shape indices derived from mature outlines...|$|R
40|$|Norwegian Spring Spawning <b>herring</b> (NSSH) <b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus</b> L. spawn on coastal banks {{along the}} west coast of Norway. The larvae are {{generally}} transported northward in the Norwegian Coastal Current (NCC) with many individuals utilizing nursery grounds in the Barents Sea. The recruitment to this stock is highly variable with a few years having exceptionally good recruitment. The principal causes of recruitment variability of this herring population have been elusive. Here we undertake an event analysis using data between 1948 and 2010 to gain insight into the physical conditions in the NCC that coincide with years of high recruitment. In contrast to a typical year when northerly upwelling winds are prominent during spring, the years with high recruitment coincide with predominantly southwesterly winds and weak upwelling in spring and summer, which lead to an enhanced northward coastal current during the larval drift period. Also in most peak recruitment years, low-salinity anomalies are observed to propagate northward during the spring and summer. It is suggested that consistent southwesterly (downwelling) winds and propagating low-salinity anomalies, both leading to an enhanced northward transport of larvae, are important factors for elevated recruitment. At the same time, these conditions stabilize the coastal waters, possibly leading to enhanced production and improved feeding potential along the drift route to Barents Sea. Further studies on the drivers of early life history mortality can now be undertaken with {{a better understanding of the}} physical conditions that prevail during years when elevated recruitment occurs in this herring stock...|$|R

40|$|Food-limited {{growth of}} larval fish, defined as growth rates lower than {{observed}} in other habitats or from laboratory experiments {{at a given}} temperature, is rarely reported in field studies. This would imply that either larval fishes are living in an environment characterized by plenty of food, that nutritional condition selective mortality (i. e., eliminating the weak) is very strong, or this impression is caused by misinterpretation of data concerning e. g., poor taxonomical resolution of potential prey items, i. e., total potential prey abundance is high, but positively selected food is actually scarce. We analyzed RNA:DNA derived growth rates of <b>herring</b> larvae (<b>Clupea</b> <b>harengus</b> L.) and taxonomically differentiated prey field data of six consecutive spring seasons from the Kiel Canal, an artificial waterway in northern Germany, {{in order to test}} if food-limited growth in larval fish can occur recurrently in coastal habitats.

Furthermore, larval growth rates were observed to be lower than mean growth rates observed in another herring larvae nursery area at temperatures above 15 °C. Asymptotic relationships between prey abundance and larval growth rates were observed, further supporting the hypothesis of food-limitation. As larval growth was best explained by the abundance of the numerically dominant calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis, the paramount importance of the dominant prey item is highlighted. We conclude that food limitation can be a severe and re-occurring issue for larval fish in coastal habitats, and that certain prey items play a crucial role in determining larval growth rates, and therefore potentially recruitment...|$|R
