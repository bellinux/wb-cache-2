25|$|The {{climate in}} and around Reading is variable, but {{relatively}} mild. The Reading area is considered a humid subtropical climate, with areas just to the north designated as a humid continental climate. Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 85°F. Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 15–20 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90°F.

50|$|This report {{argued that}} the world is in a state in which it is {{particularly}} vulnerable to even modest declines in food production. In turn, small changes in average global temperature can have disproportionately large effects on crops. Agricultural studies predicting substantial declines in U.S. and Chinese crop production may be conservative, as they do not take into account ozone depletion or daily temperature extremes. They cite the example of the Mount Tambora volcanic eruption in 1815, which produced an average annual temperature deviation of only −0.7 °C, but which brought mid-summer <b>killing</b> <b>frosts</b> to the mid-Atlantic states and caused up to 75% crop losses in northern Europe.|$|R
25|$|Winters bring {{freezing}} temperatures, {{but usually}} move above freezing during the day's warmest point.

The all-time record low (not including wind chill) was −21°F during a widespread cold wave in January 1994. Snow is common in some winters, but the harsher winter conditions experienced to the north and west are not typical of Greater Reading. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 32inches. Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s later in Spring. The last <b>killing</b> <b>frost</b> usually is in later April, but freezing temperatures have occurred in May. Total precipitation for the entire year is around 45inches (112cm).|$|E
25|$|At long last, on October 28, a <b>killing</b> <b>frost</b> struck. The city {{sent out}} word to Memphians {{scattered}} {{all over the country to}} come home. Though yellow fever cases were recorded in the pages of Elmwood Cemetery's burial record as late as February 29, the epidemic seemed quieted. The Board of Health declared the epidemic, which caused over 20,000 deaths and financial losses of nearly $200 million, at an end. On November 27, a general citizen's meeting was called at the Greenlaw Opera House to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve and die. Over the next year property tax revenues collapsed, and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts. As a result of this crisis, Memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a Taxing District from 1878–1893. Although Memphis lost its charter and 75% of its population, a new era of sanitation was developed in Memphis. A new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization and during the 1880s led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements.|$|E

50|$|Onarga has a {{continental}} climate, with four distinct seasons. Onarga experiences cold winters, with frequent snowfall and temperatures that sometimes plunge to {{as low as}} -10 °F to -20 °F.

Springs are generally mild, and often rainy, windy, and cloudy with high temperatures averaging in the 50s (late-March) to 80s (early-June). Summers are hot and humid, generally with brief periods of intense thunderstorms and rainfall. Average summer high temperatures are in the mid to upper 80s, with highs in the lower 90s also common.

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{patterns}} of snowmelt and flowering times affect fruiting success in Erythronium grandiflorum Pursh (Liliaceae) in subalpine western Colorado, USA. From 1990 to 1995, I measured the consistency across years of snowmelt patterns and flowering times along a permanent transect. In most years since 1993, I have monitored fruit set in temporal cohorts (early- to late-flowering groups of plants) at one site. To assess ‘pollination limitation’, I have also conducted supplemental hand-pollination experiments {{at various times}} through the blooming season. The onset of blooming is determined by snowmelt, with the earliest years starting {{a month before the}} latest years owing to variation in winter snowpack accumulation. Fruit set is diminished or prevented entirely by <b>killing</b> <b>frosts</b> in some years, most frequently but not exclusively for the earlier cohorts. When frosts do not limit fruit set, pollination limitation is frequent, especially in the earlier cohorts. Pollination limitation is strongest for middle cohorts: it tends to be negated by frost in early cohorts and ameliorated by continuing emergence of bumble-bee queens in later cohorts. This lily appears to be poorly synchronized with its pollinators. Across the years of the study, pollination limitation appears to be increasing, perhaps because the synchronization is getting worse...|$|R

(1963) to avoid confusion with the mathematical us-age of “singularities. ” These features are commonly identified as consistently observed warm or cold de-partures from the annual march of temperature, or as wet or dry departures from some background an-nual precipitation trend. Historically, the most studied singularity in Euro-pean weather lore is an alleged cold period during 11 – 14 May, popularly known as the Ice Saints, named after the last <b>killing</b> <b>frosts</b> that seemingly tend to oc-cur on days dedicated to Saints Mamertus, Pancras, Servatius, and Boniface on the ecclesiastical calendar (e. g., Buchan 1869; Talman 1919; Huschke 1959).

40|$|Based on {{research}} to date, we can state some expectations about terrestrial ecosystem response as several elements {{of global climate}} change develop in coming decades. Higher plant species will vary considerably in their response to elevated UV-B radiation, but the most common general effects are reductions in height of plants, decreased shoot mass if ozone reduction is severe, increased quantities of some phenolics in plant tissues and, perhaps, reductions in foliage area. In some cases, the common growth responses may be lessened by increasing CO 2 concentrations. However, changes in chemistry of plant tissues will generally not be reversed by elevated CO 2. Among other things, changes in plant tissue chemistry induced by enhanced UV-B may reduce consumption of plant tissues by insects and other herbivores, although occasionally consumption may be increased. Pathogen attack on plants may be increased or decreased as a consequence of elevated UV-B, in combination with other climatic changes. This may be affected both by alterations in plant chemistry and direct damage to some pathogens. Water limitation may decrease the sensitivity of some agricultural plants to UV-B, but for vegetation in other habitats, this may not apply. With global warming, the repair of some types of UV damage may be improved, but several other interactions between warming and enhanced UV-B may occur. For example, even though warming may lead to fewer <b>killing</b> <b>frosts,</b> with enhanced UV-B and elevated CO 2 levels, some plant species may have increased sensitivity to frost damage.

This three-year study at the Sevilleta LTER was designed to monitor net primary production (NPP) across two distinct ecosystems: pinon/juniper woodland (P) and juniper savannah woodland (J). Net primary production (NPP) is a fundamental ecological variable that measures rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP are important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well as spatial and temporal responses of the community {{to a wide range of}} ecological processes. While measures of both below- and above-ground biomass are important in estimating NPP, this study focused on estimating above-ground biomass production (ANPP). To measure ANPP (i. e., the change in plant biomass, represented by stems, flowers, fruit and foliage, over time), the vegetation variables in this dataset, including species composition and the cover and height of individuals, were sampled twice yearly (spring and fall) at permanent 1 m x 1 m plots. The data from these plots was used to build regressions correlating biomass and volume via weights of select harvested species obtained in SEV 157, "Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data.
