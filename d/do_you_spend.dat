We set out to make a fable or a fairy tale about what happened to the positive view of the future and how can we get it back and pursue that idea. For better or worse, we did." ...|$|R
40|$|Freshman {{international}} students with intermediate Japanese level need prepare for their academic {{life in the}} first semester. In this course we introduced the learning-support system (Jenzabar), and implemented 3 complementary points as follows: I inter-face reading lessons (classroom), II individual readings in class (computer room), III individual readings outside class (home). As a result, both reading classes received above average class evaluations, especially on the following points: 'How much time <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> preparing for this class?', 'Did the instructor listen to students' comments and questions?', 'Was this class easy to understand?', and 'Overall were you satisfied with this class?'. 'Blended learning' combines interface learning {{in the classroom and}} E-learning from home. In this research, we used computer rooms for linking the classroom and home. We consider this system of 'transitional blended learning' especially effective for teaching {{international students}}...|$|R

40|$|What {{documents}} do you use? How {{much of your}} document {{are others}} likely to read? How much time <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> using docu-ments? Desktop electronic document manipulation {{is one of the}} most common activities performed by computer users, yet there remains little empirical research into how documents are used in common document navigation systems. This paper presents a 14 participant, 120 day study that logged user actions in Microsoft Word and Adobe Reader, with the aim of char-acterising document use. The study found that Microsoft Word documents are likely to be significantly shorter but have longer pe-riods of interaction compared to Adobe Reader documents. Word documents averaged 6 pages in length and Reader documents 38 pages. Documents that were ten pages or less made up 80 % of those that were opened. Approximately half of the documents viewed were reopenings of ones previously used, however history mechanisms were poorly utilised. Document coverage in Microsoft Word was approximated by a normal distribution, while Reader document coverage decrea-sed in a linear fashion, the further one moved toward the end. The time spent with multiple documents open decreased exponentially as the number of documents open increased. We briefly discuss the implications these findings have for the design of document navi-gation systems...|$|E
40|$|Are {{you having}} trouble keeping abreast of your Twitter feed? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> {{too much time}} {{trying to work out}} who is worth {{following}} and who is just selling stuff? Its time to prune your feed. There are lots of apps out there that let you unfollow your unfollowers, but Feed Pruner is more intelligent. It automates that fiddly process where you visit someones profile and try to work out if they are interesting and if they are likely to engage with your content. Clean your feed and make it more powerful and less annoying. (1) Golden Ratio: shows you the ratio of followers-following of all the people in your feed displayed as a list, and allows you to unfollow those with a low ratio. These accounts are likely to be spammers, bots, or just plain uninteresting. (2) If one of those accounts is your boring cousin that you cant unfollow because genetics not pointing a finger here Brian - you can just hide him from the list by swiping left. (3) User Engagement: shows you who does, and who does not, engage with your content displayed as a list. If they dont retweet or mention you at all, that probably means they dont read your content. (4) You can also unfollow your unfollowers {{if you want to be}} old-fashioned. (5) You can reverse the order on both User Engagement and Golden Ratio so that you can see who is the most engaged with your content, who interacts the most, and who has the highest ratio. Thats cool too. Feed Pruner does exactly what it says on the box: spring cleans your Twitter feed. There are no ads in Feed Pruner, no in-app purchases - in fact wed like to help you get rid of clutter...|$|E

40|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{established}} way to measure expenditure {{in the context of}} a general purpose survey. Therefore NatCen's Questionnaire Development Testing (QDT) Hub, working in collaboration with the Institute for Fiscal Studies and collaborators from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, are looking at how best to measure expenditure in a social survey context. This report provides findings from the cognitive testing of four different question formats: 1. A 'one-shot' question i. e. a single question asking 'How much <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>spend</b> on everything in the last month?' 2. A 'two-part' question i. e. two questions, one that asks about spending on essentials and one that asks about spending on everything else. 3. A 'breakdown' question i. e. that asks respondents to say how much they spend on each item on a list of common types of expenditure 4. And 'income minus surplus' question that asks respondents to work out how much money they receive per month and how much of that income remains unspent. It is possible that spending can be calculated from this information. This project is funded by the Nuffield Foundation...|$|R
