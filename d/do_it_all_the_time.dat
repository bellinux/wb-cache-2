So I went down to a place called Twickenham, where this football game was to be, to see the sort of thing you used to do before I took charge of you and made you a respectable right-hand man. There was an enormous crowd there, and I was nearly squeezed to death, but I bore it for your sake. I found out that the English team were the ones wearing white shirts, and that the ones in red were the Welsh. I said to the man next to me, after he had finished yelling himself black in the face, [...] "Could you kindly inform me which is the English scrum-half?" [...] And just at that moment the players came quite near where I was, and about a dozen assassins in red hurled themselves violently on top of a meek-looking little fellow who had just fallen on the ball. Ginger, you are well out of it! That was the scrum-half, and I gathered that that sort of thing was a mere commonplace in his existence. Stopping a rush, it is called, and he is expected to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> The idea of you ever going in for such brutal sports! You thank your stars that you are safe on your little stool in Fillmore's outer office, and that, if anybody jumps on top of you now, you can call a cop. Do you mean to say you really used to do these daredevil feats? You must have hidden depths in you which I have never suspected.|$|E

5000|$|For example, {{faced with}} a situation, the {{language}} which people use to talk about it, reveals that they can jump very quickly from one context to another related context, knowing very well {{that at least some}} of the inferences that can be drawn in the one context are not operative in the other context. That's because they know that the assumptions in one context differ to some degree from the other. Nevertheless, the two contexts can coexist, and can be contained in the same situation, which we can demonstrate by identifying the mediating links. This is difficult to formalize precisely, yet people <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and think it perfectly [...] "reasonable". For another example, people will say [...] "you can only understand this if you are in the situation yourself" [...] or [...] "on the ground."

[...] He later felt it was a poor reason, [...] "but in the end when I figured out the structure of it it was just gonna fall within what an Atari could do." [...] He later explained the length of the song to watching a film: [...] "It should probably have been shorter, I know that, that opening track. On the other hand I thought it's a little bit like going to see a film.

As such, it only encompasses {{a small part of}} practical reasoning, which is concerned with selecting, commit-ting to, and executing plans of action.
