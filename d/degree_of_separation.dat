5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which {{the tips of the}} arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> between the de-oxygenated {{bloodstream}} destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E

For it, some researches have been madeNewm 21, Aoyama. Recently we have develop a formalism Toyota 3,Toyota 4 to explore the subject based on the string formalism developed by AoyamaAoyama. The formalism can systematically investigate the effect of closed paths, especially generalized clustering coefficient C_(p) introduced in Toyota 4, on six <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b> In this article, we analyze general q-th <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> by using the formalism developed by us. So {{we find that the}} scale free network with exponent γ= 3 just display six <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b> Furthermore we drive a phenomenological relation between the separation number q and C_(p) that has crucial information on circle structures in networks.

25|$|Parallel plate {{separators}} {{are similar}} to API separators but they include tilted parallel plate assemblies (also known as parallel packs). The parallel plates provide more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules. Such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water. However, the parallel plates enhance the degree of oil-water separation. The result is that a parallel plate separator requires significantly less space than a conventional API separator {{to achieve the same}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hand axes {{made using}} only a soft hammer {{are much less}} common. In most cases at least initial work was done with a hard hammer, before {{subsequent}} flaking with a soft hammer erased all vestiges of that work. A soft hammer is not suitable {{for all types of}} percussion platform and it cannot be used on certain types of raw material. It is, therefore, necessary to start with a hard hammer or with a flake as a core as its edge will be fragile (flat, smooth pebbles are also useful). This means that although it was possible to manufacture a hand axe using a soft hammer, it is reasonable to suppose that a hard hammer was used to prepare a blank followed by one or more phases of retouching to finish the piece. However, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> between the phases is not certain, as the work could have been carried out in one operation.|$|E
25|$|Members who do {{not conform}} to these {{community}} expectations and who cannot be convinced to repent are excommunicated. In addition to excommunication, members may be shunned, a practice that limits social contacts to shame the wayward member into returning to the church. Almost 90 percent of Amish teenagers choose to be baptized and join the church. During an adolescent period of rumspringa ("running around") in some communities, nonconforming behavior that would result in the shunning of an adult who had made the permanent commitment of baptism, may meet with a degree of forbearance. Amish church groups seek to maintain a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> from the non-Amish world, i.e. American and Canadian society. There is generally a heavy emphasis on church and family relationships. They typically operate their own one-room schools and discontinue formal education after grade eight, at age 13/14. Until the children turn 16, they have vocational training under the tutelage of their parents, community, and the school teacher.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} period of the 17th century, Pierre Bayle and some fideists were {{forerunners}} of the separation of Church and State, maintaining that faith was independent of reason. During the 18th century, the ideas of Locke and Bayle, in particular the separation of Church and State, became more common, promoted by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment. Montesquieu already wrote in 1721 about religious tolerance and a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> between religion and government.

2500|$|Findings for gorillas are mixed. [...] At {{least four}} studies have {{reported}} that gorillas failed the MSR test. [...] It {{has been suggested that}} the gorilla may be the only great ape [...] "which lacks the conceptual ability necessary for self-recognition". [...] Other studies have found more positive results, but have tested gorillas with extensive human contact, and required modification of the test by habituating the gorillas to the mirror and not using anaesthetic. [...] Koko reportedly passed the MSR test, although this was without anaesthetic. [...] In gorillas, protracted eye contact is an aggressive gesture and they may therefore fail the mirror test because they deliberately avoid making eye contact with their reflections. [...] This could also explain why only gorillas with extensive human interaction and a certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> from other gorillas and usual gorilla behaviour are more predisposed to passing the test.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the highest}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation,</b> {{it can be}} {{difficult}} to draw the line between light rail and metros, as in the case of Wuppertal's Schwebebahn hanging rail system, the [...] "D" [...] Branch of Boston's Green Line, or London's Docklands Light Railway, which would likely not be considered [...] "light" [...] were it not for the contrast between it and the London Underground. These may be considered to be light metro lines rather than [...] "light rail" [...] lines. In Europe, however, the term light rail is increasingly used to describe any rapid transit system with a fairly low frequency or short trains compared to heavier mass rapid systems such as the London Underground or Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit. For instance, the LRT-1 and MRT-3 in Manila are often referred to as [...] "light rail", despite being fully segregated, mostly elevated railways. This phenomenon is quite common in Chinese cities, where elevated light metro lines in Shanghai, Wuhan, and Dalian are called light rail lines. In North America, such systems are not considered light rail.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commercial}} {{development of the}} Cell occurred indirectly {{as a result of}} problems being experienced in MIM's Mount Isa lead–zinc concentrator (sometimes referred to as a [...] "mill" [...] in the mining industry). MIM had been operating a lead–zinc concentrator at Mount Isa since 1931, although lead–zinc ore was substituted with copper ore for a time between mid-1943 and mid-1946. Over time, the lead, zinc and other mineral grains in the ore became progressively finer, the ore grade decreased and it became more difficult to treat. These trends, combined with an increase in the concentrator's throughput, significantly reduced the concentrator's performance in the 1980s, resulting in a [...] "tense" [...] period of [...] "an endless circle of circuit changes, reagent changes, operator changes, metallurgist changes, and so on". The decreasing grain size and pushing the grinding circuit beyond its design throughput meant a reduction in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> of the individual mineral grains (referred to as [...] "liberation") during grinding. From 1984 to 1991, the liberation of sphalerite (the zinc-bearing mineral, ZnS) decreased from almost 70% to just over 50%. This decrease in liberation resulted in a reduction in the recovery of zinc to saleable zinc concentrate.|$|E
60|$|Our naturalist {{would then}} perhaps turn to {{geographical}} distribution, {{and he would}} probably declare that those forms must be distinct species, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as damp or dry countries, and for the Artic regions. He might appeal {{to the fact that}} no species in the group next to man--namely, the Quadrumana, can resist a low temperature, or any considerable change of climate; and that the species which come nearest to man have never been reared to maturity, even under the temperate climate of Europe. He would be deeply impressed with the fact, first noticed by Agassiz (7. 'Diversity of Origin of the Human Races,' in the 'Christian Examiner,' July 1850.), that the different races of man are distributed over the world in the same zoological provinces, as those inhabited by undoubtedly distinct species and genera of mammals. This is manifestly the case with the Australian, Mongolian, and Negro races of man; in a less well-marked manner with the Hottentots; but plainly with the Papuans and Malays, who are separated, as Mr. Wallace has shewn, by nearly the same line which divides the great Malayan and Australian zoological provinces. The Aborigines of America range throughout the Continent; and this at first appears opposed to the above rule, for most of the productions of the Southern and Northern halves differ widely: yet some few living forms, as the opossum, range from the one into the other, as did formerly some of the gigantic Edentata. The Esquimaux, like other Arctic animals, extend round the whole polar regions. It should be observed that the amount of difference between the mammals of the several zoological provinces does not correspond with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> between the latter; so that it can hardly be considered as an anomaly that the Negro differs more, and the American much less from the other races of man, than do the mammals of the African and American continents from the mammals of the other provinces. Man, it may be added, {{does not appear to have}} aboriginally inhabited any oceanic island; and in this respect, he resembles the other members of his class.|$|E
