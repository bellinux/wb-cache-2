40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of wood filler additions on the microstructure, fractographic features and cracking mechanism of low density polyethylene (LPDE). Design/methodology/approach: For the tests, waste polyethylene from industrial and common films and Lignocel CB 120 wood fibers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used.</b> <b>Three</b> types of compositions (composites) with 10, 20 and 30 % of wood flour have been prepared for the tests. To evaluate the role of used filler conducted it’s quantitative analysis by linear method. Parameters like volume fraction of the filler, the number particles of wood flour per surface area and mean wood fiber diameter, were determinated. Findings: The results of microscopic observations of the etched sections and fractures obtained at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperature indicate good matching between the filler particles and the structure of basic polymer, due mainly to bonding of the individual lamellae in spherulites. The reinforced polymer reveals a cracking micromechanism which is called crazing. Research limitations/implications: The further research are required {{to solve the problem of}} the filler contrast. Practical implications: From practical point of view, this research can be used to project composites (wood flour – polyethylene).

It was initiated with the purpose to provide insights into developing students‟ skills in GL 2 and aspects of Greek culture and history. The mini syllabus was developed on the basis of criteria for developing sustainable CLIL teaching as suggested by Coyle‟s 4 Cs framework (2007) and was designed around ten units with famous Greek ancient monuments being at the core. For the estimation of the feasibility of this project, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>three</b> basic tools a) a pre- and a post- test about the language and the content knowledge assessment, b) journals kept by the teacher and c) portfolios kept by the students throughout the project.

A commercial grade of engobe and green body from one of the national tile companies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used.</b> <b>Three</b> factors namely: particle size of glaze slurry, sintering time and temperature were selected to identify {{the influence of}} these factors on the quality of glaze. A Taguchi L 8 Orthogonal Arrays, fractional factorial design, was used to optimize experimental trials. This approach successfully categorized the effect of each variable using only 8 experimental trials and identified the most important variables affecting this glaze making process with the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The quality control tests of floor tile such as thermal shock resistance, specking resistance and surface hardness were carried out according to the existing Iranian standard. The optimized samples were obtained by factorial design analysis; taking into account coarser particle size, higher temperature and less time. The optimized sample was counter checked using Taguchi method and by selecting effective factors in high levels. It was demonstrated that, the particle size of the slurry is the only significant parameter and sample with high level in particle size and temperature of sintering is the best sample according to existing standard of floor tile...|$|E

The causes for repair and/or strengthening can be many, but normally change of use, increased {{demands on the}} structure, errors in the design or/and construction phase or accidents are governing. Many methods to repair or/and strengthen concrete structures exists such as concrete overlays, shotcrete, external prestressed cables etc. This report presents laboratory tests where concrete T-beams with a length of 6 meters have been strengthened. External prestressed cables and epoxy bonded CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) rods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used.</b> <b>Three</b> beams had external tendons, two with steel tendons and one with CFRP. Three beams were strengthened with epoxy bonded CFRP Near Surface Mounted Rods (NSMR). On one of those beams the rods were prestressed before bonding. One beam hade post-stressed internal steel tendons and also a non strengthened reference beam was tested. The results showed that all tested strengthening techniques increased the load carrying capacity of the beams. The beam with external tendons of CFRP obtained problems with the anchor and could therefore not be prestressed to the desired level, which also then had effect on the strengthening level. The other strengthened beams recorded for a strengthening level from 81 % to 107 % depending on the technique used. The tests scores show that prestressing is a very effective strengthening method to increase the load carrying capacity of existing concrete beams. Godkänd; 2005; 20080522 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|Remote sensing {{estimates}} of the surface energy balance, and daily evapotranspiration (LEd) in particular, have become essential in recent studies on climatology,meteorology and hydrology. High spatial resolution satellites such as Landsat or ASTER provide surface information at pixel resolutions on the order or below 100 m, but the low frequency of repeated coverage limits the utility of these sensors in the routine monitoring of LEd. Daily coverage is provided by regional to global sensors such as MODIS (1000 m) or METEOSAT (5000 m). However, most of the surface variability is lost at these coarse spatial resolutions. Recent studies have explored the possibility to estimate subpixel energy fluxes, at the spatial resolution of the sensor visible bands, to recover the mentioned surface variability. In this work, it has been firstly evaluated the loss of information in surface temperature variability with the degradation of the spatial resolution of a satellite image. Secondly, a disaggregation procedure to estimate subpixel surface temperatures has been applied at different spatial resolutions. Finally, a Simplified Two-Source Energy Balance (STSEB) model {{has been used to}} evaluate the effect of the disaggregation technique on the surface fluxes retrieval.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} a part of Forsmarks Kraftgrupp AB's {{evaluation}} of a turbulence model used in simulation of turbulent flow called PRNS (Partially Resolved Numerical Simulation). This model has promising properties and may be of use in saving computational resources. The purpose of this thesis was to analyze this model and compare it with industrially applied models such as k-omega SST and LES (Large Eddy Simulations). PRNS works as a hybrid of the k-omega SST and DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) where a constant, RCP (Resolution Control Parameter) with a value between 0 and 1 are selected. This constant is then used in the calculations and determines the behavior of the simulation. When RCP is set to zero the equation are the same as for a DNS simulation and when RCP is set to one the equations for k-omega SST is solved. In this report four different PRNS models <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used,</b> <b>three</b> where RCP was given a constant value (0. 1, 0. 4 and 0. 6). In the fourth model RCP is calculated from the flow field variables The models have been compared to an experiment from 2008 and simulations have been made to resemble the experiment. In the experiment a Particle Image Velocimeter (PIV) was used as method of measurement. From the experimental report data such as velocity (U), turbulent kinetic energy (k) and standard deviation (URMS) have been obtained and have formed the basis for comparison. The models have been simulated in two different software programs: OpenFOAM and Fluent. The data have thereafter been post processed in the software programs MatLab and ParaView, to be compared with experimental data. The results of the simulations have shown that PRNS models generally show a good accordance with experimental data. In particular, PRNS models with constant RCP have shown good results, however, there are some discrepancies. The PRNS model with varying RCP has in most cases showed the largest deviation from experimental data but also a deviation from the other models, including the reference models. Due to the design of the mesh (coarse) further evaluation of the PRNS models will be needed. First, simulate with a finer mesh, but also more complex geometries should be simulated in order to sort out PRNS strengths and weaknesses and thus determine if the model can be used in the daily work at Forsmarks Kraftgrupp AB...|$|E
40|$|Literature {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{suitable}} means for verbalizing affectivity. According to Widdowson (1998), it expresses the inexpressible and, we add, the most basic human emotions, such as fear, anger, or love. As language is deeply embedded in culture, we question how far different linguistic renderings of the same poem of a canonical author may move readers in two different cultural settings: Brazilian and Ukrainian. To this purpose, we compare three translations of Poe’s “The Lake” into Portuguese, Russian and Ukrainian and check whether the reactions previously obtained from the respondents in these two national settings (see Chesnokova et al. 2016) can be linked to what each translator decided to foreground in the translated version. As indicated by Chesnokova et al. (2016), the reactions of Brazilian and Ukrainian readers to the original English version differed: the former group perceived it under a more negative light than the latter. For instance, Brazilians believed the poem to be darker, lonelier, more mysterious and more solitary than Ukrainians. The responses to the translated versions of the poem in the respondents’ first language also proved to be culture-specific. Brazilian readers reacted to the translation into Portuguese rather negatively when compared with readers of Ukrainian and Russian versions. They found the text darker, more nostalgic and less exciting. The most positive response was elicited by Ukrainian participants who have Russian as their first language: they saw the Russian version as less sad and less melancholic. In contrast, the Ukrainian version read by participants who have this language as their L 1 aroused rather negative feelings. These respondents found the translation darker, more mystical and less dreamy when compared to the other versions. The affective differences in reactions were then matched against the translators’ stylistic choices, and we believe that these differences could be attributed to the way language has been used. For example, the Russian version is the only one out of four in which exclamatory sentences <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>three</b> times, thus making the text sound more emotional and positive. On the metaphoric level, in this version, the translator creates the image of night as a queen of dreams that enhances the positive romantic flavour. Unlike the other two translations, the Ukrainian version stands out as having a more negative tone: the original subject (the narrator) is replaced by the word “terror”; the wind mentioned in the original version becomes abrupt and ominous in the translation, and death is personified and literally ‘waits’ for the narrator. These and other stylistic differences will be detailed, supporting the argument that there seems to be a link between the respondents’ reactions and the language in which they read the poem...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{sensitization}} is {{the development}} of the allergic contact dermatitis caused by chemicals. Regulatory accepted methods to assess skin sensitizing potential of chemicals are animal based tests, but increasing interest in animal welfare presses the development of animal-free methods. The aim of this work was the development, establishment and validation of several alternative methods to animal testing to predict the skin sensitizing potential of chemicals. Therefore several methods reflecting different parts of the complex sensitization process <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used.</b> <b>Three</b> steps of the skin sensitizing process were depicted: protein reactivity of chemicals, activation of keratinocytes and dendritic cell like cells have been investigated. Establishment and validation of the methods was performed with 54 test substances of known sensitizing potential, and the findings were compared to available human patch test data and murine local lymph node assay data. The experimental data were used to calculate the predictivity of each assay in order to compare the several assays and as well to evaluate possible combinations. By combination of different assays or more specifically the combination of the outcome of different assay into a testing strategy or testing battery predictivities were increased and allowed the prediction of sensitizing and non-sensitizing substances with high probability. The development of new methods to predict the protein reactive potential of sensitizing substances indicated that such compounds are able to react with proteins on the cell surface and that this reaction impacts the detection of such proteins by antibody staining. After treatment with sensitizing substances less protein was detectable and two hypotheses were proposed and investigated: It was shown that antibody binding was reduced or fully inhibited but also that the internalization of the altered protein was triggered. A correlation between the sensitizing potential and the altered protein level was confirmed although the underlying mechanism of how detectable protein level were reduced remained to be not fully understood. Further investigations are still required as the expression of the used protein in this study is up-regulated during the activation of dendritic cells. This phenomenon was observed for three out of five sensitizing substances. This work represents successful validations, inter- and intra-laboraty, of several animal-free test methods. The combinations of assays showed that predictivity compared to single assays can be increased and that for the number of tested substances these combinations are comparable to the local lymph node assay, the current gold standard to assess skin sensitizing potential. Although this work was no part of the formal validation of these assays, increased acceptance was gained, showing the reliability, reproducibility and high predictivities of these assays. The work on a new cell based protein reactivity assay showed a correlation between reduced level of detectable protein and the exposure of cells with sensitizers, although more investigation is required. The expression of the chosen protein unfortunately seemed to be up-regulated under the presence of skin sensitizer. Investigation of proteins their expression is independent of cell activation may provide more stable results...|$|E
