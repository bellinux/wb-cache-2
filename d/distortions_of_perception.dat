40|$|Subjective {{agreement}} between voters {{and the party}} they voted for can be produced by three separate processes: rational selection of parties, persuasion by parties, and <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Rational choice theory, balance theory and social judgment theory make different predictions about the strength {{of each of these}} processes. In this article the strength of the three processes are estimated by modeling continuous longitudinal change in attitudes and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> positions on nuclear energy in a period in 1986 during which the accident at Chernobyl occurred. The study uses a short-term panel study of Dutch respondents covering this period. The analyses demonstrate that changes in attitudes and perceptions conform largely to the Downsian model of democracy. Evidence is found for a weak persuasion effect, but hardly any <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>perceptions</b> occurred. These findings challenge the applicability of concepts from balance theory to the field of electoral research. It is argued that voters have little psychological motivation to distort their <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> party positions because they are normally not strongly involved with politics or political parties...|$|R

50|$|At Weyburn, Osmond {{recruited}} a {{group of}} research psychologists to turn the hospital into a design-research laboratory. There, he conducted {{a wide variety of}} patient studies and observations using hallucinogenic drugs, collaborating with Abram Hoffer and others. In 1952, Osmond related the similarity of mescaline to adrenaline molecules, in a theory which implied that schizophrenia might be a form of self-intoxication caused by one's own body. He collected the biographies of recovered schizophrenics, and he held that psychiatrists can only understand the schizophrenic by understanding the rational way the mind makes sense of distorted perceptions. He pursued this idea with passion, exploring all avenues to gain insight into the shattered perceptions of schizophrenia, holding that the illness arises primarily from <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception.</b> Yet during the same period, Osmond became aware of the potential of psychedelics to foster mind-expanding and mystical experiences.|$|E

5000|$|In the English ufo literature, {{the term}} psycho-social {{hypothesis}} first achieved prominence in April 1984 when {{the cover of}} Magonia featured [...] "The Rise of the Psycho-social hypothesis" [...] by Jacques Scornaux and Peter Rogerson. Scornaux's {{use of the term}} traces back to French ufo controversies spawned by Michel Monnerie whose book Le Naufrage des Extra-terrestres (1979) presented [...] "le modèle socio-psychologique" [...] as a direct challenge to the extraterrestrial hypothesis. [...] Claude Maugé had exposed Magonia readers to a brief outline of [...] "the socio-psychological model" [...] emerging from French studies in 1983, but flipping the syllables made the term more conventional to existing academic vocabulary. [...] Rogerson's adopting the term represented to him an evolution and de-escalation of exotic hypotheses he had been entertaining that originally included paranormal notions like psi, collective hallucinations, and the collective unconscious. [...] The term marked the embrace of a fully normal system of psychological processes that included dreams, hallucinations, fantasy interpretations of materially real stimuli, <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception,</b> and metachoric experiences. These were things influenced by cultural myths, social conditioning, and historical context. Since 1968, the circle of writers who wrote for Magonia had been exploring alternatives to the ETH under a general sense that it had failed to account for much of what was being seen in the high strangeness cases. Roger Sandell spoke of being a nuts and bolts ufologist till he realized that ufo reports he had gathered from a 1905 Welsh wave made little sense and were part of a larger complex of ghost stories and religious visions. He notes that ufological thought had once been dominated by theories that Venus and Mars were the source of ufos, but the space program had shown they were in fact quite lifeless. Add in the apocalyptic and demonological material of then contemporary ufo thinking and the need for a major re-think seemed obliged. Could it all be mundane products of the human mind such as dreams, rumors and hoaxes? [...] Peter Rogerson had similarly become convinced we are seeing the rise of a contemporary mythology and advocated for a comprehensive search for historical antecedents of ufo rumors. He began the search for the social factors driving ufo flaps and social panics. Magonia writers would point to [...] "a relationship between ufo waves and times of radical social change" [...] with Rogerson offering that the 1954 French flap had occurred at [...] "a time of national defeat and government crisis." [...] In one striking piece, he offered a lengthy meditation on the social resonances and ideological influences shaping the varying beliefs found among ufo writers over the course of ufo history. Allen Greenfield confessed in Magonia in 1979 he had become disenchanted with the divisive emotionality and groupthink of ufo culture and worried about the influence of belief he eventually saw in his early work advocating the ETH. He was starting to think the bigger mystery was not what ufos were, but [...] "What {{are we to make of}} the whole world-wide rumor complex…what are we to make of the rumor - the ufo mythos?" [...] What was the meaning of all the mythologizing that attends the spread of the ufo rumor? ...|$|E

The present study aimed to analyse the <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> on a cognitive ability test through correlation with personality instruments as well as other cognitive abilities. We chose a test of emotional perception, which assesses the ability to identify the emotions expressed in videos of people. Distortion was understood as the perception of something not present in the original stimulus (i.e., perceiving an emotional expression on a person’s face that is not actually present). According to the literature review, we hypothesized that distortions would not be related to cognitive performance, but with the particular forms that the subjects perceive in themselves and the world. The following hypotheses were designed to be compatible with the variables of the tests we used and the meaning of each emotion, according to the literature in the field (Ekman 2003; Niedenthal et al. 2006; Plutchik 2002; Strongman 2003).|$|E
40|$|Dissociation as a {{clinical}} psychiatric condition {{has been defined}} primarily {{in terms of the}} fragmentation and splitting of the mind, and perception of the self and the body. Its clinical manifestations include altered perceptions and behavior, including derealization, depersonalization, <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> of time, space, and body, and conversion hysteria. Using examples of animal models, and the clinical features of the whiplash syndrome, we have developed a model of dissociation linked to the phenomenon of freeze/immobility. Also employing current concepts of the psychobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we propose a model of PTSD linked to cyclical autonomic dysfunction, triggered and maintained by the laboratory model of kindling, and perpetuated by increasingly profound dorsal vagal tone and endorphinergic reward systems. These physiologic events in turn contribute to the clinical state of dissociation. The resulting autonomic dysregulation is presented as the substrate for a diverse group of chronic diseases of unknown origin.

Our illusory figures designed by heteroluminant colours yielded the effects of perceived distortion qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the effects evoked by the white and black figures. Variations of luminance of colours of the figures and backgrounds within a relatively wide interval of its values did not evoke a noticeable change in strength of the perceived distortions, but if the luminance of the stimulus colour approached the magnitude which was determined as isoluminant with the background colour, {{the strength of the}} distortions changed significantly; it increased for the Brentano figure and decreased for the Delboeuf, Oppel-Kundt and Zöllner figures. The curves obtained for different subjects with different colour combinations were similar in shape, though horizontal parts and peaks of the curve were not at the same level. For isoluminant figures, the experimental curves demonstrating the strength variations of the perceived distortions in dependence of spatial parameters of the stimuli were similar in shape with the curves for heteroluminant figures, but lay above (Brentano) or below (Delboeuf, Oppel-Kundt and Zöllner) them. A mathematical model of neurophysiological spatial-frequency filtering procedure was applied to our stimulus patterns, and the evoked distortions of stimulus geometry were calculated.

SUBJECTS: 42 CPP referred for evaluation and 34 controls (staff members and relatives). OUTCOME MEASURES: Fitness index and exertion perception index was obtained by a cycle ergometer test. Trend analysis was performed on pain scores reported on a visual analogue scale during exertion. RESULTS: Male CPP mean fitness index was found to be significantly reduced. No difference in exertion perception was found between groups. Trend analysis of reported pain revealed that 49 % of CPP showed a positive trend, 5 % a negative trend, and 46 % showed no significant trend as exercise intensity increased. There was no significant relation between type of trend and fitness nor exertion perception index. CONCLUSIONS: Only male CPP have a reduced work capacity. Exertion perception seems normal among CPP. The possible <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> exertion <b>perception</b> as a causal factor in the reduced fitness of CPP has to be rejected.
