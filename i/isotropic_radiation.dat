40|$|The {{analysis}} method currently proposed {{to search for}} <b>isotropic</b> stochastic <b>radiation</b> of primordial or astrophysical origin with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) relies on the combined use of two LISA channels, {{one of which is}} insensitive to gravitational waves, such as the symmetrised Sagnac. For this method to work, it is essential to know how the instrumental noise power in the two channels are related to one another; however, no quantitative estimates of this key information are available to date. The purpose of our study is to assess the performance of the symmetrised Sagnac method for different levels of prior information regarding the instrumental noise. We develop a general approach in the framework of Bayesian inference and an end-to-end analysis algorithm based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to compute the posterior probability density functions of the relevant model parameters. We apply this method to data released as part of {{the second round of the}} Mock LISA Data Challenges. For the selected (and somewhat idealised) cases considered here, we find that a prior uncertainty of a factor ~ 2 in the ratio between the power of the instrumental noise contributions in the two channels allows for the detection of <b>isotropic</b> stochastic <b>radiation.</b> More importantly, we provide a framework for more realistic studies of LISA's performance and development of analysis techniques in the context of searches for stochastic signals.

40|$|We treat {{transformation}} {{properties of}} external radiation {{fields in the}} proper frame of a plasma moving with constant speed. The specific spectral energy densities of external <b>isotropic</b> and accretion-disk <b>radiation</b> fields are derived in the comoving frame of relativistic outflows, such as those thought to be found near black-hole jet and gamma-ray burst sources. Nonthermal electrons and positrons Compton-scatter this radiation field, and high-energy protons and ions interact with this field through photomeson and photopair production. We revisit {{the problem of the}} Compton-scattered spectrum associated with an external accretion-disk radiation field, and clarify a past treatment by the authors. Simple expressions for energy-loss rates and Thomson-scattered spectra are given for ambient soft photon fields consisting either of a surrounding external <b>isotropic</b> monochromatic <b>radiation</b> field, or of an azimuthally symmetric, geometrically thin accretion-disk radiation field. A model for blazar emission is presented that displays a characteristic spectral and variability behavior due to the presence of a direct accretion-disk component. The disk component and distinct flaring behavior can be bright enough to be detected from flat spectrum radio quasars with GLAST. Spectral states of blazars are characterized by the relative importance of the accretion-disk and scattered radiation fields and, in the extended jet, by the accretion disk, inner jet, and cosmic microwave background radiation fields.

With the external radiation assumed to turn on when the filamentary cloud forms, the filamentary cloud with low initial density (n_ 0 10 ^ 2 cm^- 3) is hardly affected by the external radiation. This is because the filamentary cloud with high initial density shields itself from the external radiation. It is found that the external radiation increases fragment mass. This result {{is consistent with previous}} results with one-zone models. It is also found that fragment mass decreases owing to the external dissociation radiation in the case with sufficiently large line mass. Comment: 26 pages, 15 figures, accepted by PAS...|$|R

In particular, it excludes models with cosmogenic neutrino fluxes detectable by existing neutrino experiments, while next-generation detectors as e. g.
