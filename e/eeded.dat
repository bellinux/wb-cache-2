40|$|We test one-zone {{synchrotron}} self-Compton (SSC) {{models with}} high-quality multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) data of Mrk 421. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to fit twelve day-scale SEDs of Mrk 421 with one-zone SSC models. Three types of electron energy distribution (<b>EED),</b> a log-parabola (LP) <b>EED,</b> a power-law log-parabola (PLLP) <b>EED</b> {{and a broken}} power-law (BPL) <b>EED,</b> are assumed in fits. We find that the one-zone SSC model with the PLLP <b>EED</b> provides successful fits to all the twelve SEDs. However, the one-zone SSC model with the LP and BPL <b>EEDs</b> fail to provide acceptable fits to the highest energy X-ray data or GeV data in several states. We therefore conclude that the one-zone SSC model works well in explaining the SEDs of Mrk 421, and the PLLP <b>EED</b> is preferred over the LP and BPL <b>EEDs</b> for Mrk 421 during the flare in March 2010.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the electron energy distribution (<b>EED)</b> of electrons escaping axially from a minimum-B electron cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS) is reported. The experimental data were recorded with a room-temperature 14 GHz ECRIS at the JYFL accelerator laboratory. The electrons escaping through the extraction mirror of the ion source were detected with a secondary electron amplifier placed downstream from a dipole magnet serving as an electron spectrometer with 500 eV resolution. It was discovered that the <b>EED</b> {{in the range of}} 5 - 250 keV is strongly non-Maxwellian and exhibits several local maxima below 20 keV energy. It was observed that the most influential ion source operating parameter on the <b>EED</b> is the magnetic field strength, which affected the <b>EED</b> predominantly at energies less than 100 keV. The effects of the microwave power and frequency, ranging from 100 to 600 W and 11 to 14 GHz respectively, on the <b>EED</b> were found to be less significant.

40|$|Abstract. Classical {{theory of}} binary {{homogeneous}} nucleation is {{extended to the}} ternary system H 2 SO 4 -NH 3 -H 20. For NH 3 mixing ratios exceeding about 1 ppt, the presence of NH 3 enhances the binary H 2 SO 4 -H 20 nucleation rate by several orders of magnitude. The Gibbs free energies of formation of the critical H 2 SO 4 -NH 3 -H 20 cluster, as calculated by two independent approaches, are in substantial agreement. The finding that the H 2 SO 4 -NH 3 -H 20 ternary nucleation rate is independ-ent of relative humidity over a large range of H 2 SO 4 concentrations has wide atmospheric consequences.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During field trials, it was {{observed}} that the delay of ignition of electro-explosive devices (<b>EED)</b> depends on ratings of power supplies or dynamo and also on the firing cable lengths. The change in ignition delay of <b>EEDs</b> due to altered supplied current will detoriate the repeatability of sequence of actions in time-critical armament applications. In order to study, supplement and analyze this observation, the measurement of electrical energy required for <b>EEDs</b> ignition is necessary. The electrical energy of <b>EEDs</b> has been determined experimentally by instrumentation and measurement setup using hall sensor and photo detector. The hall sensor is used to measure the actual current passing through <b>EEDs</b> when power supply is applied to them. Photo detector is used to detect the flash produced during <b>EED</b> ignition. By conducting repeated trials, it {{was observed}} that this method is reliable to determine the electrical energy required for <b>EEDs</b> ignition. With this parameter, the actual current to be supplied and the pulse width of supplied current for repeated ignition delays can be determined. Knowing the electrical energy of a particular <b>EED</b> by the proposed method, the required firing cable length and power supply for ignition of critical delay applications can be selected.

The objective was to describe and compare the characteristics of resilience in two different age groups of chronically ill oldest older persons living at home and who n <b>eeded</b> help from home nursing care. Design: Cross-sectional design was used to describe and comp are the resilience qualities between the two age groups. Methods: The inclusion criteria were 80 years or older, living at home with chronic disease, receiving help from home nursing care, and with the capacity to be interviewed. A sample of 120 oldest older women (n = 79) and men (n = 41) separated in two age groups, aged 80 - 89 and 90 + years, participated in the study. Resilience characteristics were measured by Resilience Scale. Results: The whole group of oldest older people was vulnerable in relation to the characteristics of perseverance, self-reliance, and existential aloneness. Despite reduced physical health they reported a meaningful life, and equ animity. Even if {{there were no significant differences}} between the age groups among the oldest older persons in the characteristics of Resilience Scale (RS), in the characteristic of meaning there was a tendency of interaction between age and how much help from home nursing care the participants received.

40|$|Abstract~Sorptive {{properties}} of organoclays may be {{greatly influenced by}} the physicochemical prop-erties of organic sorbates. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium(HDTMA) clays were prepared using a high-charge smectite (HDTMA-SAz- 1), a low-charge smectite (HDTMA-SWy- 2), and an illite (HDTMA-ILL). The resultant organoclays were used to sorb aqueous phase 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), 1, 3 -dichloro-benzene (m-DCB), and 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene (p-DCB). Sorptive characteristics of these compounds were determined by their molecular polarities (o-DCB> m-DCB> p-DCB) and the HDTMA-clay interlayer distance. HDTMA-ILL was used for comparison to HDTMA-SAz-I and HDTMA-SWy- 2. All dichloro-benzene isomers were directly intercalated in the interlayers of HDTMA-SAz- 1, causing interlayer ex-pansion, o-DCB and m-DCB were not intercalated in the interlayers of HDTMA-SWy- 2 at low concen-trations, but intercalation occurred at higher concentrations, which caused interlayer expansion. The con-centration <b>eeded</b> to produce interlayer expansion depended on the solute molecular polarity, hence a higher concentration of m-DCB than o-DCB was required, p-DCB was sorbed primarily by the HDTMA phase on the external surfaces of HDTMA-SWy- 2. In the presence of chlorobenzene (CB), p-DCB sorp-tion by HDTMA-SWy- 2 is greatly enhanced, owing to the interlayer expansion by CB and a cosolvent effect. Sorption of o-DCB resulted from both direct solvation-type interactions with HDTMA and parti-tioning into HDTMA. Such sorption results in double-sigmoid sotherms, m-DCB weakly solvates the HDTMA and partitions into the HDTMA, displaying either a donble-sigmoid or a type-III isotherm depending on clay type. p-DCB lacks ability to solvate HDTMA and partitions into HDTMA as its sole mechanism, producing type-III isotherms.

The wireless signal is transmitted by a passive antenna structure which is a radiat ion hard and much less complex object than an optical link. Due to the requirement of high data rate s in detectors a high bandwidth is required. The frequency band around 60 GHz has large potenti al for use in tracking detectors. The high baseband frequency allow for data transfer of the or der of several Gbit/s, and due to the small wave length in the mm range, only small structures are n <b>eeded.</b> One challenge in applying the technology to trackers is to bring the signal around or th rough boundaries that are not trans- parent to the mm-waves, i. e. silicon detector modules or sup port structures. This article presents a test setup of a 60 GHz data link for radial transmission of mm -waves through an ATLAS de- tector model using a passive repeater structure. We demonst rate that by using a passive repeater structure made of two 60 GHz patch array antennas connected b y a micro strip we can make the signal pass boundarie...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOptimizing and {{controlling}} electron energy distributions (<b>EEDs)</b> {{is a continuing}} goal in plasma materials processing as <b>EEDs</b> determine the rate coefficients for electron impact processes. There are many strategies to customize <b>EEDs</b> in low pressure inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs), for example, pulsing and choice of frequency, to produce the desired plasma properties. Recent experiments have shown that <b>EEDs</b> in low pressure ICPs can be manipulated {{through the use of}} static magnetic fields of sufficient magnitudes to magnetize the electrons and confine them to the electromagnetic skin depth. The <b>EED</b> is then a function of the local magnetic field as opposed to having non-local properties {{in the absence of the}} magnetic field. In this paper, <b>EEDs</b> in a magnetized inductively coupled plasma (mICP) sustained in Ar are discussed with results from a two-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics model. Results are compared with experimental measurements. We found that the character of the <b>EED</b> transitions from non-local to local with application of the static magnetic field. The reduction in cross-field mobility increases local electron heating in the skin depth and decreases the transport of these hot electrons to larger radii. The tail of the <b>EED</b> is therefore enhanced in the skin depth and depressed at large radii. Plasmas densities are non-monotonic with increasing pressure with the external magnetic field due to transitions between local and non-local kinetics...|$|R

BackgroundFew data exist {{on the value of}} using embolic protection devices during TAVR. MethodsThis pilot study included 52 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR. The <b>EED</b> system was used in 41  patients, whereas 11 patients underwent TAVR without embolic protection (control group). Cerebral diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) was performed at baseline and within 7 days and 30 days after TAVR. ResultsThe <b>EED</b> system was successfully deployed {{at the level of the}} aortic arch in all patients with no complications. The deployment of the <b>EED</b> system was associated with high-intensity transient signals (HITS) as evaluated by transcranial Doppler (median: 48 [interquartile range: 17 to 198] HITS), and a higher total number of HITS was observed in the <b>EED</b> group (p < 0. 001 vs. control group). DW-MRI performed within 7 days after TAVR showed the presence of new ischemic lesions in all patients in both groups, with a median number of 7 (interquartile range: 3 to 13) lesions per patient. The use of the <b>EED</b> system was associated with a lower lesion volume compared with the control group (p = 0. 003). All new cerebral lesions had disappeared on the DW-MRI performed at 30 days after TAVR. Two strokes unrelated to the <b>EED</b> system occurred 2 and 29 days after TAVR. ConclusionsThis study showed the feasibility and safety of using the <b>EED</b> system in TAVR procedures. The <b>EED</b> system did not prevent the occurrence of cerebral microemboli during TAVR or new transient ischemic lesions as evaluated by DW-MRI, but it was associated with a reduction in lesion volume. Further studies are warranted to determine the efficacy of using the <b>EED</b> system during TAVR procedures...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aims: Environmental enteric {{dysfunction}} (<b>EED),</b> {{a chronic}} diffuse {{inflammation of the}} small intestine, is associated with stunting in children in the developing world. The pathobiology of <b>EED</b> is poorly understood {{because of the lack}} of a method to elucidate the host response. This study tested a novel microarray method to overcome limitation of RNA sequencing to interrogate the host transcriptome in feces in Malawian children with <b>EED.</b> Methods: In 259 children, <b>EED</b> was measured by lactulose permeability (%L). After isolating low copy numbers of host messenger RNA, the transcriptome was reliably and reproducibly profiled, validated by polymerase chain reaction. Messenger RNA copy number then was correlated with %L and differential expression in <b>EED.</b> The transcripts identified were mapped to biological pathways and processes. The children studied had a range of %L values, consistent with a spectrum of <b>EED</b> from none to severe. Results: We identified 12 transcripts associated with the severity of <b>EED,</b> including chemokines that stimulate T-cell proliferation, Fc fragments of multiple immunoglobulin families, interferon-induced proteins, activators of neutrophils and B cells, and mediators that dampen cellular responses to hormones. EED-associated transcripts mapped to pathways related to cell adhesion, and responses to a broad spectrum of viral, bacterial, and parasitic microbes. Several mucins, regulatory factors, and protein kinases associated with the maintenance of the mucous layer were expressed less in children with <b>EED</b> than in normal children. Conclusions: <b>EED</b> represents the activation of diverse elements of the immune system and is associated with widespread intestinal barrier disruption. Differentially expressed transcripts, appropriately enumerated, should be explored as potential biomarkers.

40|$|The Medved Castle (Medvedgrad) {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and most {{important}} castles in the mediaeval Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. It stands upon one of the isolated slopes of the Zagreb Mountain (Medvednica) which lies to the North of the town itself. It was built after the catastrophic Mongolic invasion, between 1242. and 1250. A. D., by the Zagreb bishop Philip as a stronghold in case of similar invasions in the future and as a safe place for the treasure of the Zagreb Church. A few decades later, the castle was taken over by the king Bela IV and thus a long and picturesque sequence of its owners was started. Among them we could name nearly all the major figures of the Croatian history — for example the Babonić, Alben, Zrinski and Gregorijanec families, the Counts of Celje, Count Ivan Karlović, several kings, dukes and bishops of Zagreb. The castle is being mentioned in more than 400 mediaeval documents. Its fame was a gloomy one and it used to be the cause of many a bloody dispute. The castle has an irregular longitudinal ground-plan, oriented North-East South-West. It was surrounded by a deep fosse only from two sides, as the slopes on the north and west side of the hill is very steep. One could penetrate into the castle only through four gates — a rich triple coat-of-arms stood over the third one. It had a strong and massive keep, one smaller tower, strong and well-built outer and inner ramparts, a richly adorned chapel (early-Gothic stone carvings and wall-paintings from around 1300. A. D.), several buildings in the central part which probably had a rectangular courtyard. The relatively short life of the Medved Castle was caused {{by the fact that it}} was constructed within an area that has often been shaken by earthquakes. Itn <b>eeded</b> repair as early as 1487. and was much renewed and reinforced in 1574. (a third storey in bricks was added to the keep, etc.) by the royal architect Arconati. The strong 1590. earthquake, which even severly damaged the bellfry of St. Stephen 2 ̆ 7 s Cathedral in Vienna, partly destroyed the castle and made it unfit for fur ther life and defence. In 1602. it is already described as a stripped, plundered and abandoned fortress. The chapel still stood, although a ruin, at the beginning of the XIX cent., and the keep had a roof at the same time. In the last eighty years, the crumbling of the ruins has been very rapid. The keep has completely disappeared — its last corner fell in 1957. The rest either lies in deep layers of debris, or shyly protrudes among the bushes. Only excavations will be able to give us all the missing data about the castle, which is a prehistoric site as well...|$|E
