5|$|A {{result of}} {{dysplasia}} is usually further investigated, such as {{by taking a}} cone biopsy, which may also remove the cancerous lesion. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic changes that may eventually progress to <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer.</b> Most cases of cervical cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include vaginal bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.|$|E
5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer.</b> They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nonmuscle <b>invasive</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> is {{a common}} malignancy, usually treated by {{transurethral}} resection and adjuvant intravesical instillations of chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Appropriate adjuvant treatment can be selected based on several prognostic factors that determine risk for recurrence or progression. We discuss options for first-line and second-line adjuvant therapy for nonmuscle <b>invasive</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> RECENT FINDINGS: Mitomycin-C and epirubicin are the mostly used adjuvant chemotherapeutic drugs for tumours of low and intermediate risk. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin remains first-choice therapy in high-risk nonmuscle <b>invasive</b> bladder <b>cancer.</b> Gemcitabine and apaziquone are especially promising for treatment of intermediate risk nonmuscle <b>invasive</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> but require further study. Device-assisted therapies, such as thermochemotherapy and electromotive drug administration, have yielded good results in high-risk nonmuscle <b>invasive</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> and could be considered second-line therapy in this setting. SUMMARY: Primary problems in nonmuscle <b>invasive</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> are its tendency to recur and its elusiveness (especially high-risk nonmuscle <b>invasive</b> bladder <b>cancer)</b> of progression to muscle invasive disease. First-line adjuvant therapies are well established but suboptimal. Some second-line therapies are promising but should be used cautiously, because in some patients the best option {{is not always the}} conservative one...|$|R

2500|$|Worldwide, {{breast cancer}} {{is the most common}} <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer</b> in women. It affects about 12% of women worldwide. (The most common form of cancer is {{non-invasive}} non-melanoma skin cancer; non-invasive cancers are generally easily cured, cause very few deaths, and are routinely excluded from cancer statistics.) [...] Breast cancer comprises 22.9% of invasive cancers in women and 16% of all female cancers. In 2012, it comprised 25.2% of cancers diagnosed in women, making it the most common female cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Consequently, {{finding and}} {{treating}} {{many cases of}} DCIS represents overdiagnosis and overtreatment. [...] Treatment is given to all women with DCIS because it is currently impossible to predict which patients with DCIS will have an indolent, non-fatal course, and which few will inevitably progress to <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer</b> and premature death if left untreated. Consequently, all patients with DCIS are treated {{in much the same}} way, with at least wide local excision, and sometimes mastectomy if the DCIS is very extensive. The cure rate for DCIS if treated appropriately is extremely high, partly because the majority of DCIS cases were harmless in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|An {{advantage}} of a primary surgical approach {{is the amount of}} pathological information made available, including grade, margin status, and degree of involvement of lymph nodes. This may change the staging, as up to 40% of patients may have a different postoperative pathological stage compared to their preoperative clinical stage. In one study, 24% had their stage reduced (downstaged), which may impact subsequent decision making, including reduction in intensity and morbidity. In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Pathologists (1998) has standardised the reporting of surgical margins, with two categories, [...] "mucosal" [...] and [...] "deep", and for each created groups based on the microscopic distance from <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer</b> to the margin, as follows: more than 5mm (clear), 1–5 (close) and less than 1mm (involved).|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{etiology}} of in situ ductal breast cancer (DCIS) or what influences its possible progression to invasive ductal disease. Comparison of risk factors for DCIS and <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>cancer</b> may throw some light on these issues. We estimated relative risks for DCIS and <b>invasive</b> ductal breast <b>cancer</b> according to 12 genetic and eight environmental risk factors among 1. 1 million postmenopausal women in a large prospective UK study. There was no strong evidence of a different association with DCIS versus <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>cancer</b> for any of the 12 susceptibility loci examined. We also found similar associations of age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, age at menopause, family history of breast cancer and use of hormone replacement therapy with DCIS and <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>cancer.</b> Only body mass index (BMI) showed a clear difference in association in that it was positively associated with the risk of <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>cancer</b> but not DCIS (RRs per 5 kg/m(2) = 1. 20 and 1. 01, respectively; p-value for heterogeneity = 0. 002). The very similar risk factor profiles observed here for DCIS and <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>cancer</b> suggest that DCIS is a precursor of <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>cancer</b> and most risk factors affect the risk of <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>cancer</b> primarily through their effects on the risk of DCIS. The lack of association between BMI and DCIS suggests a greater influence of BMI on disease progression...|$|R

2500|$|A 2013 Cochrane review {{estimated}} that mammography in women between 50 and 75 years old {{results in a}} relative decreased risk of death from breast cancer of 15% and an absolute risk reduction of 0.05%. However, when the analysis included only the least biased trials, women who had regular screening mammograms were {{just as likely to}} die from all causes, and just as likely to die specifically from breast cancer, as women who did not. The size of effect might be less in real life compared with the results in randomized controlled trials due to factors such as increased self-selection rate among women concerned and increased effectiveness of adjuvant therapies. The Nordic Cochrane Collection (2012) reviews said that advances in diagnosis and treatment might make mammography screening less effective at saving lives today. They concluded that screening is “no longer effective” at preventing deaths and “it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend” for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet. [...] The review also concluded that [...] "half or more" [...] of cancers detected with mammography would have disappeared spontaneously without treatment. They found that most of the earliest cell changes found by mammography screening (carcinoma in situ) should be left alone because these changes would not have progressed into <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pathologists {{classify}} intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) {{into two}} broad groups - {{those that are}} associated with an <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer</b> and those that are not associated with an <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer.</b> This separation has critical prognostic significance. Patients with a surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without an associated <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer</b> have an excellent prognosis (>95% will be cured), while patients with a surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with an associated <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer</b> have a worse prognosis. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms without an associated <b>invasive</b> <b>cancer</b> can be further subcategorized into three groups.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{value of}} screen {{detection}} {{and treatment of}} ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) {{is a matter of}} controversy. At present, {{the extent to which the}} diagnosis and treatment of DCIS could prevent the occurrence of <b>invasive</b> breast <b>cancer</b> in the future is not clear. We sought to estimate the association between detection of DCIS at screening and <b>invasive</b> interval <b>cancers</b> subsequent to the relevant screen. MethodsWe obtained aggregate data for screen-detected cancers from 84 local screening units within 11 regional Quality Assurance Reference Centres in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland from the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme. Data for DCIS diagnoses were obtained for women aged 50 – 64 years who were invited to and attended mammographic breast screening from April 1, 2003, to March 31, 2007 (4 screening years). Patient-level data for interval cancer arising in the 36 months after each of these were analysed by Poisson regression with <b>invasive</b> interval <b>cancer</b> screen detection rate as the outcome variable; DCIS detection frequencies were fitted first as a continuous and then as a categorical variable. We repeated this analysis after adjustment with both small size and high-grade <b>invasive</b> screen-detected <b>cancers.</b> FindingsWe analysed data for 5   243   658 women and on interval cancers occurring in the 36 months after the relevant screen. The average frequency of DCIS detected at screening was 1 · 60 per 1000 women screened (median 1 · 50 [unit range 0 · 54 – 3 · 56] per 1000 women). There was a significant negative association of screen-detected DCIS cases with the rate of <b>invasive</b> interval <b>cancers</b> (Poisson regression coefficient − 0 · 084 [95 % CI − 0 · 13 to − 0 · 03]; p= 0 · 002). 90 % of units had a DCIS detection frequency within the range of 1 · 00 to 2 · 22 per 1000 women; in these units, for every three screen-detected cases of DCIS, there was one fewer <b>invasive</b> interval <b>cancer</b> in the next 3 years. This association remained after adjustment for numbers of small screen-detected <b>invasive</b> <b>cancers</b> and for numbers of grade 3 <b>invasive</b> screen-detected <b>cancers.</b> InterpretationThe association between screen-detected DCIS and subsequent <b>invasive</b> interval <b>cancers</b> suggests that detection and treatment of DCIS is worthwhile in prevention of future invasive disease.
