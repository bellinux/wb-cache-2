The present thesis discusses the effect for various geometric and flow parameters including the variation of inlet flow velocities, <b>entry</b> <b>heights,</b> face zone widths and curtain widths on the flow behavior. The Reynolds number Re considered for this study ranges from 1 · 105 to 3 · 106 based on curtain width and exit velocity. The variation of the face zone and the curtain widths considerably affected the flow behavior, resulting in recirculation regions in the face area for critical combinations. Jet spreading angles and virtual origins have been calculated for the different geometries showing that an optimum range of face and curtain widths exists. A detailed discussion employing various scenarios for exhaust ventilation systems has also been made. Full-size measurements and comparison of the experimental data with numerical simulations is presented. Implementation of machine-mounted scrubbers in the blowing system are discussed for different values of the ventilation ratios (Qs/Qin) ranging from 14 % to 53 %.

40|$|This open, {{prospective}} {{study was designed}} to evaluate the effect of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and GH replacement therapy on serum homocysteine (Hcy) concentration in children with GHD. SUBJECTS: Seventeen prepubertal children with GHD (11 boys and six girls) aged 8. 6 +/- 1. 9 years were studied before and after 12 months of GH replacement therapy at a dose of GH of 30 microg/kg/day. Seventeen healthy children acted as controls and were matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). At study <b>entry,</b> <b>height,</b> weight, blood pressure, serum Hcy, serum IGF-I, total-low density lipoprotein (LDL) - and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, free T 4, free T 3, vitamin B 12, folate, glucose and creatinine were measured in all subjects. The atherogenic index (AI) was also calculated as the ratio of total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol (T/HDL). In GHD children these parameters were also revaluated after 12 months of GH therapy. At study <b>entry</b> <b>height</b> and serum IGF-I were significantly lower, as expected, in GHD patients than in controls (P < 0. 0001 and P < 0. 007, respectively). Serum Hcy levels were significantly higher in GHD patients than in healthy children (8. 4 +/- 2. 9 vs. 6. 0 +/- 2. 9 micromol/l; P < 0. 03), although the absolute values were within the normal values for age and sex. There were no significant differences at baseline with respect to blood pressure, serum vitamin B 12, folate, fT 3, fT 4, lipid profile, creatinine and glucose levels. After 12 months of GH replacement therapy height and serum IGF-I increased significantly compared to pretreatment values (P < 0. 0001); serum Hcy levels decreased significantly (6. 0 +/- 3. 3 micromol/l; P < 0. 002) compared to baseline values, becoming similar to control values. Total cholesterol (3. 5 +/- 0. 6 mmol/l) and the AI (2. 5 +/- 0. 8) decreased significantly with respect to both pretreatment (4. 2 +/- 1. 0 mmol/l; P < 0. 0002 and 3. 4 +/- 0. 8; < 0. 002, respectively) and control values (4. 2 +/- 0. 4 mmol/l; P < 0. 0005 and 3. 3 +/- 1. 1; P = 0. 02, respectively). GHD in children is associated with higher serum levels of Hcy compared to controls, without significantly affecting the lipid profile. GH replacement for 12 months significantly decreased the Hcy levels and improved the lipid profile with a decrease of total cholesterol and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio, compared to pretreatment values. Given the small number of patients, further larger studies are needed to clarify whether these results may have significant effects in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adulthood...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that there is an increased risk of cancer in individuals with elevated levels of serum g-glutamyl transferase (GGT). METHODS: In the Guernsey Breast Cancer Cohort Study, GGT was measured in sera from 1803 normal women. Among these women, 251 subsequently developed cancer, of whom 96 developed breast cancer. RESULTS: After adjustment for age at <b>entry,</b> <b>height,</b> weight, age at menarche and first birth with nulliparity, there was a highly significant relationship between elevated GGT and breast cancer risk. In the highest quartile, the hazard ratio (HR) was 2. 17 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 19, 3. 93). When subdivided by menopausal status, there was a reduced non-significant effect in postmenopausal women, whereas for premenopausal women in the highest quartile, HR was 3. 81 (95 % CI: 1. 37, 10. 59). Premenopausal women with serum GGT levels above the normal range had a significantly elevated HR of 4. 90 (95 % CI: 1. 86, 12. 94). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that premenopausal women with high normal (above median) serum GGT or elevated levels (p 40 IU l 1) are at increased risk of breast cancer and might benefit from close surveillance, possibly with breast magnetic resonance imaging scans. Serum GGT may mark previous exposure to carcinogens and lead to the identification of DNA adducts involved in mammary carcinogenesis...|$|E

Twenty underground coal mines were studied representing various coal basins, coal seams, geology, loading conditions, and rib control strategies. The key findings are: (1) any rib design guideline or tool should take into account external rib support as well as internal bolting; (2) rib bolts on their own cannot contain rib spall, especially in soft ribs subjected to significant load-external rib control devices such as mesh are required in such cases to contain rib sloughing; (3) the majority of the studied mines follow the overburden depth and <b>entry</b> <b>height</b> thresholds recommended by the Program Information Bulletin 11 - 29 issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration; (4) potential rib instability occurred when certain geological features prevailed-these include draw slate and/or bone coal near the rib/roof line, claystone partings, and soft coal bench overlain by rock strata; (5) 47 % of the studied rib spall was classified as blocky-this could indicate a high potential of rib hazards; and (6) rib injury rates of the studied mines for the last three years emphasize the need for more rib control management for mines operating at overburden depths between 152. 4 m and 304. 8 m.

40|$|In This Chapter [Drilling, blasting, and crushers Diesel {{particulate}} Enclosed cabs Ventilation with jet fans Stopping construction methods Propeller fans as main fans] This chapter {{explains how}} to control dust in large-entry stone mines, including both silica dust and diesel particulate. Most stone mines are limestone mines, but a substantial minority are marble, sandstone, and granite mines. These mines differ from most others in that entry widths are 30 ft or more and <b>entry</b> <b>heights</b> are 25 ft or more. Such mines, developed with room-and-pillar methods, have large open areas that can make ventilation and dust control more difficult. Because {{of the difficulty of}} ventilating stone mines, improved ventilation is a major focal point of this chapter. However, the chapter also covers the control of dust from drills, blasting, and crushers. Another part of the chapter covers enclosed cabs, an effective dust control technique for some workers. BACKGROUND The major dust compliance problem in stone mines is caused by silica (quartz) in the rock. Mines in high-silica rock, 8 % or more, {{are far more likely to}} have a dust problem than those where there is less silica. Geographically, the limestone in the Northeastern and South Central United States has higher silica than the rest of the country. Chekan and Colinet [2002] have analyzed Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) dust sampling results [MSHA 2001] from the stone industry. They have concluded that, on average across the United States, the workers exposed to the highest dust concentrations are rotary drill operators, front-end loader operators, truck drivers, and crusher operators. However, there are many regional differences. Also, occupations that work outside of cabs, such as blasters, roof bolters, and laborers, can be exposed to high dust levels...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{treatment}} {{of children with}} subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is controversial for TSH values between 4. 5 and 10  mU/l. The aim of this cross-sectional, controlled study was to evaluate growth and intellectual outcome in children with persistent SH {{who have never been}} treated with levothyroxine. DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical and auxological parameters, thyroid function, and intellectual outcome were evaluated in 36 children with persistent SH at the age of 9. 7 ± 0. 6 (range 4 - 18. 0) years. Children had been followed longitudinally for 3. 3 ± 0. 3 (range 2. 0 - 9. 3) years, from first diagnosis of SH until enrollment in the study. Thirty-six age- and sex-matched children were enrolled in the study as controls. RESULTS: At study <b>entry,</b> <b>height</b> (- 0. 8 ± 0. 2 SDS), bone age/chronological age (BA/CA ratio 0. 92 ± 0. 6), and body mass index (BMI - 0. 1 ± 0. 2 SDS) in SH children were normal. Despite long-term duration of SH, none of these parameters showed a worsening with respect to height (- 0. 7 ± 0. 2 SDS), BA/CA (0. 97 ± 0. 03), and BMI (- 0. 1 ± 0. 2) at the time of first SH detection. None of the children showed overt signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism during the follow-up. Verbal (99. 1 ± 2. 2), performance (100. 4 ± 1. 9), and full-scale (99. 7 ± 1. 9) intelligence quotient (IQ) scores in SH children were normal and comparable to those of controls. No relationship was detected between IQ scores and the degree or duration of SH. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent SH in children is not associated with alterations in growth, bone maturation, BMI, and cognitive function or other complaints that could be ascribed to SH even after several years without therapeutic intervention...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between obesity and prostate cancer risk {{has been studied}} extensively but with inconsistent findings, particularly for tumor aggressiveness.

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression. During follow-up (mean = 15 years) of 16, 514 men, we ascertained 1, 374 incident prostate cancers of which 410 were classified as aggressive, and 139 deaths from prostate cancer. The incidence of all prostate cancer {{was not associated with}} body size or weight change. Weight and BMI at study entry were positively associated with aggressive prostate cancer risk (HR = 1. 06, 95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 13 per 5 kg; HR = 1. 27, 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 1. 49 per 5 kg/m 2) and prostate cancer mortality (HR = 1. 12, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 23 per 5 kg; HR = 1. 49, 95 % CI: 1. 11 - 2. 00 per 5 kg/m 2). Weight gain was positively associated with prostate cancer mortality (HR = 1. 13, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 26 per 5 kg increment); the HR for ≥ 20 kg weight gain between age 18 and study entry compared to < 5 kg gain over this period was 1. 84, 95 % CI: 1. 09 - 3. 09.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to compare the kinematic variables in youth swimmers during the grab start between sexes and to investigate the relationship between body composition and kinematic variables of the participants. Six female (Mage = 13. 71 ± 0. 49 yrs) and seven male (Mage = 14. 00 ± 1. 07 yrs) swimmers participated in this study. All participants were required to perform grab start tests in random order (three trials by each participant), while the best attempt was analyzed. Nineteen kinematic parameters consisting of block time, flight time, flight distance, total time, total distance, horizontal and vertical displacement of the center of mass (CM) at take-off, horizontal and vertical displacement of the CM at <b>entry,</b> <b>height</b> of take-off and entry, relative height of take-off, horizontal and vertical velocity of the CM at take-off, horizontal and vertical velocity of the CM at entry, angle of take-off, angle of entry and angle of knee at block were analyzed. Out of the 19 evaluated kinematic parameters, a statistical difference between the female and male group was found only in the total distance. Therefore, both female and male groups are considered as only one group and merged after analyzing the results. Statistical analysis showed positive and negative correlations between horizontal / vertical velocity of CM at take-off and several kinematic variables (e. g. angle of entry (rhorizontal = -. 868, p=. 000 / rvertical =. 591, p=. 02), total distance (rhorizontal =. 594, p=. 02 / rvertical =. 54, p=. 04), and height of take-off (rvertical =. 888, p=. 000), respectively). On the other hand, positive and negative correlations were found between somatotype components and several kinematic variables (e. g. horizontal displacement of CM at entry (rendomorphy = -. 626, p=. 013), angle of entry (rmesomorphy = -. 686, p=. 005 / rectomorphy =. 52, p=. 047), total distance (rendomorphy = -. 626, p=. 012), and height of take-off (rendomorphy = -. 633, p=. 011 / rectomorphy =. 515, p=. 05)). In conclusion, results show that in order to be successful at grab start performance, a swimmer should target to get higher horizontal velocity of CM at take-off and optimize the angle of take-off so this movement form supplies more total distance to the swimmer. Coaches should consider improving start performance and adding start training to regular training sessions.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we study}} the spatiotemporal {{dynamics}} of a two-dimensional core-annular flow (CAF) {{in a square}} channel of an oil/water system. The flow rate of oil is fixed at Qo= 0. 19 l/s and the {{flow rate of water}} Qw is varied from 0. 20 l/s to 0. 46 l/s. For large values of Qw (typically Qw> 0. 23 l/s), the CAF is unstable, and it becomes stable for low values of Qw (typically Qw< 0. 23 l/s). The spatiotemporal diagram technique is used to determine the characteristics of the water-oil interface, namely the <b>entry</b> length, <b>height,</b> parallel length, frequency, wavenumber, phase velocity, amplitude and spatial growth rate of wave amplitude as function of the water flow rate Qw.
