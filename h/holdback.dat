25|$|A <b>holdback</b> line is used {{to prevent}} the lift bag and load from {{floating}} away when used for short distance lifts at the bottom. The <b>holdback</b> {{is attached to the}} lifting ring of the bag, or to the load, and should be attached by a strong cable to an anchor point it cannot lift.

25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top of the bag. This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a <b>holdback</b> line is used for this purpose.|$|E

This bachelor’s thesis investigates the obstacles in the integration of Somali women by focusing on one case, a project named “Kvinnokraft”, partly financed by the European Socialfund. By interviewing eight key actors, opinions about obstacles in the project have been identified. A theoretical framework that incorporates integration, project research, multi-level governance and intersectionality contributes to explaining difficulties in integrating Somali women. The empirical findings show that there are individual, social and institutional <b>holdbacks.</b> Stereotypical perceptions were common amongst officials, which contributes to a creation of an inferior position in the structures {{of the society for}} Somali women. Also, multi-level governance showed that institutional <b>holdbacks</b> were due to changes caused by increasing collaboration of the European Union and municipalities through ESF-projects...|$|R

40|$|Children who undergo {{examinations}} with {{ionizing radiation}} {{have a higher}} risk of cancer. Children are more sensitive to ionizing radiation, since their bodies are developing and are more susceptible to the effects of radiation. The risk of cancer increases with a higher radiation dose. Computed tomography surveys provide many times higher dose of radiation than a conventional X-ray. X-ray examinations of children with CT scans increases despite awareness of the high radiation dose. It is important to protect radiosensitive organs in children. The aim {{of the study was to}} study the physical radiation shielding if it reduces the radiation dose to sensitive organs in children, and if there are any obstacles to use these. 11 articles were selected for review and included in the analysis. Results of the study show that physical radiation shielding reduces radiation dose to sensitive organs with some <b>holdbacks</b> such as artifacts and noise.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay was to survey the students’ {{interest}} for the past; {{in order to create}} new method tools for the teaching of history in today’s school. From this purpose, this question emerged: What kind of aspects affect the students’ interest for the past. How do these aspects promote the students’ historical consciousness? Are these aspects opportunities or <b>holdbacks</b> for the teaching of history’s purpose to develop the students’ historical consciousness? Interviews were conducted and from these five different categories were created: the past in everyday-life, interest for the past, acquisition of knowledge, how the past affects and the interest for history in school. These five categories were analyzed by using the concept and theory of historical consciousness. The result was that elder relatives and parents belong to the biggest factors, as well as the teaching of history in school. However, the crucial factor was whether the students could at all relate to the past. Furthermore, the interviewed students have a historical consciousness; however, it is flawed {{due to the fact that}} they do not see history as a whole...|$|R

5000|$|A {{car dealer}} orders {{vehicles}} from the manufacturer for inventory and pays interest (called flooring or floorplanning). Dealer holdbacks are {{a system of}} payments made by the manufacturers to their dealers. The <b>holdback</b> payments assist the dealer's ability to stock their inventory of vehicles and improves the profitability of dealers. Typically the <b>holdback</b> amount is around 1% to 3% of the vehicles' manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). Hold-back is usually not a negotiable part of the price a consumer {{would pay for the}} vehicle, but dealers will [...] "give up" [...] the dealer <b>holdback</b> {{to get rid of a}} car that has been sitting in its inventory for a long time, or if the additional sale will bring them up to the manufacturer's additional incentive payments for reaching unit bonus targets. The <b>holdback</b> was originally designed to help offset the cost the new car dealer has for paying interest on the money that is borrowed to keep the car in inventory, but is in effect lowering the dealer's gross profit, and thus the sales commissions paid to employees. The <b>holdback</b> allows dealerships to promote at- or near-invoice price sales and still achieve comfortable profits on such transactions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{research}} how pedagogues work with communication and technique within language development for children with special needs. It covers children with language disorder and language delay as well as children having a different language than Swedish as their native language. The main questions used are: What means of communication methods are the pedagogues using on their daily work with children with special needs and what methods are used in the preschool to support the children with the language development? What obstacles and possibilities do the pedagogues identify when it comes to use of technical tools and what <b>holdbacks</b> are identified in the preschools when it comes to use of technical tools? The identified conclusions were that the sociocultural perspective became the focus of argument throughout the study as it can be used to connect communication and language development. The method to get answers to the questions was to perform four interviews in different preschools. The preschools were located within different counties close to a major city. The aim was initially to see how preschools work with technical tools and language development with children. This purpose was revisited as several preschools do not use technical tools as portable reading devices as we initially thought. The performed interviews were influenced by the model of Bornholm and knowledge of how this model can be used in the preschool support to support the language development for the children. Keywords: communication in preschool, language development, children with special needs, first language, learning tablet and social context. ...|$|R
40|$|The FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) {{data format}} {{has been the}} de facto data format for astronomy-related data {{products}} {{since its inception in}} the late 1970 s. While the FITS file format is widely supported, it lacks many of the features of more modern data serialization, such as the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF 5). The HDF 5 file format offers considerable advantages over FITS, such as improved I/O speed and compression, but has yet to gain widespread adoption within astronomy. One of the major <b>holdbacks</b> is that HDF 5 is not well supported by data reduction software packages and image viewers. Here, we present a comparison of FITS and HDF 5 as a format for storage of astronomy datasets. We show that the underlying data model of FITS can be ported to HDF 5 in a straightforward manner, and that by doing so the advantages of the HDF 5 file format can be leveraged immediately. In addition, we present a software tool, fits 2 hdf, for converting between FITS and a new `HDFITS' format, where data are stored in HDF 5 in a FITS-like manner. We show that HDFITS allows faster reading of data (up to 100 x of FITS in some use cases), and improved compression (higher compression ratios and higher throughput). Finally, we show that by only changing the import lines in Python-based FITS utilities, HDFITS formatted data can be presented transparently as an in-memory FITS equivalent.
