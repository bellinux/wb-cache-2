5000|$|<b>Flush</b> <b>deck</b> {{is a term}} in naval architecture. It {{can refer}} to any <b>deck</b> of a <b>ship</b> which is {{continuous}} from stem to stern. It has two specific common referents: ...|$|R
2500|$|In side profile, turret <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> resembled other {{merchant}} vessels with <b>flush</b> <b>decks</b> or {{with small}} forecastles and poop decks. In cross-section {{the differences between}} turret deck vessels and more conventional ships are apparent. There was no gunwale; the vertical side of a turret ship curves inward above the load line to a horizontal plane. This flat area {{was known as the}} harbour deck. Further inboard, this [...] "deck" [...] arced to the vertical again by a reverse curve. That vertical plane then joined the weather deck atop the turret at a right angle. Structurally these elements were part of the hull, not of the superstructure, and the cargo holds of the ship extended up to the true weather deck atop the turret.|$|R
50|$|Mahan was a <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> destroyer; {{so-called}} {{because she}} was designed without a raised forecastle like past US destroyers. The ship had four smokestacks, and was built with a fuller hull for increased strength. The <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> destroyers included the , Wickes and es, which were {{often referred to as}} the flush deckers or the four stackers.|$|R
50|$|The wide <b>flush</b> <b>decks</b> and {{guardrails}} make access {{around the}} boat easy and relatively safe.|$|R
50|$|The Swan 76 was {{designed}} by Olin Stephens and built by Nautor's Swan and first launched in 1979. The boat was available in two versions, with <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> or deckhouse. The deckhouse version was available with the centerboard or deep keel options whereas the <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> was available with a deep keel. Five boats were built during a production run that ran from 1979-1981.|$|R
2500|$|The hull {{was built}} of steel with a <b>flush</b> <b>deck.</b> [...] The deckhouses were built of teak.|$|R
5000|$|Unusually for a brig-sloop, she was {{virtually}} a two-deck vessel as the waist between forecastle and quarterdeck was filled in {{to form a}} continuous <b>flush</b> <b>deck.</b> The upper <b>deck</b> below this <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> carried six 24-pounder carronades and two 18-pounder long guns, all mounted on centreline pivots. The gun crews could fire their weapons {{to either side of}} the vessel by rotating the carriages along grooves set into the deck firing through the eight gunports on either side to accommodate these guns.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flush</b> <b>deck</b> {{aircraft}} carriers are {{those with no}} island superstructure, so that the top deck of the vessel consists of only an unbroken flight deck.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flushed</b> <b>deck</b> {{design was}} {{introduced}} with rice ships built in Bengal Subah, Mughal India (modern Bangladesh), resulting in hulls that were stronger and {{less prone to}} leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a stepped deck design. This was a key innovation in shipbuilding at the time. The British East India Company later duplicated the <b>flushed</b> <b>deck</b> design of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|... "Flush deck" [...] in {{its more}} {{specific}} maritime-architecture sense denotes (for instance) the <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> destroyers described above: the <b>flush</b> <b>decks</b> are broken by masts, guns, funnels, and other structures and impediments, and {{are far from}} being unbroken planes. [...] "Flush deck" [...] in this sense only signifies that the main deck runs {{the length of the}} ship and does not end before the stem (with a separate raised forecastle deck forward) or before the stern (with a separate raised or, as seen on many modern warships, lowered quarterdeck rearward).|$|R
5000|$|The {{final design}} had a <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> and four smokestacks. It {{was a fairly}} {{straightforward}} evolution of the preceding Caldwell class. General dissatisfaction with the earlier [...] "1,000 ton" [...] designs (Cassin and Tucker classes) led to the fuller hull form of the [...] "flush deck" [...] type. Greater beam and the <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> provided greater hull strength. In addition, the Wickes class had [...] ( [...] more than the Caldwell class), providing an extra 5 kn. The machinery arrangement {{of some of the}} Caldwells was used, with geared steam turbines on two shafts.|$|R
500|$|A rebuild in 1922 saw the <b>ship's</b> well <b>deck</b> built over, {{creating}} a <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> profile. In 1930 {{the ship was}} refurbished and modernized. By this time, Kommandøren measured [...] and [...]|$|R
50|$|On the <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> above she {{additionally}} carried six 12-pounder carronades (two forwards {{and four}} on the quarterdeck). The crews could also shift the carronades on her upper deck {{from side to}} side as required.|$|R
50|$|USRC Tahoma, was a steel-hull <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> cutter {{that served}} in the United States Revenue Cutter Service from 1909 to 1914 with the Bering Sea Patrol and was the sister ship to the USRC Yamacraw.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hull of the}} Naniwa-class cruiser was {{a typical}} <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> with high {{freeboard}} to improve seaworthiness. The design came with a ram attached to the reinforced bow, which was standard practice for the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{stability}} problems {{experienced by}} Suma was discovered before {{the completion of}} Akashi, and she was modified during construction with greater freeboard amidships, a <b>flush</b> <b>deck,</b> and without fighting tops to lower her center of gravity.|$|R
5000|$|Colosse was a [...] 74-gun ship of {{the line}} of the French Navy. Between 1815 and 1827, her {{forecastle}} and quarterdeck were razéed and she was turned into the <b>flush</b> <b>deck,</b> 60-gun first rank frigate Pallas.|$|R
50|$|Bengali {{shipbuilding}} was advanced {{compared to}} European shipbuilding at the time. Ship-repairing, for example, was very advanced in Bengal, where European shippers visited to repair vessels. An important innovation in shipbuilding was {{the introduction of}} a <b>flushed</b> <b>deck</b> design in Bengal rice ships, resulting in hulls that were stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a stepped deck design. The British East India Company later duplicated the <b>flushed</b> <b>deck</b> and hull designs of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution.|$|R
50|$|Trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> were {{influenced}} by (some would say copied from) turret <b>deck</b> <b>ships.</b> In 1892, the Sunderland, England firm of William Doxford and Sons Ltd. built its first turret <b>deck</b> <b>ship.</b> Inspired by U.S. whalebacks, one of which had recently visited Liverpool, Doxford built a ship which had a curved hull form which was stepped in above the waterline. The narrow part of the hull, called a turret, {{was part of the}} hold.|$|R
50|$|Their <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> {{resulted}} in both weight savings and increased strength {{by allowing the}} hull's longitudinal members to be continuous. As with Yūbari, the design featured side and deck armour integrated into the ship's structure, saving additional weight.|$|R
50|$|Indian shipbuilding, {{particularly}} in Bengal, was advanced compared to European shipbuilding at the time, with Indians selling ships to European firms. Ship-repairing, for example, was very advanced in Bengal, where European shippers visited to repair vessels. An important innovation in shipbuilding was {{the introduction of}} a <b>flushed</b> <b>deck</b> design in Bengal rice ships, resulting in hulls that were stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of traditional European ships built with a stepped deck design. The British East India Company later duplicated the <b>flushed</b> <b>deck</b> and hull designs of Bengal rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|The Ōyodo {{design was}} as an {{enlarged}} and improved {{version of the}} [...] Ōyodo retained the same general hull design as the cruiser , with a <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> and bulbous bow: however, her armament differed both in layout and weaponry, and her armour protection was reduced.|$|R
60|$|Glance {{fore and}} aft our <b>flush</b> <b>decks.</b> What a {{swarming}} crew! All told, they muster hard upon eight hundred millions of souls. Over these we have authoritative Lieutenants, a sword-belted Officer of Marines, a Chaplain, a Professor, a Purser, a Doctor, a Cook, a Master-at-arms.|$|R
50|$|The New York Times {{described}} Harry Belock in March 1955 as a thin intense 47-year-old. He {{was an avid}} amateur golfer, {{and enjoyed}} using his 50 ft <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> Chris-Craft yacht, the Bar-L-Rick, for engineering projects and cruising. His home and yacht were filled with electronic devices.|$|R
50|$|The Swan 82 was {{designed}} by German Frers and built by Nautor's Swan and first launched in 2000. This was an extended version of the Swan 80 hull. This was initially launched as a raised saloon but later and <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> and semi raised saloon were introduced.|$|R
50|$|The power yacht Josephine was {{designed}} for Edward Shearson, a New York Yacht Club member, by William Gardner and built by Robert Jacobs at City Island, Bronx, New York. The yacht was twin screw, <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> with two deck houses {{and at the time}} one of the larger power yachts built.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-mornin', cap'n," [...] said he, when he {{had made}} good his entrance. [...] "I was taking you for a Fiji man-of-war, what with your <b>flush</b> <b>decks</b> and them spars. Well, gen'lemen all, here's wishing you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year," [...] he added, and lurched against a stay.|$|R
5000|$|... "Flush deckers" [...] is {{a common}} {{nickname}} {{for a series of}} American destroyers built in large quantities during or shortly after World War I - the Caldwell, Wickes, and Clemson classes - so called because they lacked the raised forecastle of preceding American destroyers, thus the main <b>deck</b> was a <b>flush</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The well decks of {{passenger}} liners {{were often}} {{for the lowest}} class passengers' use with the well deck of the [...] Titanic reserved for third class passengers. By mid 20th Century the concept of well deck design in passenger liners was [...] "old fashioned" [...] and newer ships were designed with <b>flush</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
50|$|As with turret <b>deck</b> <b>ships,</b> {{the design}} of the trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> was said to {{maximize}} strength while reducing the amount of steel needed for construction. Disadvantages included the narrow hatches atop the trunk, which inhibited efficient loading and unloading. The low freeboard meant smaller waves could board the ship, and the bridge and superstructure therefore had to be stronger to resist wave action.|$|R
5|$|Inverlyon was {{a fishing}} smack of 59 tons burthen {{that was a}} part of the fishing fleet at Lowestoft on the Suffolk coast. The wooden boat had a <b>flush</b> <b>deck,</b> two masts, and no engine. Inverlyons sails were fore-and-aft rigged and may have been red ochre in colour, the {{traditional}} sail colour for British smacks.|$|R
5000|$|Santísima Trinidad remains {{famous as}} one of the few four-decker ships of the line ever built. The U.S. Navy {{constructed}} the four-deck, 136-gun [...] and the French the 120-gun Valmy (both with similar <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> arrangement), and the Royal Navy planned — but did not actually build — the 170-gun four-decker Duke of Kent.|$|R
50|$|Dédalo was {{equipped}} with two hangars. The one {{in front of the}} superstructure was reserved for the dirigibles, with a mooring mast at the bow. The other, behind the superstructure, was fitted with an elevator to service the seaplanes. Having neither a <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> nor a catapult, her seaplanes had to be launched and retrieved by cranes.|$|R
