25|$|Alternating current {{systems can}} use {{transformers}} to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings {{in the cost}} of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other <b>electric</b> <b>device)</b> affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} schools of {{chiropractic}} adjustive techniques, although most chiropractors mix techniques from several schools. The following adjustive procedures were received {{by more than}} 10% of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey: Diversified technique (full-spine manipulation, employing various techniques), extremity adjusting, Activator technique (which uses a spring-loaded tool to deliver precise adjustments to the spine), Thompson Technique (which relies on a drop table and detailed procedural protocols), Gonstead (which emphasizes evaluating the spine along with specific adjustment that avoids rotational vectors), Cox/flexion-distraction (a gentle, low-force adjusting procedure which mixes chiropractic with osteopathic principles and utilizes specialized adjusting tables with movable parts), adjustive instrument, Sacro-Occipital Technique (which models the spine as a torsion bar), Nimmo Receptor-Tonus Technique, applied kinesiology (which emphasises [...] "muscle testing" [...] as a diagnostic tool), and cranial. Chiropractic biophysics technique uses inverse functions of rotations during spinal manipulation. Koren Specific Technique (KST) may use their hands, or they may use an <b>electric</b> <b>device</b> known as an [...] "ArthroStim" [...] for assessment and spinal manipulations. Insurers in the US and UK that cover other chiropractic techniques exclude KST from coverage because they consider it to be [...] "experimental and investigational". Medicine-assisted manipulation, such as manipulation under anesthesia, involves sedation or local anesthetic and is done by a team that includes an anesthesiologist; a 2008 systematic review did not find enough evidence to make recommendations about its use for chronic low back pain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveImplantation of a left {{ventricular}} assist device {{as a bridge}} to transplantation has become an acceptable approach for patients with end-stage heart failure. Our long-term results with 3 Thoratec HeartMate devices are presented to outline improvements in successful bridging to transplantation and post-transplant survival. MethodsFrom August 1990 through January 2003, 243 patients underwent implantation of Thoratec HeartMate devices as a bridge to transplantation. This included 52 (21. 4 %) pneumatic devices, 17 (7. 0 %) dual-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices,</b> and 174 (71. 6 %) single-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices.</b> ResultsMean age was 49. 7 ± 13. 7 years. Mean support time was 78. 1 ± 82. 9 days (0 - 541). Bridging success increased from 63. 5 % (n = 33) for pneumatic devices to 64. 7 % (n = 11) for dual-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices</b> and 72. 4 % (n = 126) for single-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices</b> (P =. 005). Posttransplant 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year actuarial survival increased from 87. 5 %, 78. 1 %, and 71. 9 % in patients with pneumatic devices to 91. 5 %, 86. 9 %, and 81. 3 %, respectively, for patients with single-lead vented <b>electric</b> <b>devices.</b> Device infection and malfunction occurred in 17. 7 % (n = 43) and 12. 8 % (n = 31) of patients, respectively. ConclusionsSuccessful bridging to transplantation and posttransplant survival has improved over time. Left ventricular assist devices have become increasingly more effective in bridging patients with end-stage heart failure to transplantation. This is likely due {{to a combination of}} better patient selection, improvements in clinical practice, and evolution in device design...|$|R
