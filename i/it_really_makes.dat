500|$|LeVert {{had been}} {{expected}} to be a 2015 NBA Draft selection, but following his injury some felt his draft stock was impaired. Following the season, he sought advice from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, but decided that he needed a second evaluation from them as the field of declared underclassmen became more clear with the thinking that [...] "I don't think <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> sense to (leave school) early and get drafted in the second round". On April 21, LeVert announced that he would return for his senior season. According to CBSSports.com's Sam Vecenie, this would give LeVert a chance to improve his pick and roll decision making, his midrange offensive game and his defense, especially against screens.|$|E
500|$|Several game modes in Backbreaker {{can also}} be played as local or online multi-player over the Internet. In Exhibition mode, a second player can join the game and can play either against or with the first player. Two players may also compete against one another in Tackle Alley for the most points. Games against other players are played in splitscreen format {{as opposed to the}} usual single-camera view of other {{football}} game series. This is due to Backbreakers [...] "on the field" [...] camera angle, set close to the players, making it difficult for a single-camera two-player setup. Although this setup differs from most modern football games, the developers believe it would add realism to the player's experience.

Epitaph had previously released Patent Pending, the 2006 album by Skiba's side project Heavens. Named Heart & Skull after Alkaline Trio's logo, the new label would be inaugurated by the release of their new album. Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. We knew it was time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> sense to release our own records, but we wanted to make sure we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special to us.

60|$|On this {{occasion}} Frank Greystock {{went down to}} Portray Castle {{with the intention of}} staying at the house during the very short time that he would remain in Scotland. He was going there solely on his cousin's business,--with no view to grouse-shooting or other pleasure, and he purposed remaining but a very short time,--perhaps only one night. His cousin, moreover, had spoken of having guests with her, in which case there could be no tinge of impropriety in his doing so. And whether she had guests, or whether she had not, what difference could <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>make?</b> Mr. Andrew Gowran had already seen what there was to see, and could do all the evil that could be done.

That evil, if it were an evil, must be encountered with absolute indifference. So he went direct to the castle, and was received quietly, but very graciously, by his cousin Lizzie.|$|R

40|$|TITLE: Interactive Whiteboard in Educational Practise AUTHOR: Mgr. Lenka Žďárská DEPARTMENT: Department of Information Technology and Education SUPERVISOR: PhDr. Josef Procházka, Ph. D. ABSTRACT: Is it {{possible}} to use the interactive whiteboard as a phenomenon of today's education? Does <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>make</b> the process of education more efficient? Does it have any motivational potential and does it make a teacher's daily work easier? Offered dissertation will try to clarify these suggested questions. The Thesis is introduced by a theoretical part which describes the interactive whiteboard as a complex and integrates it into {{the current system of}} didactic tools. It also deals with the aspects of efficient language learning among which belong motivation and interactivity. The theoretical part is followed by the analyses of empirical research which is devoted to using the interactive whiteboard from teacher's and student's viewpoint. The main aim of this work is to incorporate the technical didactic tool - the interactive whiteboard into the current system of didactic tools and secondly, in experimental verification of its effects on teachers and students within educational process.

But that shows that where people have nothing to do but attend to their social duties they are always prompt--even the men; women, of course, reply early anyway, and you don't really care for them; but in town the men seem to put it off till the very last moment, and then some of them call when it's over to excuse themselves for not having come after accepting. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> you wish for a leisure class.

60|$|Wellhausen {{himself had}} {{explained}} Jehovah as 'a family or tribal god, {{either of the}} family of Moses' (tribe of Levi) 'or of the tribe of Joseph.' It seems to be all one to Mr. Oxford whether Jehovah was a god of Moses's tribe or quite the reverse, 'a Kenite god.' Yet <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>makes</b> a good deal of difference! For in a complex of tribes, speaking one language, it is to the last degree unexampled (within my knowledge) that one tribe, or family, possesses, all to itself, a family god who is also the Creator and is later accepted as such by all the other tribes. One may ask for instances of such a thing in any known race, in any stage of culture. Peru will not help us--not the Creator, Pachacamac, but the Sun, is the god of the Inca family. If, on the other hand, Jehovah was a Kenite god, the Kenites were a half-Arab Semitic people connected with Israel, and may very well have retained traditions of a Supreme Being which, in Egypt, were likely to be dimmed, as Exodus asserts, by foreign religions. The learned Stade, to be sure, may disbelieve in Israel's sojourn in Egypt, but that revolutionary opinion is not necessarily binding on us and involves a few difficulties.|$|E
