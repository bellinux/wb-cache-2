5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{description}} of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.|$|E

5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Due to {{ergonomic}} exposure {{musicians are}} at risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck, <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> upper extremities. <b>The</b> literature confirms musculoskeletal problems in these anatomic regions among orchestra musicians. Methods An explorative cross-sectional study among 441 musicians from six Danish symphony orchestras; 216 underwent a clinical examination constructed for the purpose. Prior to the examination the musicians rated their maximally perceived trouble within the last week on a scheme blinded to the examiner. Accessibility to the clinical examination differed between orchestras. The aims were to assess the prevalence of 1) perceived symptoms within <b>the</b> previous week <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck, <b>back</b> <b>and</b> limbs and of 2) clinical findings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck, <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> upper extremities, and 3) to investigate the co-existence of the perceived symptoms and clinical findings. Results Symptoms and findings were most common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck, <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> shoulders. Due to a poor co-existence between self-reported symptoms and clinical findings musicians experiencing bodily trouble could not be identified through this clinical examination. Free accessibility to the examination was of major importance to participation. Conclusions <b>In</b> compliance with <b>the</b> purpose, perceived symptoms within the previous week and present clinical findings were assessed. Although both symptoms and findings were most frequent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neck, <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> shoulders <b>the</b> co-existence of anatomically localized symptoms and findings was generally quite poor in this study. Discrepancy between symptoms and findings might be caused by the participants currently attending work and therefore being relatively healthy, and the fluctuating nature of musculoskeletal problems. Furthermore from a comparison of different measuring units - self-reported symptoms being period prevalence rates and clinical findings point prevalence rates; a bias which may also be inherent in similar studies combining self-reported questionnaire data and clinical findings. </p...|$|R

Hearing the snap of the fuse primer, and realizing that his wounded comrade lay {{helpless}} beside the deadly explosive, he courageously and with complete disregard for his own personal safety threw himself on the man to shield him from the explosion. Although he was seriously wounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> legs by fragments, and was blown several feet by the concussion, he crawled back to his comrade and administered first aid to him.

Williams followed him, shooting him again and killing him. He then shot and killed George's wife, Iris. The Burkitts' 17-year-old daughter was hit four times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> once in the thigh, but survived. Two other neighbours, a married couple who had witnessed the attack on the Burkitts, also survived being shot. The injured were treated at Birmingham General Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
5|$|As {{de facto}} racial {{segregation}} increased, so did tensions between {{residents of the}} northeast {{and members of the}} predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and {{had been shot in the}} back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> that he was carrying a gun. A police officer testified to finding a modified starter's pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell's jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Mike Kelly.|$|E
