5|$|<b>Grid-connected</b> {{domestic}} {{wind turbines}} may use grid energy storage, thus replacing purchased electric power with locally produced power when available. The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be {{fed into the}} network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cost}} of solar {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of <b>grid-connected</b> solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|Many {{residential}} PV {{systems are}} connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets. In these <b>grid-connected</b> PV systems, use of energy storage is optional. In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such stand-alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{government}} {{has set a}} target to generate 10% of the UK's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Energy White Paper (2003) sets out the Government's aspiration to double that figure to 20% by 2020. It has additionally signed up to the legally binding Kyoto Protocol, which requires a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% of 1990 levels by 2008–12 and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 20% of 1990 levels by 2010. Regional and local authorities are required {{to contribute to the}} delivery of these national targets. The East Riding has an above-average potential to generate renewable electricity for Local Authorities in the region due its large wind energy potential. The East Riding of Yorkshire is set a target of 41MW by 2010, and a target for 2021 of 148MW for installed <b>grid-connected</b> renewable energy. There are operational wind farms at Lissett in Holderness and Out Newton {{to the north of the}} Humber estuary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grid-connected</b> solar {{electricity}} {{can be used}} locally thus reducing transmission/distribution losses (transmission losses in the US were approximately 7.2% in 1995).|$|E
25|$|The first utility <b>grid-connected</b> {{wind turbine}} {{to operate in}} the UK was built by John Brown & Company in 1951 in the Orkney Islands.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2014, 3,230 {{turbines}} at 84 {{offshore wind}} farms across 11 European countries had been installed and <b>grid-connected,</b> making a total capacity of 11,027 MW.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} of the Tuvalu Solar Power Project in 2008-9, involved the installation of a 40kW <b>grid-connected</b> solar system that is intended to provide about 5% of Funafuti’s peak demand, and 3% of TEC’s annual household consumption. The first large scale system in Tuvalu was a 40kW solar panel installation {{on the roof of}} Tuvalu Sports Ground. This <b>grid-connected</b> 40kW solar system was established in 2008 by the E8 and Japan Government through Kansai Electric Company (Japan) and contributes 1% of electricity production on Funafuti. Future plans include expanding this plant to 60kW.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic {{systems have}} long been used in {{specialized}} applications, and standalone and <b>grid-connected</b> PV systems have been in use since the 1990s.

25|$|The US State of Maine {{solicited}} {{proposals in}} September 2010 {{to build the}} world's first floating, commercial wind farm. The RFP is seeking proposals for 25MW of deep-water offshore wind capacity to supply power for 20-year long-term contract period via <b>grid-connected</b> floating wind turbines in the Gulf of Maine. Successful bidders must enter into long-term power supply contracts with either Central Maine Power Company (CMP), Bangor Hydro-Electric Company (BHE), or Maine Public Service Company (MPS). Proposals were due by May 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} considers {{renewable resources}} {{as a vital}} element of its strategy to diversify energy supply, reduce vulnerability to external shocks, and mitigate {{the environmental impacts of}} energy production. The development of large hydropower projects and the provision of further incentives for <b>grid-connected</b> renewable projects are the present priorities of the government in the renewable energy sector. The penetration of renewable energy technologies into rural electrification programs is still limited and most of the rural electrification activities are grid extensions.|$|E
25|$|North America’s first {{floating}} <b>grid-connected</b> {{wind turbine}} was {{lowered into the}} Penobscot River in Maine on 31May 2013 by the University of Maine Advanced Structures and Composites Center and its partners. The VolturnUS 1:8 was towed down the Penobscot River where it was deployed for 18 months in Castine, ME. During its deployment, it experienced numerous storm events representative of design environmental conditions prescribed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines, 2013.|$|E
25|$|A {{photovoltaic}} system, or solar PV {{system is}} a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other electrical accessories. PV systems range from small, roof-top mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are <b>grid-connected,</b> while stand-alone systems only account for {{a small portion of}} the market.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{cumulative}} PV {{capacity in the}} U.S., there has been growth in the distributed generation segment, which are all <b>grid-connected</b> PV installations in the residential and non-residential markets. Non-residential market includes installations on commercial, government, school and non-profit organization properties. Between 2000 and 2013 there had been 2,261 MW of residential solar and 4,051 MW non-residential solar installed. In 2013, there were 1,913 MW installed for these markets; the top 5 states were California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Arizona. The residential market had 60% annual growth in 2013. The growth contributing factors were new marketing strategies to partner with retailers to reach more customers, and new financial models including the securitization of residential solar assets. Non-residential PV had a slight growth of 4% in 2013 as the market was recovering from the oversupply in 2012. The future growth will likely come from New York, Arizona, and Colorado.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, the University of Maine {{made history}} with its VolturnUS 1:8, a 65-foot-tall {{floating}} turbine prototype that is 1:8th {{the scale of}} a 6-megawatt (MW), 450-foot rotor diameter design. VolturnUS 1:8 was the first <b>grid-connected</b> offshore wind turbine deployed in the Americas. The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete semisubmersible floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation & Maintenance costs, and to allow local manufacturing throughout the US and the World. The VolturnUS technology {{is the culmination of}} collaborative research and development conducted by the University of Maine-led DeepCwind Consortium. U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King announced in June 2016 that Maine’s New England Aqua Ventus I floating offshore wind demonstration project, designed by the DeepCwind Consortium, has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy to participate in the Offshore Wind Advanced Technology Demonstration program.|$|E
25|$|The European Union {{is helping}} Niue convert to {{renewable}} energy. In July 2009 a solar panel system was installed, injecting about 50kW into the Niue national power grid. This is nominal 6% {{of the average}} 833kW electricity production. The solar panels are at Niue High School (20kW), Niue Power Corporation office (1.7kW) and the Niue Foou Hospital (30kW). The EU-funded <b>grid-connected</b> PV systems are supplied under the REP-5 programme and were installed recently by the Niue Power Corporation on the roofs {{of the high school}} and the power station office and on ground-mounted support structures in front of the hospital. They will be monitored and maintained by the NPC. In 2014 two additional solar power installations were added to the Niue national power grid, one funded under PALM5 of Japan is located outside of the Tuila power station – so far only this has battery storage, the other under European Union funding is located opposite the Niue International Airport Terminal.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{energy in}} Tuvalu {{is a growing}} sector of the country's energy supply. Tuvalu has {{committed}} to becoming the first country to get 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020. This is considered possible {{because of the small}} size of the population of Tuvalu and its abundant solar energy resources due to its tropical location. It is somewhat complicated because Tuvalu consists of nine inhabited islands. The Tuvalu National Energy Policy (TNEP) was formulated in 2009, and the Energy Strategic Action Plan defines and directs current and future energy developments so that Tuvalu can achieve the ambitious target of 100% renewable energy for power generation by 2020. The program is expected to cost 20 million US dollars and is supported by the e8, a group of 10 electric companies from G8 countries. The Government of Tuvalu worked with the e8 group to develop the Tuvalu Solar Power Project, which is a 40kW <b>grid-connected</b> solar system that is intended to provide about 5% of Funafuti’s peak demand, and 3% of the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation's annual household consumption.|$|E
500|$|The European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) is a {{research}} facility operating a <b>grid-connected</b> wave test site at Billia Croo, off {{the west coast of}} the Orkney Mainland, and a tidal power test site in the Fall of Warness, off the northern island of Eday. At the official opening of the Eday project the site was described as [...] "the first {{of its kind in the}} world set up to provide developers of wave and tidal energy devices with a purpose-built performance testing facility." ...|$|E
500|$|Renewable {{energy is}} also the most {{economic}} solution for new <b>grid-connected</b> capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where [...] "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today". As of 2012, renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally. In 2011, additions included 41 gigawatt (GW) of new wind power capacity, 30 GW of PV, 25 GW of hydro-electricity, 6 GW of biomass, 0.5 GW of CSP, and 0.1 GW of geothermal power.|$|E
500|$|In an {{electricity}} {{system without}} grid energy storage, generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be {{go up and}} down in reaction to {{the rise and fall of}} solar electricity (see load following power plant). [...] While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. [...] Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, <b>grid-connected</b> intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections, energy storage or demand side management. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing baseload generation contracts.|$|E
500|$|In {{stand alone}} PV systems {{batteries}} are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With <b>grid-connected</b> photovoltaic power system, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the electrical grid. Net metering and feed-in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. [...] Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually. When wind and solar are {{a small fraction of the}} grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. Batteries used for grid-storage stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.|$|E
500|$|Solar concentrating {{technologies}} such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This <b>grid-connected</b> cogeneration system provided 400kW of electricity plus thermal {{energy in the form}} of 401kW steam and 468kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from seawater {{is one of the oldest}} applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas.
