5|$|After {{this sudden}} spate of activity, Smoke Imix {{continued}} to rule until almost {{the end of}} the 7thcentury; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Copán, including the construction of Structure2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67years and died on 15June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> AltarQ. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple26 and he was buried just two days after his death.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the recall}} process, Republican George Rivera {{announced}} his candidacy for Giron's senate seat. Rivera {{was planning to}} run against Giron in the 2014 elections but stated he would put <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the ballot during the recall process. Rivera had to turn in a petition with 1,000 signatures {{in order to qualify}} to be on the ballot and turned in 1,500 signatures on July 26. Sonia Negrete Winn, a Democrat, also sought to be on the ballot to replace Giron, but failed to obtain the required signatures to be a candidate. In Morse's district, Republican Bernie Herpin announced his interest in replacing Morse and submitted sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot.|$|E

Although estranged from Frederick for several years, the two were reconciled during Seydlitz's final illness.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
5|$|Nixon entered <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} {{announcing his}} candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (brother {{of the late}} president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.|$|E

5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid only around $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick's {{family was}} {{informed}} {{of his death}} by a neighbor who had heard <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a radio broadcast, and the news from the military came via telegraph several days later. The family was immediately inundated by reporters and local well-wishers. Shadrick's body was returned to the United States, and on June 17, 1951, a funeral attended by hundreds of local residents was held in Beckley, West Virginia. The service was set {{to coincide with the}} anniversary of the start of the war. His flag-draped casket was escorted down the streets of the town on a horse-drawn carriage, and he was buried at the American Legion cemetery in the town.|$|E
5|$|The Ross {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific {{exploration of the}} Antarctic in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror.

He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states {{that there has been}} no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E
5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{then made}} short {{work of the}} Kings, {{defeating}} them in four straight, before eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks in five games {{to set up a}} rematch of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal. This time, the Flames won in six games, the last being a 4–2 victory in Montreal on May 25, 1989. The clinching win was especially significant in that it marked the only time that an opposing team defeated the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup on Montreal Forum ice. Al MacInnis captured the Conn Smythe as playoffs' most valuable player, while long-time captain Lanny McDonald announced his retirement. The 1989 Stanley Cup win gave Flames co-owner Sonia Scurfield (Ralph's widow) the distinction of being the first (and as of 2013, only) Canadian woman to have her name engraved on the Cup. It also made Kwong one of the few to have <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> both the Stanley Cup and the Grey Cup.|$|E

5|$|On taking power Henry gave a high {{priority}} to the restoration of royal finances in England, reviving Henry I's financial processes and attempting {{to improve the quality}} of the royal accounting. Revenue from the demesne formed the bulk of Henry's income in England, although taxes were used heavily in the first 11 years of his reign. Aided by the capable Richard FitzNeal, Henry reformed the currency in 1158, putting <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> English coins for the first time and heavily reducing the number of moneyers licensed to produce coins. These measures were successful in improving his income, but on his return to England in the 1160s Henry took further steps. New taxes were introduced and the existing accounts re-audited, and the reforms of the legal system brought in new streams of money from fines and amercements. A wholesale reform of the coinage occurred in 1180, with royal officials taking direct control of the mints and passing the profits directly to the treasury. A new penny, called the Short Cross, was introduced, and the number of mints reduced substantially to ten across the country. Driven by the reforms, the royal revenues increased significantly; during the first part of the reign, Henry's average exchequer income was only around £18,000; after 1166, the average was around £22,000. One economic effect of these changes was a substantial increase in the amount of money in circulation in England and, post-1180, a significant, long-term increase in both inflation and trade.|$|E
5|$|The 2008–09 {{campaign}} was Burnley's first full season with Owen Coyle as manager. Carlisle {{managed to keep}} {{his place in the}} team under the new regime and was a regular fixture in the team {{for the first six months}} of the season. However, he was dropped from the team for the match against Charlton on 31 January 2009 due to a lack of form. He remained out of the team for the whole of February 2009. He made his return to action on 3 March 2009, starting in the centre of defence in the 1–0 win over his old team, Blackpool, at Bloomfield Road. On his next league appearance he scored Burnley's first goal in a 4–2 victory against Crystal Palace at Turf Moor. He went on to score three further goals in the last two months of the season, getting <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the scoresheet against Nottingham Forest, Southampton and his former team, Queens Park Rangers. His goals helped Burnley to a fifth-placed finish in the Championship, and a place in the play-offs. He played in both legs of the semi-final against Reading as the team won 3–0 on aggregate to secure a place in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. Carlisle was handed the man of the match award for his performance as Burnley triumphed 1–0 against Sheffield United to earn promotion to the Premier League for the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

5|$|The porters {{abandon the}} group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and {{eventually}} reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang's steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses {{what seems to be}} a human silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a cliff face, concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops his knife, alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their tent and must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving within sight of the Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before being caught in an avalanche.|$|E
5|$|The {{titles and}} styling of Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ {{featuring}} Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France are mostly for comedic reasons. Colbert became an ordained minister on June 2, 2011, granting himself {{the title of}} Reverend. Colbert was mock-knighted by Queen Noor of Jordan on April 7, 2009, bestowing him with the title of Sir. He was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts by Knox College in 2006, giving him the title of Doctor {{and use of the}} suffix D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts). This title is featured regularly during his segments Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA. Yasiin Bey gave Colbert the use of his stage name Mos Def on October 5, 2011. Colbert was set to interview Mike Tyson on July 23, 2013. Tyson did not appear which led Colbert to declare himself Heavy Weight Champion of the World and grant himself use of the title. The large asterisk in the title is to denote that he did not defeat Tyson in a boxing match. The suffix featuring Flo Rida was added during the segment I tried to sign up for Obamacare on October 23, 2013, where <b>his</b> <b>name</b> <b>on</b> the ACA form said featuring Flo Rida. Her Excellency was added to the title as Colbert was seated next to Michelle Obama at the White House state dinner in February 2014, in which the President of France François Hollande was not accompanied by a partner. Because it is customary that the first lady of a visiting nation is seated next to the First Lady of the United States, Colbert proclaimed himself First Lady of France on February 12, 2014.|$|E
