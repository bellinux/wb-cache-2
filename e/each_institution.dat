5|$|Schuster also {{assisted}} Birkenhead in {{his attempts}} to reform {{the administration of the}} court system, particularly in his preparation of the Supreme Court (Consolidation) Act 1925. A committee was also set up to look into the reform of the Supreme Court, the County Courts and the Probate Services, divided into a subcommittee for <b>each</b> <b>institution.</b> Schuster served {{as a member of the}} committee, with his primary goal being to end the patronage and nepotism that filled the judicial system. Although the Supreme Court was resistant the committee did succeed in making some changes, such as introducing mandatory retirement ages for masters and clerks; they were unable, however, to end the patronage. Schuster also attempted to reform the County Courts by increasing their jurisdiction, and a Committee on County Court Procedure (known as the Swift Committee after its chairman Rigby Swift) was set up in 1920, with Schuster serving as a member. The commission concluded that HM Treasury had mismanaged the County Courts, and on 1 August 1922 the Lord Chancellor's Office instead became responsible for the courts, with Schuster becoming Accounting Officer. The committee's final report was used as the basis for the County Courts Act 1924, which did much to correct the problems with the County Courts. Schuster was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1920 New Year War Honours.|$|E

25|$|In February 2006, President George W. Bush {{signed into}} law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related {{conforming}} amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, {{as well as a}} number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount <b>each</b> <b>institution</b> is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to changing regulations, {{changes in the}} industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC.

The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle {{to keep up with}} the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with <b>each</b> <b>institution,</b> and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.|$|E

However, some institutions foreseen under the law, such as the River Basin Councils, remain to be created. The water law also establishes priority uses of water, re-defines water user rights, understands water as an economic good, defines sanctions, considers river basins as management units and incorporates groundwater management considerations. It is foreseen that subsidiary legislation (reglamentos) will complement the water law by specifying, for instance, the roles of <b>each</b> <b>institution</b> within the National Water Resources System.|$|E
