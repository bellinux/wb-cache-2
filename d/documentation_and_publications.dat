Standardized clinical photographs {{are part of}} an armamentarium for any ophthalmologist interested in enhancing his or her practice. Unfortunately, many clinicians still avoid taking patient photographs for want of basic knowledge or inclination. The ubiquitous presence of the digital camera and digital technology has made it extremely easy and affordable to take high-quality images. It is not compulsory to employ a professional photographer or invest in expensive equipment any longer for this purpose. Any ophthalmologist should be able to take clinical photographs in his/her office settings with minimal technical skill.

Do people {{know the difference between}} varieties such as unwashed Arabicas, Colombian milds and Robustas, let alone their varying yields? And how many people even know the main coffee producing countries? In a recently published book entitled 'The Economics of Coffee', the Dutch author J. de Graaff has produced a reference work on coffee that is an analytical synthesis of its many dimensions. In over 300 pages, he covers the most important botanical and economic aspects of this cash crop.

40|$|Few {{exploratory}} ventures {{would ever}} be undertaken if the explorer appreciated his own limitations at the outset. Although his ultimate destination is unclear, the route uncertain, the terrain unfamiliar and the tools inadequate he is spurred initially by a self-assurance born of his own limited knowledge. Unfortunately, that same self-assurance ill-equips him for the difficulties which he inevitably has to face en route. This thesis has been no exception to this pattern. It has involved more than {{its fair share of}} blind alleys, false trails, disorientation, retracing of footsteps and re-establishment of bearings. It has occasionally been marked by that feeling of despairing bewilderment which confronts the uncertain traveller lost in unfamiliar territory or overwhelmed by the novelty and complexity of his surroundings. Like most exploratory journeys, it has been difficult to decide when the ultimate destination has been reached and almost impossible in restrospect to recall the exact route by which that particular point was achieved. However, the historian of Dahomey is fortunate in comparison with the explorer venturing into virgin territory. For he is well served by the pioneers who have blazed the trail before him and by the signposts which are available to him. The Kingdom of Dahomey has been well covered by primary source material and contemporary <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>publications...</b>|$|E

The rest of the papers, all on mangrove-friendly aquaculture efforts are from the Philippines, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, and Cambodia.

The proceedings include a tabulation of the reported mangrove-friendly technology by country [...] e. g. silvofisheries in ponds (mangrove and fish/shrimp/mudcrab) and pens (mangrove and mudcrab).

40|$|For {{more than}} 15 years ISAT, the Information and Advisory Service on Appropriate Technology, has been {{involved}} in the development, adaptation and dissemination of appropriate technology. Appropriate technologies use available local resources with minimal damage to the environment and so aim to improve the economic, ecological and socio-cultural conditions of the disadvantaged segments of the population. ISAT provides assistance to all organizations and institutions working in development cooperation through a number of services. These include a question-and-answer service, a range of <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>publications,</b> and the use of networks to help get information to those whom it would benefit most. Every year almost 3, 000 customers (individuals, institutions or organizations) make use of ISAT's question-and-answer service which is provided free-of-charge for users in developing countries. The service attempts to answer each specific question or complex problem with individual advice provided by the regional adviser responsible. The complexity of the question determines the level of involvement by the ISAT experts. A number of stages can be involved in finding the answer, from the adviser's own knowledge and experience, a literature search, passing the enquiry on to specialized advisory services, companies or institutes, or even arranging for and financing local or external short-term consultancy. ISAT also has its own appropriate technology library providing access to more than 10, 000 documents and books and 250 journals. The documentation centre includes reports and statements, some of which have never been published, and also project reports, scientific literature, and international literature. As with the question-and answer service, these documents are available to all parties in the field of development cooperation free-of-charge. ISAT not only makes documentation available, but offers a number of other services including advice to people looking for literature, consultancy on setting up and developing documentation centres, and training courses for documentalists. ISAT believes in the importance of making information available to the public and uses the knowledge it gains from feedback and enquiries to determine gaps in the information available Experienced experts are then commissioned to close these gaps and make the results of their work available. The appropriate technology information is not just made available through technical books and leaflets, but also journals and the use of films and other media. Advice can also be given on the production and distribution of books, journals and other audiovisual material, as well as organizing exhibitions and other special events. To assist and involve local expertise in their work ISAT cooperates with a number of regional information networks including SIATA based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso for West and Central Africa, RATIS based in Harare, Zimbabwe for East and Southern Africa, MAELA and CLADES in Latin American and RISE-AT in Asia.

Mainly, it qualitatively explores the perceptions of both research users and research producers regarding their experiences with research results. The study builds on the models of Diffusion of Innovation (DoI), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Perceived Characteristics of Innovation (PCI). The findings of this study suggest that the investigated dimensions of DoI, PCI and TAM are applicable to the context of assessing research results with the extra dimension of risk reduction. In particular, some of the criteria used to assess the usefulness of research results are through its originality, scalability and relevance. The findings also suggest that <b>documentation</b> <b>and</b> <b>publication</b> are important to research users: Research users assess ease of use based on the presentation of the research results in their documentation; and they assess the quality of research results based on <b>publications</b> <b>and</b> the reputation of researchers.
