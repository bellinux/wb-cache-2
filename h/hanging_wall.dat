25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was felt}} {{over a wide}} area from Alexandria in the southwest to Antioch in the north previously damaged by the earthquake of 526. The area of felt intensity of VIII or more extends from Tripoli in the north to Tyre in the south. Estimates for the magnitude vary from 7.2 on the surface wave magnitude scale to a possible 7.5 on the moment magnitude scale. The rupture length {{is estimated to be}} greater than 100km and possibly as long as 150km. The origin of the tsunami was thought to have been due to an underwater landslide triggered by an earthquake on the Dead Sea Transform itself. More recent analysis suggested that an offshore continuation of the Roum Fault mapped onshore was responsible. However, seabed surveys have discounted this possibility and the discovery of geologically recent fault scarps at seabed indicate that movement on the newly identified Mount Lebanon Thrust was the cause of the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Quaternary uplift recorded by a series of marine-cut terraces between Tripoli and Beirut are consistent with continuing upward movement of the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> of the proposed thrust. At a smaller scale, an uplifted vermetid bench, which indicates vertical movement of about 80cm, is dated to the sixth century A.D. Continued uplift above this thrust since the late Miocene may explain the formation of the Mount Lebanon range.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1999 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} in Nantou County, Taiwan, little information {{was available for}} estimating ground motion that resulted from large (greater than M7) thrust earthquakes, and whether the values seen in that event are commonplace remains unresolved.

A common occurrence of shattered rock that has been observed on the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> of thrust faults reinforces the existence of the strong motions, but precarious rock surveys have indicated that smaller ground motions are present on the foot wall side of the fault.

The kettles were formed when ice situated under gravel outwash from ice sheets melted as the glaciers retreated.|$|E
500|$|Multiple-event {{relocation}} {{of the main}} shock and aftershock epicenters and discontinuous surface ruptures recorded after the earthquake are compatible with northeastward movement on a southwest-dipping thrust, although maximum recorded displacements were less than would have been expected from the observed magnitude. This suggests {{that most of the}} slip did not actually reach the Earth's surface but caused folding at the surface. A previously unmapped thrust with little surface expression, the Abdareh fault, has been identified from the disruption of earlier drainage systems by the growth of the fold in its <b>hanging</b> <b>wall,</b> and is thought to be responsible for the earthquake. [...] Such structures are known as blind thrusts, and have been responsible for many destructive earthquakes in Iran and elsewhere. The geomorphological effects of this particular fold have been partly obscured by the presence of an earlier Neogene topography. The Qazvin region was hit by an even greater earthquake in 1962, which killed 12,200. In 1990 a rupture killed over 40,000 people, injured 60,000, and left more than 500,000 homeless.|$|E

Smaller but related volcanoes include Hoodoo Mountain (...) , Heart Peaks (...) , Maitland Volcano (...) and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (...) [...] Because of Level Mountain's great extent {{it can be seen}} from outer space. This, coupled with elevation and snow, helps define the geology of the region. Level Mountain lies on the Nahlin Plateau, a subdivision of the larger Stikine Plateau that is dominated by the volcano. The basement of the shield consists largely of felsic igneous rocks comprising northern Stikinia, but sedimentary rocks are also present below the lava plateau escarpment. Two major northwest trending faults straddle Level Mountain, both of which were active during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The King Salmon Fault forms a geological boundary between island arc rocks of Stikinia and seafloor rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. Paleozoic to Mesozoic rocks are exposed in the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> of this thrust fault and are intensely cleaved, particularly near the sole of the thrust. The other planar fracture, Nahlin, is an east-dipping thrust fault extending several hundred kilometres from northern British Columbia into southern Yukon.|$|E

2500|$|When Captain Borlase {{arrived as}} the chief agent (mine manager) in 1889 {{it was clear that}} the engine shaft in the Lucy Level had been sunk too far to the south to work the long stretch of good ore that had been found near its {{northern}} end. Also, having been sunk into the footwall, longer and longer cross-cuts were needed to reach the vein from it. Another problem was that limited water resources would place limits on the winding and pumping capacities of the hydraulic engines as the mine deepened. Borlase proposed bold solutions to both problems. First he proposed building a hydroelectric power station further up the Glenridding valley, where water supply was abundant, but could not easily be used in the mine. Electricity could then be used for pumps and winding engines as well as for powering a locomotive. The electric winders and locomotive were to be the first ones installed in a metalliferous mine in Britain. Borlase also proposed a new engine shaft [...] north of the existing shaft, to be sunk initially in the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall,</b> from an eastern extension to Warsop's Crosscut.

2500|$|During {{most of the}} Paleozoic Era, {{what became}} the Ouachita Mountains was {{the bottom of a}} shallow sea, where several {{sedimentary}} layers were created. [...] About 500 million years ago a collision of the South American Plate with the North American Plate caused the shale and sandstone layers to fracture and fissure, creating mountains of the folded rocks. [...] The thermal springs emerge from the plunging crest line of a large overturned anticline in the Zigzag Mountains of the Ouachita anticlinorium. The overturned anticline plunges toward the southwest into the Mazarn Basin. There are two recognized major thrust faults trending nearly parallel to fold axes that define the northern and southern limits of the thermal springs discharge area. The northern fault extends nearly parallel to Fountain Street northeastward about [...] onto the southeast flank of North Mountain, and dips about 26 degrees north. At the northern extent of the thermal springs, this fault is suggested to form along the bedding contact of the Hot Springs Sandstone and Stanley Shale, with the Stanley Shale forming the <b>hanging</b> <b>wall</b> of the fault. The southern fault extends northeastward about [...] roughly along the axis of the Hot Springs anticline, and dips about 44 degrees north.

40|$|Although {{hundreds}} of papers have {{been devoted to}} the geometric and kinematic analysis of compressional tectonic regimes, surprisingly little {{has been written about}} the details of large-scale strain in extended areas. We attempt, by means of quantitative theoretical analysis guided by real geological examples, to establish some ground rules for interpreting extensional phenomena. We have found that large, very low-angle normal faults dominate highly extended terranes, and that both listric and planar normal faults are common components of their <b>hanging</b> <b>walls.</b> The very low-angle normal faults may have displacements from a few kilometres up to several tens of kilometres and we regard their <b>hanging</b> <b>walls</b> as extensional allochthons, analogous (but with opposite sense of movement) to thrust-fault allochthons. Differential tilt between imbricate fault blocks suggests listric geometry at depth, whereas uniformly tilted blocks are more likely to be bounded by planar faults. The tilt direction of imbricate normal-fault blocks within large extensional allochthons is commonly away from the transport direction of these sheets, but in many cases tilts are in the same direction as transport, thus limiting the usefulness of the direction of tilting as a transport indicator. The presence of chaos structure, a structural style widely recognised in the Basin and Range Province, implies large scale simple shear on very low-angle normal faults and does not necessarily form as a result of listric faulting...|$|R
