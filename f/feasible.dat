5|$|However, in locally {{advanced}} tumours, surgery may not routinely {{provide the}} best chance of cure and is often not technically <b>feasible</b> to perform. In these cases radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, offers the only chance of cure.|$|E
5|$|In some select cases, {{pipelines}} {{can even}} transport solids, such as coal and other minerals, over long distances; short distance {{transportation of goods}} such as grain, cement, concrete, solid wastes, pulp etc. is also <b>feasible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Verse 1.69 {{asserts that}} in a {{cleansed}} body resides a peaceful mind, and when this mind achieves purity, Atmavidya (knowledge of soul) becomes <b>feasible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Assuming less {{load and}} rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} needed a {{slightly}} smaller towing crew. Under these circumstances, the use of harnessed oxen—which has been refuted by Tolley {{on the basis of}} their relatively diminished pulling capabilities— would have become <b>feasible.</b> However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{original}} announced {{alignment of the}} line, a West Coast Extension to the Circle Line from the Jurong Region Line is currently under study. It links the West Coast region directly to Pasir Panjang, allowing commuters on the Jurong Region Line access to the central area of the city easily. If <b>feasible,</b> the extension would be ready by 2030.|$|E
5|$|For 1966, {{the engine}} {{capacity}} limit in Formula One was doubled from 1.5litres (92cuin) to 3litres (183cuin). It was not <b>feasible</b> to enlarge existing 1.5-litre engines {{to take full}} advantage of the higher limit and Climax chose not to develop a new 3-litre motor, leaving many teams without a viable engine for 1966.|$|E
5|$|Hot {{springs and}} other {{geothermal}} manifestations are widespread in Iran {{and using them}} to gain geothermal energy has been studied; {{according to a report}} of 2002 hot springs at that time were mainly used for therapeutic purposes and bathing. A report in 2002 indicated that Taftan may be a <b>feasible</b> place to install a binary cycle power plant at Taftan.|$|E
5|$|Ian Garrad, {{impatient}} to establish whether the conversion was <b>feasible,</b> commissioned racing driver and fabricator Ken Miles to build another prototype {{as quickly as}} he could. Miles was provided with a budget of $800, a Series II Alpine, a Ford V8 engine and a 2-speed automatic transmission, and in about a week he had a running V8 conversion, thus proving the concept.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 {{the first}} railway line reached Richmond. Richmond Gasworks opened in 1848, and Richmond {{began to develop}} into a {{significant}} town. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting it to the London Underground. Commuting to central London became <b>feasible</b> and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, Peter Wright, the Chairman of the FIA Safety Commission {{was quoted}} as saying that a closed cockpit would not have averted Bianchi's head injuries, while the Vice President, Andy Mellow, also {{confirmed}} that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was not a <b>feasible</b> solution.|$|E
5|$|Military {{units are}} {{produced}} at specific buildings {{relevant to their}} area. All sea units are created at the docks. Walls and towers are defensive fortifications (Age of Empires {{was one of the}} first real-time strategy games to include walls strong enough to form a <b>feasible</b> means of defense). Farms are used to produce food. Granaries, storage pits, and the Town Center are used to store resources deposited by the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Operation Winter'94 became <b>feasible</b> {{after the}} HVO {{captured}} Kupres (north of the Livanjsko field) in Operation Cincar on 3 November 1994, securing the right {{flank of the}} planned advance northwest of Livno. The HVO and the ARBiH advanced towards Kupres, in the first military effort coordinated between them since the Washington Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Specialized {{applications}} include use in laboratories as containment for high-pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, {{and limited}} use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{being made in}} the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are becoming <b>feasible.</b> The high thermal conductivity of diamond makes it suitable as a heat sink for integrated circuits in electronics.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{separation}} of technetium-99 from {{spent nuclear fuel}} is a long process. During fuel reprocessing, it comes out {{as a component of}} the highly radioactive waste liquid. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long-lived isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes <b>feasible.</b> A series of chemical processes yields technetium-99 metal of high purity.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the production possibilities set {{is known as the}} Production-possibility frontier (PPF). This curve measures the <b>feasible</b> outputs that Crusoe can produce, with a fixed technological constraint and given amount of resources. In this case, the resources and technological constraints are Robinson Crusoe's labour.|$|E
5|$|The players {{went out}} on strike in week 3. The main demand was free agency for all players with at least four years of service. The weekend's games were {{cancelled}} as the owners prepared teams of replacement players. According to owner Hugh Culverhouse, {{it would not be}} <b>feasible</b> to make up the cancelled games, with the TV networks already having their schedules set for the open weekend following the season.|$|E
5|$|Thus, for a {{large-scale}} development to be <b>feasible,</b> the requisite capital must be generated {{from within the}} country itself, and not through export surplus or foreign investment. Only then can productivity increase and lead to increasing returns to scale and eventually create virtuous circles of growth.|$|E
5|$|Trevor H. Hall who {{researched}} {{the case in}} detail established that the levitation took place at Ashley Place in Westminster at a height of 35 feet and suggested rather than levitating Home had stepped across a gap of four feet between two iron balconies. Gordon Stein {{also noted that the}} gap between the two balconies was only four feet making passing between them entirely <b>feasible.</b>|$|E
5|$|World lead {{resources}} exceed 2 billion tons. Significant deposits {{are located}} in Australia, China, Ireland, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Russia, and the United States. Global reserves—resources that are economically <b>feasible</b> to extract—totaled 88 million tons in 2016, of which Australia had 35 million, China 17 million, and Russia 6.4 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{union of}} any two <b>feasible</b> sets is also <b>feasible.</b> That is, F is closed under unions.|$|E
25|$|If S is a nonempty <b>feasible</b> set, {{then there}} exists some x in S such that S \ {x} (the set formed by {{removing}} x from S) is also <b>feasible.</b> That is, F is an accessible set system.|$|E

25|$|Many {{optimization}} algorithms need {{to start}} from a <b>feasible</b> point. One way to obtain such a point is to relax the feasibility conditions using a slack variable; with enough slack, any starting point is <b>feasible.</b> Then, minimize that slack variable until slack is null or negative.|$|E
25|$|In the set theoretic axiomatization of an antimatroid {{there are}} certain special sets called paths that {{determine}} the whole antimatroid, {{in the sense that}} the sets of the antimatroid are exactly the unions of paths. If S is any <b>feasible</b> set of the antimatroid, an element x that can be removed from S to form another <b>feasible</b> set is called an endpoint of S, and a <b>feasible</b> set that has only one endpoint is called a path of the antimatroid. The family of paths can be partially ordered by set inclusion, forming the path poset of the antimatroid.|$|E
25|$|Advanced {{numerical}} {{methods are}} essential in making {{numerical weather prediction}} <b>feasible.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} of a linear program is accomplished in two steps. In the first step, known as Phase I, a starting extreme point is found. Depending {{on the nature}} of the program this may be trivial, but in general it can be solved by applying the simplex algorithm to a modified version of the original program. The possible results of Phase I are either that a basic <b>feasible</b> solution is found or that the <b>feasible</b> region is empty. In the latter case the linear program is called infeasible. In the second step, Phase II, the simplex algorithm is applied using the basic <b>feasible</b> solution found in Phase I as a starting point. The possible results from Phase II are either an optimum basic <b>feasible</b> solution or an infinite edge on which the objective function is unbounded below.|$|E

25|$|The {{vertices}} of the polytope {{are also}} called basic <b>feasible</b> solutions. The {{reason for this}} choice of name is as follows. Let d denote the number of variables. Then the fundamental theorem of linear inequalities implies (for <b>feasible</b> problems) that for every vertex x* of the LP <b>feasible</b> region, there exists a set of d (or fewer) inequality constraints from the LP such that, when we treat those d constraints as equalities, the unique solution is x*. Thereby we can study these vertices by means of looking at certain subsets of the set of all constraints (a discrete set), rather than the continuum of LP solutions. This principle underlies the simplex algorithm for solving linear programs.|$|E

25|$|While a local minimum is {{at least}} as good as any nearby points, a global minimum {{is at least}} as good as every <b>feasible</b> point. In a convex problem, if there is a local minimum that is {{interior}} (not {{on the edge of the}} set of <b>feasible</b> points), it is also the global minimum, but a nonconvex problem may have more than one local minimum not all of which need be global minima.|$|E
25|$|A poset antimatroid {{has as its}} <b>feasible</b> {{sets the}} lower sets of a finite {{partially}} ordered set. By Birkhoff's representation theorem for distributive lattices, the <b>feasible</b> sets in a poset antimatroid (ordered by set inclusion) form a distributive lattice, and any distributive lattice can be formed in this way. Thus, antimatroids {{can be seen as}} generalizations of distributive lattices. A chain antimatroid is the special case of a poset antimatroid for a total order.|$|E
