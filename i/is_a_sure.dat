500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 1, 1910. An article in the The Moving Picture World gave a positive review, but recognized that the tensions amongst the Union and Confederate states of the Civil War could pose a concern for viewers and stated that no offense {{will come from the}} showing of this patriotic picture. The reviewer said that it would please American audiences and foreign ones as well. This possibility of an audience taking offense over the content of the picture was a reasonable one because the film was within living memory. The movement and influence of members in the Grand Army of the Republic was strong and memberships still exceeded 200,000 persons in 1910. A review by The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> enough 'classy' picture, full of human feeling and good acting. It is one of the kind that is giving the Thanhouser people the fine reputation they are gaining. ... The picture is strongly effective." [...] One advertisement billed the film as a patriotic masterpiece and would have musical accompaniment by the vaudeville musician Etta Hyland.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Waylett of The Advocate {{was more}} critical, saying [...] "Madonna {{delivers}} the worst performance {{in recent memory}} as the heroine of an attempt at screwball comedy. Watching her try to look like Marilyn Monroe and sound like Betty Boop, though, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> sign that this film was a disaster in the making. At the same time, it seems inconceivable that anyone would sit down and plan something so dreadful." [...] Carole Kass of the Richmond Times-Dispatch felt that since [...] "Madonna is the idol of teen-agers. If they imitate her hair and her makeup, these 'wanna-bes' {{who want to be}} like Madonna and dress like Madonna may be cute. But, as a popular personality, Madonna has a responsibility to her fans. And shoplifting is something not to promote. Nor is smoking." [...] Dan Dinicola of The Schenectady Gazette felt that [...] "Who's That Girl is not simply an awful film, it is positively unbearable. It's a movie without a head or a brain, a picture of such crass stupidity that it can't even make you angry. Instead it numbs you to death with its moronic platitudes, its pretensions to comedy. [...] It's a vanity project which is so amateurly produced and conceived that it makes you want to cringe in shame. [...] Madonna {{is no more than a}} novelty item." [...] Johanna Steinmetz of the Chicago Tribune complimented Dunne's acting and said: [...] "Fortunately the film has Griffin Dunne. Dunne, working in a domain once ruled by Cary Grant, manages to be stuffy, naive and vulnerable but never undignified as Loudon Trott, the New York lawyer." [...] Jean Rosenbluth of Rolling Stone was harsh about the film, saying [...] "The question posed by the film's title was Who's that girl? The answer provided by the box-office receipts was, alas, 'The same one who appeared in Shanghai Surprise and bored us to death'." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} favorable. Columnist Joan Crosby noted that [...] "This {{is the kind}} of show you don't think you'll laugh at, but you do, mostly because the cast is so good." [...] She noted that Cleavon Little, Joan Van Ark, and Reva Rose were, respectively, [...] "marvelous", [...] "pretty", and [...] "funny", and that Nancy Fox [...] "wins this year's cute-as-a-kitten award". Barbara Holsopple, TV and radio editor for the Pittsburgh Press, noted that [...] "ABC did a gutsy turnabout in taking the heavy drama out of a {{hospital}} and replacing it with comedy. The venture worked well, thanks to excellent performances from the Temperatures Rising cast". She [...] praised Albertson, noted that Whitmore [...] "was little seen", and that the series: [...] "{{is the kind of}} tidy little show that brings chuckles". Win Fanning, a syndicated columnist, stated that: [...] "the comedy writing and performances by a beautifully integrated cast give Temperatures a bright, light quality so seldom achieved in a situation comedy", and that it was: [...] "loaded with one-liners and sight gags, which, if kept on the level of the opener, promise many hours of hilarity". Fanning praised Little as [...] "one of the comedy finds of any TV season", and Fox as [...] "a fresh new face and talent giving promise of a long, successful career ahead". More praise for the series came after the broadcast of its fourth episode. An unidentified reviewer, writing for the Armored Sentinel (of Temple, Texas), stated [...] "If you're suffering from the case of the 'downs,' this series <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> pick up!" [...] The reviewer went on to note that [...] "the brightest spot of the series is wacky Nancy Fox. Her role applies the wackiness of Goldie Hawn, but in situation comedy form. I'd watch the show just for her! The whole series is wacky and funny; it's downright good. I highly recommend it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Honorific {{speech is}} used in several {{settings}} {{as a way of}} showing honor and respect to older ones, those who have been assigned titles, royalty, and in almost all religious settings. Depending on the second or third person, a given sentence may vary widely because honorific speech comprises a separate vocabulary, including all parts of speech and topics both lofty and mundane. Examples include: pohnkoiohlap (to eat with the nahnmwarki), likena (high chief's wife), pahnkupwur (chest; normally mwarmware), pahnpwoal (armpit; normally pahnpeh), dauso (anus, normally pwoar), kelipa (to joke, normally kamwan), kaluhlu (to vomit), and keipweni (an interjection). Although at times {{in the absence of a}} specific honorific word, the word [...] "Ketin" [...] is often used to indicate that the proceeding verb is honoric ("Koht kin ketin kapikada" [...] would translate to [...] "God creates"). The word [...] "Ketin" [...] has no meaning by itself. However, when used as a prefix, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> way to distinguish honorific speech ("Kiong" [...] has the meaning of [...] "Give", [...] "Ketkiong" [...] would be the honorific version of the same word) ...|$|E
