5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> is {{the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute <b>kidney</b> <b>failure.</b> If <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is poisoning {{caused by}} drinking ethylene glycol. Early symptoms include intoxication, vomiting and abdominal pain. Later symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness, headache, and seizures. Long term outcomes may include <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> and brain damage. Toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{paper is}} based on {{statistical}} analysis of rate of <b>kidney</b> renal <b>failure</b> {{taking into account that}} the variables of interest are sex and age group. The nature of the data used herein is secondary data, which was obtained from University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) medical record for consecutive ten (10) years (1998 - 2007), while monthly reported cases was collected and analyzed. Our present study has been carried out in order to determine whether the effect of renal failure depends on age and sex, and to look at the prevalence of <b>kidney</b> (renal) <b>failure,</b> over the period of study. Appropriate statistical techniques have been used to test the difference of means (t-test) and contingency table (x 2 -test), based on the analysis of results. The analysis has been done for significant at 5 % level of significance. The empirical results are obtained from the tests of two different means which reveal that there is {{a significant difference in the}} prevalent of renal failure between male and female. Resultantly, the impact of <b>kidney</b> renal <b>failure</b> has been focused both on two parameters of age and sex. Finally, some significant suggestions based on our empirical results and observations have also been proposed for preventing <b>kidney</b> renal <b>failure</b> and future scope of present study...|$|R

50|$|On April 16, 2007, Natural Balance {{informed}} the FDA {{that they had}} received complaints from consumers regarding a select amount of Venison & Brown Rice Dry Dog Food and Venison & Green Pea Dry Cat Food.

The source of melamine was believed to be from rice protein concentrate.|$|R

There may be tea-colored urine or an irregular heartbeat.

5|$|The {{second phase}} occurs between 24h and 72h {{following}} overdose {{and consists of}} signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. Acute <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases, acute <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, {{it has been suggested}} that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey {{conducted}} in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: {{the median age}} at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The {{main causes of death}} were similar in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed a higher proportion of deaths attributed to either <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> or a urethral obstruction.|$|E

5|$|Death caps {{have been}} {{reported}} to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes it particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substance in the blood. <b>Kidney</b> <b>failure</b> (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial bleeding, pancreatic inflammation, acute <b>kidney</b> <b>failure,</b> and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children are loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, <b>kidney</b> <b>failure,</b> irritability, lethargy, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Slow development of normal childhood behaviors, such as talking and use of words, and permanent intellectual disability are both commonly seen. Although less common, {{it is possible for}} fingernails to develop leukonychia striata if exposed to abnormally high lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or <b>kidney</b> <b>failure</b> may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E
