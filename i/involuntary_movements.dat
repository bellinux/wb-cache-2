We describe a 12 -year-old boy {{who suffered from}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>movement</b> after the first surgery but it improved dramatically after the second surgery. Initially, the patient underwent an encephalo-duro-arterio-myosynangiosis {{on the right side}} and encephalo-duro-periostealsynangiosis on the bifrontal side, which ameliorated his motor weakness in his left upper extremity. However, <b>involuntary</b> <b>movement</b> appeared in his right upper extremity. Secondly, the patient underwent encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-periostealsynangiosis on the left side. Thereafter, the patient’s <b>involuntary</b> <b>movement</b> completely resolved.

25|$|Patients with aceruloplasminemia {{develop a}} variety of {{movement}} problems. They may experience dystonia {{of the head and}} neck, resulting in repetitive movements and contortions. Other <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> may also occur, such as tremors, chorea, blepharospasms, and grimacing. Affected individuals may also experience ataxia, the lack of coordination of muscle movements. Some develop psychiatric problems and midlife dementia. The type of neurological disruption corresponds to associated regions of iron deposition in the brain and liver.|$|E
25|$|Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreathetosis (PKC) {{also called}} {{paroxysmal}} kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by attacks of <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements,</b> which are triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person's 20s to 30s. <b>Involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> {{can take many}} forms such as ballism, chorea or dystonia and usually only affect {{one side of the}} body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of paroxysmal dyskinesias and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen. Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central nervous system trauma, or peripheral nervous system trauma. PKD has also been linked with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome, in which patients have afebrile seizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life. This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.|$|E

Although this <b>involuntary</b> <b>movement</b> is most often described with intramedullary lesions of the brain stem, it may also appear with lesions external to the neuraxis. We review the literature and propose a more widespread distribution of potential lesions along the facial nerve pathway, which may produce facial myokymia. © 1977, American Medical Association.

25|$|<b>Involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> {{may make}} feeding {{difficult}} or messy and may excessively prolong mealtimes. It {{may be easier}} to finger feed than use utensils (e.g., spoon or fork). For liquids, it is often easier to drink from a closed container with a straw than from an open cup. Caregivers may need to provide foods or liquids so that self-feeding is possible, or they may need to feed the person with A-T. In general, meals should be completed within approximately 30 minutes. Longer meals may be stressful, interfere with other daily activities, and limit the intake of necessary liquids and nutrients.|$|E
25|$|A tremor is an involuntary, {{somewhat}} rhythmic, muscle contraction {{and relaxation}} involving to-and-fro movements {{of one or}} more body parts. It is the most common of all <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder. Many different forms of tremor have been identified, such as essential tremor or Parkinsonian tremor. It is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems, but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances.|$|E
25|$|In third grade, Warhol had Sydenham's chorea (also {{known as}} St. Vitus' Dance), {{the nervous system}} disease that causes <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> of the extremities, which is {{believed}} to be a complication of scarlet fever which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness. He became a hypochondriac, developing a fear of hospitals and doctors. Often bedridden as a child, he became an outcast at school and bonded with his mother. At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.|$|E
40|$|Facial synkinesis is an {{abnormal}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>movement</b> of {{one set of}} facial muscles accom-panying a voluntary movement of a different facial muscle.

50|$|Motor {{disorders}} are malfunctions {{of the nervous}} system that cause <b>involuntary</b> or uncontrollable <b>movements</b> or actions of the body (Stone). These disorders can cause lack of intended movement or an excess of <b>involuntary</b> <b>movement</b> (Mandal). Symptoms of motor disorders include tremors, jerks, twitches, spasms, contractions, or gait problems.|$|R
25|$|For example, {{people with}} Tourette {{syndrome}} and related tic disorders make <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> and utterances (called tics) {{despite the fact}} that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or unvoluntary, because they are not strictly involuntary: they may be experienced as a voluntary response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed. People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.|$|E
25|$|Chorea is a continuous, random-appearing {{sequence}} {{of one or}} more discrete <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> or movement fragments. Although chorea consists of discrete movements, many are often strung together in time, thus making it difficult to identify each movement's start and end point. These movements can involve the face, trunk, neck, tongue, and extremities. Unlike dystonic movements, chorea-associated movements are often more rapid, random and unpredictable. Movements are repeated, but not rhythmic in nature. Children with chorea appear fidgety and will often try to disguise the random movements by voluntarily turning the involuntary, abnormal movement into a seemingly more normal, purposeful motion. Chorea may result specifically from disorders of the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. It has also been associated with encephalitis, hyperthyroidism, anticholinergic toxicity, and other genetic and metabolic disorders. Chorea is also the prominent movement featured in Huntington's disease.|$|E
25|$|Athetosis {{can vary}} from mild to severe motor dysfunction; it is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> of muscle and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture. The associated motor dysfunction can be restricted to a part of body or present throughout the body, depending on {{the individual and the}} severity of the symptom. One of the pronounced signs can be observed in the extremities in particular, as the writhing, convoluted movement of the digits. Athetosis can appear as early as 18 months from birth with first signs including difficulty feeding, hypotonia, spasm, and involuntary writhing movements of the hands, feet, and face, which progressively worsen through adolescence and at times of emotional distress. Athetosis is caused by lesions in several brain areas such as the hippocampus and the motor thalamus, as well as the corpus striatum; therefore children during the developmental age could possibly suffer from cognitive deficits such as speech impairment, hearing loss, and failed or delayed acquirement of sitting balance.|$|E

25|$|The first {{indications}} of A-T usually occur during the toddler years. Children start walking at a normal age, {{but may not}} improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A-T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison to when they are walking slowly or standing in one place. Around {{the beginning of their}} second decade, children with typical forms of A-T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine-motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with slurring of speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and feet that look like fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (athetosis), adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).|$|E
25|$|OA1 is {{recognized}} by many different symptoms. Reduced visual acuity {{is accompanied by}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> of the eye termed as nystagmus. Astigmatism is a condition wherein there occurs significant refractive error. Moreover, ocular albino eyes become crossed, a condition called as ‘lazy eyes’ or strabismus. Since very little pigment is present the iris becomes translucent and reflects light back. It appears green to blueish red. However, {{the most important part}} of the eye, the fovea which is responsible for acute vision, does not develop properly, probably indicating the role of melanin in the development stages of the eye. Some affected individuals may also develop photophobia/photodysphoria. All these symptoms are due to lack of pigmentation of the retina. Moreover, in an ocular albino eye, nerves from back of the eye to the brain may not follow the usual pattern of routing. In an ocular albino eye, more nerves cross from back of the eye to the opposite side of the brain instead of going to the both sides of the brain as in a normal eye. An ocular albino eye appears blueish pink in color with no pigmentation at all unlike a normal eye. Carrier women have regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation due to X-inactivation and partial iris transillumination and do not show any other symptoms exhibited by those affected by OA1.|$|E
500|$|Currently, no {{treatment}} slows the neurodegeneration {{in any of}} the neuroacanthocytosis disorders. Medication may be administered to decrease the <b>involuntary</b> <b>movements</b> produced by these syndromes. Antipsychotics are used to block dopamine, anticonvulsants treat seizures and botulinum toxin injections may control dystonia. Patients usually receive speech, occupational and physical therapies to help with the complications associated with movement. [...] Sometimes, physicians will prescribe antidepressants for the psychological problems that accompany neuroacanthocytosis. Some success has been reported with Deep brain stimulation.|$|E
