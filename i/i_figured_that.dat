500|$|Despite Kemp's {{return from}} injury {{and the arrival}} of running back O. J. Simpson, the Bills only {{compiled}} a 4–10 record during the 1969 season under new coach John Rauch. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league's 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it. In 1969, the Erie County Republican Party approached him about running for the United States Congress. After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics. Kemp said, [...] "I had a four-year no-cut contract with the Bills at the time. ...<b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> if I lost I could always come back and play. But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Brown {{sold his}} {{interest}} in KFC to Heublein for $284 million (. Using some of the profits from the KFC sale, Brown and some associates bought the Miami-based Lum's chain of restaurants from its founders, Stuart and Clifford S Perlman, for $4 million. Of the 340-outlet beer-and-hot-dog chain, Brown said [...] "they did not have very good food. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> upgrading {{it would be my}} first task." [...] Accordingly, he hired a group of young executives to find [...] "the perfect hamburger". A month later, he hired Ollie Gleichenhaus, owner of a hamburger restaurant in Miami Beach, Florida, to train Lum's staff to create his hamburgers. He later started a chain of drive-through restaurants called Ollie's Trolley, named for Gleichenhaus, but the franchise failed. Lions Club International at Tampa, Florida, honored Brown with its Service to America Award in 1974. Brown sold the Lum's chain for $9.5 million to Friedrich Jahn's Wienerwald holding group in 1978. A few years later, Brown launched John Y's Chicken, a venture which also subsequently failed.|$|E
500|$|While Amusement Vision was {{responsible}} for most of the game's development, Nintendo EAD employees Shigeru Miyamoto and Takaya Imamura took on the role of producer and supervisor, respectively. Sega handled planning and execution and Nintendo {{was responsible}} for supervision of their product. Nagoshi was initially concerned about differences in opinion between the two companies, and mentioned [...] "If Nintendo planned to hold our hands through development, I would have suggested they develop the game themselves. That way we could focus on a project which would reflect our studio's abilities. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> would cause a war, but I was told most of the responsibility would be left to us." [...] Miyamoto thought the collaboration resulted in a [...] "true evolution of the F-Zero series", enhancing the simulation of racing at high speeds and expanding the [...] "F-Zero world on a grand scale." [...] Published by Nintendo, F-Zero GX was released in Japan on July 25, 2003, in North America on August 25, 2003, and in PAL regions on October 31, 2003.

500|$|In 1993, Pascu {{experienced}} {{his first}} significant success in music with the album Mixed Grill {{and the single}} [...] "Ţara arde şi babele se piaptănă" [...] ("The Country Is Burning and Old Women Are Combing Their Hair", referencing a Romanian proverb). A poll conducted by the journal Evenimentul Zilei nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nationwide station Radio Contact awarded Pascu its [...] "Composer of the Year" [...] title. Mixed Grill marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae. [...] Hits such as [...] "Gizzi" [...] and [...] "Mi-am luat colac" [...] ("I Got Me a Lifebuoy") led some to consider {{him one of the}} pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like El Negro and Pacha Man. The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: [...] "When I was writing records, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>that,</b> should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, and they would not grow bored. But it's not because of that, I think that's how inspiration visits me, that this is how I write. I won't stick to any one musical genre." [...] In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the harmonica.|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

[...] "Around the time that I recorded the first FF tape, I was reading a lot of books on UFO's. Not only is it a fascinating subject, but there's a treasure trove of band names in those UFO books!" [...] he said. [...] "So, since I had recorded the first record by myself, playing all the instruments, but I wanted people to think that it was a group, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> FOO FIGHTERS might lead people to believe that it was more than just one guy. Silly, huh?" [...] Continuing, Dave Grohl insisted that a more appropriate name could have been chosen.

As Ol' Dirty Bastard took the stage to a round of applause, he asked the audience, [...] "Please calm down, the music and everything. It's nice that I went and bought me an outfit today that costed {{a lot of money}} today, you know what I mean? 'Cause <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> Wu-Tang was gonna win.

2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything.
