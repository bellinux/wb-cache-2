After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington publicly apologized at length for using the epithet in reference to Knight.

He also accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on the series. Following his firing, Washington began asserting that racism within the broadcasting media was a primary factor in his dismissal from the series, which drew a critical perspective from Rhimes.

You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown.

Also, another factor in the show's eventual cancellation were complaints concerning its alleged excessive violence.Seven years later, Connors would go on to star in the successful, long-running CBS crime series, Mannix.|$|R
