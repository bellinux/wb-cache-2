5|$|Like {{with many}} large {{cities in the}} United States, Denver’s CBD and the {{adjacent}} neighborhoods were blighted {{with the presence of}} many open parking lots in the 1970s and 80’s. Recent focus to redevelop these open lots and increase density/activity in the city’s core have been hugely successful as many of these lots are today being turned into large residential, retail and commercial developments. This is especially true around the newly redeveloped and highly popular Union Station area in Denver’s LoDo (Lower Downtown) neighborhood. What used to be open land, parking lots, warehouses and rail yards as recently as {{the turn of the century}} is now several city blocks of new residential and commercial buildings as well as a new RTD underground bus terminal, rail platforms/pavilions and a park. There are also improved pedestrian friendly connections to the RiNo (River North), Five Points, Auraria and Highland neighborhoods from the new development. Historic Union Station itself has been fully renovated and turned back into a travel and activity hub. It now includes the Denver Amtrak station, a new boutique hotel and several restaurants, bars & shops all centered on the large Great Hall inside and a public plaza outside along Wynkoop Street. Starting in April 2016 the University of Colorado A-Line commuter train began service directly connecting Union Station and downtown Denver to <b>Denver</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> and the airport's new 500+ room Westin Hotel & conference center.|$|E
