5|$|If {{you please}} Sir I am a widow; & <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> very wrong {{that there is}} not any Mrs. Fisher, but I would not marry Mr. Jeremy not for worlds, the way he does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & not a bit of good {{starching}} his cravats.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> has {{in terms}} {{of some of the}} stuff they did in the Middle East {{supporting}} the pro-democracy demonstrators. But a lot of bad things too, unnecessarily harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{was really}} special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together {{of a very}} specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Very; exquisite, really; the {{blending}} of the tones is so perfect. I wish I {{knew what to}} think about these things. I can't {{make up my mind}} about them.

5000|$|... “This {{just really}} infuriates me because {{apparently}} I {{was one of}} the extreme few that actually cherished my scholarship and went to get the education that everybody else had to pay for. I scream {{at the top of my}} lungs every day when some of these guys are screaming for more money, more money, more money. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> absolutely ridiculous, but once again, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of the way our country has gone. We want more, but we want to do less. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> terrible." ...|$|R
5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video; it's meant to be a profuse number of the question.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5000|$|It's taking Korn {{into another}} {{dimension}} for the listener, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that {{takes you to}} another world. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> really emotional, as far as it's not so anger-based. You know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a more well-rounded emotional journey it kinda takes you on, the listener. James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer on See You on the Other Side.|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> fun. Because you {{can focus}} on one project for each class. Like one whole project for each class. <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> you have to say, “Oh, great. I {{finished}} this project but now I’ve got to finish another.” So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> easier to do one project for just multiple classes.|$|R
5000|$|The song's verse sounds {{similar to}} Tears For Fears' 1982 single [...] "Mad World". Yusuf/Cat made a {{reference}} to this at a concert on his 2016 tour while playing 'Matthew and Son', inserting the lyrics 'I <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of funny, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of strange, yes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of funny, that this sounds the same!‘.|$|R
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is {{at the base of}} Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, and headed back to the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will astonish our enemies...|$|E

25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a lovely thought and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the region is necessarily slow, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is also certain. There is every reason for expecting a steady and progressive increase in earnings for an indefinite period in the future. I am not in entire accord with the general manager's statement that the business secured from this branch may be replaced from points on our own lines. Contrary to the belief, the supplies of cedar in western Washington are comparatively limited, and the greatest reserves of this timber are {{along the line of}} the Lake Shore. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> but {{a matter of a few}} years when the cedar will be exhausted on our other lines.|$|E

25|$|I think Neal {{did a lot}} of {{marvelous}} {{things for}} us, because even though what he did was a different thing and not quite the style but sort of a different sound, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was quite musical.|$|E

25|$|What {{it really}} {{highlights}} though is that nothing has really changed in our strategy, {{and that is}} that we need to re-equip, we need to grow our capacity, we need to have new products, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> just brings these objectives into focus more and more by having a high profile about what's happened.|$|E
