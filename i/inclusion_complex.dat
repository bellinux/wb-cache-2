40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to study the effect of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the in vitro dissolution of aceclofenac (AF) from molecular <b>inclusion</b> <b>complexes.</b> Aceclofenac molecular <b>inclusion</b> <b>complexes</b> in 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 M ratio were prepared using a kneading method.

Molecular <b>inclusion</b> <b>complexes</b> of AF with β-CD showed a considerable increase in the dissolution rate {{in comparison with the}} physical mixture and pure drug in 0. 1 N HCl, pH 1. 2, and phosphate buffer, pH 7. 4. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>complexes</b> with a 1 : 2 M ratio showed the maximum dissolution rate in comparison to other ratios.

Molecular modeling results indicated the relative energetic stability of the β-CD dimer-AF complex as compared to β-CD monomer-AF. Dissolution enhancement was attributed to the formation of water soluble <b>inclusion</b> <b>complexes</b> with β-CD.
