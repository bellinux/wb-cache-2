5|$|The {{ancestor}} of the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> {{is believed to}} be the extinct Arno river dog that lived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9million years ago. It is described as being a small, jackal-like canine. Genetic studies indicate that the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> expanded from India at the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The oldest <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> fossil is 20,000 years old and was found at the Ksar Akil rock shelter near Beirut, Lebanon. The oldest <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> fossils in Europe were found in Greece and are 7,000 years old. There are seven subspecies of the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal.</b> The <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> is not closely related to the African black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead more closely related to the gray wolf, coyote, African golden wolf, and Ethiopian wolf. It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both the gray wolf and the African golden wolf. Dog-jackal hybrids called Sulimov dogs are in service at the Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow where they are deployed by the Russian airline Aeroflot for scent-detection.|$|E

5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African golden wolf), {{reducing the number of}} <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African golden wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> and the African golden wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Outside of India, <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> in the Caucasus and Turkey {{indicate}} the next highest genetic diversity, while those in Europe indicate low genetic diversity, which confirms their more recent expansion into Europe. Genetic data {{indicates that the}} <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> of the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia may represent two ancient populations that have survived into modern times. <b>Golden</b> <b>jackals</b> in the Balkans originated from those expanding from southeast Europe and from the Caucasus. <b>Golden</b> <b>jackals</b> from both the Balkans and the Caucasus are expanding into the Baltic. In the Middle East, <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> from Israel have a higher genetic diversity than European jackals. This {{is thought to be}} due to Israeli jackals having hybridized with dogs, gray wolves, and African golden wolves, creating a hybrid zone in Israel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>jackals</b> {{are present}} in almost all Indian zoos, with 67 males, 72 females, and 54 unsexed {{individuals}} as of March 2000. Outside India, <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> are rarely kept in Western zoos, where the more colourful black-backed jackal is mostly exhibited.|$|R
50|$|In Israel, <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> {{have been}} shown to be {{significant}} predators of snakes, including venomous snakes; an increase of snakebites occurred during a period of a poisoning campaign against <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> while a decrease in snakebites occurred when the poisoning ceased.|$|R
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by golden jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes golden jackals from all of the other regions. Indian golden jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, which indicates that India was the center from which golden jackals spread. The extant <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia provided a refuge when compared with the surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum {{and the beginning of the}} warming cycles, the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.|$|E
5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> is not native wildlife but an invading species. The <b>Golden</b> <b>Jackal</b> informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in golden jackals.|$|E
5|$|The Morea {{expedition}} {{confirmed that}} the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> existed in Greece. Although earlier travel narratives had mentioned its presence, these were not considered trustworthy. Moreover, the subspecies seen and described by the French (named Canis aureus moreotica) was endemic to the region. Bory de Saint-Vincent brought back pelts and a skull.|$|E

5|$|The wolf-like canids, (genus Canis, Cuon and Lycaon) {{including}} the dog (Canis lupus familiaris), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red wolf (Canis rufus), eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), coyote (Canis latrans), <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> (Canis aureus), Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus).|$|E
5|$|In India, the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> {{occurs in}} all of India's {{protected}} areas apart {{from those in the}} higher areas of the Himalayas. It is included in CITES AppendixIII, and is listed in the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, under ScheduleIII, thus receiving legal protection at the lowest level to help control the trade of pelts and tails in India.|$|E
5|$|The Carmel Mountain {{has three}} main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si’ach. For {{the most part}} these valleys are undeveloped natural {{corridors}} that run up through the city from the coast {{to the top of}} the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, <b>golden</b> <b>jackal,</b> hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons.|$|E
5|$|Foxes can {{be found}} only at the fringes of jackal territory. Red foxes and <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> share similar diets, with the jackal being three times bigger than the red fox. The red fox will avoid close {{proximity}} with jackals, and fox populations decrease where jackals are abundant. Striped hyenas prey on <b>golden</b> <b>jackals,</b> and three jackal carcasses were found in one hyena den.|$|R
50|$|Although {{hybridization}} between {{wolves and}} <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> {{has never been}} observed, evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria. Although there is no genetic evidence of gray wolf-jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> have displayed remarkably gray wolf-like phenotypes, {{to the point of}} being mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.|$|R

5|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> {{may have}} once been tamed in Neolithic Turkey 11,000 years ago, {{as there is}} a {{sculpture}} of a man cradling a jackal found in Göbekli Tepe. French explorers during the 19thcentury noted that people in the Levant kept golden jackals in their homes. The Kalmyk people near the Caspian Sea were known to frequently cross their dogs with jackals, and Balkan shepherds once crossed their sheepdogs with jackals.|$|E
5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E
5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The <b>golden</b> <b>jackal,</b> particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E
50|$|Similar matings between <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> and {{grey wolves}} {{have never been}} observed, though {{evidence}} of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria. Although there is no genetic evidence of grey wolf-jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> have displayed remarkably grey wolf-like phenotypes, {{to the point of}} being mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.|$|R

5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and <b>golden</b> <b>jackal),</b> the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
5|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E

2500|$|In Hungary, {{where they}} are {{sometimes}} called [...] "reed wolves", <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> had disappeared in the 1950s through hunting and habitat destruction, only to return in the late 1970s, with the first breeding pairs being detected near the southern border in Transdanubia, then between the River Danube and Tisza. <b>Golden</b> <b>jackals</b> have increased greatly in number year by year, with some estimates indicating that they now outnumber red foxes. The sighting of a jackal near the Austrian border {{in the summer of}} 2007 indicated that they have spread throughout the country.|$|R
50|$|In Russia, <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> {{are one of}} {{the founder}} breeds of the Sulimov dog, a working dog owned {{exclusively}} by Aeroflot and used for bomb detection in airport security.|$|R
5|$|In Dalmatia, {{the golden}} jackal's diet {{consists}} of mammals, fruits, vegetables, insects, birds and their eggs, grasses and leaves. Jackals change their diet to {{more readily available}} foods. In Serbia, their diet is primarily livestock carcasses that are increasingly prevalent {{due to a lack}} of removal, and this may have led to the expansion of their population. In Hungary, 55% of their diet is composed of common voles and bank voles, and 41% is composed of wild boar carcasses. Information on the diet of the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> in northeastern Italy is scant, but it is known to prey on small roe deer and hares. In Israel, golden jackals are significant predators of snakes; during a poisoning campaign against golden jackals there was an increase in human snakebite reports, but a decrease when the poisoning ceased.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{animals that}} are found in Karnataka include the elephant, the tiger, the leopard, the gaur, the sambar deer, the chital or spotted deer, the muntjac, the bonnet macaque, the slender loris, the common palm civet, the small Indian civet, the sloth bear, the dhole, the striped hyena and the <b>golden</b> <b>jackal.</b> Some of the birds found here are the great hornbill, the Malabar pied hornbill, the Ceylon frogmouth, herons, ducks, kites, eagles, falcons, quails, partridges, lapwings, sandpipers, pigeons, doves, parakeets, cuckoos, owls, nightjars, swifts, kingfishers, bee-eaters and munias.

5|$|Dog pups show {{unrestrained}} {{fighting with}} their siblings from 2 weeks of age, with injury avoided only {{due to their}} undeveloped jaw muscles. This fighting gives way to play-chasing {{with the development of}} running skills at 4–5 weeks. Wolf pups possess more-developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age, when they first show signs of play-fighting with their siblings; serious fighting occurs during 4–6 weeks of age. Compared to wolf and dog pups, <b>golden</b> <b>jackal</b> pups develop aggression at the age of 4–6 weeks, when play-fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm. This aggression ceases by 10–12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed. Once the lactation period concludes, the female drives off the pups. Pups born late remain with their mother until early autumn, at which time they leave either singly or in groups of two to four individuals. Females reach sexual maturity after 10–11 months and males at 21–22 months.|$|E
50|$|Various {{species of}} animals and birds can be encountered. Porcupines, <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> and wild boars are {{familiar}} sights. Foxes and striped hyenas are present although very rare to see.|$|R

50|$|That <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> {{are capable}} of hybridising with {{domestic}} dogs has long been attested by naturalists. The Kalmyks in particular were known to frequently cross their dogs with jackals, and Balkan shepherds used to cross their sheepdogs with jackals. During 1975, scientists at Russia's DS Likhachev Scientific Research Institute for Cultural Heritage and Environmental Protection began a breeding project in which they crossed <b>golden</b> <b>jackals</b> with huskies, to create an improved breed with the jackal's power of scent and the husky's resistance to cold. During recent years, Aeroflot has used one-quarter jackal hybrids, known as Sulimov dogs, to sniff out explosives otherwise undetectable by machinery.|$|R
