40|$|Abstract. B 3 LYP /aug-cc-pvdz {{level of}} theory, {{combined}} with NBO and G 3 methods, {{is applied to}} study substituent effects on the geometries, bond dissociation energies and high energetic density material properties of 27 kinds of derivatives designed by substituted hydrogen atoms of pentazine, 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine and s-triazine, of which the hydrogen atoms are substituted by –CN,-NO 2,-NH 2,-N 3,-N 2 H,-NHNH 2,-N 4 H and-N 4 H 3 groups. The relatively small <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> are observed for the derivatives substituted by-NH 2,-H,-NO 2 and-NHNH 2. The order <b>of</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> for the derivatives containing the same substituent is: pentazine> 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine>s-triazine. For the derivatives substituted by-CN,-N 2 H and-N 4 H 3, <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> are 860 ~ 1124 kJ/mol，in which <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine derivatives are larger. For derivatives substituted by-N 3 and-N 4 H, their <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> are 974 ∼ 1735 kJ/mol, which are the highest in all derivatives. The order <b>of</b> <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> is: s-triazine derivative> 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine derivative> pentazine derivative. The normalized <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> these pentazine derivatives substituted by –CN,-N 3,- N 2 H and –N 4 H and 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazine derivatives substituted by –CN,-N 3 and –N 4 H are 93 ∼ 109 kJ, which is {{higher than that of}} triazido-s-triazine and diazido-s-tetrazine derived from Hiskey. Our observations indicate that the higher <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> substituent molecules have, the higher ones the substitutive derivatives. By means of the data of dissociation energy, it can be found that the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> derivatives substituted by –N 3,-N 2 H and –CN are greater, and they are also more stable.

40|$|A {{calculation}} method for <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> (HOF, {{referred to as}} ∆Hf) based on the density func-tional theory (DFT) is presented in this work. Similar to Gaussian- 3 theory, the atomic scheme is applied to calculate the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the molecules. In this method, we have modified the formula for calculation of Gaussian- 3 theory in several ways, including the correction for diffuse functions and the correction for higher polarization functions. These corrections {{are found to be}} significant. The average absolute deviation from experiment for the 164 calculated <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> for-mation is about 1. 9 kcal·mol− 1, while average absolute deviation from G 3 MP 2 for the 149 (among the 164 molecules, 15 large-sized molecules can not be calculated at the G 3 MP 2 level) calculated <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> is only about 1. 9 kcal·mol− 1.

25|$|Crystalline bulk silicon {{is rather}} inert, but becomes more {{reactive}} at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) {{that protects the}} metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900nbsp&°C, but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950nbsp&°C and 1160nbsp&°C and when 1400nbsp&°C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si3N4. Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600nbsp&°C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000nbsp&°C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300nbsp&°C, and bromine and iodine at about 500nbsp&°C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction can be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive in the liquid state, alloying with most metals to form silicides, and reducing most metal oxides because the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>formation</b> of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.|$|E
