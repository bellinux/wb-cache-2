5|$|Around 0300UTC on October4, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Punta Abreojos and San Carlos on the Pacific coast of Baja California and <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Santa Rosalía to Loreto on the Gulf coast of the Peninsula. Roughly twelve hours later, the warning was superseded by another tropical storm warning. The new warning was issued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Punta Abreojos and El Rosario on the Pacific coast and <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Santa Rosalia and Punta Final on the Gulf coast. In mainland Mexico, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for coastal areas of Sonora between Cabo Lobos and Puerto Penasco. By 1830UTC, all of the watches and warnings were revised; on the Pacific coast of Baja California, the warning was in effect <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Punta Abreojos and San Juanico; on the Gulf coast, the warning was in effect <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Santa Rosalia and Punta Conception; the watch for coastal areas of Sonora was upgraded to a tropical storm warning <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Guaymas and Cabo Lobos. Following Raymond's landfall in mainland Mexico, all warnings were discontinued by 1200UTC on October5.|$|E

5|$|As Earl tracked {{towards the}} northeastern Gulf of Mexico on September1, a {{hurricane}} warning was issued for coastal areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Cameron, Louisiana. Additionally, hurricane watches extended out to Destin, Florida and High Island, Texas from {{the edges of}} the warning respectively. Early the next day, a tropical storm warning was issued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Destin, Florida. In response to the eastward movement of the hurricane, the hurricane watch and warning was discontinued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> west of Morgan City, Louisiana. Additionally, the hurricane warning was extended eastward to Destin, Florida, a tropical storm warning was issued east of Destin to Apalachicola, Florida, and a tropical storm watch was declared <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Morgan City and Cameron, Louisiana. Several hours later, the hurricane warning was again extended eastward to the mouth of the Suwannee River. All watches and warnings were discontinued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> west of Pascagoula, Mississippi and due to the asymmetrical structure of Hurricane Earl, a tropical storm warning was issued as far south as the Florida Keys. Continuing uncertainty in the track of Earl prompted the issuance of a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Grand Isle, Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. After Earl made landfall in Florida, all watches and warnings were discontinued in relation to the storm.|$|E

5|$|Before Hurricane Patricia arrived, the Government of Mexico issued {{multiple}} {{watches and}} warnings for coastal communities. A hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00UTC on October21, encompassing areas of Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco. A tropical storm watch also covered portions of Guerrero. As Patricia intensified, the government issued a hurricane warning <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, and Punta San Telmo, Michoacán; {{a tropical storm}} warning supplemented this <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> farther north and east. The hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of San Blas, Nayarit, on October23.

A preliminary alert was issued for naval and marine {{areas in the}} Carolinas from Norfolk, Virginia. Special forecasts from the Weather Bureau office in Columbia, South Carolina were activated on the radio at 16:50 UTC on July 8. Several thousand people evacuated in areas of South Carolina, including Folly Beach, Sullivan's Island, Isle of Palms, and Pawleys Island. The issuance of an emergency flood forecast for Columbia, South Carolina occurred {{as a result of}} Cindy.|$|E
5|$|On November7, Tropical Depression Ida re-entered the Caribbean Sea and restrengthened into a {{tropical}} storm, prompting the NHC to issue {{a tropical}} storm watch <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between San Felipe, Yucatán and Punta Allen in Mexico {{as well as in}} Pinar del Río Province, Cuba. Several hours later, the watches were upgraded to warnings and a new tropical storm warning was declared for Grand Cayman. A tropical storm watch was also issued for Isla de la Juventud and a hurricane watch <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Tulum and Cabo Catoche, Mexico. Early on November8, the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch for Mexico were modified to include areas from Punta Allen to Playa del Carmen and Tulum to Playa del Carmen respectively. A hurricane warning was also declared <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Playa del Carmen and Cabo Catoche. Later that day, the tropical storm warning for Grand Cayman was discontinued as Ida moved away from the island. Early on November9, all watches and warnings for Cuba and Mexico were discontinued as Ida moved into the Gulf of Mexico and towards the United States.|$|E
30|$|The {{calculated}} {{electrical conductivity}} profiles for any h are almost identical between the four different representative ages, because the thermal structure is almost identical {{in the range}} of ages compared here. However, the results for different values of h showed significantly different conductivity profiles. The inversion profile <b>for</b> <b>Area</b> A falls between the simulated profiles for h of 80 and 100  km. <b>For</b> <b>Area</b> B, the inversion profile is in between the profiles for h of 100 and 125  km. <b>For</b> <b>Area</b> D, it mostly corresponds to the simulated profiles for h of 200 and 300  km, which are almost the same. The resistive layer <b>for</b> <b>Area</b> C is much thicker than the simulated profile for h of 300  km, which suggests that it is more consistent with a cooling half space rather than a cooling plate, as discussed in previous studies (Baba et al. 2010, 2013 a). This result suggests that the transition from the resistive to high-conductivity zones is mainly controlled by h. It is impossible to represent the 1 -D profiles <b>for</b> all <b>areas</b> by a thermal model with a single value of h. In other words, {{it is likely that the}} thickness of the cool thermal lithosphere differs between these areas. If the appropriate values of h are chosen, the simulated profiles with the same value of potential temperature fit the high-conductivity zone well <b>for</b> all <b>areas,</b> although the inversion profile <b>for</b> <b>Area</b> B is slightly higher than the simulated profile at depths between 150 and 200  km. This observation suggests that the asthenospheric mantle in this region is rather homogeneous in potential temperature and chemical composition, except <b>for</b> <b>Area</b> B.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after being}} {{designated}} as Tropical Storm Ida on November4, {{the government of}} Nicaragua issued a tropical storm warning for the entire coastline of Nicaragua, {{and the government of}} Columbia also issued a warning for the nearby islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Later that day, a hurricane watch was declared <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Bluefields and the Nicaragua–Honduras border. As Ida moved closer to land, the tropical storm warning for San Andrés and Providencia was discontinued. Several hours later, the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were modified to cover areas south of the Nicaragua–Honduras border to Puerto Cabezas and a hurricane warning was issued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> south of Puerto Cabezas to Bluefields. After Ida made landfall in Nicaragua, all hurricane advisories were discontinued and replaced by a tropical storm warning. Shortly thereafter, a tropical storm watch was declared <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> along the Honduran coastline between Limón and the Nicaragua–Honduras border. However, all watches and warnings were discontinued once Ida weakened to a tropical depression on November6.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Acapulco to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco at 2100UTC September 21, but was discontinued 18 hours later.

Twelve hours later, a {{tropical storm}} warning was issued for the remaining portion of Baja California Sur. The same day, a hurricane warning was issued for a large area of the mainland. However, all watches and warnings were discontinued on September 13 as the system had moved inland over Mexico.|$|E
5|$|After Isaac {{crossed the}} Florida Keys on August26, the {{hurricane}} warning was downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning, and the tropical storm watch from Sebastian Inlet to Flagler Beach was discontinued. Simultaneously, the hurricane watch on the Gulf Coast of the United States was upgraded to a hurricane warning along the portion from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Destin, Florida. Additionally, the tropical storm warning was discontinued {{from the mouth of}} the Suwannee River to Tarpon Springs. Early on August27, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Florida was discontinued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> lying north of the Jupiter Inlet. Six hours later, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Florida was lifted from the Jupiter Inlet southward to Ocean Reef, including Lake Okeechobee. At 1500UTC, all of the remaining watches and warnings for South Florida were cancelled. On August28, the tropical storm warning in the Florida Panhandle was discontinued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> east of Destin.

5|$|After Narelle {{moved into}} TCWC Perth's area of {{responsibility}} on 9 January, a cyclone watch was issued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Whim Creek and Coral Bay. A blue alert, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) lowest level of readiness, was also issued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Mardie and Whim Creek. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a cyclone warning for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west, encompassing areas as far as Cape Cuvier. The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon. As the storm continued on a more westward path than initially anticipated, the warning area was gradually decreased, with areas east of Roebourne receiving the all clear later on 11 January. The watch area, however, continued to expand and encompassed areas as far east as Denham. As the storm made its closet approach to Western Australia on 13 January, the watches and warnings area were gradually discontinued, with all advisories being discontinued that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm at the time, the CPHC anticipated Neki {{to become a}} hurricane as it tracked northwestward. As such, they issued a hurricane watch for Johnston Island {{on the afternoon of}} October19. The following day, the hurricane watch was replaced by a tropical storm watch as Neki was no longer forecast to pass close enough to the island to produce hurricane-force winds. Later that day, a hurricane watch was issued for the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between the French Frigate Shoals and Lisianski Island. The following morning, a supplementary hurricane warning was issued for the monument <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa. Additionally, the tropical storm watch for Johnston Island was discontinued. Early on October22, the hurricane watch for Lisianski Island to Marco Reef was replaced by a tropical storm watch. Several hours later, the CPHC discontinued this watch. Early on October23, as Neki weakened to a tropical storm, the hurricane warning <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa was replaced by a tropical storm warning. The tropical storm warning remained in effect for more than a day before being canceled during the afternoon of October24.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Ida {{moved over}} the Yucatán Channel on November8, the NHC issued a {{hurricane}} watch <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Mexico Beach, Florida.

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the weather forecast office in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the weather forecast office <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed <b>for</b> <b>areas</b> east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, {{and other forms of}} communication. During the time that the hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface weather analysis maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while floating dock property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton stock markets reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, with stock prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E
