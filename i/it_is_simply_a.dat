5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also {{does not have the}} field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E

25|$|Most often, a {{character}} {{will be used}} for both sound and meaning, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> matter of choosing the correct reading based on which word it represents. In other cases, {{a character}} is used only for sound (ateji). In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of ateji, narrowly jukujikun). Therefore, only the full compound—not the individual character—has a reading. There are also special cases where the reading is completely different, often based on an historical or traditional reading.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} {{distinctive}} points in Cousin's philosophy. These are his method, {{the results of}} his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology, Ontology and Eclecticism in history.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E
25|$|Check hook : A check hook is {{employed}} to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part {{consists of a}} regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking {{it has been said}} that there is no such thing as a check hook and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. Floyd Mayweather, Jr. employed the use of a check hook against Ricky Hatton, which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down.|$|E

500|$|Outside the state, Willson enjoyed {{somewhat}} higher esteem. In 1908, Harvard University {{presented him with}} an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

The meeting sparked interest in an annual gubernatorial meeting, and in 1910, Willson organized a second conference and was again elected chair. Although some had advocated for a House of Governors that would propose uniform state laws, Willson's opening remarks made it clear that this was not the intent of the National Governors' Conference.

500|$|Sports {{journalists have}} {{articulated}} the idea {{with increasing frequency}} that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike, is a [...] "knee-jerk" [...] reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> waste of time. The Journal of Sport and Social Issues Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline {{on the part of}} participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity. However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.|$|E
500|$|Hugh Sterbakov of GameSpot {{was more}} {{critical}}. He called it [...] "a clone of the original", and criticised {{the lack of}} split-screen multiplayer. Another critical reviewer was from Edge; he described the game as [...] "virtually indistinguishable" [...] from the first Ridge Racer, and commented that Ridge Racer Revolution does not fulfil the expectations evoked by the original. It was also stated that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> [...] "jazzed-up" [...] Ridge Racer 2, and [...] the visuals were criticised as [...] "antiquated". Despite these criticisms, the handling was praised, and the gameplay was described as [...] "varied". A reviewer for Next Generation contended that the original Ridge Racer was rushed {{in order to make}} it out for the PlayStation launch, and that whereas rival Sega had done an exceptional job of fixing their own launch day rush job with Virtua Fighter Remix, [...] "Namco has simply released a disc with a new track, using the same flawed game engine". He particularly felt that the price was much too high for what was essentially an expansion pack, and concluded that anyone who bought the game would be [...] "a half-step away from being conned". Will Groves of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the game as [...] "a poor sequel", but liked the range of options provided. He described the game itself as [...] "great", but further criticised it for not being fun, as he thought the feel is aggressive.|$|E
