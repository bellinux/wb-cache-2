40|$|The Kcnq 1 ot 1 {{antisense}} noncoding RNA {{has been}} implicated in long-range bidirectional silencing, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we characterize a domain at the 5 ′ end of the Kcnq 1 ot 1 RNA that carries out transcriptional silencing of linked genes using an <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> system. The bidirectional silencing property of Kcnq 1 ot 1 maps to a highly conserved repeat motif within the silencing domain, which directs transcriptional silencing by interaction with chromatin, resulting in histone H 3 lysine 9 trimethylation. Intriguingly, the silencing domain is also required to target the <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> to the perinucleolar compartment during mid-S phase. Collectively, our data unfold a novel mechanism by which an antisense RNA mediates transcriptional gene silencing of chromosomal domains by targeting them to distinct nuclear compartments known to be rich in heterochromatic machinery...|$|E

In this study, primary human ocular melanoma cells were transfected with a novel vector (B 45 -Neo <b>episomal</b> <b>vector)</b> containing the complementary DNA (cDNA) for human CD 80 to determine if this vector system is useful for stimulating CD 8 + T cells.

The transcription of plasmid cDNA, plasmid copy number, and cell surface expression were determined on transfected tumor cell lines, and cloned tumor cells were obtained by limiting dilution techniques. The stability of CD 80 expressed on tumor cells was determined after prolonged culture without geneticin and on irradiated cells.

40|$|Extrachromosomal, or <b>episomal,</b> <b>vectors</b> offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for therapeutic and scientific applications compared to integrating vectors. Extrachromosomal vectors persist in the nucleus without the requirement to integrate into the host genome, hence avoiding the recent concerns surrounding the genotoxic effects of vector integration. By avoiding integration, <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> avoid vector rearrangement, which can occur at integration, and also avoid any effect of surrounding DNA activity on transgene expression ("position effect"). Extrachromosomal vectors offer a very high transgene capacity, allowing either the incorporation of large promoter and regulatory elements into an expression cassette, {{or the use of}} complete genomic loci of up to 100 kb or larger as transgenes. Whole genomic loci transgenes offer an elegant means to express genes under physiological and developmental-stage regulation, to express multiple transcript variants from a single locus, and to express multiple genes from a single tract of genomic DNA. The combined advantages of <b>episomal</b> <b>vectors</b> of prolonged transgene persistence in the absence of vector integration, avoiding silencing by flanking heterochromatin, and high capacity, facilitating delivery and expression of genomic DNA transgenes, will be reviewed here and potential therapeutic and scientific uses outlined...|$|R

40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{infection is}} the most common sexually transmitted disease in the world and is related to the etiology of cervical cancer. The most common high-risk HPV types are 16 and 18; however, the second most prevalent type in the Midwestern region of Brazil is HPV- 33. New vaccine strategies against HPV have shown that virus-like particles (VLP) of the major capsid protein (L 1) induce efficient production of antibodies, which confer protection against the same viral type. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is an efficient and inexpensive expression system for the production of high levels of heterologous proteins stably using a wild-type gene in combination with an integrative vector. It was recently demonstrated that P. pastoris can produce the HPV- 16 L 1 protein by using an <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> associated with the optimized L 1 gene. However, the use of an <b>episomal</b> <b>vector</b> is not appropriate for protein production on an industrial scale. In the present study, the vectors were integrated into the Pichia genome and the results were positive for L 1 gene transcription and protein production, both intracellularly and in the extracellular environment. Despite the great potential for expression by the P. pastoris system, our results suggest a low yield of L 1 recombinant protein, which, however, does not make this system unworkable.

LTK 63 -specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies were highest in mice immunized with the high-level-expression strain.
