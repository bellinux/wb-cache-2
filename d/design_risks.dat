According to Ed Boon, {{the main goal}} heading into Injustice {{was to create a}} game outside of the Mortal Kombat series that was dramatically different within the fighting game genre. Producer Hector Sanchez stated that NetherRealm Studios did not feel constrained by the parameters of Mortal Kombat, allowing the developers to take more <b>design</b> <b>risks</b> with Injustice, such as removing Mortal Kombats traditional dedicated block button. Similar to Boon's previous DC-related title, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the use of the DC Comics license implied restrictions to the amount of violence in the game; however, Boon intended to push the [...] "Teen" [...] rating by replacing violence with [...] "crazy, over-the-top action." [...] When questioned if the studio's past experience with Mortal Kombat and its characteristic violence would influence Injustice, Boon replied that he wanted to keep the two titles as separate entities.|$|E
50|$|Development {{test and}} {{evaluation}} (DT&E) is conducted {{to demonstrate that}} the engineering design and development process is complete. It is used to reduce risk, validate and qualify the design, and ensure that the product is ready for government acceptance. The DT&E results are evaluated to ensure that <b>design</b> <b>risks</b> have been minimized and the system will meet specifications. The results are also used to estimate the system’s military utility when it is introduced into service. DT&E serves a critical purpose in reducing the risks of development by testing selected high-risk components or subsystems. DT&E is the government developing agency tool used to confirm that the system performs as technically specified and that the system is ready for field testing.|$|E

40|$|<b>Design</b> <b>risk</b> {{can greatly}} affect {{the success or}} {{otherwise}} of design-build projects. This study presents the identification of <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> factors in design-build projects and an analysis of their impact on project performance. A total of 23 <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> factors were identified, comprising 17 factors obtained from an exhaustive literature review and six factors arising from in-depth interviews with five experienced construction practitioners. These <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> factors formed {{the focus of a}} questionnaire survey of 500 construction practitioners, which used a five-point Likert scale as the response format. This yielded 150 valid responses for data analysis. Exploratory Factor Analysis showed that these factors can be categorized into six groupings, namely, risk of improper design-team, risk of designer’s lack of responsibility, risk of designer’s lack of experience, risk of inaccuracy or delay of third-party information, <b>risk</b> of improper <b>design</b> scheme, and <b>risk</b> of <b>design</b> change and employer review. Confirmative Factor Analysis revealed that the risk of an improper design scheme is significantly associated with the risk of designers’ lack of responsibility and experience, as well as inaccuracy and delay of third-party information, which has a significant and negative impact on project performance. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge in design-build risk analysis and, more fundamentally, the findings enhance design-build contractors’ understanding of how to achieve better project results through improved <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> management...|$|R

40|$|The {{design process}} {{can be viewed as}} a series of actions for {{reducing}} uncertainty in product or system design specifications. At the beginning of the design process, the uncertainty is high because the design space has yet to be explored and decisions have not been made. This uncertainty contributes to <b>design</b> <b>risk,</b> risk due to the engineer’s lack of knowledge and/or information. In <b>design</b> teams, <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> takes on the added dimension of lack of group awareness about the state of knowledge of each of the team member. To better understand and capture uncertainty inherent in early design, we have developed a methodology to model design evolution in concurrent design teams. The representation is a directed graph that represents the state of a design over time. In this paper we describe our modeling methodology and present a case study of two different design teams. We present the results of modeling a part of the design process. Then we show how the model can be analyzed for understanding how information and knowledge transfer was used to make decisions and reduce uncertainty and <b>design</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|R

West Africa provides considerable insight into the potential <b>design</b> <b>risks</b> associated with providing sustainable financing of regional regulation. In West Africa, development institutions are increasingly providing financial support for the development of regional regulatory frameworks to facilitate the introduction of Bt cotton. The regional approach is supported by market-levy-based financing initiatives; however, a market does not currently exist for Bt cotton in West Africa. Our results show that using the market levy may create financial incentives for the regulatory agencies to approve and promote the adoption of Bt technology without appropriate processes being followed. Alternative funding mechanisms are evaluated suggesting that a suitably designed financial guarantee may be a prudent approach to mitigate any risks that may arise from financial short falls {{in the early years of}} a regional regulatory system.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. In the context of internationally challenging economic, design has been regarded as {{a key factor in}} assisting design and manufacturing companies to survive. By using up-to-date computer-supported technology, the global design collaboration based on multidisciplinary and distributed environment is becoming a mainstream to new product development (NPD). However, during the process of collaborative <b>design,</b> <b>risk</b> is rarely mentioned. In particular, due to the complexity of design process and lack of efficient design decision-making, there have been some design collaboration failures across multiple companies. Some design projects cannot deliver the benefits as companies have expected through the collaboration. Moreover, a number of stakeholders, managers and designers expressed their disappointment at not seeing the projected savings in cost and time, which critically discredited the value of design collaboration. Many studies in academia and commercial cases have suggested that risk assessment can be applied as an effective means in the realm of design. Nevertheless, few of them conducted risk management research associated with design constraints under a collaborative environment from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In current risk practice, many risk practitioners simply report key risks to their management teams and no further analysis, which might subsequently result in confusion with excessive discussions. Consequently, to prevent the failure of design collaboration and perform a satisfactory risk assessment, it is important to perform risk management with an upstream perspective and at an operational level. An approach, called constraint-based <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> management (DRM) where a conceptual framework has been proposed on the basis of collaborative <b>design</b> features, <b>risk</b> management process and Theory of Constraints (TOC). Moreover, a DRM matrix has been developed to map, measure and mitigate collaborative <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> through evaluating the critical design constraints, and then specified <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> variables in the light of <b>risk</b> criteria. <b>Design</b> constraints are quantitative parameters that frequently affect main design processes and decisions. The combination of <b>design</b> constraints and <b>risk</b> criteria can be accessible and applicable by designers and design mangers. In addition, a Bayesian weighting method based on Bayesian theorem has been developed to measure collaborative <b>design</b> <b>risk</b> in a more efficient manner. Ultimately, a DRM tool has been created as a simulated scenario prototype, which incorporated with three case-study evaluations, to demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of using TOC and risk theory in the realm of design collaboration...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a fuzzy risk {{assessment}} model for construction projects procured with target cost contracts (TCC) and guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contracts using factor analysis (FA) and fuzzy synthetic evaluation method, based on an empirical questionnaire survey with relevant industrial practitioners in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 34 key risk factors (RFs) inherent with TCC/GMP contracts were identified through an extensive literature review and a series of structured interviews. A questionnaire survey was then launched to solicit the opinions of industrial practitioners on risk assessment of such RFs. Findings – The most important 17 principal RFs after the calculation of normalised values were selected for undertaking FA. Five principal risk groups (PRGs) were then generated in descending order of importance as: <b>design</b> <b>risks,</b> pre-contract risks, economic and financial risks, lack of experience in TCC/GMP procurement process and post-contract risks. These survey findings also reveal that <b>design</b> <b>risks</b> may be the major hurdle to the success of TCC/GMP projects in Hong Kong. Originality/value – An overall risk index (ORI) associated with TCC/GMP construction projects and the risk indices of individual PRGs can be generated from the model for reference. An objective and reliable assessment can be achieved. The model provides a solid platform to measure, evaluate and reduce the risk levels of TCC/GMP projects based on objective evidence instead of subjective judgments. The research methodology could be replicated in other countries or regions to produce similar models for international comparisons and the assessment of risk levels for different types of TCC/GMP projects worldwide.
