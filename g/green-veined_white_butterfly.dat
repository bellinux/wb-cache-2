40|$|Abstract There is genetic {{variation}} in the female mating rate in the <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris napi), and females benefit from male ejaculates that contain both sperm and accessory gland substances. Although polyandry corresponds to higher lifetime fecundity than monandry, some females abstain from remating irrespective {{of the number of}} available mates. Explaining {{genetic variation}} in mating rates requires that monandrous females perform better than polyandrous ones under some conditions. We experimentally explored the reproductive performance of females either with a low or high intrinsic mating rate by allowing them to mate, feed, and lay eggs freely in a laboratory. Individual females followed different life histo-ries: during the early days of reproduction, females with a low mating rate produced more eggs than females with a high mating rate. Hence, refraining from the benefits of multiple mating may be beneficial, if the time for reproduction is limited, or other female traits associated with polyandry are traded off against longevity. Given the day length of 10 h, a model shows that even if polyandrous females enjoy higher lifetime reproductive success, change-able and unpredictable weather will favor monandry if each period of suitable weather lasts, on average, less than 5 days. Thus, a combination of life history cost and unpredictability of fitness may explain the maintenance of monandry in the wild. Our results are also consistent with the observation that frequency of monandry increases with latitude...|$|E
40|$|In {{multivoltine}} {{insects that}} oviposit and develop on short-lived plants, different herbivore generations across a growing season often exploit different plant species. Here, we compare the development time, pupal mass, and survival of two closely related oligophagous herbivore species on {{two species of}} brassicaceous plants that grow in different habitats and which exhibit little overlap in temporal growth phenology. In central Europe, the <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Pieris napi L., is bivoltine, whereas the small cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae L., has two to three generations a year. Moreover, P. napi is primarily found in moist, open (e. g., meadow), and forest habitats, whereas P. rapae prefers drier, open habitats. Both butterflies were reared on Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), which is shade-tolerant and grows early in spring in forest undergrowth, and Black mustard (Brassica nigra), which prefers open disturbed habitats and is most common in summer. Both host plant species differ in other traits such as secondary chemistry. We hypothesized that, owing to habitat preference, P. napi would develop equally well on both plants but that P. rapae would perform better on B. nigra The results provide partial support for this hypothesis, as both herbivores performed equally well on A. petiolata and B. nigra However, there were differences in these parameters that were species-specific: on both plants P. rapae developed faster and had larger pupae than P. napi Our results show that specialized herbivores can exploit different species of related plants that grow {{at different times of}} the season, enabling them to have multiple generations...|$|E
40|$|Butterflies show {{considerable}} {{variability in}} female mating frequency, ranging from monandrous species to females mating {{several times in}} their lifetime. Degree of polyandry also varies within species, with some females only mating once and others mating multiply. Previous {{studies have shown that}} one reason for female multiple mating is to obtain nutritious male donations that both increase the longevity of females and result in higher lifetime fecundity. Despite the presence of male nutrient donations, some females of the <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieridae: Pieris napi) never mate more than once. In this study, we examined this apparent paradox. We assessed to what degree polyandry is under genetic control by a full-sib analysis, and we also estimated the broad sense heritability of female lifetime fecundity in singly mated females. Both polyandry and lifetime fecundity have a genetic component. However, degree of polyandry appears to be traded off against reduced longevity when denied the oppor-tunity to mate more than once. It is possible that female P. napi display different reproductive strategies, with some females relying on male donations to realize their potential fecundity and others relying on their own resources for egg production. In nature, polyandrous females may be prevented from mating multiply due to unfavorable weather. We discuss the possibility that the trade-off between degree of polyandry and life span when singly mated may affect the maintenance of genetic variability in female mating frequency in this species. Possible reasons for these different reproductive strategies are discussed. Key words: body size, fecundity, life history, nuptial gifts, polyandry, sexual selection, trade-offs.

40|$|Evolution is {{not always}} straight-forward, as {{selection}} pressures may differ between different generations of the same species. This thesis focuses {{on the evolution of}} life history of the model species, the <b>Green-veined</b> <b>White</b> <b>butterfly</b> Pieris napi. In central Sweden P. napi has two generations per year. The directly developing summer generation is short-lived and time stressed, compared to the diapausing generation. In paper I polyandry, defined as female mating rate, was shown to differ between generations but was unaffected by environmental factors. In paper II both males and females of the direct developing generation were shown to eclose more immature than the diapausing generation, indicating larval time constraints. Consistent with this, diapausing males mated sooner than direct developers. Directly developing females, however, mated sooner after eclosion than diapausing females, even though they are more immature. This was shown to negatively affect fecundity, but can pay off when the season is short. Paper III shows that directly developing males have less sex pheromones at eclosion than diapausers, and the differences in sex pheromone production is consistent with developmental time constraints and the differences in mating system. In P. napi and other polyandrous butterflies, males transfer a large, nutritious ejaculate at mating. Large ejaculates confer advantages under sperm competition, but as they are costly, males should adjust ejaculate size to the risk of sperm competition. In paper IV we found that males transfer on average 20 % larger spermatophores under high male competition than at low competition. The same effect could be observed if we added male sex pheromone to the air in a mating cage without male-male competition. Paper V shows that males of the two generations respond differently to an increase in male-male competition, with diapausing males transferring larger spermatophores than direct developers at high male competition risk.

40|$|The {{decision}} by females to mate {{or not is}} influenced by many factors that vary in virgin and mated females. Apart from the endogenous reproductive maturation state of virgin females ensuring {{they are ready to}} reproduce, females ’ mating decisions can be directly affected by males ’ behaviour. Males have to be of the right species, but as they frequently vary in ‘quality’, should ideally be of high value. Male ‘quality ’ can, for example, reflect variation in resources provided to females at mating. Males of several lepidopteran species provide females with nutrients in the ejaculate that increase female fecundity (e. g. Boggs and Gilbert, 1979; Wiklund et al., 1998), and there is variation between males in provisioning ability (e. g. Wedell, 1996). Males may also vary in genetic quality, such as viability, which can be passed to offspring (Jennions and Petrie, 2000). Male courtship Males frequently engage in courtship displays prior to mating. In both butterflies and moths, for example, males court females prior to mating by releasing pheromones that function as aphrodisiacs to stimulate copulation. These odours are released from specialised scent organs such as hair-pencils, coremata and modified scales (Birch et al., 1990). Male released pheromones can provide information both regarding species identity and overall quality. In the <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> Pieris napi, males release a sex-specific volatile (citral) during courtship, which entices the female to perform mate acceptance behaviours (Andersson et al., 2003). Similarly, male Heliothis virescens moths, display abdominal hair-pencils and release odours during courtship, promoting female mate acceptance. These compounds are species-specific (Hillier and Vickers, 2004). There is also variation in aphrodisiacs within species. In the arctiid moth Utetheisa ornatrix, males transfer chemical compounds to the female at mating that she bequeaths to her offspring, rendering them distasteful and thus protected against predators (Dussourd et al., 1988). Interestingly, males with more protective compounds to offer release scents that are more appealing to females than males with inferior offerings. Hence by assessing the quality of males ’ pheromones, females may gain information regarding the amount received, which increase...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} biology of Pierinae {{is described in}} three separate studies. In Part One, the population biology of the Orange Tip butterfly (Anthocharis card amines) is described. Colonies of this species are localised in riverbank habitats in Co. Durham. Using mark-recapture studies, the population size and movements of individual males were assessed. Studies of individual pre-adult survival indicated that food-plant related mortality and parasitisation were important causes of death. However a key-factor analysis for one population showed that failure of adult females to lay all their eggs was" the most Important factor influencing population size. The adaptiveness of oviposition behaviour was examined by following individual females and by mapping the distribution of eggs upon foodplants. It was shown that many aspects of oviposition choice were best interpreted as chance outcomes of searching behaviour. The observed differences in larval survival on different foodplants, and the constraints placed by time shortage on oviposition were used to construct a simple optimality model. It was shown that oligophagy, the typical condition of A. cardamines populations, leads to increased individual fitness when compared to monophagy. The effect of this stabilising selection on future speciation in Pierinae is discussed. The concept of effective population size is developed for A. cardainines and it is shown that allelic variation at one locus conforms to the predictions of sampling theory in small populations. Part two describes the mating behaviour of several Pierinae, and demonstrates that reproductive isolation in this group is not a result of male behaviour, but of female discrimination of male characters. The agreement of observed behaviour with the predictions of sexual selection is noted, and the likely effects of sexual selection in past and future speciation is discussed. Part three describes the amount of structural gene change that has occurred during the evolution of Pierinae It is shown that little genetic differentiation at such loci occurs prior to or during speciation. Rather, differentiation of species appears to occur at other loci, including those involved in local adaptation, as was described for montane and lowland populations of the <b>Green-Veined</b> <b>White</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Artogeia napi) in Co.

40|$|Abstract Females {{may either}} mate with one (monandry) or several (polyandry) males during a single {{breeding}} season. The polyandrous mating system has prompted numerous studies since {{the recognition of}} a widespread occurrence of mixed paternity among animals. Consequently, the benefits of polyandry have become well-established, and the female role in sexual selection upgraded. Females may gain both material and genetic benefits from multiple mating. Hence, the occurrence of polyandry is understandable, whereas monandry remains an evolutionary puzzle especially among species with male nutrient provisioning. I studied both the life history variation among female mating tactics and the adaptive significance of monandry in varying environmental conditions in the <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> [Pieris napi, (L. 1758) ], which is a predominantly polyandrous species with nuptial feeding. I used a combination of explicit laboratory experiments and field studies. My results show that monandry and degrees of polyandry are distinct strategies with life history differences reaching beyond mating frequencies. Polyandry corresponded with a higher lifetime fecundity than monandry in P. napi. Polyandry was, however, associated with relatively low fecundity during {{the early days of}} reproduction. Thus, monandry is beneficial if time for reproduction is limited severely enough or other female traits or behaviours associated with polyandry are traded off against longevity. Due to temporal variation in reproductive rate among mating tactics, offspring of polyandrous females have less time to complete development. Accordingly, polyandrous females developed at a faster rate as larvae than monandrous ones under optimal conditions. Despite growth rate variation, monandrous females were more likely to contribute to additional summer generation in conditions that allow production of only a partial second generation, and thus monandry is favoured under these conditions. Genetic variation in female mating tactics will not only prevail if environmental conditions do not allow all individuals to contribute evenly to the directly breeding generation in bivoltine populations, but also if even the production of a single generation per year is time-limited. A general conclusion would be that seasonality and unpredictability of fitness in the wild drives the evolution of optimal female mating tactics and promotes the maintenance genetic variation in mating frequencies, regardless of the direct benefits of nuptial feeding. Even if a high degree of polyandry would be the most profitable mating tactic in an average year, strong annual variation in weather conditions and the duration of summer may create possibilities for a temporally fluctuating selection that promotes a co-existence of different mating tactics because variance of fitness is likely increase with an increasing mating frequency...|$|E
40|$|In the <b>green-veined</b> <b>white</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Pieris napi), females obtain direct fitness {{benefits}} from mating multiply and {{studies have shown}} that fitness increases seemingly monotonically with number of matings. The reason is that at mating males transfer a large nutritious gift (a so called nuptial gift) to the females that the females use to increase both their fecundity and lifespan. In addition, if exposed to poor food conditions as larvae, females mature at a smaller size compared to males. Accordingly, it was suggested that smaller females could compensate for their size through nuptial feeding by, for instance, mating more frequently. We did not find any support for that hypothesis. On the contrary, larger females remated sooner and had a higher lifetime number of matings. Neither were smaller females able to compensate in any other way, because singly mated females and multiply mated females suffered to the same extent from their smaller size. This thesis also shows that despite the positive relationship between fitness and number of matings, there is a large variation in female mating frequency in wild populations and about every second female mates only once or twice. This variation is not dependent on how often females get courted by males, because female mating frequency was shown not to be affected by male courtship intensity. Hence, the reason for the low mating frequency could either be that males have evolved the ability to manipulate females to mate at a suboptimal rate as a measure of protection against sperm competition, or alternatively, that female mating rate is suppressed by some costs. Using two selection lines, artificially selected for either a high or a low mating rate, we showed that the variation in mating rate was mainly a female trait because which line the females were from affected their mating rate whereas which line the male was from did not. This implies that females mate at a low rate due to hidden costs or due to constraints. The same study also showed that females with a high "intrinsic" mating rate lived shorter, but only when denied remating. This led us to test the hypothesis that the cost females face is {{to have the ability to}} mate at a high rate but the cost is only paid when remating opportunities are scarce. However, we found no support for such an idea, because females with a high intrinsic mating rate held in a cold environment where the butterflies were prevented from flying and feeding did not live shorter. Neither was there an effect of a female’s mating rate on her ability to quickly break down and convert male nutrient gifts into egg material. Female mating rate did, on the other hand, affect dispersal tendency, with low mating rate females being more inclined to fly between different habitats. The underlying reason for this is still to be explored...|$|E
