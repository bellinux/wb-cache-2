5|$|Fictional {{portrayals of}} Walsingham tend to follow Catholic interpretations, {{depicting}} him as sinister and Machiavellian. He features in conspiracy theories surrounding {{the death of}} Christopher Marlowe, whom he predeceased. Charles Nicholl <b>examined</b> (<b>and</b> rejected) such theories in The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe (1992), which {{was used as a}} source by Anthony Burgess for his novel A Dead Man in Deptford (1993).|$|E
5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is <b>examined</b> <b>and</b> attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci <b>examined,</b> <b>and</b> two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount of variation was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.|$|E

From 2007 - 2009 a number of interim evaluation reports were submitted to the PMC on the development phase {{of the project and}} its resources. In 2009, following the extension of the project, the objectives of the evaluation were revised. These objectives, which underpin this final evaluation report, are as follows: <b>Examine</b> <b>and</b> assess the pilot phase; <b>Examine</b> <b>and</b> assess the uptake and use of the Information Packs by parents <b>and</b> practitioners; <b>Examine</b> <b>and</b> assess the partnership working and development on a multi-sectoral and crossborder basis of the PMC, and more generally in meeting the needs of immigrant parents; <b>Examine</b> <b>and</b> assess the mainstreaming of learning and good practice; <b>and</b> <b>Examine</b> <b>and</b> assess the training/awareness raising and support of practitioners in delivering the programme...|$|R

5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically <b>examined,</b> <b>and</b> the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been <b>examined</b> <b>and</b> that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell <b>examined</b> <b>and</b> catalogued around 10,000 barrows and {{advanced}} the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory fieldwork influenced much British archaeology {{in the latter part of}} his 20th century, while his willingness to pay attention to other sources of information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be ahead of his time.|$|E

5|$|In 1877 three {{stones were}} found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues {{solitaire}} skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One of the stones was <b>examined</b> <b>and</b> found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , but hardly flat on one side as described by Leguat. This {{could be due to}} its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their hatchlings.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, {{after four}} years in the workhouse, Merrick {{contacted}} a showman named Sam Torr and proposed that Torr should exhibit him. Torr agreed and arranged for a group of men to manage Merrick, whom they named the Elephant Man. After touring the East Midlands, Merrick travelled to London to be exhibited in a penny gaff shop on Whitechapel Road which was rented by showman Tom Norman. Norman's shop, directly {{across the street from the}} London Hospital, was visited by a surgeon named Frederick Treves, who invited Merrick to be <b>examined</b> <b>and</b> photographed. Soon after Merrick's visits to the hospital, Tom Norman's shop was closed by the police, and Merrick's managers sent him to tour in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Newton died in {{his sleep}} in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had {{divested}} much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton. After his death, Newton's hair was <b>examined</b> <b>and</b> found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters like zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, <b>examined,</b> <b>and</b> combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.|$|E

5|$|Such eliminativists have {{developed}} different arguments {{to show that}} folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory {{and needs to be}} abolished. They argue that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being <b>examined</b> <b>and</b> explained by modern neurosciences. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.|$|E
5|$|The layer pyramid {{was first}} <b>examined</b> <b>and</b> its {{surroundings}} explored in 1839 by John Shae Perring. Soon after, in 1848, the pyramid {{was identified as}} such by Karl Richard Lepsius, who listed it as number XIV in his pioneering list of pyramids. Around 40 years later, in 1886, Gaston Maspero unsuccessfully searched for {{the entrance of the}} subterranean passages of the pyramid, which was discovered in 1896 by Jacques de Morgan. The latter undertook excavations of the pyramid but stopped after clearing the first few steps of the descending stairway.|$|E
5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be <b>examined,</b> <b>and</b> a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E
