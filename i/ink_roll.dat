60|$|Joseph dipped his pen, {{and paused}} meditatively {{to watch a}} drop of ink, {{wherewith}} it was overladen, fall back into the horn. The briefest of pauses was it, yet {{it was not the}} accident it appeared to be. Hitherto Joseph had been as sincere as he had been earnest, intent alone upon saving his life at all costs, and forgetting in his fear of the present the dangers that the future might hold for him were Crispin Galliard still at large. But in that second of dipping his quill, assured that the peril of the moment was overcome, and that Crispin would go forth as he said, the devil whispered in his ear a cunning and vile suggestion. As he watched the drop of <b>ink</b> <b>roll</b> from his pen-point, he remembered that in London there dwelt at the sign of the Anchor, in Thames Street, one Colonel Pride, whose son this Galliard had slain, and who, did he once lay hands upon him, was not like to let him go again. In a second was the thought conceived and the determination taken, and as he folded the letter and set upon it the superscription, Joseph felt that he could have cried out in his exultation at the cunning manner in which he was outwitting his enemy.|$|E

Flexographic plates can be created with analog and digital platemaking processes. The image areas are raised above the non image areas on the rubber or polymer plate. The ink is transferred from the <b>ink</b> <b>roll</b> which is partially immersed in the ink tank. Then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll (or meter roll) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly (the number of cells per linear inch can {{vary according to the}} type of print job and the quality required). To avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look, it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive. This is achieved by using a scraper, called a doctor blade. The doctor blade removes excess ink from the anilox roller before inking the printing plate. The substrate is finally sandwiched between the plate and the impression cylinder to transfer the image. The sheet is then fed through a dryer, which allows the inks to dry before the surface is touched again. If a UV-curing ink is used, the sheet {{does not have to be}} dried, but the ink is cured by UV rays instead.|$|E
50|$|Finally, as {{the machine}} worn out, a little mark {{appeared}} at 35 millimeters {{from the center}} of each datestamp. When up the <b>inking</b> <b>roll</b> went to far and put ink on the touching piston. When going down, the piston, that was at 35 millimeters from the datestamps' centers, touched the mail and deposed a blur of ink.|$|R
50|$|A major {{beneficiary}} of the invention of synthetic dyes was a document reproduction technique known as stencil duplicating. Its earliest form was invented in 1874 by Eugenio de Zuccato, a young Italian studying law in London, who called his device the Papyrograph. Zuccatoâ€™s system involved writing {{on a sheet of}} varnished paper with caustic ink, which ate through the varnish and paper fibers, leaving holes where the writing had been. This sheet - which had now become a stencil - was placed on a blank sheet of paper, and <b>ink</b> <b>rolled</b> over it so that the ink oozed through the holes, creating a duplicate on the second sheet.|$|R

2500|$|An {{intentional}} {{recording of}} friction ridges is usually made with black printer's <b>ink</b> <b>rolled</b> across a contrasting white background, typically a white card. Friction ridges {{can also be}} recorded digitally, usually on a glass plate, using a technique called Live Scan. A [...] "latent print" [...] is the chance recording of friction ridges deposited {{on the surface of}} an object or a wall. Latent prints are invisible to the naked eye, whereas [...] "patent prints" [...] or [...] "plastic prints" [...] are viewable with the unaided eye. Latent prints are often fragmentary and require the use of chemical methods, powder, or alternative light sources in order to be made clear. Sometimes an ordinary bright flashlight will make a latent print visible.|$|R

50|$|Wood {{engraving}} is {{a relief}} printing technique, with the images made by carving into fine-grained hardwood blocks. <b>Ink</b> is <b>rolled</b> {{onto the surface}} of the block, dry paper is placed on top of the block and it is printed either by rolling both through a press, or, by hand, using a baren to rub the ink {{from the surface of the}} block onto the paper. In a relief print, the engraved lines show white.|$|R
50|$|While {{working at}} Atelier 17, Krishna Reddy was {{instrumental}} in developing a new printing process to produce multi-colored prints from a single printing matrix by exploiting the viscosity and tackiness of the inks, subsequently named viscosity printing. Sticky and thick <b>ink</b> does not <b>roll</b> {{down on top of}} oily, runny ink, but oily and runny <b>ink</b> does <b>roll</b> down on top of sticky and thick. Inks of different tack and viscosity are employed to edition multi-colored prints off of deeply etched and carved metal printing plates. This process reveals the three dimensionality of the printing matrix to a significant degree. In the case of a printing matrix with three distinct areas; textured, original surface, and areas that have been smoothly etched to a lower level, each area will print in a different color. The matrix is inked and wiped as an intaglio using etching ink for the first color. A hard roller with slightly runny ink is used to put a layer of ink onto the original surface for the second color. Etching ink is often fairly viscous, but has very low tack so the second color does not adhere to the textured areas. A soft roller with stiff <b>ink</b> is <b>rolled</b> over the entire plate for the third color. The matrix is printed just like any intaglio. When this is carefully done each color is distinct and the process is repeatable. Each step in this process is sensitive to the point that most printmakers employ it for producing monotypes and monoprints rather than editions.|$|R
40|$|Extended {{fingerprint}} {{features are}} routinely used by latent examiners in forensic applications. They {{are now being}} considered for inclusion in automatic fingerprint identification systems (AFIS), particularly with the adoption of 1000 ppi resolution in the Next Generation Identification (NGI) system. Earlier studies on this topic suffered from two limitations: (i) experiments were based on live scan images that are generally of good quality and contain smaller intra-class variations compared to ink images and (ii) the baseline minutiae matcher {{used to measure the}} additive value of extended features was not a state-of-the-art matcher. In this paper, we study the utility of pores, one of the most prevalent extended fingerprint features, on <b>rolled</b> <b>ink</b> fingerprint images at both 500 ppi and 1000 ppi resolution in the NIST SD 30 database. The results show that the fingerprint image quality significantly affects the automatic extraction and matching accuracy of pores. Furthermore, the contribution of pores to the overall fingerprint recognition accuracy is miniscule when a COTS matcher is used for 500 ppi <b>rolled</b> <b>ink</b> fingerprint images. The fusion between pore matcher and COTS minutiae matcher is a bit more effective on 1000 ppi good quality <b>rolled</b> <b>ink</b> fingerprint images. We believe that these results will be useful in the design of next generation AFIS. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The Blickensderfer Typewriter {{was invented}} by George Canfield Blickensderfer (1850-1917) and {{patented}} on August 4, 1891. Two models were initially unveiled {{to the public at}} the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the Model 1 and the Model 5. His machines were originally intended to compete with larger Remington, Hammond and Yost typewriters, and were the first truly portable, full-keyboard typewriters. The design also enabled the typist to see the typed work {{at a time when most}} typewriters were understrike machines that concealed the writing. When Blickensderfer unveiled his small Model 5 at the 1893 World's Fair, a stripped-down version of his larger more complex Model 1 machine, these revolutionary features attracted huge crowds and a full order book - many of them from Britain, Germany and France, whose business machine markets were more highly developed than the United States. [...] The Blickensderfer typewriters were initially manufactured in a rented factory on Garden Street in Stamford, Connecticut. By 1896, due to strong foreign demand in particular for his machines, Blickensderfer opened a new and modern factory on Atlantic Street in Stamford. According to an article published by the Stamford Historical Society [...] " [...] Blickensferfer's typewriter...became the world's best seller, and the company became one of the world's largest typewriter manufacturers". The factory employed about 200 people and produced about 10,000 typewriters per year at its peak (1903-1907) until the factory closed in 1919. The first commercially successful model was the No. 5, which sold for $35, compared to the benchmark machines of the day which cost $100 or more. Each new model 5 came in a simple wooden carrying case with an extra typewheel, a dozen <b>ink</b> <b>rolls</b> and a tool kit.|$|R

5|$|In 1960, Warhol began {{producing}} {{his first}} canvases, which he based on comic strip subjects. In late 1961, {{he learned the}} process of silkscreening from Floriano Vecchi, who had run the Tiber Press since 1953. Though the process generally begins with a stencil drawing, it often evolves from a blown up photograph which is then transferred with glue onto silk. In either case, one needs to produce a glue-based version of a positive two-dimensional image (positive means that open spaces are left where the paint will appear). Usually, the <b>ink</b> is <b>rolled</b> across the medium so that it passes through the silk and not the glue. Campbell's Soup cans were among Warhol's first silkscreen productions; the first were U.S. dollar bills. The pieces were made from stencils; one for each color. Warhol did not begin to convert photographs to silkscreens until after the original series of Campbell's Soup cans had been produced.|$|R
50|$|A rubbing (frottage) is a {{reproduction}} of the texture of a surface created by placing {{a piece of paper}} or similar material over the subject and then rubbing the paper with something to deposit marks, most commonly charcoal or pencil, but also various forms of blotted and <b>rolled</b> <b>ink,</b> chalk, wax, and many other substances. For all its simplicity, the technique can be used to produce blur-free images of minuscule elevations and depressions on areas of any size in a way that can hardly be matched by even the most elaborate, state-of-the-art methods. In this way, surface elevations measuring only a few thousandths of a millimeter can be made visible.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary ink {{metering}} systems {{employ a}} self contained system {{known as a}} chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox <b>roll.</b> <b>Ink</b> is pumped through a hose(s) to the chamber which fills to capacity. Ink is retained within the system by end seals and doctor blades.One blade work as a retaining blade, simply holding ink within the chamber. The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll.Chambered doctor blade systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity.|$|R
40|$|In {{fingerprint}} recognition, interoperability is {{the ability}} of a system to work with a diverse set of fingerprint devices. Variations induced by fingerprint sensors include image res-olution, scanning area, gray levels, etc. Such variations can impact (i) the quality of the extracted features, and (ii) cross-device matching performance. This is true even when dealing with fingerprint sensors of the same sensing tech-nology (e. g. optical). Previous research did not provide a model to accommodate sensor distortions to increase cross-device matching performance. In this paper, we propose a method that increases interoperability in systems which de-ploy optical fingerprint sensors. We design and evaluate a set of characteristics suitable for measuring differences in fingerprint image acquisition. Further, we propose a clas-sification scheme, which combines the defined features with match scores. The classification performance is evaluated on a set of fingerprints acquired using four different optical devices and scanned <b>rolled</b> <b>ink</b> prints, from approximately 500 subjects. Experimental results confirm the significant impact of low interoperability on match rates and show that the proposed approach is able to reduce cross-device match error rates by a significant margin. 1...|$|R

Rusted metal surfaces continually attract my attention. The geometric shapes I use {{give a sense of}} human order and structure to the work and create a formal contrast to the textural fields in these unique (one of a kind) prints. The surfaces found in my work have been inspired by the Texturologies of Jean Dubuffet, with their geological sensibility and their juxtaposition of textures, as well as the successive layers of paper. Helen Frankenthaler has been referred to as an intuitive and natural painter, and her experimentation and spontaneity have influenced me. The overall patterning of Jackson Pollock's Drip Paintings, with their skeins of layered colors, the suggested layering in Robert Rauschenberg's prints, and Ron Davis' geometric illusions have given me direction. To achieve the painterly textures, I cover my zinc etching plate with hard ground and drip solvent (kerosene or lacquer thinner) on it in a controlled manner. It is then etched in a strong nitric acid solution, aquatinted by spraying it with lacquer and etched again to create the tonal values. This process is repeated three or four times. Finally, I coat the plate with soft ground, imbed it with foil to create a network of fine lines, remove the foil and etch. The finished plate is intaglio <b>inked</b> and relief <b>rolled</b> for the initial printing on the press. In intaglio inking, ink is forced into the etched (grooved) surfaces of the plate and the top surfaces are wiped clean. (See more in text. ...|$|R
