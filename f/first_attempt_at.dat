5|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{was first}} {{published}} in 1968 by Parnassus Press in Berkeley, a year before The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's watershed work. It was a personal landmark for Le Guin, as it represented her <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> writing for children; she had written only a handful of other novels and short stories prior to its publication. The book was also her <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> writing fantasy, rather than science-fiction. A Wizard of Earthsea was the first of Le Guin's books to receive widespread critical attention, and has been described as her best known work, as part of the Earthsea series. The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated Folio Society edition released in 2015. It was also translated into a number of other languages. An omnibus edition of all of Le Guin's Earthsea works is planned to be released on the 50th anniversary of the publication of A Wizard of Earthsea in 2018.|$|E

Braathens Rederi's <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> {{entering}} the helicopter market was in 1982, when it {{applied for a}} concession from the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications to operate offshore helicopters, which it was awarded in 1983. As a protest, the incumbent Helikopter Service applied for the airline routes that Braathens SAFE operated from Stavanger, but this application was rejected.|$|E

5|$|Nathan Lazur {{initially}} {{planned to}} create a Chrono Trigger remake for the Nintendo 64, called CT64, using GNU-based homebrew tools. Lazur's motivation for the project came in 1999 when playing Chrono Trigger and Super Mario 64. The remake, developed {{by a team of}} four people, was Lazur's <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> creating a complete title. The game was intended to have two playing modes and the same battle system as the original.|$|E

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> {{reclaiming}} Chat Moss {{took place}} {{at the start of the}} 19th century. In 1793 William Roscoe began work on reclaiming the smaller Trafford Moss, now part of Trafford Park. By 1798 that work was sufficiently advanced for Roscoe to enter into a lease of part of Chat Moss from the de Trafford family, but no reclamation work was carried out until 1805.|$|E

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> {{surgery on}} the {{esophagus}} focused in the neck, and {{was conducted in}} dogs by Theodore Billroth in 1871. In 1877 Czerny carried out surgery in people.

5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> {{studying}} sea animals {{in their native}} environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E

5|$|Corea {{explains}} at {{his website}} {{how he was}} motivated to work on music inspired by To the Stars, commenting that he {{was inspired by a}} scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a tone poem piece. Previous tone poem albums by Corea include The Leprechaun (1975), My Spanish Heart (1976), and The Mad Hatter (1978). The piece is Corea's <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.|$|E
5|$|Defender was Williams Electronics' <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> {{developing}} a new video game; the company's earlier game was a Pong clone. The popularity of coin-operated arcade games in 1979 spurred the company to shift its focus from pinball games to arcade games. The company chose Eugene Jarvis, who had a successful record of Williams pinball games, to head development. Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault assisted Jarvis. At the time, Williams had a small staff and the management was unfamiliar with technology used for its electronic games. As a result, the staff was afforded {{a large amount of}} creative freedom.|$|E
5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 grew out of the need for a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the stillborn Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved avionics and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was incrementally improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with highly sophisticated combat avionics and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as avionics (Tu-142MP) and engine (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Clarke {{spent some}} time writing war histories. Until his {{retirement}} from the army in 1947, with the rank of brigadier, he recorded the history of 'A' Force. The document was never published and remained classified till the 1970s. His first complete book was published in 1948. Seven Assignments recorded Clarke's activities during the early wartime period of 1939 and 1940 (before the Middle East posting). It was not his <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> a book. In 1925 Clarke had found a publisher for his coverage for the Rif rebellion, but the work was never finished.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson {{published}} the <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> forecasting the weather numerically. Using a hydrostatic variation of Bjerknes's primitive equations, Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour forecast {{for the state}} of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. His forecast calculated that the change in surface pressure would be , an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis.|$|E
5|$|In 2065, the Zero-X {{spacecraft}} launches from Glenn Field as the <b>first</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>at</b> a manned {{mission to}} Mars.

When his foot becomes trapped in the hydraulics, the Hood causes a systems failure and Zero-X loses control. While the villain manages to extract his bloodied foot and parachute from the undercarriage, Travers and his crew eject in an escape pod and Zero-X crashes into the ocean before leaving Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
