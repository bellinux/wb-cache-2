5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard <b>elevons,</b> varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost <b>elevons,</b> which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|The B.1 {{had four}} {{elevators}} (inboard) and four ailerons (outboard). In the B.2, these {{were replaced by}} eight <b>elevons.</b> The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (in, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.|$|E
25|$|Northrop's Chief Test Pilot Vance Breese {{flew the}} N-1M on its maiden flight, {{unexpectedly}} bouncing {{into the air}} during a planned high-speed taxi run. He reported that the aircraft could fly no higher than five feet off the ground. Flight could only be sustained by maintaining a precise angle of attack, but Theodore von Kármán solved the problem by making adjustments to the trailing edges of the <b>elevons.</b> Control of the aircraft was achieved {{through the use of}} a system of <b>elevons</b> and wingtip rudders. The <b>elevons</b> served in tailless type aircraft both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took the place of a conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.|$|E

40|$|Replacing the {{helicopter}} rotor swashplate and blade pitch control system with on-blade <b>elevon</b> control surfaces for {{primary flight control}} may significantly reduce weight and drag to improve mission performance. Simplified analyses are {{used to examine the}} basic aeroelastic characteristics of such rotor blades, including pitch and flap dynamic response, <b>elevon</b> reversal, and <b>elevon</b> control effectiveness. The profile power penalty associated with deflections of <b>elevon</b> control surfaces buried within the blade planform is also evaluated. Results suggest that with aeroelastic design for pitch frequencies in the neighborhood of 2 /rev, reasonable <b>elevon</b> control effectiveness may be achieved and that, together with collective pitch indexing, the aerodynamic profile power penalty of on-blade control surface deflections may be minimized...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{pressure}} distributions {{are presented}} for regions where three-dimensional separated flow effects are prominent on swept-wing-elevon-end-plate models of 0 degree, 50 degree, and 70 degree sweepback, and with 0 degree, 10 degree, 20 degree, and 30 degree <b>elevon</b> deflections. Surface-oil-flow photographs and pressure distributions on the flat-plate wing, <b>elevon,</b> and end-plate surfaces are presented for numerous geometric variations, including various spacings between the <b>elevon</b> {{and the end}} plate, with and without a tip fin. The data, for a free-stream Mach number of 6 and a wing-root-chord Reynolds number of 20 x 10 to the sixth power, reveal considerably larger regions of <b>elevon</b> induced loads on the adjacent end-plate surface than would be anticipated by using inviscid flow analyses...|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} control near and above the speed of sound, it is often necessary to use either power operated all-flying tailplanes (stabilators), or delta wings fitted with power operated <b>elevons.</b> Power operation prevents aerodynamic forces overriding the pilots' control inputs.|$|E
25|$|The P.40 is a {{tailless}} aircraft with a swept, cantilever, low wing. In plan, the wing has a rectangular centre section and straight tapered outer panels with <b>elevons.</b> There are wing tip fins and outward opening rudders which extend a little below the wing.|$|E
25|$|Northrop had {{investigated}} several {{means of}} applying directional control that would least infringe on the aircraft's radar profile, eventually settling {{on a combination}} of split brake-rudders and differential thrust. Engine thrust became a key element of the B-2's aerodynamic design process early on; thrust not only affects drag and lift but pitching and rolling motions as well. Four pairs of control surfaces are located along the wing's trailing edge; while most surfaces are used throughout the aircraft's flight envelope, the inner <b>elevons</b> are normally only in use at slow speeds, such as landing. To avoid potential contact damage during takeoff and to provide a nose-down pitching attitude, all of the <b>elevons</b> remain drooped during takeoff until a high enough airspeed has been attained.|$|E
40|$|The orbiter <b>elevon</b> seal panel {{mechanism}} {{controls the}} position of fairing panels between the orbiter wing and <b>elevon.</b> Early mechanism designs used linkages which approximately matched the panel motion to <b>elevon</b> position, depending on panel deflections to maintain sealing. These linkages were refined during orbiter development to match panel motion to <b>elevon</b> motion more exactly, thus reducing panel deflections, loads, and weight. Changes to the adjacent cove seal resulted {{in the use of}} curved tension compression links. Mechanism temperatures up to 750 F (locally) posed difficulties in bearing lubrication. Despite the adverse effect of the many fabrication tolerances, the system successfully prevented the entry of 1200 F hot gases into the wing/elevon joint...|$|R
40|$|Space shuttle orbiter <b>elevon</b> {{effectiveness}} {{was measured}} with the 6 inch elevon/elevon and elevon/fuselage gaps and various configurations of wing/elevon upper hingeline gap sealing flapper doors. The <b>elevon</b> configuration parametric variations consisted of sealing the lower hingeline to prevent flow-through and testing a long chord flapper door, a short chord flapper door, no flapper door (elevon/wing gap upper hingeline completely open), and a completely sealed <b>elevon</b> at <b>elevon</b> deflections from + 20 deg to - 40 deg. Preliminary data analysis indicates loss of <b>elevon</b> effectiveness at deflections more negative than - 20 deg, and little or no effect of flapper door configuration on <b>elevon</b> effectiveness. Flow visualization photographs taken at alpha = 15 deg for two flapper door configurations substantiated the force data results. Aerodynamic force and moment data were measured in the body axis by a 2. 5 inch task type internal strain gage balance. The model was sting supported through the base region with a nominal angle of attack range of - 10 deg {{less than or equal}} to alpha {{less than or equal to}} 24 deg at a model angle of sideslip of Beta equal to 0 deg...|$|R

25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{control surfaces}} of SpaceShipOne {{are designed to}} operate in two distinct flight regimes, subsonic and supersonic. The supersonic flight regime is of primary interest during the boost phase of a flight, and the subsonic mode when gliding. There are separate upper and lower rudders, and <b>elevons.</b> These are controlled using aviation-style stick and pedals. In supersonic mode the trim tabs are controlled electrically, whereas the subsonic mode uses mechanical cable-and-rod linkage.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{complies with}} the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight category rules. It features an unusual diamond-shaped biplane, strut-braced closed wing layout, a two-seats-in-tandem enclosed or open cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The upper wing is swept back, while the lower wing is straight, but mounted further aft. The two wings are joined by swept tip rudders. The <b>elevons</b> are mounted to the lower wing only.|$|E
25|$|A Nieuport-built Dunne {{appeared}} at the Paris Aero Salon in December 1913. Like the second D.8 it was a Gnome powered two-seater, but with significant differences both aerodynamically and structurally. It combined the double upper wing <b>elevons</b> into a single surface and had very rounded rear wingtips. The fuselage was slightly modified and built around steel tubes rather than wood. The interplane struts were streamlined steel tubes. It also had a strikingly simplified undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{control of}} the Regulus II was {{through the use of}} <b>elevons</b> fitted to the outer half of the wing {{trailing}}-edges, as the missile was not fitted with a tailplane, and a rudder fitted to the trailing edge of the fin. Flaps were fitted to the inner half of the trailing edge for use during takeoff. Additional stability and control in pitch was provided by small trapezoidal canard foreplanes near the nose of the fuselage.|$|E
40|$|The aeromechanics {{design of}} the Active <b>Elevon</b> Rotor (AER) has been completed. The AER <b>elevon</b> is a 15 % chord, plain, trailing-edge flap {{actuated}} by a piezoceramic-based conformal actuator. A trade study is performed to determine {{the location of the}} <b>elevon</b> for reducing the (4 /rev) vibratory hub loads at µ = 0. 125. Both single- and dual-elevon configurations are considered, with the dual-elevon configuration being selected. In addition, a linear engineering analysis is used to approximate <b>elevon</b> finite-span effects, which are found to be of sufficient size to warrant further investigation. Additional results are given for the selected AER design, including rotor blade modal frequencies and damping, and vibratory hub loads and <b>elevon</b> motions at four advance ratios. The design choice is predicted to have the six vibratory hub loads reduced by 50 - 90 % at µ = 0. 125 and by 80 - 98 % at µ = 0. 225; the effectiveness is compromised, however, at µ = 0. 400, with an 80 % reduction of the vertical force being achieved at the expense of four other hub loads. Overall, the AER design should provide a reasonable basis for ongoing rotor blade development and future wind-tunnel testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{heating rate}} and {{pressure}} distributions {{in and around}} the <b>elevon</b> coves were correlated. An analytical approach incorporating such a correlation into a thermal structure computer code to examine the <b>elevon</b> seal and cover structure in flight was developed. Emphasis was placed on the design of a thermal model that predicts gas and wall temperatures in the cove area. The <b>elevon</b> cove area was modelled analytically by a parallel plate flow channel, incorporating effects of axial wall conduction, axial and environmental radiant energy exchanges, and effects of laminar and turbulent convection entrance regions. Comparisons were made between computed and measured values of (1) cove wall temperatures; (2) local gas temperature within the cove; and (3) local heating rates...|$|R

25|$|Several {{technology}} {{research and}} development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, <b>elevons,</b> flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. These {{may be used in}} many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics.|$|E
25|$|With {{pitch control}} {{provided}} by all four <b>elevons,</b> roll by the split ailerons (operating together), speed / approach control by split ailerons / airbrakes and yaw {{controlled by the}} rudder. In this configuration the aircraft proved to be stable in pitch, {{being able to be}} flown hands-off during aero-tow, and pitch could be controlled simply by the pilot leaning forwards or backwards to adjust the centre of gravity. Lateral stability was noted to be poor to fair but acceptable and the aircraft was safe and capable of flying simple aerobatics.|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} of the SZD-6x was {{designed}} to allow the aircraft to be flown with several different control configurations. The trailing edges of the wings carried three surfaces each, all {{of which could be}} linked to form <b>elevons</b> or operated individually as ailerons, elevators or flaps. The metal-skinned split ailerons, (the outboard control surfaces), also formed the airbrakes, opening out to give increased drag. The ailerons/airbrakes could be connected to the rudder pedals to be used as drag rudders, similar to the drag rudders used on the Northrop flying wings. The inboard control surfaces on the swept ford section of trailing edge were typically used for trimming purposes deflecting 10° up or down.|$|E

40|$|The {{design study}} of a lightweight, effective, reuseable seal for use along the <b>elevon</b> cove of shuttle-type reentry and {{hypersonic}} cruise vehicles is presented. The study deals primarily with membrane seals, both metallic and non-metallic. This type of seal spans the cove gap between the wing and <b>elevon,</b> and {{does not depend on}} spring tension to maintain contact along a flexing wing span. Technical requirements and criteria were generally derived from the space shuttle and utilized for seal design...|$|R
25|$|A {{consequence}} of a tailless delta design, {{such as in the}} Viggen, is that the <b>elevons,</b> which replace more conventional control surfaces, operate with a small effective moment arm; their use adds substantial weight to the aircraft at takeoff and landing. Hinged leading edge surfaces can help counteract this, but an even more effective tool is the canard. The canard surfaces were positioned behind the inlets and placed slightly higher than the main wing, with a higher stall angle than the wing, and were equipped with flaps. The lifting canard surfaces act as a vortex generator for the main wing and therefore provide more lift. An added benefit was that they also improved roll stability in the transonic region. The canard flaps were deployed in conjunction with the landing gear to provide even more lift for takeoff and landing.|$|E
25|$|The D.8 was a {{tailless}} four bay unstaggered biplane {{with its}} wings swept at 32°. Its constant chord wings were built up around two spruce spars, the forward one forming the leading edge. To help achieve stability the incidence and interplane gap decreased outboard, the former becoming negative. This washout on tips well behind {{the centre of}} gravity provided longitudinal stability {{in the same way}} as a conventional tailplane, set at lower incidence than the wings. Camber increased outwards. Simple, near parallel, pairs of interplane struts joined the spars. The outer interplane struts were enclosed with fabric, forming fixed side curtains that provided directional (yaw) stability. Wing tip <b>elevons</b> were used for control, operated by a pair of levers, one either side of the pilot. The D.8 initially used just a pair of these, mounted on the upper wing, a rectangular cutout in the side curtains allowing for their movement as on the D.5. Large parts of the aircraft were built by Short Brothers.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't until Dunne {{left the}} Balloon Factory and {{started his own}} company, the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd., that a {{monoplane}} could be built. The D.6 was finished in 1911, with a 60hp (45kW) Green in a pusher configuration. Three A-frames supported the wing engine, pilot and undercarriage. All Dunne's tailless aircraft had swept wings with marked washout (reduction of angle of incidence) at the tips. Since sweepback placed the tips well behind the centre of gravity, they provided longitudinal (pitch) stability in just {{the same way as}} a conventional tailplane, mounted at lower incidence than the wing. The wing camber increased outwards, causing the outer leading edge to droop further. The inherent design of the wing provided some directional (yaw) stability, which was augmented on the D.6 using down-turned wingtips. The wing had wingtip <b>elevons</b> for control, though because of the down-turned tips these also provided some rudder-like forces. The D.6 was tested at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain in January 1911 but failed to take off.|$|E
