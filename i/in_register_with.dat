5000|$|To {{bring out}} the best {{attributes}} of letterpress, printers must understand the capabilities and advantages of what can be a very unforgiving medium. For instance, since most letterpress equipment prints only one color at a time, printing multiple colors requires a separate press run <b>in</b> <b>register</b> <b>with</b> the preceding color. When offset printing arrived in the 1950s, it cost less, and made the color process easier. The inking system on letterpress equipment is the same as offset presses, posing problems for some graphics. Detailed, white (or [...] "knocked out") areas, such as small, serif type, or very fine halftone surrounded by fields of color can fill in with ink and lose definition if Rollers are not adjusted correctly. However, a skilled printer overcomes most of these problems. However, a letterpress provides the option of a wider range of paper, including handmade, organic, and tree-free. Letterpress printing provides a wide range of production choices. The classic feel and finish of letterpress papers takes printing back to an era of quality and craftsmanship. Even the smell of the ink, more apparent on a letterpress-printed page than with offset, may appeal to collectors.|$|E

In particular he was able to show in the spinal cord that the large neurones supplying individual muscles are clustered together in discrete nuclei termed pools that are arranged <b>in</b> <b>register</b> <b>with</b> the position of the limb muscles they are programmed to innervate. Furthermore, in a now classic paper published in 1951, Romanes showed that the pools of motor neurones innervating the muscles that act together to control a limb joint are themselves grouped together into larger clusters - thus uncovering a remarkable positional registration between a motor neuron and its target muscle. George reasoned that “all the higher parts of the central nervous system would be organized in a similar basic way “, a premise that is now gathering experimental support. [...] His contemporaries used the utility of his maps to identify the pathognomonic lesions of motoneurones seen in the polio epidemic which was sweeping the USA. Modern workers using transgenic mice have confirmed the genetically determined location of the motor neurone pools and shown how the rest of the spinal cord network, including the connection of the sensory nerves, to be dependent on the positional template first described by George. === ...|$|E

Given the multi-layered and parallel architecture of brains, the question specifically is where physiological activity patterns correspond to stimulus features and/ or perception.

40|$|AbstractAn 8 – 9 bp RNA–DNA hybrid in the {{transcription}} elongation complex {{is essential for}} keeping the RNA 3 ′ terminus engaged with the active site of E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP). Destabilization of the hybrid leads to detachment of the transcript terminus, RNAP backtracking, and shifting of the hybrid upstream. Eventually, the exposed 3 ′ segment of RNA can be removed through transcript cleavage. At certain sites, cycles of unwinding–rewinding of the hybrid are coupled to reverse–forward sliding of {{the transcription}} elongation complex. This explains apparent discontinuous elongation, which was previously interpreted as contraction and expansion of an RNAP molecule (inchworming).
