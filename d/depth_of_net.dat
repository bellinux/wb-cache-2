In {{order to obtain}} information on the incidental capture of harbour porpoise in the western North Atlantic, research was conducted in three fishing regions (St. Bride's, Newfoundland {{during the summer of}} 1993, Jeffreys Ledge in the Gulf of Maine during the fall of 1993 and Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy during the summers of 1994 and 1995) where incidental capture of harbour porpoise in groundfish gillnets was occurring. Data were collected on the procedures used in fishing, the environmental conditions at the time of fishing, characteristics of the porpoise caught and the views of the fishermen regarding the issue of harbour porpoise incidental capture in their nets. [...] A total of 124 harbour porpoises were captured during 465 observer days when 17, 363 nets were hauled. Over three seasons, significant relationships were found between harbour porpoise capture, duration of net soak time and distance of net placement from shore. The depth at which the net was set and the number of nets in a string were related to harbour porpoise bycatch over two seasons. Target species capture varied between seasons, altering the relationship of target species fish and bycatch. For one of the two seasons where mesh size varied, it showed a relationship to harbour porpoise bycatch. Of 85 animals retrieved, 50 were male and 35 female. Lengths and weights of females were greater than males. Estimated age of animals ranged from 0 to 7 + years. Of the total number, 64 % of the porpoises were sexually mature, 23 % were immature, and 13 % were calves. [...] Newfoundland porpoise primarily foraged for capelin, sand lance and herring, while Gulf of Maine/Jeffreys Ledge animals ate pearlsides, silver hake and herring; in the Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy region the diet was primarily Atlantic herring and silver hake. Atlantic herring occurred in 80 % of the stomachs analyzed and was the longest prey fish (44 - 332 mm). [...] Environmental data were collected over the 159 days of the study. Bycatch of the harbour porpoise was correlated with wind speed during both seasons in Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy, with cloud cover during the 1993 summer season in Newfoundland, and with water temperature during the 1994 Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy season. [...] Assessment of elapsed time since death was undertaken to examine the diagnostic usefulness of the vitreous humour and core body temperature in determining postmortem interval. Twenty-four animals from Bay of Fundy bycatches were examined for core temperature and concentrations of various constituents of vitreous humour (glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus) and the data were compared with published data of rectal temperature and serum concentrations of similar elements in live harbour porpoise. Vitreous humour glucose decreased from antemortem serum values, and the level was positively correlated with core temperature. Potassium and magnesium increased from antemortem serum values.

We find substantial gaps in access to care despite the presence of a medical school, an abundance of primary care and specialty physicians, two major teaching hospitals, a large federally qualified health center and other safety net resources in this community of about 50, 000 residents. Using a blend of random-digit-dial and area probability sampling, a survey of 595 households was conducted in 2001 generating detailed information about the health, access to care, demographic and other characteristics of 1, 572 individuals. Confirming the great <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the New Brunswick health care safety net, the survey showed that more than one quarter of local residents reported a hospital or community clinic as their usual source of care.

40|$|More than {{a decade}} has passed since {{the passage of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. During that time the U. S. tuna purse seine neet reduced its {{incidental}} porpoise mortality rate more than 10 -fold. This was made possible through the development of gear and techniques aimed at reducing the frequency of many low probability events that contribute to the kill. Porpoise are killed by becoming entangled or entrapped in folds and canopies <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> and suffocating. The configuration <b>of</b> the <b>net,</b> both before and during the backdown release procedure, is a major determinant of the number of porpoise killed. Speedboats can be used to tow on the corkllne to prevent net collapse and also to adjust the net configuration to reduce net canopies prior to backdown. Deepening a net can reduce the probability of porpoise being killed by prebackdown net collapse. The effects of environmental conditions and mechanical failures on net configuration can result in high porpoise mortality unless mitigated by skilled vessel maneuvers or prevented by the timely use of speedboats to adjust the net. The backdown procedure is the only means to effectively release captured porpoise from a purse seine. It is also the time during the set when most of the mortality occurs. The use of small mesh safety panels and aprons in the backdown areas <b>of</b> <b>nets</b> reduces porpoise entanglement, and Increases the probability of an effective release. The tie-down points on the net for preparing the backdown channel must be properly located in order to optimize porpoise release. A formula uses the stretched <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> to calculate one of these points, making it a simple matter to locate the other. Understanding the dynamics of the backdown procedure permits a thorough troubleshooting of performance, thus preventing the repetition of poorly executed backdowns and thereby reducing mortality. Porpoise that cannot be released must be rescued by hand. A rescuer in a rigidly inflated raft can rescue porpoise effectively at any time during a net set. Hand rescue can make the difference between above average kill and zero kill sets. In all circumstances, the skill and motivation of the captain and his crew are the final determinants in the prevention of incidental porpoise mortality in tuna seining.

The dominant activation energy between 14 meV and 22 meV determined by temperature dependent Hall-effect {{is very similar to}} the donor silicon on gallium site. Two other activation energies at 30 meV and between 50 meV and 70 meV were found corresponding well with O Ga and V N defects, respectively. The <b>depth</b> profiles <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> donor densities show a strong increase towards the substrate /LT-GaN/HT-GaN interface indicating diffusion of silicon from the SiN mask towards the surface. Therefore, the Si-doping is attributed to the dissolution of the SiN masks during the following high temperature GaN layer growth. Sidoping from the SiN masks also explains the deterioration of the band bending within the LT-GaN / HT-GaN junction found by photovoltage spectroscopy...|$|R
25|$|The {{display on}} a net sounder shows the {{distance}} <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> {{from the bottom}} (or the surface), rather than the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline <b>of</b> the <b>net,</b> the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments {{to be made to}} catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end <b>of</b> the <b>net.</b> As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.|$|R
25|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry, under Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth Jr., {{was opened}} in Pearl Harbor the {{following}} day. An early {{theory that the}} incident {{was the result of}} a Japanese submarine attack was dismissed as impractical because <b>of</b> the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the West Loch and the presence <b>of</b> anti-submarine <b>nets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1968: Reclaim {{took part}} in the salvage {{operation}} on the Air Lingus Viscount 803 Aircraft EI-AOM, the [...] "Saint Phelim", which had crashed into the Irish Sea off Tuskar Rock on 24 March 1968. Over a period of 26 days, divers working from the Reclaim performed 91 dives in <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> 250 ft, managing to salvage a third of the aircraft's wreckage. Unfortunately, when Reclaim attempted to raise the fuselage to the surface using straps instead <b>of</b> <b>nets,</b> the wreckage broke apart upon reaching the surface and sank.|$|R
25|$|Lady Alexandra was {{designed}} for the routes from Vancouver, British Columbia to Bowen Island and Howe Sound. Alexandra had a gross tonnage <b>of</b> 1,396 and <b>net</b> tonnage <b>of</b> 678. The ship was 225.4 feet long, with a beam of 40.7 feet and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> hold of 9.7 feet.|$|R
50|$|The bow is {{the most}} {{prominent}} portion of the wreck with the stern damaged by <b>depth</b> charges. Three <b>of</b> the four propellers were removed by Oceaneering International in 1982. Expeditions to Lusitania {{have shown that the}} ship has deteriorated much faster than Titanic has, being in a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 305 ft of water. When contrasted with her contemporary, Titanic (resting at a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 12,000 ft), Lusitania appears in a much more deteriorated state due to the presence <b>of</b> fishing <b>nets</b> lying on the wreckage, the blasting of the wreck with depth charges and multiple salvage operations. As a result, the wreck is unstable and may at some point completely collapse.|$|R
