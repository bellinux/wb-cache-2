25|$|Methods of {{immersion}} or multiangular <b>ellipsometry</b> {{are applied}} to find the optical constants of the material with rough sample surface or presence of inhomogeneous media. New methodological approaches allow the use of reflection <b>ellipsometry</b> to measure physical and technical characteristics of gradient elements in case the surface layer of the optical detail is inhomogeneous.|$|E

25|$|Magneto-optic {{generalized}} <b>ellipsometry</b> (MOGE) is {{an advanced}} infrared spectroscopic <b>ellipsometry</b> technique for studying free charge carrier properties in conducting samples. By applying an {{external magnetic field}} {{it is possible to}} determine independently the density, the optical mobility parameter and the effective mass parameter of free charge carriers. Without the magnetic field only two out of the three free charge carrier parameters can be extracted independently.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ellipsometry</b> is a {{powerful}} technique for the measurement of the optical properties of a uniform surface. It involves measuring the polarization state of light following specular reflection from such a surface. This is typically done {{as a function of}} incidence angle or wavelength (or both). Since <b>ellipsometry</b> relies on reflection, it is not required for the sample to be transparent to light or for its back side to be accessible.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{analysis}} of the change of polarization of light, <b>ellipsometry</b> can yield information about layers that are thinner than the wavelength of the probing light itself, even down to a single atomic layer. <b>Ellipsometry</b> can probe the complex refractive index or dielectric function tensor, which gives access to fundamental physical parameters like those listed above. It is commonly used to characterize film thickness for single layers or complex multilayer stacks ranging from a few angstroms or tenths of a nanometer to several micrometers with an excellent accuracy.|$|E
25|$|At {{infrared}} {{and optical}} frequencies, a common technique is <b>ellipsometry.</b> Dual polarisation interferometry {{is also used}} to measure the complex refractive index for very thin films at optical frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Typically, <b>ellipsometry</b> is {{done only}} in the {{reflection}} setup. The exact nature of the polarization change {{is determined by the}} sample's properties (thickness, complex refractive index or dielectric function tensor). Although optical techniques are inherently diffraction-limited, <b>ellipsometry</b> exploits phase information (polarization state), and can achieve sub-nanometer resolution. In its simplest form, the technique is applicable to thin films with thickness of less than a nanometer to several micrometers. Most models assume the sample is composed of a small number of discrete, well-defined layers that are optically homogeneous and isotropic. Violation of these assumptions requires more advanced variants of the technique (see below).|$|E
25|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} surface concentrations {{is needed in}} order to prove the validity of the model: two different techniques are normally used: <b>ellipsometry</b> and following the decay of 14C present in the surfactant molecules.|$|E
25|$|A spectroscopic {{ellipsometer}} can {{be found}} in most thin film analytical labs. <b>Ellipsometry</b> is also becoming more interesting to researchers in other disciplines such as biology and medicine. These areas pose new challenges to the technique, such as measurements on unstable liquid surfaces and microscopic imaging.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} NanoKid “stand’, the acetyl {{protecting}} groups were removed {{through the use}} of ammonium hydroxide in THF to create the free thiols. A gold-plated substrate was then dipped into the solution and incubated for four days. <b>Ellipsometry</b> was used to determine the resulting thickness of the compound, and it was determined that the NanoKid was upright on the substrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{measured}} signal {{is the change}} in polarization as the incident radiation (in a known state) interacts with the material structure of interest (reflected, absorbed, scattered, or transmitted). The polarization change is quantified by the amplitude ratio, Ψ, and the phase difference, Δ (defined below). Because the signal depends on the thickness {{as well as the}} material properties, <b>ellipsometry</b> can be a universal tool for contact free determination of thickness and optical constants of films of all kinds.|$|E
25|$|The {{detection}} of both near-field amplitude and phase also provides {{means for the}} quantitative studies of the sample interior (within the probing range of the tip near field, of course). This could been utilized for the recovery of thickness and permittivity of layered films and nanostructures, for the nanoscale profiling of multiphase materials and other subsurface analysis of samples. In other words, nano-FTIR has a unique capability of recovering the same information about thin-film samples that is typically returned by <b>ellipsometry</b> or impedance spectroscopy, yet with nanoscale spatial resolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ellipsometry</b> {{can be used}} {{to model}} the (complex) {{refractive}} index of a surface of a bulk material. It is also very useful in determining parameters of one or more thin film layers deposited on a substrate. Due to their reflection properties, not only are the predicted magnitude of the p and s polarization components, but their relative phase shifts upon reflection, compared to measurements using an ellipsometer. A normal ellipsometer does not measure the actual reflection coefficient (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the p and s reflections, as well as change of polarization ellipticity (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied. In addition to use in science and research, ellipsometers are used in situ to control production processes for instance.|$|E

2500|$|Single-wavelength <b>ellipsometry</b> {{employs a}} {{monochromatic}} light source. This {{is usually a}} laser in the visible spectral region, for instance, a HeNe laser [...] with a wavelength of 632.8nm. Therefore, single-wavelength <b>ellipsometry</b> is also called laser <b>ellipsometry.</b> The advantage of laser <b>ellipsometry</b> is that laser beams can be focused on a small spot size. Furthermore, lasers have a higher power than broad band light sources. Therefore, laser <b>ellipsometry</b> {{can be used for}} imaging (see below). However, the experimental output is restricted to one set of [...] and [...] values per measurement. Spectroscopic <b>ellipsometry</b> (SE) employs broad band light sources, which cover a certain spectral range in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet spectral region. By that the complex refractive index or the dielectric function tensor in the corresponding spectral region can be obtained, which gives access to a large number of fundamental physical properties. Infrared spectroscopic <b>ellipsometry</b> (IRSE) can probe lattice vibrational (phonon) and free charge carrier (plasmon) properties. Spectroscopic <b>ellipsometry</b> in the near infrared, visible up to ultraviolet spectral region studies the refractive index in the transparency or below-band-gap region and electronic properties, for instance, band-to-band transitions or excitons.|$|E

2500|$|In situ <b>ellipsometry</b> {{refers to}} dynamic {{measurements}} during the modification process of a sample. This {{process can be}} used to study, for instance, the growth of a thin film, including calcium phosphate mineralization at the air-liquid interface, etching or cleaning of a sample. By in situ <b>ellipsometry</b> measurements it is possible to determine fundamental process parameters, such as, growth or etch rates, [...] variation of optical properties with time. In situ <b>ellipsometry</b> measurements require a number of additional considerations: The sample spot is usually not as easily accessible as for ex situ measurements outside the process chamber. Therefore, the mechanical setup has to be adjusted, which can include additional optical elements (mirrors, prisms, or lenses) for redirecting or focusing the light beam. Because the environmental conditions during the process can be harsh, the sensitive optical elements of the <b>ellipsometry</b> setup must be separated from the hot zone. In the simplest case this is done by optical view ports, though strain induced birefringence of the (glass-) windows has {{to be taken into account}} or minimized. Furthermore, the samples can be at elevated temperatures, which implies different optical properties compared to samples at room temperature. Despite all these problems, in situ <b>ellipsometry</b> becomes more and more important as process control technique for [...] thin film deposition and modification tools. In situ ellipsometers can be of single-wavelength or spectroscopic type. Spectroscopic in situ ellipsometers use multichannel detectors, for instance CCD detectors, which measure the ellipsometric parameters for all wavelengths in the studied spectral range simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ellipsometry</b> {{can also}} be done as imaging <b>ellipsometry</b> by using a CCD camera as a detector. This {{provides}} a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null <b>ellipsometry</b> and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging <b>ellipsometry</b> is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In <b>ellipsometry,</b> the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E
