50|$|The wild life {{found in}} the country are elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer and {{pronghorn}} antelope. These provide for good hunting opportunities. The pheasant population has been increasing in the county, eagles frequent War Horse Lake, and Gray, or <b>Hungarian,</b> <b>partridge</b> are an introduced species.|$|E
5000|$|The grey {{partridge}} (Perdix perdix), {{also known}} as the English partridge, <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge,</b> or hun, is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds. The scientific name is the Latin for [...] "partridge", and is itself derived from Ancient Greek perdix.|$|E
50|$|Hunting furbearing {{animals is}} prohibited. Hunting of these birds by non-natives is permitted: <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge,</b> pheasants, ducks, geese, mergansers, and coots. Other animals {{that can not}} be hunted by non-natives are: elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer, grizzly bear, and moose. Wolves, bison, swans, and falcons are also present.|$|E
50|$|Harker Lake {{is used by}} {{waterfowl}} approximately {{nine months}} out of the year. The most common species to be found include Canada geese, mallards, snow geese, ring-necked pheasants, sharp-tailed grouse, and <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridges.</b> White-tailed deer are common around the lake, and some coyotes live in the area. A majority of the grasslands {{around the perimeter of the}} lake are introduced grasses and legumes.|$|R
50|$|Nevada's game bird {{resources}} include chukar and <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge,</b> sage, {{blue and}} ruffed grouse, California, Gambel, and mountain quail, ring necked pheasants, mourning dove and wild turkey. Waterfowl {{associated with the}} state's aquatic areas include northern pintail, mallard, America wigeon, redhead and wood ducks as well as Canada and snow geese.|$|E
50|$|Upland hunters {{traditionally}} walk when finding game, though quail {{hunters in}} the Southern States often employ hunting buggies or vehicles {{due to the}} sparseness of game. Because of the large area that must be covered {{in order to find}} bobwhite quail many hunters employ specially designed hunting buggies to haul gear and kennels for fresh dogs. On the other hand, chukar and <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge</b> hunters of much of the western U.S. will hunt with one or two dogs on the ground {{for the duration of the}} hunt, hiking 8+ miles of steep mountain terrain in a single hunt with well conditioned dogs.|$|E
50|$|Deschutes River {{is one of}} 28 {{state parks}} in Oregon with year-round campgrounds {{although}} water is turned off during the winter. There are 34 campsites suitable for recreational vehicles, with electricity and water available. An additional 25 primitive sites with drinking water and facilities nearby are available. The park is along the Oregon Trail and offers a covered wagon to rent for camping. The park includes showers, mowed lawns, and wildlife viewing. Hiking and biking opportunities include a trail named for former governor Victor G. Atiyeh that runs along the Deschutes. Hunting is also available for pheasant, chukar, and <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge</b> during designated seasons for each. Located on the west shore of the Deschutes River, Heritage Landing boat ramp is on the opposite shore from the main access to the park, with the Lower Deschutes Wildlife Area about one mile (1.6 km) upriver.|$|E

40|$|Population {{characteristics}} and seasonal ecological {{requirements of a}} <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge</b> population were determined on a 54 mi 2 area in northeast Teton County, Montana during January, 1969 -April 1974. A total of 2, 873 observations and 17, 736 partridge were recorded. (Cereal grains were major food items with green plant materials and forbs taken in high frequencies but low volumes. Dandelions were the major forb species eaten.) Partridge fed in early morning and late evening, the latter being most important. Pairs were the basic population unit; pairing began annually 7 - 18 February and was complete by 1 March. All observed, marked females and 81 - 83 percent of males paired. Surviving previous-year pairs remained paired and all adults tended to pair within coveys; 67 and 69 percent of subadult males and females, respectively, paired outside their winter coveys. The peak week of nesting was 13 - 19 May and 29 percent of all broods hatched during the peak week, 19 - 25 June. Mean brood sizes decreased 18 percent from time of hatching to observation in July, 21 percent July-August, and 7 percent August-September...|$|E
40|$|Of {{the many}} game birds {{introduced}} to the North American continent only two, the European or <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge,</b> Perdix perdix, and the ring-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, have been successful thus far. Recent introductions of the chukar partridge, Alectoris graeca, also show promise of being successful. The {{pros and cons of}} animal introductions have been discussed in a number of papers. It is definitely true that rabbits in Australia, starlings in America and the mongoose in Hawaii have become pests. But the garre birds introduced in North America cannot fairly be classed as pests; they have been welcomed {{in a number of states}} and provinces; actually partridges and pheasants have completely altered the hunting picture in many areas, and it is difficult to realize the amount of hunting left if these birds were removed. King (1942), although generally opposed to the introduction of the partridge and the pheasant in America, mentions that probably 90 percent of the upland bird shooting in Oregon is produced by the partridge and pheasant; and the importance of the pheasant as a game bird in the cornbelt needs no elaboration...|$|E
