5|$|One of Parcells first {{decisions}} as coach was to replace Simms {{as the starting}} quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked to be traded after the benching, but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player's helmet on his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, {{but according to the}} book, Simms to McConkey, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and <b>Dick</b> <b>Schaap,</b> the injury was much more severe, with the thumb literally hanging off after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Personal Voice and the Impersonal Eye", Dan Wakefield acclaimed the nonfiction of Capote and Wolfe as elevating {{reporting to the}} level of literature, terming that work and some of Norman Mailer's nonfiction a journalistic breakthrough: reporting [...] "charged with the energy of art". A review by Jack Newfield of <b>Dick</b> <b>Schaap's</b> Turned On saw the book as a good example of budding tradition in American journalism which rejected many of the constraints of conventional reporting:This new genre defines itself by claiming many of the techniques that were once the unchallenged terrain of the novelist: tension, symbol, cadence, irony, prosody, imagination.|$|R

25|$|Frank Gifford was the play-by-play announcer, while then-ABC Sports analyst Don Meredith and then-Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann {{served as}} color commentators. Al Michaels and Jim Lampley hosted the pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame (Lampley {{presided over the}} Vince Lombardi Trophy {{presentation}} ceremony) coverage for ABC. Michaels and Lampley were joined by analysts O. J. Simpson (who would normally have been the second color commentator; when interviewed as to why Theismann would join Gifford and Meredith in the booth instead of Simpson; director Chet Forte {{was quoted in the}} January 14, 1985 edition of Broadcasting Magazine as saying that Theismann could contribute more due to having played both teams in the regular-season as well as having played in the two previous Super Bowls.) and Tom Landry (in a separate booth during the game). Also helping out with ABC's coverage were Jack Whitaker, <b>Dick</b> <b>Schaap,</b> Donna de Varona, Ray Gandolf, and ABC News reporters Stone Phillips, Jeff Greenfield, Judd Rose, and Bill Redeker.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "Republican paper, a Protestant {{paper and}} a paper more {{representative}} of the suburbs than the ethnic mix of the city", the Tribune generally did not match the comprehensiveness of the New York Times coverage, but its national, international and business coverage was generally viewed as {{among the best in}} the industry, as was its overall style. At one time or another, the paper was home to such writers as Dorothy Thompson, Red Smith, Roger Kahn, Richard Watts, Jr., Homer Bigart, Walter Kerr, Walter Lippmann, St. Clair McKelway, Judith Crist, <b>Dick</b> <b>Schaap,</b> Tom Wolfe, John Steinbeck, and Jimmy Breslin. Editorially, the newspaper was the voice for eastern Republicans, later referred to as Rockefeller Republicans, and espoused a pro-business, internationalist viewpoint.|$|E
500|$|The Tribune's demise hastened a {{settlement}} of the strike. Discontinued as a morning paper, the Tribune name {{was added to the}} afternoon publication and on September 12, 1966, the new World Journal Tribune published its first issue. [...] "It was not a bad paper," [...] according to Tribune historian Richard Kluger, and featured many Tribune writers, including Wolfe, Breslin, Kerr and columnist <b>Dick</b> <b>Schaap,</b> and incorporated New York as its Sunday magazine. The first weeks' editions were dominated by the input of the Hearst and Scripps papers, but after a time, the [...] "Widget" [...] (as the merged publication was nicknamed) took on the appearance and style of the late-era Tribune. The World Journal Tribune reached a circulation near 700,000—fourth-largest for American evening newspapers at the time—but had high overhead costs and relatively little advertising. Whitney eventually withdrew support for the newspaper, but Scripps and Hearst continued to back it until the paper folded on May 5, 1967.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{days after}} Knight {{was fired from}} Indiana University, Jeremy Schaap of ESPN interviewed him and {{discussed}} his time at Indiana. Towards {{the end of the}} interview, Knight talked about his son, Pat, who had also been dismissed by the university, wanting an opportunity to be a head coach. Schaap, thinking that Knight was finished, attempted to move on to another subject, but Knight insisted on continuing about his son. Schaap repeatedly tried to ask another question when Knight shifted the conversation to Schaap's style of interviewing, notably chastising him about interruptions. Knight then commented (referring to Schaap's father, <b>Dick</b> <b>Schaap),</b> [...] "You've {{got a long way to}} go to be as good as your dad!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of his show {{business}} career, Dryer flexed his acting muscles when he helped cover Super Bowl IX for SPORT magazine. Fed up with the grandiose and self-important nature of the NFL's championship match, then-editor <b>Dick</b> <b>Schaap</b> hired Dryer and Rams teammate Lance Rentzel for this journalistic assignment. Donning costumes inspired by The Front Page, [...] "Scoops Brannigan" [...] (Dryer) and [...] "Cubby O'Switzer" [...] (Rentzel) peppered players and coaches from both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings with questions that ranged from clichéd to downright absurd. This became the inspiration for the eccentricities that surround Media Day at the Super Bowl. He briefly served as a color analyst on CBS's NFL coverage in 1982.|$|E
