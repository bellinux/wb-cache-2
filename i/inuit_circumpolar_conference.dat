500|$|During {{his first}} year in the Senate Gravel urged {{abolition}} of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In the early 1970s Gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between Alaskan villages and the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, for medical diagnostic communications. Gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first <b>Inuit</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> <b>Conference</b> in 1977, attended by Inuit representatives from Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. These conferences now also include representatives from Russia. In 1977, Gravel helped lead an effort to have the U.S. Interior Department rename Mount McKinley to Denali; this eventually led to Denali National Park being so named. Subsequently, Gravel proposed a never-built [...] "Denali City" [...] development above the Tokositna River near the mountain, to consist of a giant Teflon dome enclosing hotels, golf courses, condominiums, and commercial buildings.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, the {{circumpolar}} {{peoples and}} their organizations are {{actively engaged in}} attempts to protect their welfare, identity, interests, and culture, including their hunting culture. The [...] "Kuujjuaq Declaration" [...] addressed perceived attacks on their autonomy and rights, and recommended that the <b>Inuit</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> <b>Conference</b> [...] "undertake a comprehensive study {{on how best to}} address global forces, such as the 'animal rights' and other destructive movements that aim to destroy Inuit sustainable use of living resources, and to report back to the next General Assembly on its findings."

2500|$|In 1977, the <b>Inuit</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> <b>Conference</b> (ICC) {{meeting in}} Barrow, Alaska, United States officially adopted Inuit as a {{designation}} for all circumpolar native peoples, {{regardless of their}} local view on an appropriate term. [...] As a result, the Canadian government usage has replaced the (locally) defunct term Eskimo with Inuit (Inuk in singular). The preferred term in Canada's Central Arctic is Inuinnaq, and in the eastern Canadian Arctic Inuit. The language is often called Inuktitut, though other local designations are also used. Despite the ICC's 1977 decision to adopt the term Inuit, this was never accepted by the Yupik peoples, likened to calling all Native American Indians Navaho simply because the Navaho felt that that's what all tribes should be called.|$|E
2500|$|Inuit {{serving in}} {{political}} roles have actively advocated {{in support of}} the Inuit community. [...] The Inuit serve within a national political organisation known as the Inuit Tapirisat. Abe Okpik CM, was instrumental in helping Inuit obtain surnames rather than disc numbers. while Simonie Michael, the first Inuk to sit on what is now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories was among the early Inuit leaders to call {{for an end to the}} disc numbers. Kiviaq (David Ward) Inuit politician was the first Inuk to become a lawyer, and is responsible for several important advances in establishing the legal rights of the Inuit people. In 2001, Kiviaq won the legal right to use his single-word Inuktitut name. Peter Irniq a former Commissioner of Nunavut set up the offices of [...] "the Official Languages, Access to Information and Conflict of Interest Commissioners". Irniq also has encouraged the use of the Inuit language and the Inuit culture, referred to as [...] Qaujimajatuqangit. Sheila Watt-Cloutier, OC, is an Inuit political representative and activist at the regional, national and international levels. Sheila has most recently working as International Chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (formerly the <b>Inuit</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> <b>Conference).</b> Nellie Cournoyea, OC, of Inupiat heritage served as the first female Premier of the Northwest Territories and the second female leader of an elected legislature in Canada.

2500|$|Because of the linguistic, ethnic, and {{cultural}} differences between Yupik and Inuit peoples, {{it seems unlikely that}} any umbrella term will be acceptable.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this project}} is to revisit and reconsider the central concept of sovereignty within International Relations. From a social, historical and discourse-embedded standpoint, it will {{be argued that the}} known conception and narrative of sovereignty as tied to the Westphalian nation state, comprises only one definition of several other autonomous uprising and contesting loci of sovereignty in our contemporary transforming and globalised world. Thus, the concept of sovereignty as inherently bound to a demarcated territory and authority of the nation state needs reconsideration in the aim of exploring more suitable ways to describe and conceptualise emerging non-state agency and polities in our current globalised world order. Deconstructing sovereignty into the elements of territory, population, authority and recognition provides a useful framework for understanding the significance of transnational non-state polities’ claim to sovereignty. An examination the sovereignty claim of the <b>Inuit</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> Council, functions as an empirical example, possibly indicating new ways in which transnational and non-state polities are altering known conceptions of sovereignty within International Relations. The <b>Inuit</b> <b>Circumpolar</b> Council’s claim to sovereignty consequently exhibit how the concept of sovereignty is best understood as transformative by nature rather than static or insignificant...|$|R
