A method to produce <b>design</b> <b>storms</b> exhibiting anisotropic spatial scaling is presented by combining a state-of-the-art stochastic rainfall generator STEPS with the linear generalized scale invariance (GSI) notation. The enhanced model is used to create ensembles of <b>design</b> <b>storms</b> based on an extreme storm with a distinct rainband shape observed in Melbourne, Australia. <b>Design</b> <b>storms</b> are generated both with and without accounting for anisotropy. Effect of anisotropy on precipitation characteristics is studied using the entire region covered by the radar (radar scale) and at a significantly smaller catchment scale. A rainfall-runoff model is applied to route the rainfall through the catchment into streamflow. Accounting for anisotropy allows for a more realistic description of precipitation features at the radar scale. At the catchment scale, anisotropy increases the probability of high rainfall accumulations, which translates into greater flood volumes. No discernible difference was observed in streamflow characteristics after controlling for the accumulation over the catchment. This could be explained by a lower importance of anisotropy relative to other factors affecting streamflow generation, and by the difficulties in creating representative rainfall temporal properties at the catchment scale when the radar scale is used for model calibration. The proposed method provides a tool to create ensembles of <b>design</b> <b>storms</b> when the anisotropic shape of the fields is of importance. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Stormwater runoff is {{generally}} simulated using a <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> as input. The use of design storms significantly reduces {{the complexity of}} stormwater runoff analysis. As a result, the use of design storms is popular among engineers. The basic premise behind their use is that a <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> of a given return frequency will produce a simulated runoff peak and volume having the same return frequency. As an example, using a 5 -year <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> {{will result in a}} 5 -year runoff peak and volume. Typically, design storms are developed by statistical analysis of rainfall records. The resultant temporal distributions of these design storms may be quite unlike the rainstorms occurring in nature. Worse, the use of design storms may not be resulting in runoff peaks and volumes having the same return frequency. As a result, drainage and flood control facilities designed using design storms may be oversized or undersized. Unfortunately, design storms are, by and large, not tested against long-term rainfall/runoff record simulation to determine if they will reasonably simulate runoff for a given return frequency. A research effort is underway by the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District in the Denver, Colorado area to develop more reliable runoff simulation techniques.

40|$|Many studies {{related to}} climate change focused on global, {{continental}} or regional scale effect in space and annual or seasonal scale effect in time. However, for practical planning and engineering design, {{it is necessary to}} deal with local (spatial) and event (temporal) scales. In this paper we present the development of a continuous stochastic storm-rainfall simulation model (SRSM) which can accommodate the aforementioned scales and provides quantitative assessment of the impact on <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> depth under given scenarios of climate change. The SRSM is a parametric stochastic simulation model which considers random processes of four major storm types: frontal rainfall, Mei-Yu, convective storms and typhoons occurring annually in Taiwan. Random process of a storm rainfall event is characterized by (1) inter-arrival time of storm events, (2) joint probability distribution of storm duration and total rainfall depth and (3) time distribution of the total depth. Occurrences of storm events of a certain storm type can be modeled as a Poisson process and the inter-arrival time is modeled as a random variable with exponential distribution. A bivariate exponential distribution is adopted for joint distribution of storm duration and total rainfall depth. A Gauss-Markov random process is used for disaggregation of total rainfall. Under certain scenarios of climate change, i. e. the average number of typhoons events for the study site increases or decrease, we assess the impact on <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> depth. Changes in the number of typhoon events corresponds to changes in the inter-arrival time, and therefore the SRSM can provide a quantitative assessment of climate change effect on <b>design</b> <b>storm.</b> Our simulation results show that if the annual number of typhoons increases from current average of 4. 5 events to 5 events, the 1 -hr (24 -hr), 100 -year <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> depth will increase by 25 % (7. 7 %); whereas the 1 -hr (24 -hr), 10 -year <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> depth will increase by 13 % (6. 1 %) ...|$|E

Several regulatory enforcements of GI implementation created an urgent need for quantitative information on GI practice effectiveness, namely for sediment and stream erosion. This study aims at investigating the capability and performance of GI in reducing stream bank erosion in the Blackland Prairie ecosystem. To achieve the goal of this study, we developed a methodology to represent two types of GI (bioretention and permeable pavement) into the Soil Water Assessment Tool, we also evaluated the shear stress and excess shear stress for stream flows in conjunction with different levels of adoption of GI, and estimated potential stream bank erosion for different median soil particle sizes using real and <b>design</b> <b>storms.</b> The results provided various configurations of GI schemes in reducing the negative impact of urban stormwater runoff on stream banks. Results showed that combining permeable pavement and bioretention resulted in the greatest reduction in runoff volumes, peak flows, and excess shear stress under both real and <b>design</b> <b>storms.</b> Bioretention as a stand-alone resulted in the second greatest reduction, while the installation of detention pond only had the least reduction percentages.

Combining the disaggregation technique with a succession of simple hydrological models, i. e. a production function, a unit hydrograph and a flood routing model, we form a stochastic approach for <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> and flood synthesis. Similar to common engineering methods, the proposed method starts with the selection of certain characteristics of the <b>design</b> <b>storm</b> (i. e. its duration and total depth that correspond to a given return period). Subsequently, the method generates a series of probable time distributions by disaggregating the given total depth into incremental depths. Then the series of hyetographs is routed through the hydrological models and the result is the conditional probability distribution function of the outflow peak of the hydraulic construction studied, given the duration and total storm depth. From this distribution we can adopt the design discharge either as the conditional expected value of the outflow peak or as a value corresponding to a selected probability level. The method is illustrated with a real-world example and compared with common engineering methods. © 1994...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{new concept}} of using {{continuous}} simulation in hydraulic design attracts interest. However, {{the absence of}} long rainfall records with appropriate temporal resolution, coupled with the requirement of simulating {{a vast number of}} synthetic events to calculate the flood peak for a given exceedance probability have become a barrier to the use of such approaches. Therefore, the use of design storms based on local intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves remains at present the most popular method not only for its simplicity but mainly because most frequently the IDF curves represent the only available information on local rainfall. Also, IDF based approaches assure the reproduction of rainfall extremes whereas continuous simulation models may fail to do so.
