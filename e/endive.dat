Some versions may use edible mushrooms such as porcini, wild herbs, and leaf vegetables/greens such as arugula, <b>endive,</b> mint, chard, chicory, dandelion greens, watercress, valerian and others. As the greens boil down, {{they contribute to}} the broth's flavor. The dish may be topped with a poached egg.

500|$|Fats and {{proteins}} {{reduce the}} perception of tannins on the palate. When Cabernet Sauvignon is paired with steak or dishes with a heavy butter cream sauce, the tannins are neutralized, allowing {{the fruits of the}} wine to be more noticeable. In contrast, starches such as pastas and rice will have little effect on tannins. The bitterness of the tannins can also be counterbalanced by the use of bitter foods, such as radicchio and [...] <b>endive,</b> or with cooking methods that involve charring like grilling. As the wine ages and the tannins lessen, more subtle and less bitter dishes will pair better with Cabernet Sauvignon. The oak influences of the wine can be matched with cooking methods that have similar influences on the food-such as grilling, smoking and plank roasting. Dishes that include oak-influenced flavors and aromas normally found in Cabernet Sauvignon—such as dill weed, brown sugar, nutmeg and vanilla—can also pair well.|$|E
2500|$|Ms. <b>Endive</b> (voiced by Mindy Sterling): An obese, intelligent, and {{somewhat}} snobbish female chef who teaches cooking to Panini with strict discipline. She's also occasionally portrayed as the show's main antagonist or villain. She is usually depicted as gargantuan in size. This {{is shown in}} the episode [...] "The Apprentice Games" [...] where Mung Daal and Chowder enter the games by riding on Endive's posterior. She regularly berates Mung Daal, whom she considers a rival. In the episode [...] "Chowder's Girlfriend", it is revealed she despises boys and boyfriends because her fiancé did not show up on their wedding day. Ms. <b>Endive</b> is first seen in the second episode with Panini, [...] "Chowder's Girlfriend". The creator describes her as Martha Stewart with Oompa-Loompa colors. Greenblatt chose to name her after the <b>endive</b> since <b>endive</b> is bitter and Belgian <b>endive</b> is fancy; hence the character is bitter and fancy. Endive's character stayed constant throughout the initial development. The long nose, which changed from a rectangular shape to a triangle shape for the final version, represents how <b>Endive</b> looks down at other characters. It was revealed in later episodes that Ms. <b>Endive</b> is in love with Shnitzel. Greenblatt said that he felt that her evolution throughout the series was fun to observe, especially when William Reiss wrote plots involving <b>Endive.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In modern times, {{when there}} is no paschal lamb, some Ashkenazi Jews have adopted the {{practice}} of emulating Hillel's example by making a sandwich of matzo and maror (the [...] "bitter herbs": either lettuce, <b>endive,</b> or horseradish). The maror, if lettuce or <b>endive,</b> is dipped in the meal's traditional charoset (a finely chopped sweet mixture of fruits and nuts, typically apples, walnuts, red wine, cinnamon, and honey) just before the sandwich is made. [...] In Ashkenazi families where grated horseradish is used for the maror instead of lettuce or <b>endive,</b> the maror cannot be dipped in the charoset, so it is the custom to spread the bottom piece of matzah with horseradish maror, cover it with a pile of charoset, and top it with another piece of matzah to make a hot-sweet sandwich.|$|E
2500|$|Wild lettuce, {{known as}} chazeret, was a leafy herb with prickly, red tinged leaves that became bitter as they matured. It was {{cultivated}} from around 800 BCE. Sweeter head-lettuce was only developed and {{introduced by the}} Romans. Bitter herbs eaten at the Passover sacrifice with the unleavened bread, matza, were known as merorim. [...] "Chazeret" [...] is listed in the Mishna (Pesahim 2:6) as the preferred bitter herb for this Passover ritual, along with other bitter herbs, including chicory or <b>endive</b> (ulshin), horehound (tamcha), reichardia or eryngo (charchavina) and wormwood (maror).|$|E
2500|$|The Gardens of Adonis (1888, oil on canvas, 93 x 135 cm) was {{exhibited}} at the New Gallery, where it was described: [...] "Light flowing robes of pink purple, green and pale lemon colour; one maiden carries rose wreaths for offerings." [...] The catalogue explains, Before the feast of Adonis it was the custom of the Greeks to sow in shallow vessels the seeds of lettuce, <b>endive,</b> barley, [...] These grew up quickly, and having no roots soon withered away, and in consequence were considered as typifying the life and early death of Adonis. [...] They were called Gardens of Adonis, and after being carried in procession were, together with a statuette of the god, committed to the sea {{on the last day}} of the ceremonies. [...] This observance is described by Theocritus, Idyll XVI.|$|E

2500|$|Panini (voiced by Liliana Mumy): A 9-year-old pink cabbit {{who has a}} {{crush on}} Chowder and reminds him at every opportunity. Chowder does not return the {{feelings}} and responds with [...] "I'm not your boyfriend!" [...] whenever she greets him. Panini is an apprentice to Ms. <b>Endive,</b> and is also possessive of Chowder. Panini gets jealous when she sees Chowder with another girl, in which Chowder really does to avoid her. Her original character concept had her bully Chowder in a manner described by Greenblatt as similar to Angelica Pickles from Rugrats. Greenblatt removed the pointy ears since he felt this did not {{fit in with the}} rounded shapes in Chowder. Greenblatt did not like characters similar to Angelica and believed that he needed to make Panini [...] "cuter and sweeter". Greenblatt said that the details of Panini formed when the creator decided that Panini had a crush on Chowder; since Chowder is not old enough {{to fall in love with}} females, according to Greenblatt this aspect would frustrate Chowder [...] "in a more fun way". In the last episode, it is shown that Chowder finally returned Panini's feelings and accepted her because he realizes that he made Panini's life miserable and they are married with many kids and was voiced by Grey DeLisle. Panini's name literally means [...] "sandwiches" [...] in Italian, while her former name, Borlotti, is a type of beans.|$|E
2500|$|When the British took over, {{the great}} {{majority}} of Dutch families remained, with the exception of government officials and soldiers. However new Dutch arrivals were very few. [...] While the Netherlands was a small country, the Dutch Empire was quite large, meaning that emigrants leaving the mother country had a wide variety of choices under full Dutch control. The major Dutch cities [...] were centers of high culture, but they sent few immigrants. Most new arrivals in the 17th century had been farmers from remote villages who on arrival in New Netherland scattered into widely separated villages that had little cross contact with each other. Even inside a settlement, different Dutch groups had minimal interaction. [...] With very few new arrivals, the result was an increasingly traditional system cut off from the forces for change [...] The folk maintained their popular culture, revolving around their language and their Calvinist religion. [...] The Dutch brought along their own folklore, most famously Sinterklaas (the foundation of the modern day Santa Claus). [...] They maintained their distinctive clothing, and food preferences. [...] They introduced some new foods to America, including beets, <b>endive,</b> spinach, parsley, and cookies. [...] After the British takeover, the rich Dutch families in Albany and New York City emulated the English elite. They purchased English furniture, silverware, crystal, and jewelry. They were proud of the Dutch language, which was strongly reinforced through the church, but they were much slower than the Yankees in setting up schools for their children. They finally did set up Queens College (now Rutgers University) in New Jersey. [...] They published no newspapers, and published no books and only a handful of religious tracts annually.|$|E

60|$|We returned, viâ the landward {{flank of}} the hog's-back, along the fine plain ('O Kampos') bounded west by the range called after Mount Meriy, the apex, rising 3,274 feet. Anglo-Zantiots fondly compare its outline with the Jura's. The look of the rich lowlands, 'the vale,' as our charts call it, {{suggested}} a river-valley, but river there is none. Every nook and corner was under cultivation, and each country-house had its chapel and its drying-ground for 'fruit,' level yards now hidden under large-leaved daisies and wild flowers. We passed through the Graetani village, whose tenants bear a bad name, and saw none of the pretty faces for which Zante is famed. The sex was dressed in dark jackets and petticoats à l'italienne; and the elders were apparently employed in gathering 'bitter herbs,' dandelion and the wild <b>endive.</b> Verily this is a frugal race.|$|E
60|$|I am not {{particular}} about what I eat, as with me good digestion waits on appetite, and {{so long as}} I get a bellyful--to use a good old English word--I am satisfied. On this particular occasion, {{with or without a}} pretty girl at the table, I could have consumed a haggis--that greatest abomination ever invented by flesh-eating barbarians--I was so desperately hungry. It was therefore a disappointment when nothing more substantial than a plate of whitey-green, crisp-looking stuff resembling <b>endive,</b> was placed before me by one of the picturesque handmaidens. It was cold and somewhat bitter to the taste, but hunger compelled me to eat it even to the last green leaf; then, when I began to wonder if it would be right to ask for more, to my great relief other more succulent dishes followed, composed of various vegetables. We also had some pleasant drinks, made, I suppose, from the juices of fruits, but the delicious alcoholic sting was not in them. We had fruits, too, of unfamiliar flavors, and a confection of crushed nuts and honey.|$|E
6000|$|Upon Market Hill executions {{also take}} place, the {{criminal}} being {{shot through the}} heart. M. Pereira's garden produces all that Porta da Lenha can grow, with less trouble and of a superior kind. Water-melons, tomatoes, onions, and pimento, or large pepper (pimentão, siliquastrum, ndungu ya yenéne), useful to produce [...] "crocodiles' tears;" [...] mint, and parsley flourish remarkably; turnips are eatable after two months; cabbage and lettuce, beet, carrot, and <b>endive</b> after three or four. It {{is a waste of}} ground to plant peas; two rows, twelve feet by four, hardly produce a plateful. Manioc ripens between the sixth and ninth month, plantains and bananas once a year, cotton and rice in four months, and maize in forty days--with irrigation it is easy to grow three annual crops. The time for planting is before the rains, which here last six weeks to two months, September and October. The staple of commerce is now the nguba, or ground-nut (plural, jinguba), which Merolla calls incumba, with sometimes a little milho (maize), and Calavance beans. Of fruits we find trellised grapes, pines, and guavas, which, as at Fernando Po, are a weed. The agrumi, limes, oranges and citrons are remarkably fine, and hold, as of old, a high place in the simple medicines of the country. A cup of lime-leaf tea, drunk warm in the morning, is the favourite emetic and cathartic: even in Pliny's day we find [...] "Malus Assyria, quam alii vocant medicam (Mediam?, venenis medetur" [...] (xii. 7). On the Gold Coast and in the Gaboon region, colic and dysentery are cured by a calabash full of lime- juice, [...] "laced" [...] with red pepper. The peculiarity of European vegetables throughout maritime Congo and Angola is the absence of all flavour combined with the finest appearance; it seems as though something in the earth or atmosphere were wanting to their full development. Similarly, though in the upper regions the climate is delicious, the missionaries could not keep themselves alive, but died of privation, hardship, and fatigue.|$|E

The innkeeper was a friend of his; for, in the first place, they had lived within three doors of each other all their lives; and next, Jack was quite pleasant company enough, beside being a learned man and an Oxford scholar, to be asked in now and then to the innkeeper's private parlor, when there were no gentlemen there, to crack his little joke and tell his little story, sip the leavings of the guests' sack, and sometimes help the host to eat the leavings of their supper. And it was, perhaps, with some such hope that Jack trotted off round the corner to the Ship that very afternoon; for that faithful little nose of his, as it sniffed out of a back window of the school, had given him warning of Sabean gales, and scents of Paradise, from the inn kitchen below; so he went round, and asked for his pot of small ale (his only luxury), and stood at the bar to drink it; and looked inward with his little twinkling right eye, and sniffed inward with his little curling right nostril, and beheld, in the kitchen beyond, salad in stacks and fagots: salad of lettuce, salad of cress and <b>endive,</b> salad of boiled coleworts, salad of pickled coleworts, salad of angelica, salad of scurvy-wort, and seven salads more; for potatoes were not as yet, and salads were during eight months of the year the only vegetable.
