5000|$|Thus the D43-3 Dodge Mayfair was {{introduced}} in both hardtop and sedan models. [...] (Contrary to published articles, the D43-3 series was not a wagon). The exterior had the front <b>fender</b> <b>trim</b> extend onto {{the front door and}} backup lamps were standard. Interiors were two-tone, in either blue or green, with a matching steering wheel. [...] With the new D43-3 Mayfair, the Regent Mayfair hardtop was dropped.|$|E
5000|$|For 1954, the [...] "Clipper by Packard" [...] {{was given}} {{its own unique}} rear <b>fender</b> <b>trim</b> and tail lights to further {{differentiate}} it from traditional Packards. The cars were also available with a distinctive two-tone paint pattern. For 1955, Packard became a marque in the newly formed Studebaker-Packard Corporation. The 1955 Clipper Custom offered torsion-bar suspension something not offered on other models, which only offered coil and leaf spring suspension. It also had a power steering option. Drivers enjoyed the comfortable ride but complained of door rattles and poor workmanship.|$|E
5000|$|An unusual {{development}} was {{the installation of}} the European market 1-litre [...] "EJ" [...] engine in the Mira Gino 1000, presented in August 2002. This version no longer fit into the Kei class because of its larger engine, and was also marginally longer and wider due to the installation of bumper overriders and <b>fender</b> <b>trim.</b> The bigger engine produced , the same as a turbocharged 660 cc engine, but offered considerably more power at lower engine speeds. 1,290 of the Gino 1000 had been built when production of the first generation came to an end in June 2004. The Gino 1000 was effectively replaced by the 1-litre Daihatsu Boon.|$|E
50|$|The Mitsubishi Pajero Junior is a mini SUV {{produced}} by Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors between October 1995 and June 1998 for the Japanese domestic market only. Based on a lengthened Minica platform, {{it was a}} larger version of the Mitsubishi Pajero Mini, a kei car. The biggest visual difference from the Pajero Mini is the wide <b>fender</b> <b>trims</b> and wider tyres, giving it a more purposeful appearance. It did benefit from moderate ownership costs to Japanese buyers, due to the exterior dimension being within the favorable compact size class according to Japanese Government dimension regulations, and the small displacement engine obligated a minimal annual road tax.|$|R
2500|$|Harley-Davidson FL [...] "big twins" [...] {{normally}} had {{heavy steel}} <b>fenders,</b> chrome <b>trim,</b> and other ornate and heavy accessories. After World War II, riders wanting more speed would often shorten the fenders or {{take them off}} completely to reduce {{the weight of the}} motorcycle. These bikes were called [...] "bobbers" [...] or sometimes [...] "choppers" [...] because parts considered unnecessary were chopped off. Those who made or rode choppers and bobbers, especially members of outlaw bike gangs like the Hells Angels, referred to stock FLs as [...] "garbage wagons".|$|R
50|$|For 1961, the Meteor was a {{full-sized}} model, differentiated {{from the}} Monterey through its trim and taillights. Meteor 600 taillights were oblong, while the Meteor 800 and upmarket Monterey used six circular tail lights, three on each side. Meteor 600s, available only as two- and four-door sedans, featured chrome spears from the taillights {{to the front}} wheels. Meteor 800s, available in two- and four-door sedan and hardtop body styles, featured the spear and three chrome bars on the front fenders, chrome <b>fender</b> fin <b>trim,</b> rocker panel trim and back-up lights.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the market}} {{segments}} expanded as manufacturers offered {{a wide variety}} of pick-up truck types and sizes. With the dawn of the extended cab, trucks began taking on a more urban appeal and were being purchased for their style as well as their utility. This new audience of truck owner began to demand more than a simple tool box to adorn their trucks. They began developing an appetite for accessories that would complement the look of their truck and manufacturers began to accommodate their desires with products like billet grilles, chrome <b>fender</b> <b>trim,</b> nerf bars and hood deflectors. In addition, truck manufacturers began collaborating with and designing their vehicles to easily accommodate these accessories with bolt-on ease.|$|E
5000|$|Fender flares {{are used}} on SUVs, pickup trucks, {{off-road}} vehicles, and sport cars. They either {{come with a}} vehicle as a standard equipment or added afterwards as an aftermarket accessory. Fender flares are often made of fiberglass or ABS plastic to ensure flexibility and light weight, however some trucks and SUVs come with metal fender flares to ensure better durability. There are 3 common styles of fender flares: OE style (Narrow flares with smooth surface), bolt-on (wider fender flares with exposed bolts) and Cut-Out (oversized flares that require a <b>fender</b> <b>trim).</b> The most important characteristic of a fender flare is the width as it shows the tire coverage. Common fender flares are 1"- 8" [...] wide.|$|E

New wider and lower bodies were offered and [...] "Airfoil" [...] front fenders that flowed into the lines of the rear fenders were introduced on convertibles and sedanet models. The Super had new front <b>fender</b> <b>trim</b> featuring parallel chrome strips. Also featured for 1942 was a handsome new grille with a lower outline and thin vertical strips. A feature shared with other Buicks was a new interior air intake positioned near the front center grille that eliminated the old cowl-level ventilator. The number of body styles was reduced to three with the elimination of the one year only Business coupe.|$|E

2500|$|... 1978 was the Corvette's twenty fifth anniversary, and all 78's {{featured}} silver anniversary {{nose and}} fuel door emblems. A new fastback rear window {{was the most}} dramatic and noticeable styling change, giving the ten-year-old C3 Corvette body style a fresh lease on life. The fixed-glass fastback benefited both aerodynamics and increased the usable luggage space behind the seats while improving rearward visibility in the bargain. A shade was installed that could be pulled forward to cover the rear compartment to protect cargo and carpet against the unrelenting sun. The tachometer and speedometer were redesigned to match the new “aircraft styled” center console and gauge cluster first seen the previous year. Redesigned interior door panels were also new {{as well as an}} actual glove box was added in front of the passenger seat, replacing the map pockets of previous years. Available options now included power door locks, a power antenna, dual rear speakers and a CB radio. The optional convenience group, introduced the previous year, now included intermittent (delay) wipers, floor mats, and the passenger side vanity mirror was an upgraded illuminated unit. The base L-48 engine generated Those destined for California or high altitude areas produced [...] Gone was the chrome-plated ignition shielding over the distributor, replaced with a metal-lined black plastic unit. The single-snorkel air intake used since 1976 was changed to a dual-snorkel set-up on L-82 equipped cars helping to boost that output to [...] L-82 engines were also now fitted with an aluminum intake manifold which saved 24pounds compared to the cast iron unit of previous years. The Corvette converted to metric tires with the P225/70R15 as standard. Wider P255/60R15 tires were available as an option and required <b>fender</b> <b>trimming</b> from the factory for clearance. The fuel tank capacity increased from 17 gal to 24 gal on all cars. To make room for the larger tank, a smaller (P195/80D15) space saver spare tire was utilized.|$|R

50|$|The Ranger's base trim {{appointments}} included arm rests, {{a cigarette}} lighter, rear-view mirror, two coat hangers and black rubber floor mats. On the exterior, Rangers received chrome around the {{rear quarter panel}} cove molding. Two-tone paint was also optional. The main visual cue {{that makes it possible}} {{to tell the difference between}} most Rangers and the upmarket Pacer was the lack of stainless trim on the front doors and fenders. A very rare, optional, Ranger-only door trim was available from dealers early in the model year to be used together with the Pacer <b>fender</b> <b>trim.</b> A basic heater (as a US$92 option) and radio (at US$95) were available, and air conditioning was optional as well (at $417), along with seat belts, warning lights, automatic trunk opener, and rear door child safety lock covers.|$|E
50|$|In 1956 {{there was}} a new grille, with finer {{textured}} insert, and the repositioning of the parking lights in the bumpers, below the wing guards. Buyers were given an option of the standard satin finish grille or an optional gold finish. Cadillac script was found on the left side. A narrow chrome molding and nine vertical louvers were seen. Side trim was about the same as in 1955, except for the addition of exhaust extension moldings on the rear <b>fender.</b> The <b>trim</b> ran long a tapering conical flare from above the wheel housing to the rear bumper. A Fleetwood script appeared on the deck lid and limousine styling was seen again. Both the sedan and the limousine had auxiliary seats and the Imperial limousine again featured a glass driver's partition. Standard equipment was comparable to the previous year. The engine was stroked to 365 cuin L for 285 or 305 hp (213 or 227 kW) in 1956.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{features}} {{intended for}} the new generation were delayed until 1965, when front disc brakes became standard equipment and sequential turn signals which flashed three bulbs in the broad, horizontal tail lights from inside to outside were added; the latter had been delayed by vehicle lighting regulations in U.S. states. Exterior trim was revised, including a new grille, Thunderbird emblem replacing the block letters on {{the front edge of}} the hood, simulated front <b>fender</b> vent <b>trim,</b> revised Thunderbird scripts now located on the rear edge of the 1/4 panels, and revised taillight lens trim and center emblem replacing the lens Birds and block letters respectively. The popular [...] "Tilt-Away" [...] steering column continued, and was a Thunderbird recognized feature that was later shared on other upper-level Ford Products.

50|$|While the Ambassador {{had been}} offered only with Nash's in-line eight from mid-1932 to 1935, the 1936 Ambassador Six added Nash's largest in-line six as well, in a 121 in {{wheelbase}} model, {{formerly known as the}} Advanced Six. In 1937 Nash acquired the Kelvinator Corporation as part of a deal that allowed Charlie Nash's handpicked successor, George W. Mason, to become President of the new Nash-Kelvinator Corporation. The 1937 models saw the return of coupes and convertibles to the Ambassador lines. From 1936 onward, the senior Nash models used identical bodies, relying on a longer wheelbase, hood and front <b>fenders</b> (plus subtle <b>trim</b> augmentations) to provide visual cues to differentiate the more expensive Eights from the less expensive Six models.|$|R
50|$|The Custom {{nameplate}} reappeared in 1964, {{once again}} on the economy line of models. As in 1957-1958, the Custom range consisted of two series: a base Custom range and a slightly-better trimmed Custom 500 series. Most Customs were sold to police and taxi fleets during the 1960s, although anyone who wanted basic, no-frills transportation with the convenience of a full-sized car could purchase one, while the Custom 500 was more geared toward budget-conscious buyers who wanted a low-cost automobile but not a stripped model. Generally, the Custom 500 models were differentiated from their less-expensive stable mates by a chrome <b>trim</b> <b>fender</b> strip, roof drip moldings, carpeting (although by the late 1960s, even base Customs had carpeting), a somewhat upgraded cloth-and-vinyl upholstery and minor convenience items.|$|R
5000|$|For 1957, a tubular X-frame without {{side rails}} was adopted. This {{resulted}} in lower body without {{a loss of}} usable space. Front end styling was marked by rubber bumper guard tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the standard 62 models were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal wind slits. At the upper end this <b>fender</b> brake <b>trim</b> joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both taillamps. A crest medallion was seen on the forward angled rear fins. De Villes had special nameplates on the front fenders. Series 62 Eldorados (as distinct from the Series 70 Eldorado Brougham) were further distinguished by the model name above a V-shaped rear deck ornament and on the front fenders. The rear fender and deck contour was trimmed with broad, sculptured stainless steel beauty panels. Also seen were [...] "shark" [...] style fins pointing towards {{the back of the}} cars. A three section built in front bumper was another exclusive trait of the Series 62 Eldorados, which came with a long list of standard features. A new body style was added to the subseries, a 4-door Eldorado Sedan Seville, but only four were actually sold, and it was cancelled the following year.|$|R
