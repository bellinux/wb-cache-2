40|$|The {{problem of}} nonlinear, steady state {{magnetic}} reconnection in <b>incompressible</b> <b>plasmas</b> is considered. A self-consistent treatment is developed which allows a formal analytic {{solution of the}} resistive induction equation, valid for all sub-Alfvénic velocity fields. This solution relates the velocity stream function to the global magnetic field structure and highlights several key properties of the resistive system. In particular, the field lines are isobars of uniform current density and characteristics of the velocity stream function. The impact of this analysis on "fast" magnetic reconnection is then considered. Despite strong constraints on the flow topology - no separatrix flows are allowed - fast, nonlinear models can be developed self-consistently. It is shown that the reconnection rate is maintained against reductions in the plasma restrictivity by the increasing amplitude but decreasing width of the current layer aligned to the separatrix. It is concluded that "open" flow topologies allow fast reconnection to continue under conditions which lead to stalling in "closed" or periodic geometries...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{radiative}} energy loss on {{the stability of}} compressible plasma in coronal loops is studied. By taking the limit as poloidal wavenumber m approaches infinity, stability conditions for local modes are derived. It {{was found that the}} radiation effect can trigger MHD instabilities of coronal loops which are in ideally marginally stable states. Compressibility is a stabilizing effect for ideal MHD local modes because the compression of magnetic field lines exerts a restoring force by increasing magnetic pressure. Compression of plasma induces two modes in a radiatively unstable plasma, magnetosonic and condensation modes. Compressibility affects the stability of ideally stable (or unstable) coronal plasmas through magnetosonic modes, which are a stabilizing (destabilizing) effect for ideally stable (unstable) plasmas. For coronal plasmas in ideally marginally stable states, condensation as well as magnetosonic modes can trigger MHD instability. Because of these two modes, the effect of radiation on compressible coronal plasmas is more destabilizing than it is on <b>incompressible</b> <b>plasmas</b> when the plasmas are in ideal MHD unstable or marginally stable states...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} current sheet {{formation}} {{in the vicinity of}} three-dimensional (3 D) magnetic null points is investigated. The particular focus is upon the effect of the compressibility of the plasma on the qualitative and quantitative properties of the current sheet. An initially potential 3 D null is subjected to shearing perturbations, as in a previous paper [Pontin et al., Phys. Plasmas, in press (2007) ]. It is found that as the incompressible limit is approached, the collapse of the null point is suppressed, and an approximately planar current sheet aligned to the fan plane is present instead. This is the case regardless of whether the spine or fan of the null is sheared. Both the peak current and peak reconnection rate are reduced. The results have a bearing on previous analytical solutions for steady-state reconnection in <b>incompressible</b> <b>plasmas,</b> implying that fan current sheet solutions are dynamically accessible, while spine current sheet solutions are not.

40|$|The radial, oscillatory {{motion of}} the Earth's {{magnetopause}} {{has been found to}} occur predominantly with some distinct, sometimes called "magic" frequencies, which have been attributed to magnetospheric wave guide modes, typical solar wind variations or, more recently, surface waves on the magnetopause standing between the northern and southern ionospheres. In this paper we present {{for the first time a}} derivation of these surface waves, denominated as Kruskal-Schwarzschild-modes (KS-modes), in the approximation of the ideal, single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic theory for <b>incompressible</b> <b>plasmas.</b> The calculations are performed in the simplified geometry of the box magnetosphere with the magnetopause being a plane between two plasma regimes of homogeneous conditions. The reflection of the KS-modes at the ionospheres is being discussed. Under the given assumptions and realistic conditions the validity of the calculations is shown to be limited to cases of parallel or anti-parallel background magnetic fields on both sides of the magnetopause, respectively. For these cases a detailed discussion of the mode structure is presented. The magnetopause when affected by a KS-mode is found to resemble a membrane under tension with respect to its motion; the ionospheres act as supporting points of the membrane and the KS-modes correspond in this picture to their eigenmodes of oscillation. Localized pressure enhancements in the magnetosheath are discussed as possible excitation mechanism for the KS-modes...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic fields play an {{important}} role in astrophysical accretion discs, and in the interstellar and intergalactic medium. They drive jets, suppress fragmentation in star-forming clouds and can have a significant impact on the accretion rate of stars. However, the exact amplification mechanisms of cosmic magnetic fields remain relatively poorly understood. Here I start by reviewing recent advances in the numerical and theoretical modelling of the 'turbulent dynamo', which may explain the origin of galactic and inter-galactic magnetic fields. While dynamo action was previously investigated in great detail for <b>incompressible</b> <b>plasmas,</b> I here place particular emphasis on highly compressible astrophysical plasmas, which are characterised by strong density fluctuations and shocks, such as the interstellar medium. I find that dynamo action works not only in subsonic plasmas, but also in highly supersonic, compressible plasmas, as well as for low and high magnetic Prandtl numbers. I further present new numerical simulations from which I determine the growth of the turbulent (un-ordered) magnetic field component (B_turb) in the presence of weak and strong guide fields (B_ 0). I vary B_ 0 over 5 orders of magnitude and find that the dependence of B_turb on B_ 0 is relatively weak, and can be explained with a simple theoretical model in which the turbulence provides the energy to amplify B_turb. Finally, I discuss some important implications of magnetic fields for the structure of accretion discs, the launching of jets, and the star formation rate of interstellar clouds.

An analytical model of steady-state magnetic reconnection in a collisionless <b>incompressible</b> <b>plasma</b> is developed using the electron Hall MHD approximation. It is shown that the initial complicated system of equations may split into a system of independent equations, and the solution of the problem is based on the Grad-Shafranov equation for the magnetic potential. The results of the analytical study are further compared with a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of reconnection. It is shown that both methods demonstrate a close agreement in the electron current and the magnetic and electric field structures obtained.

Equilibrium configurations for certain values of the integration constants are displayed. Examination of their characteristics in connection with the impact of nonlinearity and sheared flow indicates that these equilibria are consistent with the L-H transition phenomenology. For flows parallel to the magnetic field one equilibrium corresponding to the H-state is potentially stable in the sense that a sufficient condition for linear stability is satisfied in an appreciable part of the plasma while another solution corresponding to the L-state does not satisfy the condition. The results indicate that the sheared flow in conjunction with the equilibrium nonlinearity play a stabilizing role. Comment: 26 pages, 16 figure...|$|E
