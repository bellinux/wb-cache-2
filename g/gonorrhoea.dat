Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression.

5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and <b>gonorrhoea.</b> As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

Original and test-of-cure N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> culture isolates were compared using antibiotic susceptibility testing and N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> multiantigen sequence typing. Results. One hundred seventy-eight cases of pharyngeal N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> infection and 97 cases of pharyngeal C. trachomatis infection were identified, primarily by culture methods. The mean incidence was 1. 62 and 0. 81 cases per 1000 visits per year for N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> and C. trachomatis infection, respectively.

The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set of surgical tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of <b>gonorrhoea,</b> and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E
5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for <b>gonorrhoea.</b> Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E

40|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs) for {{the detection}} of Neisseria <b>gonorrhoeae</b> became available in the early 1990 s. Although offering several advantages over traditional detection methods, N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> NAATs do have some limitations. These include cost, risk of carryover contamination, inhibition, and inability to provide antibiotic resistance data. In addition, there are sequence-related limitations that are unique to N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> NAATs. In particular, false-positive results are a major consideration. These primarily stem from the frequent horizontal genetic exchange occurring within the Neisseria genus, leading to commensal Neisseria species acquiring N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> genes. Furthermore, some N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> subtypes may lack specific sequences targeted by a particular NAAT. Therefore, NAAT false-negative results because of sequence variation may occur in some gonococcal populations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plasmid-mediated and chromosomal-mediated {{resistance}} of Neisseria <b>gonorrhoeae</b> to penicillin, tetracycline, thiamphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has spread dramatically in Africa. Monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility {{is a key}} element in the control of sexually transmitted diseases. GOAL: To document antimicrobial susceptibilities of gonococci isolated during the past 15 years in Kigali, Rwanda. STUDY DESIGN: Minimal inhibitory concentrations of recently collected gonococcal isolates of eight antimicrobials were determined. The results were compared with data collected for isolates obtained since 1986. RESULTS: In 1986, 35 % of the gonococcal isolates were penicillinase-producing N <b>gonorrhoeae.</b> Tetracycline-resistant N <b>gonorrhoeae</b> appeared in 1989. The prevalence of penicillinase-producing N <b>gonorrhoeae</b> and tetracycline-resistant N <b>gonorrhoeae</b> increased significantly to 70. 5 % and 89. 2 %, respectively. Chromosomal resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, and thiamphenicol increased temporarily, then decreased significantly. Chromosomal resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appeared in 1988 and increased to 21. 6 %. All the isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin, and kanamycin. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated the rapidly increasing frequencies of penicillinase-producing N <b>gonorrhoeae</b> and tetracycline-resistant N <b>gonorrhoeae.</b> Chromosomal resistance to thiamphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole excludes these drugs as alternative treatment.

40|$|Neisseria <b>gonorrhoeae</b> is {{the second}} most common sexually {{transmitted}} bacterial pathogen worldwide. Diseases associated with N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> cause localized inflammation of the urethra and cervix. Despite this inflammatory response, infected individuals do not develop protective adaptive immune responses to N. <b>gonorrhoeae.</b> N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> is a highly adapted pathogen that has acquired multiple mechanisms to evade its host's immune system, including the ability to manipulate multiple immune signaling pathways. N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> has previously been shown to engage immunosuppressive signaling pathways in B and T lymphocytes. We have now found that N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> also suppresses adaptive immune responses through effects on antigen presenting cells. Using primary, murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and lymphocytes, we show that N. gonorrhoeae-exposed dendritic cells fail to elicit antigen-induced CD 4 + T lymphocyte proliferation. N. <b>gonorrhoeae</b> exposure leads to upregulation of a number of secreted and dendritic cell surface proteins with immunosuppressive properties, particularly Interleukin 10 (IL- 10) and Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L 1).
