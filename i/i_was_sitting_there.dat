It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
500|$|Paul Rothchild, {{producer}} of The Doors' first five albums, recalled the elation that an American musician {{had made a}} record that successfully challenged {{the primacy of the}} British Invasion groups. He said, [...] "What I realized when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> is that one of US—one of the so-called Village hipsters—was making music that could compete with THEM—the Beatles, and the Stones, and the Dave Clark Five—without sacrificing any of the integrity of folk music or the power of rock'n'roll." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
5000|$|Jenny Meagher from Music Feeds {{gave the}} album 4 out of 5 saying: [...] "I <b>am</b> certain had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> {{watching}} this show live at the Enmore Theatre, I would have shed a tear. [...] " ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{had come}} back to New York, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> staying in my old room at my parents' house. Artie was living at his parents' house, too. I {{remember}} Artie and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in my car one night, parked on a street in Queens, and the announcer the radio said, [...] "Number one, Simon & Garfunkel." [...] And Artie said to me, [...] "That Simon & Garfunkel, they must be having a great time." [...] Because there we were on a street corner my car in Queens, smoking a joint. We didn't {{know what to do with}} ourselves.|$|R
2500|$|Douglas Brinkley {{called the}} speech {{a turning point}} in the Obama presidency. [...] "It was his most {{important}} speech so far, one that history is going to reflect on," [...] said Brinkley. [...] "There was a bit of Dr. King to him.

2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
2500|$|Last Train to Paris {{is officially}} {{credited}} to Diddy – Dirty Money. The group was formed when Diddy asked former Danity Kane member, Dawn Richard, and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper to perform alongside {{him on the}} album. In an interview with All Hip-Hop, Diddy said that Dirty Money is [...] "not about no drug money, illegal money, or anything negative". Instead he described it as [...] "a sound, a movement, [...] a crew", something fresh and unique for his new album. He explained that [...] "he wanted to tell a love story" [...] but needed Dirty Money because [...] "he couldn’t just tell the male’s point of view." [...] Further elaborating on the group's name, Diddy told Slant Magazine that its origins are dated back to 2005 when the group was at [...] "a strip club in Jacksonville, Florida, during the Super Bowl. People heard I was there, {{and all of a}} sudden so many people came in that I had to rush outside to my truck. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> with a bunch of money and I was like, 'Damn, this is some dirty money.' A light bulb went off that day." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly described the group's role on the album as [...] "fleshing out Last Trains skeletal storyline, playing jealous lovers, disappointed partners, and commanding divas to his conflicted playboy." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News said that Dirty Money [...] "sing loudly, often and well -- a good thing", on the disk. [...] Henry Yanney of Soulculture said that Last Train to Paris was vocally-led Harper and Richard, who give the album [...] "attitude and style". He said [...] "the duo sing harmoniously and break into solos with much precision and pace, remaining in sync at all times with the abrasive club influenced beats on hand." [...] David Jeffries said that at times Dirty Money came off as [...] "fine background singers or part of Diddy’s Fashion Week posse." [...] Matt Sayles disagreed, stating that on the record, [...] "Diddy takes a backseat" [...] which allowed [...] "Kaleena and Dawn to do a lot of the heavy lifting (and breathing) on a wide range of songs." [...] Dirty Money was inspired by the 1980s bands Soul II Soul and Loose Ends though Diddy pointed out that he [...] "wanted to flip things" [...] by having two girls and one guy in the band. [...] "Two bad divas, one for the left and one for the right side of me". He told Amos Barshad from New York that [...] " [...] diamonds in the rough. These girls got a certain flavor and swagger, which is rare in this marketplace." ...|$|E

The blasts were booming from all hills--the men were going home with their dinner-pails flashing red in the setting sun's light. It was terrible to think of them going home to supper. It seemed impossible that <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> starving, and the grass so green, the sunset so beautiful.

5000|$|Etienne noted when he {{received}} the appointment.

We had to play phone tag. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> up at the family farm with a chain saw, working in the woods. And, when he called, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just getting out of my pickup truck. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in my Carhart jeans and in my work boots, and had nothing to take notes with. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in my truck listening to him tell me that I've just been named bishop.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> one evening, {{about six}} o'clock, over {{a glass of}} that {{gorgeous}} Burgundy which he kept behind a pile of black-letter folios; he was striding about the room, fingering, after a habit of his, {{one of the great}} swords in his collection; the red glare of the strong fire struck his square features and his fierce grey hair; his blue eyes were even unusually full of dreams, and he had opened his mouth to speak dreamily, when the door was flung open, and a pale, fiery man, with red hair and a huge furred overcoat, swung himself panting into the room.|$|E
60|$|I {{was at home}} at {{that hour}} and writing in my study; and {{although}} my French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those days {{to look up at}} the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> visible to me had I only looked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thanked him}} and went out. I walked {{about all that}} night; for I couldn't think of {{anything}} to do or anywhere to go. In the morning I slept on a seat in one of the squares. Then I thought I would go to the Gallerien; and I spent the whole day looking at the pictures. When the Galleries were shut I was very tired, so I went into a cafe, and had some beer. When I came out I sat on the same seat in the Square. I meant to wait till dark and then walk out of the city and take the train at some little station, but while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> I went to sleep. A policeman woke me. He had my wig in his hand.|$|E
