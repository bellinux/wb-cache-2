25|$|The 3rd Cavalry Regiment {{was formed}} in {{beginning}} of 1967 when, {{as a result of}} a re-organisation of the units of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, the 1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron which was serving in Vietnam at the time, was renamed as 'A' Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment. At the same time 'B' Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment {{was formed in}} Australia to provide a <b>follow-on</b> <b>force</b> and relieve 'A' Squadron at the end of their tour. Equipped with the M113A1 armoured personnel carriers (APCs), its initial strength in Vietnam was 10 officers and 107 men. Both 'A' and 'B' Squadrons of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment would continue this extensive service throughout the remainder of Australia's involvement in Vietnam as part of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF), with a squadron of the regiment operating there for nearly the next six years.|$|E
25|$|The 3rd NZ Division's {{operations}} on Vella Lavella ran from 21 September to 9 October 1943. The Americans had {{landed on the}} island in August, establishing a beachhead in the south. The division's 14th Brigade Group, under Brigadier Leslie Potter, landed at the US base a month later as a <b>follow-on</b> <b>force.</b> Upon arrival, they were given the task of clearing the remaining Japanese forces from {{the north of the}} island so that it could be used to establish a radar station and a motor torpedo boat base. The New Zealanders were outnumbered by the defenders, nevertheless, they had been well trained and this training ultimately led to their success. The 35th and 37th Battalions were dispatched along with supporting elements on two axes of advance: one up the east coast, the other up the west. The tactic proved successful and by early October the Japanese defenders were caught in a small pocket by the two New Zealand forces, having killed between 200 and 300 Japanese. Potter, however, failed to capitalise on the situation and due to overcaution the remaining 589 Japanese were able to escape the island on the night of 6/7 October aboard ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Total New Zealand casualties in this operation were 32 killed and 32 wounded.|$|E

Although Perry had said earlier that they would leave Bosnia within a year, in June 1996 he hinted at a longer stay if NATO decided the peace in Bosnia would not hold without them. The secretary agreed to a study proposed in September 1996 by NATO defense ministers for a <b>follow-on</b> <b>force</b> to replace IFOR. Finally in November 1996, after the presidential election, Clinton announced, with Perry's support, that the United States would provide 8,500 troops to a NATO <b>follow-on</b> <b>force.</b> The U.S. force would be gradually reduced in 1997 and 1998 and completely withdrawn by June 1998.|$|E

On 20 June 1998, Joint Guard ended and the Stabilization Force transitioned to a slightly smaller <b>follow-on</b> <b>force,</b> and was renamed Operation Joint Forge. The 86th AW, with augmentation support from active duty, Air National Guard and Reserve units from the United States, successfully sustained this effort by delivering US Army and Air Force peacekeeping forces and equipment into the area. By 31 December 2000, the 86th AW and its supporting units had transported over 48,000 tons of cargo and 111,164 personnel into, around and out of the theater of operations.|$|E

On 15 November 1943, Major General John S. Wood who commanded the 4th Armored Division, announced that the 4th Armored Division would deploy overseas. On 11 December 1943, the 4th Armored Division moved northeast by train, unloading at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts, on 20 December 1943 for winter training. The 4th AD sailed from the Boston Port of Embarkation on 29 December 1943. They arrived in England for more training on 8 January 1944, and - after getting used to the local environment, and waiting for the D-Day invasion success at Normandy on 6 June, they proceeded to France on 11 July 1944 as part of the <b>follow-on</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

2500|$|GMV {{is meant}} to be light and fast and deliver {{soldiers}} from a drop zone far from enemy air defenses or indirect fire systems. Five vehicles would carry a platoon headquarters, three rifle squads, and a weapons squad. The vehicle is seen as a [...] "21st century jeep" [...] to move troops around during an initial attack faster than the enemy can counter them with heavy weapons. Both the GMV and LRV are to replace sling-loaded Humvees in this role (but not for other units). Interest in the effort is expected on the scale of the U.S. Special Operations Command program to replace the Ground Mobility Vehicle, which also sought to replace a Humvee-based vehicle with a lighter and more air-mobile design. Airborne infantry brigades would use the vehicles to rush forces from their airborne insertion point to seize an objective, which would become a forward airfield for reinforcing and deploying heavier <b>follow-on</b> <b>forces.</b> After <b>follow-on</b> <b>forces</b> arrive and set up positions, the ULCV would not be as useful, but could potentially allow troops to operate for up to a week without support.|$|R

5000|$|... 1st BN, 44th Air Defense Artillery RegimentAs stated above, the Turkish {{situation}} {{kept the}} division {{from participating in}} the invasion as originally planned, instead joining the fight as a <b>follow-on</b> <b>force.</b> After quickly organizing materiel and manpower at ports in Kuwait, the division moved to positions around Baghdad in April 2003. After all divisional assets were established in Iraq, the Brigade combat teams attacked selected areas. The main avenues of attack for the division pushed north through Tikrit and Mosul. Headquartered in Saddam Hussein's former palaces, the 4th ID was deployed in the northern area of the Sunni Triangle. The 4th Infantry Division was spread all over Northern Iraq from Kirkuk to the Iranian border and {{as far south as}} Al Wihda, southeast of Baghdad. The Division Headquarters was located at FOB Ironhorse in the old Saddam Presidential Complex in Tikrit while the 1st Brigade Combat Team headquarters was at FOB Raider south of the city. To the south in the volatile Diyala Province was the 2nd Brigade Combat Team headquarters at FOB Warhorse just northeast of Baqubah and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team at FOB Anaconda at the Balad Air Base northwest of Khalis. To the far north stationed at an air field just {{on the outskirts of the}} city of Kirkuk were elements of the division's 4th Artillery Brigade and attached units until mid-September when it was moved back to Tikrit. The 4th Infantry Division also disarmed the MEK warriors in Northern Iraq in July-August 2003.|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of British landing craft in the Second World War, in an opposed landing, saw the {{disembarkation}} of French Foreign Legionnaires of the 13th Demi-Brigade and supporting French Hotchkiss H39 tanks {{on the beach at}} Bjerkvik, eight miles (13 km) above Narvik, on 13 May during the Norwegian campaign. The army commander, Général de brigade Antoine Béthouart, responsible for capturing the area north of Rombaksfjorden, realized that a landing behind German lines, in Herjangsfjorden, a part of Ofotfjorden north of Narvik was required to force the enemy to retire. The plan agreed involved a pre-landing naval bombardment, followed by the landing of three tanks - two from MLCs, and one from the new LCM(1), then the landing of an initial wave of infantry from LCAs, and lastly a <b>follow-on</b> <b>force</b> carried in barges and towed by motor torpedo boats. On 12 May, at about 23:40, Royal Navy destroyers commenced a bombardment of the town intending to destroy all buildings on the foreshore. The plan became somewhat frustrated by the slow deployment of the MLCs (and their tank cargoes), from the davits of the battleship Resolution, then serving as their transport ship. The LCAs landed after the LCM(1) had delivered a tank to the beach. The LCA crews manoeuvred their craft in the small hamlet to the vest of the village of Bjerkvik, the intended landing place, and under a slight rise in the ground in order to spare the soldiers casualties from opposing machine gun fire. Although touchdown was {{in the early hours of}} the new day the midnight sun illuminated the battle-field. Once ashore, the 13e DBLE's companies deployed to seize the high ground to the north and south of the town.|$|E
