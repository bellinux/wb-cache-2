5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride <b>dieldrin</b> was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, <b>dieldrin</b> and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|Many {{attempted}} {{methods of}} eradicating meat ants have proven unsuccessful. The first investigations {{were made in}} the 1930s to control meat ant populations in urban areas by fumigation, using carbon disulfide and calcium cyanide. Although these methods successfully eradicated some nests, they were rapidly reoccupied by those living in satellite or rival nests. However, the reoccupation of these nests by incipient colonies (young colonies beginning to develop) does not occur. This is because colony founding is often difficult and rare when most areas are nested by mature colonies. This behaviour has led to long-term maintenance and repeated treatments to ensure the nests are not resettled. In addition, not all nests can be treated, and some may remain undetected from pest controllers. In 1973, Greaves notes that the poor penetration of insecticides into all nest galleries may be the reason why nests are reoccupied, but owing to the nest structure, the insecticides have to be poured into each individual hole as no gallery connects to one another. Missing a single gallery can mostly lead to the reoccupation of the nest site. Greaves concludes that <b>dieldrin</b> is the most effective insecticide to control meat ants, capable of killing the ants quickly and being the most long-lasting chemical used.|$|E
25|$|In general, tissue residue {{approaches}} {{are used for}} chemicals that bioaccumulate or for bioaccumulative chemicals. The majority of these substances are organic compounds that are not easily metabolized by organisms and have long environmental persistence. Examples of these chemicals include: polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, furans, biphenyls, DDT and its metabolites, and <b>dieldrin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also in the 1950s and 1960s, 40% of all U.S. {{pesticide}} exports went to Central America. Nicaragua and {{its neighbors}} widely used compounds banned in the U.S., such as DDT, endrin, <b>dieldrin</b> and lindane. In 1977 a study revealed that mothers living in León had 45 times more DDT in their breast milk than the World Health Organization safe level.|$|E
25|$|As of 2008, {{the organic}} {{contaminants}} monitored by Mussel Watch included 51 PCB congeners (out {{of a possible}} 209), 65 PAHs, DDT, butyltin, chlordane, and <b>dieldrin.</b> A complete list is available at http://NSandT.noaa.gov. Most of the organic contaminants monitored by Mussel Watch have an anthropogenic source, with PAHs being an exception as they are derived from both natural processes and anthropogenic sources. PCB congeners were selected based off a list of criteria including that the chosen congeners are already being measured by other scientific organizations. Organic contaminants can be compared across all sites and all species used by Mussel Watch.|$|E
25|$|A further {{issue is}} {{industrial}} and metropolitan waste from early-established landfills and waste-emitting factories {{on the banks}} of the river. These include an unlined waste dump at Horotiu, just downriver from Hamilton, whose leachates include persistent organic pollutants such as <b>dieldrin</b> in quantities toxic to freshwater marine life. The 2002 GHD report saw new regulations put in place to make industries comply with a new bylaw which stops hazardous substances entering the water system at all according to the HCC website. In 2002 dead eels were found in a tributary of the river when a container of pesticides and other chemicals was apparently illegally dumped. The chemicals were diluted when they entered the much bigger Waikato River. The harmful effect was temporary.|$|E
25|$|Three {{recent studies}} by the Washington Department of Ecology showed that toxic {{chemicals}} banned decades ago continue to linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish collected from 45 sites. The toxic substances included PCBs; dioxins, two chlorinated pesticides, DDE and <b>dieldrin,</b> and PBDEs. As {{a result of the}} study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the Washington State Department of Health is advising the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also indicated high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.|$|E
500|$|Studies {{conducted}} by DEQ, USGS, the City of Gresham, {{and other public}} agencies have identified DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane), <b>dieldrin,</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), chlordane, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as carcinogenic pollutants of Johnson Creek. The creek has been classified as a [...] "waterbody of concern" [...] by the DEQ because of elevated levels of copper, chromium, and nickel in water and sediments. Generally, metal concentrations increase downstream.|$|E
500|$|M. inquilina is {{the only}} species in its genus to be listed as [...] "vulnerable" [...] by the IUCN Red List. This, however, needs updating. Habitat loss may be {{responsible}} for the ant to be potentially endangered; Douglas and Brown note that a contamination of <b>dieldrin</b> spray to control the argentine ant destroyed many nests housing M. inquilina, and burn-offs are also a threat to colonies housing M. inquilina.|$|E
500|$|The {{large scale}} use of {{insecticides}} in agricultural crops effectively controlled the pest {{until it became}} resistant to DDT in 1952 and <b>dieldrin</b> in 1958. Insecticides remain the main method of pest control on commercial farms. However, many chemicals are often unsuccessful when used against this pest because of the beetle's ability to rapidly develop insecticide resistance. Different populations in different geographic regions have, between them, developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide, although not every population is resistant to every chemical. The species {{as a whole has}} evolved resistance to 56 different chemical insecticides. The mechanisms used include improved metabolism of the chemicals, reduced sensitivity of target sites, less penetration and greater excretion [...] of the pesticides, as well as some changes in the behavior of the beetles.|$|E
500|$|By 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} by Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ants on Trial; Carson characterized it as [...] "flagrant propaganda" [...] that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially <b>dieldrin</b> and heptachlor) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington Post, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations—in her words, the [...] "silencing of birds"—to pesticide overuse. That was also {{the year of the}} [...] "Great Cranberry Scandal": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible [...] "financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} EPA {{evaluation of}} the site stated that the onsite samples originally tested contained di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, <b>dieldrin,</b> pentachlorophenol, and PCBs. Other samples contained lead, cadmium and ammonia. The ASTDR Public Health report stated: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dieldrin</b> is an {{organochloride}} originally {{produced in}} 1948 by J. Hyman & Co, Denver, as an insecticide. <b>Dieldrin</b> {{is closely related}} to aldrin, which reacts further to form <b>dieldrin.</b> Aldrin is not toxic to insects; it is oxidized in the insect to form <b>dieldrin</b> which is the active compound. Both <b>dieldrin</b> and aldrin are named after the Diels-Alder reaction which is used to form aldrin from a mixture of norbornadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dieldrin,</b> a {{pesticide}} used {{to control}} termites, textile pests, insect-borne diseases and insects living in agricultural soils. In soil and insects, aldrin can be oxidized, resulting in rapid conversion to <b>dieldrin.</b> Dieldrin’s half-life is approximately five years. <b>Dieldrin</b> is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic animals, particularly frogs, whose embryos can develop spinal deformities after exposure to low levels. <b>Dieldrin</b> {{has been linked to}} Parkinson's disease, breast cancer, and classified as immunotoxic, neurotoxic, with endocrine disrupting capacity. <b>Dieldrin</b> residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals. Human exposure to <b>dieldrin</b> primarily derives from food.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemicals}} <b>dieldrin</b> and aldrin {{were widely}} applied in agricultural areas throughout the world. Both are toxic and bioaccumulative. Aldrin does break down to <b>dieldrin</b> in living systems, but <b>dieldrin</b> {{is known to}} resist bacterial and chemical breakdown processes in the environment.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{developed}} in the 1940s {{as an alternative to}} DDT, <b>dieldrin</b> proved to be a highly effective insecticide and was very widely used during the 1950s to early 1970s. Endrin is a stereoisomer of <b>dieldrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|IPCS quotes the World Health Organization as stating <b>dieldrin</b> is {{prohibited}} {{for use in}} agriculture in, among others, Brazil, Ecuador, Finland, the German Democratic Republic, Singapore, Sweden, Yugoslavia, and the USSR. The European Community legislation prohibits the marketing of phytopharmaceutical products containing <b>dieldrin.</b> In Argentina, Canada, Chile, the Federal Republic of Germany, Hungary, and the USA, its use {{is prohibited}}, with some exceptions. The use of <b>dieldrin</b> is restricted in India, Mauritius, Togo, and the United Kingdom. Its use in industry is prohibited in Switzerland and its manufacture and use in Japan is under government control. In Finland, the only accepted use for <b>dieldrin</b> is as a termiticide in one glue mixture for exported plywood.

50|$|Aldrin {{was used}} to control soil pests (namely termites) on corn and potato crops. <b>Dieldrin</b> was an {{insecticide}} used on fruit, soil, and seed. It persists in the soil with a half-life of five years at temperate latitudes. Both aldrin and <b>dieldrin</b> may be volatilized from sediment and redistributed by air currents, contaminating areas far from their sources. They have been measured in Arctic wildlife, suggesting long range transport from southern agricultural regions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dieldrin</b> can {{be formed}} from the {{synthesis}} of hexachloro-1,3-cyclopentadiene with norbornadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction, followed by epoxidation of the norbornene ring.|$|E
50|$|In soil, on plant surfaces, {{or in the}} {{digestive}} tracts of insects, aldrin oxidizes to the epoxide <b>dieldrin,</b> which is more strongly insecticidal.|$|E
5000|$|Most POPs (including <b>dieldrin)</b> {{bioaccumulate}} in the fatty {{tissues of}} humans and other animals. The Stockholm Convention banned 12 POPs, nicknamed [...] "the dirty dozen". These include: aldicarb, toxaphene, chlordane and heptachlor, chlordimeform, chlorobenzilate, DBCP, DDT, [...] "drins" [...] (aldrin, <b>dieldrin</b> and endrin), EDB, HCH and lindane, paraquat, parathion and methyl parathion, pentachlorophenol, and 2,4,5-T.
