5|$|The boycotts {{were largely}} led or {{supported}} by celebrities. Film star Chen Kun posted {{a message to}} Weibo—where he had 70 million followers—stating {{that he would be}} boycotting Malaysia until <b>its</b> <b>government</b> told the truth. The post was shared over 70,000 times and drew over 30,000 comments. Over 337,000 people retweeted a tweet from TV host Meng Fei, that said he would join the boycott.|$|E
5|$|When the {{hurricane}} appeared {{to pose a}} threat to Bermuda, <b>its</b> <b>government</b> issued a hurricane watch. Around 24hours before Erin made its closest approach, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Initial forecasts indicated Erin would pass within 15miles (24km) of the island. As a result, ferry and bus transport was suspended. Officials prepared a school to be used as an emergency shelter, though few people used it.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, Girdap was {{deprived}} of <b>its</b> <b>government</b> protections, {{as it had}} no links to the new agrarian government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski. In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in Berkovitsa for eight months before he was acquitted, Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were sealed. In 1922, the Bulgarian National Bank closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap to be withdrawn by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While {{at the time the}} Bulgarian National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's declaration of bankruptcy, it reversed its stance two years later. Girdap was declared bankrupt on 3 February 1925 and its managers Boncho Boev, Ivan Kovachev and Nikola Kovachev were arrested.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand {{had almost}} fully conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking {{a large number of}} prisoners. Despite {{stubborn}} resistance by Filipino and US forces, the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing <b>its</b> <b>government</b> into exile. On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division. Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea and Indian Ocean, and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha. These easy victories over unprepared US and European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as overextended.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of <b>its</b> <b>government</b> is limited.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few months}} later in a 2002 letter, he {{made no mention of}} this {{justification}} but claimed [...] "that since the United States is a democracy, all citizens bear responsibility for <b>its</b> <b>government's</b> actions, and civilians are therefore fair targets." ...|$|R
50|$|While the United States is a {{party to}} {{international}} conventions against torture, a proponent of human rights treaties and a critic of torture by other countries, torture has taken place within its borders and on <b>its</b> <b>government's</b> behalf outside of its borders.|$|R
50|$|Pakistan was {{recommended}} by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in May to be designated as a “Country of Particular Concern” (CPC) by the Department of State because of <b>its</b> <b>government’s</b> engagement or toleration of systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom.|$|R
5|$|Most Chinese {{people and}} many others have been {{influenced}} in some way by Taoist traditions. Since {{the creation of the}} People's Republic of China, <b>its</b> <b>government</b> has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the Chinese Taoist Association was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957. It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution under Mao, but was re-established in 1980. The headquarters of the association are at the Baiyunguan, or White Cloud Temple of Beijing, belonging to the Longmen branch of Quanzhen Taoism. Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, both belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools, and clergy ordination has been resumed.|$|E
5|$|One of Piłsudski's main goals was to {{transform}} the parliamentary system into a presidential system; however, he opposed the introduction of totalitarianism. The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935, tailored by Piłsudski's supporters to his specifications — providing for a strong presidency — came too late for Piłsudski to seek that office; but the April Constitution would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry <b>its</b> <b>Government</b> in Exile {{through to the end}} of the war and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Saint Lucia gained full {{independence}} in 1979. Immediately beforehand, Odlum organised large protests {{in front of}} international news cameras, further cementing {{his role in the}} region's communist and socialist movement. Three weeks after independence, the nearby country of Grenada saw the overthrow of <b>its</b> <b>government</b> by communists revolutionaries led by Maurice Bishop. When the United Workers Party called a general election in Saint Lucia three weeks later, Compton's government fell – Odlum was returned to Parliament and the Labour Party, led by Allan Louisy, came to power.|$|E
25|$|The {{flag of the}} Soviet Union {{has been}} burned many times by protestors against <b>its</b> <b>government's</b> policies, for {{instance}} in Brazil by those protesting the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia of 1968, and in New York City in 1985 by protesters against the Soviet War in Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|The {{practical}} {{effect of}} the legislation was to allow the continuation of a longstanding civil lawsuit brought by families of victims of the September 11 attacks against Saudi Arabia for <b>its</b> <b>government's</b> alleged role in the attacks, though {{the law does not}} mention Saudi Arabia by name.|$|R

5|$|Students are {{involved}} in the community, and PHC requires <b>its</b> <b>Government</b> students to fulfill up to 24 credits of apprenticeship projects, which include internships, research and writing projects, and extracurricular activities such as moot court, Model United Nations, and Mock Trial. Students currently serve as interns {{in a wide variety of}} political organizations, such as congressional offices and think-tanks. Students are active in local and national politics, and members of the Patrick Henry College Republicans chapter often work with local political action groups to lobby for conservative issues at the federal and state levels. Classes are canceled the day of the national elections and the day before, so that students may volunteer on political campaigns; and many students act as Student Action Team leaders for Generation Joshua, leading groups of usually homeschooled high school students volunteering on campaigns across the United States.|$|E
5|$|The BJP's origins {{lie in the}} Bharatiya Jana Sangh, {{formed in}} 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee. After the State of Emergency in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party; it {{defeated}} the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election. After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 {{with the members of}} the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the 1984 general election, it grew in strength {{on the back of the}} Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and <b>its</b> <b>government</b> lasted only 13 days.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{government}} {{followed a}} policy of neutrality during the interwar years. Nazi Germany invaded on 10 May 1940 and, after 18 days of fighting, Belgium surrendered on 28 May and was occupied by German forces. King Leopold III, who had surrendered to the Germans, was kept a prisoner {{for the rest of}} the war. Just before the fall of Belgium, <b>its</b> <b>government,</b> including the Minister of the Colonies Albert de Vleeschauwer, fled first to Bordeaux in France, then to London, where it formed an official Belgian government in exile in October 1940.|$|E
50|$|While Japan {{was seen}} {{for many years}} as an {{economic}} success story {{as late as the}} early 1990s, the authors argue that its ongoing recession since then resulted from <b>its</b> <b>governments</b> refusal to stop subsidies to many of its industries and companies (this issue is ongoing).|$|R

5|$|The Empire of Brazil was a 19th-century {{state that}} broadly {{comprised}} the territories which form modern Brazil and Uruguay. <b>Its</b> <b>government</b> was a representative parliamentary constitutional monarchy {{under the rule}} of Emperors Dom PedroI and his son Dom PedroII. A colony of the Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil became the seat of the Portuguese colonial Empire in 1808, when the Portuguese Prince regent, later King Dom JoãoVI, fled from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. JoãoVI later returned to Portugal, leaving his eldest son and heir, Pedro, to rule the Kingdom of Brazil as regent. On 7 September 1822, Pedro declared the independence of Brazil and, after waging a successful war against his father's kingdom, was acclaimed on 12 October as PedroI, the first Emperor of Brazil. The new country was huge but sparsely populated and ethnically diverse.|$|E
5|$|The Kuomintang (KMT) {{party in}} China {{launched}} a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon {{embroiled in a}} civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what <b>its</b> <b>government</b> saw as the country's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is governed}} by a mayor and a nine-member city council. In 2006, <b>its</b> <b>{{government}}</b> changed from a council–manager government to a strong mayor government, as decided by a citywide vote in 2004. The mayor is in effect {{the chief executive officer}} of the city, while the council is the legislative body. The City of San Diego is responsible for police, public safety, streets, water and sewer service, planning and zoning, and similar services within its borders. San Diego is a sanctuary city, however, San Diego County is a participant of the Secure Communities program. , the city had one employee for every 137 residents, with a payroll greater than $733 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} irrelevance of the Holy Alliance after 1825 and {{the fall}} of the Bourbon dynasty in France in 1830 during the July Revolution eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe, {{but it was not until}} the king's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military reconquest, and in 1836 <b>its</b> <b>government</b> went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America. During the course of the 19th century, Spain would recognize each of the new states. Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish–American War in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The {{new focus}} was on women's self-discovery; and the ACWF {{launched}} the Four Self Campaign consisting of: self-respect, self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reliance. An example of the ACWF balancing <b>its</b> <b>government</b> responsibilities with its responsibility to the women of China {{can be seen in}} the One-Child Policy. The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his many {{interactions}} with U.S. officials and settlers, Irataba was invited to Washington, D.C., in 1864, for an official meeting with members of the U.S. military and <b>its</b> <b>government,</b> including President Abraham Lincoln. In doing so, he became the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. He received considerable attention during his tours of the U.S. capital, and of New York City and Philadelphia, where he was given gifts, including a silver-headed cane from Lincoln. Upon his return he negotiated the creation of the Colorado River Indian Reservation, which caused a split in the Mohave Nation when he led several hundred of his supporters to the Colorado River valley. The majority of the Mohave preferred to remain in their ancestral homelands near Fort Mohave and under the leadership of their hereditary leader, Homoseh quahote, who was less enthusiastic about direct collaboration with whites. As leader of the Colorado River band of Mohave, Irataba encouraged peaceful relations with whites, served as a mediator between the warring tribes in the area, and during his later years continued to lead the Mohave in their ongoing conflicts with the Paiute and Chemehuevi.|$|E
