5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised {{him as a man}} who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar is {{reputed to}} have been a staunch disciplinarian, with {{willingness}} to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who have personally approached the Sultan in his later years described <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> with a warm and generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was a person with a turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of past notorious incidents, which include an experience of being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E

25|$|Galán {{was largely}} {{influenced}} by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's ideas and Nikos Kazantzakis's books. His father Mario described <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> fascinated with spirituality, {{a man with}} integrity, an individual struggle for knowing one's self {{between good and evil}} and that the effort to achieve it consisted in the main objective in life, not only individually, but collectively.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 2012, the European Court of Human Rights {{ruled in}} favor of Nada, citing that Nada's human rights had been violated, {{in the context of the}} European Convention on Human Rights. In this ruling the {{government}} of Switzerland was ordered to pay Nada 30,000 Euros in damages, for their treatment of <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> placed — with no evidence of guilt — on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 terror blacklist by the United States.|$|E
25|$|Sri Ramana led {{a modest}} and renunciate life. However, {{according}} to David Godman, {{who has written}} extensively about Ramana, a popular image of <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who {{spent most of his time}} doing nothing except sitting silently in samadhi is highly inaccurate. From the period when an Ashram began to rise around him after his mother arrived, until his later years when his health failed, Ramana was actually quite active in Ashram activities such as cooking and stitching leaf plates.|$|E
50|$|Peers {{describe}} <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> intelligent <b>person</b> and {{his many}} skills include drawing, singing and playing guitar and {{was known to}} crack jokes {{that go along with}} the occasion.|$|R

50|$|Family members found Baalu Girma's car {{outside of}} Addis Ababa {{on the way}} to Debre-Zeit. The {{military}} junta classified <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> missing <b>person</b> and no one has heard from Girma since.|$|R
25|$|Sheffield {{was born}} in Tampa, Florida, {{and grew up in}} Belmont Heights, near the Ponce de Leon projects. He and his family lived with his uncle, Dwight Gooden, who would go on to become the ace pitcher for the New York Mets. They played {{baseball}} frequently and Sheffield learned how to hit a fastball from Gooden, who is only four years older than he is. Sheffield has publicly said that his grandfather had a significant positive impact on his life, influencing <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> and as an athlete.|$|E
25|$|A Mahafaly individual's social {{identity}} is also defined {{by his or}} her foko - a grouping of all descendants of a living man or woman; an individual belongs simultaneously to multiple foko. Members of a foko typically only gather or work together when the head of the foko is ill, in need of assistance, or has died, in which case the members will organize to take action as needed. An even stronger identity is one's tariha, the living descendants of a male line of descent traced back to a common male ancestor who died recently enough that the oldest members of the group can trace their kinship ties to him and remember some features about <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> All sacrifices to the ancestors (soro) are made in the name of this common ancestor, and the oldest male tariha member is responsible for carrying out these rituals on behalf of the group. Members of a tariha typically live near each other and form a village or cluster of villages.|$|E
500|$|In a February 1957 {{speech to}} a plenum of the Central Committee of the Party {{subsequently}} published in the newspaper Zëri i Popullit, Hoxha defended Stalin's legacy and attacked the Yugoslavs (but not the Soviet leadership by name.) [...] He added that, [...] "In blackening Stalin, the enemies are not concerned about <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> but their aim is to discredit the Soviet Union, the socialist system, and the international communist movement, consequently, to undermine the workers' faith in socialism." ...|$|E
50|$|Asinius Saloninus or (Gnaeus Asinius Saloninus) (sometimes wrongly called Salonius), died in 22. Tacitus {{describes}} <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ‘eminent’ <b>person.</b> Saloninus {{was intended}} to marry one of the granddaughters of Emperor Tiberius.|$|R
5000|$|Antoninus was {{a friend}} and {{correspondent}} to Roman Senator and historian Pliny the Younger. The Augustan History describes <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ‘righteous <b>person,</b> and he pitied Nerva when he became Roman Emperor in 96.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, {{everyone}} feared Kitano. After {{getting used}} to him and learning his real personality, they started to view <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> normal <b>person.</b> Even {{the people who were}} against him changed for the better.|$|R
500|$|Nicknamed both [...] "Beast" [...] and [...] "Sarge", McCrimmon {{was often}} {{considered}} [...] "gruff" [...] {{and had a}} direct way of speaking that cultivated respect amongst his peers. [...] According to former teammate Lanny McDonald: [...] "He was tough, he was abrasive, but on the inside {{he was a big}} teddy bear, a big softie." [...] McCrimmon's brother remembered <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who dedicated himself to his family. McCrimmon had two children with his wife Maureen: daughter Carlin and son Liam.|$|E
500|$|Hutcherson {{currently}} {{lives in}} Los Angeles, California. In May 2012, he purchased the [...] $2.5 million former house of Heath Ledger in Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills, a small ranch built in 1951. He professes that his fame {{has not changed}} <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> stating, [...] "I love my job {{more than anything in}} the world and I could never imagine doing anything else. So this whole thing is a very small price to pay compared to someone who has to go to an office to work." ...|$|E
500|$|After the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Afghan President Karzai's {{views about}} the {{security}} issues confronting Afghanistan {{and how best to}} deal with them reportedly changed. This impacted the working relationship between the President of Afghanistan and some of his cabinet ministers including his intelligence chief. Saleh said, [...] "He [...] thought democracy had hurt <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> His family had been attacked by the media unfairly, and the West was criticizing him unfairly. So after a presidential election, he was a changed man, and we could not have the same relationship as before the presidential election." [...] Political analyst Ahmed Rashid in 2010 observed the same, [...] "Karzai's new outlook is the most dramatic political shift he has undergone in the twenty-six years that I have known him." [...] Both Saleh and Interior Minister Hanif Atmar subsequently had strong disagreements with Karzai on how to proceed against the Taliban, who Karzai began referring to as [...] "brothers". At that point Saleh and Atmar were increasingly isolated in the Karzai administration.|$|E
50|$|A {{supervisor}} from Sakurai Kikan and {{a former}} Imperial Japanese Army lieutenant colonel. He {{is the one who}} usually gives mission briefings to the group. He is a mild-mannered gentleman and speaks in a polite tone. Aoi describes <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sly <b>person.</b>|$|R
5000|$|His {{friends and}} colleagues knew <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{compassionate}} <b>person,</b> <b>a</b> quality which landed him in trouble during his tenure at NCL when he allowed a family of poor means {{to stay in a}} settlement inside NCL campus. The incident later developed into a legal battle.|$|R
500|$|He was {{featured}} in the syndicated comic strip The Far Side, which showed <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> clumsy <b>person</b> who spilled {{in various stages of}} his life; <b>as</b> <b>a</b> baby (his cup), teenager (pen ink in his shirt pocket), and ultimately <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult, driving into a water tower.|$|R
500|$|Biographers have characterised Pick {{as being}} [...] "very shy", and [...] "brilliant but lonely". Christian Barman {{described}} <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who inspired conflicting opinions about his personality and his actions: [...] "a man about whom {{so many people}} held so many different views". Pick acknowledged {{that he could be}} difficult to work with: [...] "I have always kept in mind my own frailties – a short temper. Impatience with fools, quickness rather than thoroughness. I am a bad hand at the gracious word or casual congratulation." [...] His moralistic character led to friends giving him the nickname [...] "Jonah". Pick valued criticism and savoured challenging debate, though he complained that he found it difficult to get people to stand up to him. UERL board member Sir Ernest Clark considered Pick to be perhaps too efficient and unable to fully delegate and relinquish responsibility: [...] "his own efficiency has a bad effect on the efficiency of others... How can the housemaid take pride in a job to which the mistress will insist on putting the finishing touch?" [...] Pick's friend Noel Carrington thought that his attention to detail made him the [...] "ideal inspector general." ...|$|E
500|$|Yoshimura wanted Braugher {{to treat}} D'Onofrio {{like he was}} [...] "bad luck" [...] {{and try to keep}} his {{distance}} at first, but gradually come to view <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> and form a close bond with him {{by the end of the}} episode. A New York City firefighter, Tim Brown, was a consultant for most of the technical information in the episode. In addition to helping Yoshimura with the dialogue from medical staff characters, Brown advised Yoshimura on the method of using air bags to push the subway train forward and remove Lange's body. Yoshimura included conflicting reports from witnesses about how the incident took place, which the writer described as a [...] "Rashomon thing", in reference to the 1950 Japanese film in which several characters offer differing descriptions of the same murder. [...] "Subway" [...] continued a sixth season trend in which the detectives became more personally involved with the victims, and thus becoming more emotionally drained at their deaths. For example, in the episode [...] "Birthday", which aired a month earlier, Falsone interviewed a victim who eventually died at the conclusion of the episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.|$|E
500|$|For {{his role}} as Charley [...] "the Gent", the brother of Marlon Brando's {{character}} in Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Film writer Leo Braudy wrote that the [...] "incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic". The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted, despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised. Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not stop crying, which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate. Though Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor, he disliked <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> and frequently complained during the production of Brando's [...] "predilection for leaving the set" [...] immediately after shooting his scenes. Steiger later remarked: [...] "We didn't {{get to know each}} other at all. He always flew solo and I haven't seen him since the film. I do resent him saying he's just a hooker, and that actors are whores". Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 interview with BBC News, Steiger said he probably would not have done On the Waterfront if he had known at the time that Kazan provided the House Un-American Activities Committee with names of performers suspected of being Communists.|$|E
5000|$|Fenton was a {{familiar}} figure with his cassock and biretta {{on the campus of}} The Catholic University of America for 25 years.

Fenton's colorful expressions and trenchant observations became legendary.|$|R
50|$|A {{controversial}} personality, Mieli sometimes made {{a spectacle}} of himself. Once in Rome he publicly ate his own excrement {{and that of}} a dog. While some may have found this behavior outrageous or frightening, others knew <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gentle <b>person</b> who enjoyed cross-dressing, capable of being very charming in private.|$|R
50|$|Around 1356 Henry {{began his}} efforts to obtain the Canonry of the Cathedral of Prague.

The place of his burial is unknown.|$|R
500|$|... {{is one of}} {{the members}} of Team 10. Creator Kishimoto has noted that he [...] "likes" [...] Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Shikamaru's intelligence is such that Asuma Sarutobi, Team 10's leader, has never been able to defeat Shikamaru at games such as shogi or go, and he can devise complex strategies even in the heat of battle. However, his laziness frequently prevents him from effectively utilizing his intelligence. Shikamaru is a longtime friend of Choji Akimichi, as he chooses to look upon Choji as a person rather than only considering his large girth.Despite thinking of Naruto a bit poorly and often getting annoyed by him, he {{is one of the}} few people to have acknowledged <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> rather than the tailed beast in childhood, remaining one of Naruto's close friends since then. In battle, Shikamaru can manipulate his shadow, and by extending it into another person's shadow he can force the target to mimic his movements. In the series epilogue, Shikamaru works as Naruto's advisor, and is revealed to have married Temari who had moved to the Hidden Leaf, with whom he has a son, Shikadai. In the Japanese anime, Shikamaru's voice actor is Showtaro Morikubo, although Nobutoshi Canna acted as a stand-in for Morikubo in episode 141. His English voice actor is Tom Gibis.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{being in}} a band with his younger brother Jonny Greenwood, Colin said: [...] "Beyond the normal brotherly thing, I respect <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> and a musician." [...] On another occasion, he said: “It’s wonderful, it’s good, it makes my promise {{to keep an eye}} on him for my mother a lot easier, having him right next to me all the time. But he’s very easy to look after anyway, 'cause he’s very well behaved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{is the son}} of Bishop Eugene and Darlene Ringer, who {{are both}} ministers. Ringer is a devout Christian. He owns a black belt in Karate. He majored in sociology. Ringer is known for his [...] "unselfish attitude", such as signing any {{autograph}} a fan asks for, and often does charity work. Michigan State Head coach Mark Dantonio said of Ringer, [...] "He's a total team player - it's not about him, and you can't say enough about <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> aside from his athletic abilities." ...|$|E
50|$|Perivaldo earned two caps for Brazil.
