5|$|Nelson, the Hamiltons {{and several}} other British {{travellers}} left Leghorn for Florence on 13 July. They made stops at Trieste and Vienna, spending three weeks in the latter where they were entertained by the local nobility and heard the Missa in Angustiis by Haydn that now bears Nelson's name. By September they were in Prague, and later called at Dresden, Dessau and Hamburg, from where they caught a packet ship to Great Yarmouth, arriving on 6 November. Nelson was given a hero's welcome and after being sworn in as a freeman of the borough and received the massed crowd's applause. He subsequently {{made his way to}} London, arriving on 9 November. He attended court and was guest of honour at a number of banquets and balls. It was during this period that Fanny Nelson and Emma Hamilton met for the first time. During this period, Nelson was reported as being cold and distant to his wife and his attention to Emma became the subject of gossip. With the marriage breaking down, Nelson began to hate even being in the same room as Fanny. Events came to a head around Christmas, when according to Nelson's solicitor, Fanny issued an ultimatum on whether he was to choose her or Emma. Nelson replied: I love you sincerely but I cannot <b>forget</b> <b>my</b> obligations to Lady Hamilton or speak of her otherwise than with affection and admiration. The two never lived together again after this.|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} Brown's laugh, {{followed}} by [...] "undislodgeable [...] piano notes." [...] Over these notes, the first {{lines of the}} refrain are rapped in a call and response interaction between Brown and Halliwell. The words [...] "tell," [...] "really" [...] and [...] "I wanna" [...] are repeated, so that the vocal tone and lyrics build up an image of female self-assertion. The refrain ends with the word [...] "zigazig-ha," [...] a euphemism for female desire, which is ambiguously sexualised or broadly economic. The first verse follows; Brown, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton sing one line individually, in that order. In this part, the lyrics have a pragmatic sense of control of the situation; they begin, [...] "If you want my future, <b>forget</b> <b>my</b> past." [...] This, according to musicologist Sheila Whiteley, taps directly into the emotions of the young teenage audience.|$|E

500|$|Ramsey joined Ipswich {{just after}} the club's relegation from the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1954–55 season, the team's only year above the third tier up to that point. To quote McKinstry, Ipswich had neither [...] "glittering {{pedigree}} or status" [...] nor [...] "strong footballing tradition"—the club had joined the Football League only in 1938, and its home ground at Portman Road was small and basic. One of the team's advantages was the patronage of the aristocratic Cobbold brewing family, to which the chairman and much of the club hierarchy belonged. [...] "I had no plan for Ipswich when I went there," [...] Ramsey later said. [...] "In fact the first thing I had to do was to <b>forget</b> <b>my</b> set ideas on how football ought to be played. My experience had been in the First Division. I soon found that what I faced at Ipswich was very different." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} {{the first batch}} of originals in 1990, Yankovic focused his attention on parodies. By early 1991, only three parodies had been recorded. Two of them, the cookie-inspired New Kids on the Block parody [...] "The White Stuff" [...] and the television-centric MC Hammer parody [...] "I Can't Watch This," [...] were slated to be released as singles. In fact, several cartons of promo singles were pressed, but they were deleted from the record company's catalogue at the last minute. These CDs were later discovered by Yankovic and his drummer, Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz, in a trash heap and have since become collector's items. [...] "The Plumbing Song," [...] a double parody of Milli Vanilli's hit singles [...] "Baby Don't <b>Forget</b> <b>My</b> Number" [...] and [...] "Blame It on the Rain" [...] was also recorded. In a 1992 interview with Dr. Demento, Yankovic said that he believed the parody to be [...] "kind of redundant" [...] {{at that point in}} time, given the lip-synching scandal that had effectively destroyed the band almost two years prior. In reference to this scandal, Yankovic also jokingly affirmed that he did indeed sing lead vocals on his parody.|$|E

2500|$|Edwards {{was hired}} as Vanderbilt University's head {{football}} coach and athletic director in 1949, replacing Henry Russell Sanders when Sanders left to become head coach at the University of California, Los Angeles. Vanderbilt gave the 43-year-old coach a three-year contract paying a $12,500 salary ($ in today's dollars). [...] "I don't like to leave the Cleveland Browns and Paul Brown in particular," [...] {{he said at the}} time. [...] "I'll never <b>forget</b> <b>my</b> experiences with the Browns over the past two years." [...] Edwards remained at Vanderbilt for four seasons, building up a 21–19–2 record. He instituted a modern T formation offense to replace Sanders's more traditional single-wing formation. He resigned in 1953 under pressure from Vanderbilt alumni following a 3–5–2 season. He then moved to the University of North Carolina, where he was an assistant on the football team's coaching staff in 1953 and 1954.|$|E
2500|$|Felix {{converted}} a wing of his Moika Palace into {{a hospital}} for wounded soldiers but avoided entering military service himself {{by taking advantage of}} a law exempting only-sons from serving in the war. He entered the Cadet Corps and took an officer's training course but had no intention of joining a regiment. Irina's first cousin, Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna, to whom she had been close when they were girls, was disdainful of Felix: [...] "Felix is a 'downright civilian,' dressed all in brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes—a man idling in such times," [...] Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas II, on 5 March 1915 after paying a visit to the Yusupovs. Felix and Irina's only daughter, Princess Irina Felixovna Yusupova, nicknamed [...] "Bebé", was born on 21 March 1915. [...] "I shall never <b>forget</b> <b>my</b> happiness when I heard the child's first cry," [...] her father wrote. Irina liked her name and wanted to pass it on to her first child. Her mother Xenia was so worried over the delivery that Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna said it was almost like Xenia was giving birth instead of Irina.|$|E

2500|$|I {{talked to}} him (Dr. Scott) for some time, and {{consulted}} him about baby, who was looking thin and weak. (15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when I felt something whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never <b>forget</b> <b>my</b> anxiety lest baby should commence crying again, and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

2500|$|One {{headline}} in a September 1895 article by The New York Times ran [...] "Armenian Holocaust," [...] while the Catholic World declared, [...] "Not all the perfume of Arabia can wash {{the hand of}} Turkey clean enough to be suffered any longer to hold the reins of power over one inch of Christian territory." [...] The rest of the American press called for action to help the Armenians and to remove, [...] "if not by political action than by resort to the knife... the fever spot of the Turkish Empire." [...] King Leopold II of Belgium told British Prime Minister Salisbury that {{he was prepared to}} send his Congolese Force Publique to [...] "invade and occupy" [...] Armenia. The massacres were an important item on the agenda of the United States President Grover Cleveland, and in his presidential platform for 1896, Republican candidate William McKinley listed the saving of the Armenians as one of his top priorities in foreign policy. Americans in the Ottoman Empire, such as George Washburn, then-president of the Constantinople-based Robert College, pressured their government to take concrete action. In December 1900, the USS Kentucky called at the port of Smyrna, where its captain, [...] "Red Bill" [...] Kirkland, delivered the following warning, somewhat softened by his translator, to its governor: [...] "If these massacres continue I'll be swuzzled if I won't someday <b>forget</b> <b>my</b> order… and find some pretext to hammer a few Turkish towns… [...] I'd keel-haul every blithering mother's son of a Turk that wears hair." [...] Americans on the mainland, such as Julia Ward Howe, David Josiah Brewer, and John D. Rockefeller, donated and raised large amounts of money and organized relief aid that was channeled to the Armenians via the newly established American Red Cross. Other humanitarian groups and the Red Cross helped by sending aid to the remaining survivors who were dying of disease and hunger.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Hume wrote an {{extremely}} brief autobiographical essay titled [...] "My Own Life" [...] which summed up his entire life in [...] "fewer than 5 pages", and notably contains many interesting judgments that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume. The scholar of 18th century literature Donald Seibert judged it a [...] "remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere." [...] Hume here confesses his belief that the"love of literary fame" [...] had served as his [...] "ruling passion" [...] in life, and claims that this desire [...] "never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments." [...] One such disappointment Hume discusses in the mini-autobiography was his disappointment that [...] with the initial literary reception of the Treatise, which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the Essays: [...] "the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely <b>forget</b> <b>my</b> former disappointment". Perhaps most notable is Hume's revelation of his own retrospective judgment that his philosophical debut's apparent failure [...] "had proceeded more from the manner than the matter." [...] Hume thus suggests that [...] "I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early." [...] Hume provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: [...] "my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best." [...] Hume also makes a number of self-assessments in the essay, writing of his social relations that [...] "My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as the state, that [...] "though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury", and professing of his character that [...] "My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct." [...] Hume concludes the essay with the frank admission: [...] " [...] I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained." ...|$|E
