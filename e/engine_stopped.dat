5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started {{to pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo and fell {{to the back of the}} field.|$|E

25|$|The {{flight was}} a {{scheduled}} domestic passenger flight from Croydon to Manchester. It was also {{reported to be}} carrying mail, although this was later denied by the General Post Office. Whilst flying over Buckinghamshire, a storm was encountered. Witnesses stated that an <b>engine</b> <b>stopped,</b> but was then restarted. It appeared to them that an emergency landing {{was going to be}} made at Ford End, Ivinghoe when the aircraft dived to the ground and crashed at Ivinghoe. The accident happened at about 18:05. The wreckage came to rest upside down, with both crew and all three passengers being killed. One witness reported hearing a violent explosion, but was not sure whether this was before the aircraft crashed or {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E

25|$|At about 1:30 in the {{afternoon}} of October 25, the engineer reported that the water {{had been allowed to}} get too low in the boiler. On hearing this report, the captain ordered the <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> and the safety valve opened, the steamer being brought to anchor about {{a mile and a half}} from the Fox Islands, in Penobscot Bay. The fire in the furnace was extinguished, but in about a half hour, the steamer was found to be on fire under the deck over the boiler, near the animal cages. An effort was made to extinguish the flames by means of a hose attached to the pump, but it proved fruitless. The fire spread rapidly and soon consumed the firefighting equipment.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{helicopter}} lifted off, it {{was hit by}} NVA anti-aircraft rounds, and its <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> {{at an altitude of}} 4,500 feet. Rose was notified that a Marine door gunner had been shot through the neck by an NVA round, and he rendered lifesaving medical treatment to the man before the helicopter crashed, several kilometers away from the original extraction point. Rose was thrown from the helicopter before it crashed, and while still dazed and wounded crawled back into the wreckage to pull out wounded and unconscious soldiers, knowing that it could explode at any moment. He continued to treat the wounded until another helicopter arrived to extract them. Upon returning to base, Rose, covered in blood and wounds, refused all treatment until the other wounded were treated first. He was credited with treating between 60 and 70 wounded and saving many lives; only three Montagnards died in Operation Tailwind.|$|E
25|$|After it {{slid off}} the runway, parts of the {{aircraft}} caught on fire. This reached high intensity and centered around the middle section of the fuselage and the right wing. The fire was not started when the aircraft left the runway, but commenced no later than 13 seconds afterwards. Forty-five seconds after the overrun the first fire engine arrived at the scene, the second five seconds after that. By 1 minute and 45 seconds after overrun, most of the fuselage was on fire. The tail collapsed at 3 minutes and 30 seconds after overrun, and 5 minutes and 45 seconds inside left <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> running. One fire engine left to resupply with water at 8 minutes, returning at 13 minutes. The first municipal fire engine came to the scene after 18 minutes. The fire crew initially did not see anyone near the wreckage and presumed all the passengers had perished. Only later did they realize that people standing near by were actually survivors. The fire was extinguished at 09:30.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplicity}} of the Wankel engine makes it well-suited for mini, micro, and micro-mini engine designs. The Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) Rotary Engine Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, has previously undertaken research towards the development of Wankel engines of down to 1mm in diameter, with displacements less than 0.1cc. Materials include silicon and motive power includes compressed air. The goal of such research was to eventually develop an internal combustion engine {{with the ability to}} deliver 100 milliwatts of electrical power; with the engine itself serving as the rotor of the generator, with magnets built into the engine rotor itself. Development of the miniature Wankel <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> at UC Berkeley {{at the end of the}} DARPA contract. Miniature Wankel engines struggled to maintain compression due to sealing problems, similar to problems observed in the large scale versions. In addition, miniature engines suffer from an adverse surface to volume ratio causing excess heat losses; the relatively large surface area of the combustion chamber walls transfers away what little heat is generated in the small combustion volume resulting in quenching and low efficiency.|$|E
25|$|During 1940 Britain {{supplied}} significant {{military aid}} to the VVKJ, to strengthen its forces against the increasing German threat. In early March 1941, the German Luftwaffe forces started arriving in neighboring Bulgaria. On March 12, 1941, VVKJ units began to deploy to their wartime airfields. The overthrow of the pro-German government in Belgrade on March 27 brought an end to hopes of a settlement with Germany. On April 6, 1941, Luftwaffe units in Bulgaria and Romania attacked Yugoslavia in what {{was known as the}} Bombing of Belgrade. Equipped with a combination of obsolete equipment and new aircraft still being introduced into service, the VVKJ was forced to defend the country's long borders against multiple attacks from many directions. The dubious loyalty of some military personnel did not help matters. Yugoslav fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery brought down about 90-100 enemy aircraft, but defending forces were unable to make any significant impact on the enemy advance. During the attack of German aircraft on Niš Airport Medoševac on 6 April around 08:00, fire from the ground shot down the plane of German fighter ace Herbert Ihlefeld. Captain Ihlefeld, who was credited with over forty air victories, was shot down by Corporal Vlasta Belić, firing a Darne machine gun, caliber 7.69mm, taken from a Yugoslav Breguet 19. Having received a shot in the oil cooler, the Bf 109's <b>engine</b> <b>stopped,</b> and the pilot was forced to leave the plane. He rescued himself with a parachute about 35 miles southeast of Nis. The German ace was captured by Serbian peasants who handed him over to the gendarmes. On April 17, 1941 the Yugoslav government surrendered. Several VVKJ aircraft escaped to Egypt via the Kingdom of Greece, and the crews then served with the British Royal Air Force (RAF).|$|E
500|$|As they {{ascended to}} , the number-four <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> and the {{propeller}} began [...] (rotating freely) in the airstream.

Their aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of [...] to launch its Skyrocket payload, and the B-29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly. Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose-down alignment to increase speed, then launched the Skyrocket. At the instant of launch, the number-four engine propeller disintegrated. Pieces of it damaged the number-three engine and hit the number-two engine. Butchart and Armstrong were forced {{to shut down the}} number-three engine, due to damage, and the number-one engine, due to the torque it created. They made a slow, circling descent from [...] using only the number-two engine, and landed safely.|$|E

500|$|On 5March 1917, {{shortly after}} commencing {{operations}} with No.1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> {{while he was}} bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria. At first believing {{that he had been}} struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base. On 21April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under [...] "intense anti-aircraft fire"; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order for [...] "conspicuous gallantry". He was promoted major in May and given command of No.1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air."

500|$|Starting in September, South Carolina and the pre-dreadnoughts of the Atlantic Fleet began escorting convoys to France. On 6 September, she {{departed}} {{with the}} pre-dreadnoughts [...] and [...] {{to protect a}} fast HX troopship convoy. On 16 September, the three battleships left the convoy in the Atlantic and steamed back to the United States, while other escorts brought the convoy into port. On the 17th, South Carolina lost her starboard propeller, which forced her to reduce speed to [...] using only the port shaft. On 20 September, the port <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> after a throttle valve broke down. She got underway temporarily using an auxiliary throttle before severe vibration forced her to stop for six hours while the main throttle was fixed. Four days later, the ships reached the United States and South Carolina {{made her way to}} Philadelphia for repairs. After South Carolina returned to service, she participated in gunnery training, which continued until Germany signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the fighting in Europe. In mid-February 1919, South Carolina began the first of four round trips between the United States and Brest, France to bring American soldiers back from Europe. In the course of the voyages, the last of which concluded in late July, the ship had carried over 4,000 soldiers home. She then went to the Norfolk Navy Yard for a lengthy overhaul.|$|E
500|$|Michael Schumacher battled for Montoya {{for third}} {{position}} until {{he became the}} first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 18, and rejoined the track in fourth place. The Williams and Ferrari teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Williams team were planning a one-stop strategy whereas the Ferrari team were planning for two stops. [...] Barrichello (on a lighter fuel load) was able to quickly extend his lead over Montoya to ten seconds by his first pit stop on lap 19. However, Barrichello's pit stop proved problematic: his refuelling rig failed to work which meant he was stationary for around six to seven seconds longer than planned. Barrichello exited the stop in third position, ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen lost second {{during the course of the}} 19th lap, and then lost all gears on the previous lap which forced him to retire. Verstappen retired on the 26th lap because his <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> working. At the front of the field, Ralf Schumacher moved into the lead of the race when Montoya made his pit stop on lap 28, where his pit crew made an adjustment to his front wing to rectify an issue Montoya had with oversteer, and he rejoined in third place with a deficit of 5.5 seconds. Frentzen retired from ninth position with a gearbox failure on lap 29. Villeneuve made a pit stop from sixth on lap 34 and retained the position.|$|E

2500|$|One cell aligned itself {{behind a}} Merkava Mark III tank, another behind a {{concrete}} watchtower, and another behind an armored personnel carrier. The militants simultaneously {{opened fire on}} their targets. The militants that attacked the tank blew open its rear door with an RPG. The tank's gunner, Corporal Gilad Shalit, was wounded by the RPG blast, suffering a broken left hand and a light shoulder wound. Two of the militants then approached the tank. The RPG hit caused the tank {{to go up in}} flames, and its fire extinguisher system was activated. However, the <b>engine</b> <b>stopped</b> working and the ventilation system failed to work as a result, creating suffocating conditions inside. The tank's commander and driver climbed out to escape, and were gunned down by the militants. A militant then climbed onto the tank's turret and threw grenades into the tank, wounding another crew member. Shalit climbed out of the tank to escape the suffocating conditions, and as he emerged onto the turret, he saw one of the militants climbing onto the tank, with his AK-47 strapped to his back. Shalit at this point could have easily killed the militant using the [...]50 caliber machine gun mounted on the turret, but instead surrendered to him. He later told IDF investigators that he was confused and in a state of shock, and thus never thought of shooting him. Shalit was then taken to Gaza with the militants. An Israeli tank soon arrived on the scene and an IDF observation post witnessed their escape, although it was not known {{at the time that the}} militants had a captive Israeli soldier with them, and the tank did not open fire in time, as the commander was awaiting permission.
