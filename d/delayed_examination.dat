40|$|Tritrichomonas foetus, a venereal {{pathogen}} of cattle, {{was recently}} {{identified as an}} inhabitant of the large intestine in young domestic cats with chronic diarrhea. Recognition of the infection in cats has been mired by unfamiliarity with T. foetus in cats as well as misdiagnosis of the organisms as Pentatrichomonas hominis or Giardia sp. when visualized by light microscopy. The diagnosis of T. foetus presently depends on the demonstration of live organisms by direct microscopic examination of fresh feces or by fecal culturing. As T. foetus organisms are fastidious and fragile, routine flotation techniques and <b>delayed</b> <b>examination</b> and refrigeration of feces are anticipated to preclude the diagnosis in numerous cases. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a sensitive and specific PCR test for the diagnosis of feline T. foetus infection. A single-tube nested PCR was designed and optimized for the detection of T. foetus in feline feces by using a combination of novel (TFITS-F and TFITS-R) and previously described (TFR 3 and TFR 4) primers. The PCR is based on the amplification of a conserved portion of the T. foetus internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS 1 and ITS 2) and the 5. 8 S rRNA gene. The absolute detection limit of the single-tube nested PCR was 1 organism, while the practical detection limit was 10 organisms per 200 mg of feces. Specificity was examined by using P. hominis, Giardia lamblia, and feline genomic DNA. Our results demonstrate that the single-tube nested PCR is ideally suited for (i) diagnostic testing of feline fecal samples that are found negative by direct microscopy and culturing and (ii) definitive identification of microscopically observable or cultivated organisms...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{assessment}} of the vaginal lactobacillary flora helps to direct further diagnostic microbiologic investigations in genital infectious disease and seems to represent a powerful tool in predicting infectious morbidity and preterm labor during pregnancy. In {{the absence of a}} "gold standard," we studied the variations in assessing lactobacillary morphotypes according to the method used. METHODS: The lactobacillary flora from 183 pregnant women was classified according to 3 groups: normal, intermediate, and abnormal. This grading of lactobacilli was appled to vaginal and cervical specimens by means of 1) immediate wet-smear microscopy, 2) Gram's stain on a fresh, air-dried specimen, and 3) delayed Gram's stain after specimen transportation in Stuart's growth medium for 3 - 6 h. RESULTS: The assignment of intermediate or abnormal flora (grade II or grade III) showed high concordance rates among the different preparatory techniques, but the assignment of grade I (normal flora) did not. Fewer lactobacilli were found 2. 6 times more often after Gram's stains of fresh specimens [Relative Risk (RR) 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 7 - 4. 1] and 6 times more often when the Gram%s stain was performed in a <b>delayed</b> <b>examination</b> after transport than in a fresh wet-mount specimen (RR 6. 2, 95 % CI 2. 5 - 15. 6). Disturbed lactobacillary grades were also found more frequently in specimens from the cervix than those from the vagina (RR 4. 0, 95 % CI, 1. 5 - 10. 4). CONCLUSIONS: There are discrepancies in the diagnosis of lactobacillary grades between gram-stained and fresh vaginal specimens. The evidence is ambiguous as to which of the 2 methods is responsible. If an evaluation is to be done on a gram-stained specimen, then the storage of the sample in Stuart transport medium before staining should be avoided. status: publishe...|$|E

Tailored scanning delays were obtained with automated region of interest threshold triggering. A delay of 23 seconds between the start of contrast material injection and imaging was used for fixed <b>delay</b> <b>examinations.</b> Quantitative and qualitative evaluation was performed in 21 patients with normal cardiac function referred for MR assessment of hypervascular liver tumors. In the tailored examinations, the median time delay between the start of contrast material injection and the start of magnetic resonance imaging was 21 seconds (range, 18 - 34 seconds). The median tumor-to-liver contrast during tailored examinations was 19. 1 versus 14. 7 during fixed <b>delay</b> <b>examinations.</b> This difference, however, was not significant. Similarly, the enhancement in the aorta, the portal vein, the liver, and the tumor did not differ significantly between examinations performed with tailored and fixed delays.

40|$|Hansen's Bacillus: By {{electron}} microscopy this bacillus shows membrane and halo, this being more visible when sorrounding the globi or bundles of bacilli; shows, also, free granules {{of various sizes}} which were before considered as dust of the dyes; shows external granules bound with the membrane and some times branching. By phases contrast microscopy examining leproma suspensions and subcataneous lymph at 400 x we saw many free granules with intense rotatory movement; granulated bacilli with screw, skip or stroke motion, producing slow progressive motion. All such elementes are surrounded by a halo, corresponding to the classical gloea. By a patient and <b>delayed</b> <b>examination</b> {{we were able to}} see that the internal granules are motile and help the progression of the bacilli, giving the impression that the cytoplasm is liquid. By a lasting observation we could see the larger granules form prolapse, like a pseudopode and abandon the bacilli and going in very rapid rotatory movement. There are branched bacilli; there are pedunculated fred granules like comets. The addition of a drop of formol at the preparation stops all movements. Stefansky's Bacillus: Repeated examination by RCA electron microscope, type EMU- 25 of fresh suspensions of rat lepromas, led us to confirm the close relationship between human and murine leprosy agents. We examined also material from carabo (Lepra bubalorum) from Java, but due to fixation, the material was unsuitable for comparative studies. The Stefansky's bacilli showed also emmbranes and halos, internal or external granules (smaller than those of Hansen's bacillus). The bacilli shaded by chromium look thicker and shorter than those of Hansen. Due to electron bombardment both, Hansen's and Stefansky's baccilli suffer considerable alterations in their structure, showing black barrs of chromatin condensation at their extremities as also in their centers. By phase microscopy the Stefansky's bacilli showed elements with 1, 2 (bipolar), 3 or more internal small granules, developing identical movements as those of Hansen. The globi seem to be non-motile but the free bacilli appearing around the globi show intense movement. At 1000 x the examination is less satisfactory than at 400 x. The addition of formol solution in the preparation suppresses all movements, even the brownian, but the material becomes more suitable for the study of static morphology of the bacilli. CONCLUSION - The electron and phases contrast microscopy of leprous material from different types and phases of the disease may explain some of the unknown aspects of the biology and morphology of the bacilli...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wires shrink less {{efficiently}} than transistors. Smaller dimensions increase relative delay and {{the probability of}} crosstalk. Solutions to this problem include adding additional latency with pipelining, using “fat wires ” at higher metal levels, and advances in process and material technology. We propose a stopgap {{solution to this problem}} by applying a decade old technique called bus-expanding to the problem. By exploiting low spatial and temporal entropy of data it is possible to transfer   bits of data over a ¡-bit wide bus in a single cycle (  £ ¢ ¡). High entropy data will be routed directly over the bus while low entropy data will be compacted using small lookup tables. A table index will be transferred {{in the case of a}} successful lookup, otherwise the full value will be transferred in several cycles. Reducing the number of wires per bus, enables the use of wider wires, which in turn reduces the wire <b>delay.</b> <b>Examination</b> of projected process technologies shows that by shrinking the number of bits in a bus (64 ¤ 48) instead of shrinking the individual wires maintains a constant wire delay.
