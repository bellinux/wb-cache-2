However, the NIL suffers from substantial windfall effects.

40|$|<b>INSEEs</b> Business Tendency Survey in {{industry}} constitutes {{a source of}} information on the competitiveness of manufacturing firms. At an individual level, a rise in competitiveness appears significantly correlated with an increase in sales and production and a reduction in intermediate consumption costs and labour costs. However, these correlations concern raw values rather than relative values in relation to the sector in which they produce. This observation suggests that variations in the competitiveness expressed by entrepreneurs reflect above all the short-term economic changes with which the business is faced, rather than a true modification of its competitive position. At the aggregate level, the balance of opinion on the evolution of competitiveness in the Business Survey seems, however, to follow quite closely the variations of some conventional indicators such as labour productivity or exchange rate, as well as indicators of costs relatively to the costs of competing foreign products.

40|$|<b>Insee's</b> {{quarterly}} survey {{of investment in}} industry is a prime source of information concerning short-term evolutions in productive investment, {{making it possible to}} estimate these evolutions at an early stage and with considerable precision.

This article proposes a quarterly indicator based on revisions in industrial firms? expectations regarding their investment. This indicator measures the adjustments to investment figures made during the year in response to changes of a short-term nature. It turns out to be closely correlated with quarterly evolutions in firms? investment as measured in the national accounts. Moreover, it is available roughly three months before the publication of the initial quarterly national accounts figures. As the distributions examined fail to verify the classic normality hypothesis (thick tails and heavy concentrations at zero) it is necessary toapply an estimation method that is robust to extreme revisions.

Our results show that pension inequalities are much lower than wage inequalities, which strengthen {{the idea that the}} French pension system indeed performs a large amount of redistribution. The decrease in variability mainly concerns {{the lower part of the}} distributions of pensions and wages. Besides, women benefit from redistribution more than men: this stems both from their lower pensions on average (due to their lower wages and shorter career) and from the existence of some redistribution mechanisms that target mothers. Most redistribution tools have been implemented in the pension system during the 1970 s. This has resulted in an increase of the systems capacity to reduce inequalities among pensioners, up to the cohorts that are going into retirement nowadays. pension systems, redistribution, microsimulatio...|$|R
40|$|Since 1995, {{fiscal law}} {{requires}} that un-married couples declare each of their children on only one of their two separate fiscal declarations. Thereby, their choice can {{be the result of}} an optimization, since the reduction each child implies depends on the family income. Fiscal simulation models generally assume that such an optimization takes place. It is interesting to see whether this assumption is supported by existing data. Such an examination can also contribute to forecasting what would be the impact of a full individualization of personal income tax, or contribute to the understanding of collective decision processes within households. Using the data from <b>INSEEs</b> 1997 Fiscal Revenue Survey, we provide an empirical study of this optimization, which leads to some stylized facts about household behavior. We observe that the fiscal optimum is reached by about three out of four un-married couples. This certainly does not result from a random choice. Indeed, the latter would lead to far more non-optimal couples. The losses that non-optimal couples incur are relatively weak. Three types of explanations can be given for this non-optimality : complex household structures (a former union or a large number of children), complex earning structures (non-wage earnings), or, mechanically, the level of earnings themselves. fiscal policy, household taxation, personal income tax...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, technocrats such as Jean Bichelonne and {{engineers}} from the Groupe X-Crise used their position to push various state, administrative, and economic reforms. These reforms {{have been cited}} as evidence of a continuity of the French administration {{before and after the}} war. Many of these civil servants and the reforms they advocated were retained after the war. Just as the necessities of a war economy during the First World War had pushed forward state measures to reorganize the economy of France against the prevailing classical liberal theories – structures retained after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles – reforms adopted during World War II were kept and extended. Along with the 15 March 1944 Charter of the Conseil National de la Résistance (CNR), which gathered all Resistance movements under one unified political body, these reforms were a primary instrument in the establishment of post-war dirigisme, a kind of semi-planned economy which led to France becoming the modern social democracy it is now. An example of such continuities is the creation of the French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems by Alexis Carrel, a renowned physician who also supported eugenics. This institution was renamed as the National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) after the war, and exists to this day. Another example is the creation of the national statistics institute, renamed <b>INSEE</b> after the Liberation. The reorganization and unification of the French police by René Bousquet, who created the groupes mobiles de réserve (GMR, Reserve Mobile Groups), is another example of Vichy policy reform and restructuring maintained by subsequent governments. A national paramilitary police force, the GMR was occasionally used in actions against the French Resistance, but its main purpose was to enforce Vichy authority through intimidation and repression of the civilian population. After Liberation, some of its units were merged with the Free French Army to form the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS, Republican Security Companies), France's main anti-riot force.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} tried to provide {{rigorous}} tests of causal effects of education levels on health status. Some of these studies show a significant causal impact of school-leaving age on mortality at later ages: their empirical strategy consists in using exogenous shocks on education levels resulting from changes in compulsory schooling regulations. Data from <b>Insees</b> Permanent Demographic Dataset {{can be used to}} attempt transposing this strategy to the French case. The two identifying shocks used are the Zay and Berthoin reforms. They have respectively raised the minimum school leaving age to 14 and 16 years. After having detailed the methological framework, we successively implement a non-parametric approach comparing cohorts born immediately before or immediately after the application of reforms, and a parametric two-stage approach using information from a larger part of our sample. None of these approaches confirm results of existing studies. Despite the fact that reforms have significantly increased school leaving ages, {{and despite the fact that}} subsequent declines in mortality have been observed, none of these declines appear to be significant. We conclude with a discussion on possible limitations of these two reforms as identifying devices, and make some suggestions for future research.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} the investment decision {{by focusing on the}} firms subjective judgments about the impact of some economic factors. This work uses data from the <b>INSEEs</b> business surveys on investment in the industry, over the period 1991 - 2002. In October, these data contain firms opinions about the effect of the different determinants on their expected capital expenditures. These original and complex data are first studied by using the aggregate indicators (opinions balances, for example) traditionally used by economic forecasters. We then identify a hierarchy that clearly separates real factors (demand, profits and technology) from financial ones. Nevertheless, this hierarchy is only based on aggregate opinions about factors. That is why we estimate the relationship between opinions about each factor effect and expected investment spending by using a random effects Tobit model applied on individual data. This approach emphasizes on the degree of coherence between opinions and plans. Moreover, capital expenditures are distinguished according to their main economic purpose: expansion of production capacity, modernization or rationalization, replacement and new products manufacturing. One main result is that respondents clearly evaluate each factor effect by referring to specific kinds of spending, and not to their global investment. As an example, opinions about expected demand only appear consistent with investments aiming at expanding production capacity. The previous hierarchy is then globally confirmed and significantly refined. investment decision, expectations, business survey data, panel data, Mundlak's method...|$|R

The data come from the OECD (OECDs STAN database and <b>INSEEs</b> FLUBIL database, constructed with OECD data). The econometric analysis {{is based on a}} structural trade model, inspired by the new international trade theory. The model establishes a relationship between relative market shares and a set of explanatory variables, among which relative prices. We identify a few stylised facts regarding the change in Frances market shares, relatively to that of the five other exporting countries considered: - In industrialized markets, the relative market shares are relatively well explained, in the structural model, by the industry-size and price-competitiveness effects. Over the 1992 - 2003 period, France gained market shares with respect to Japan and the United Kingdom, but lost market shares relatively to the three other exporting countries. However, the size of these trends is limited, except when Frances performances are compared {{to those of}} Spain, where catching-up effects are probably predominant. - Ceteris paribus, and in particular price-competitiveness and industry-size, France tends to lose market shares relatively to the five other countries considered between 1992 and 2003, essentially in emerging markets. - Finally, the analysis of the results that are left unexplained by the structural model shows that these changes in relative market shares are mainly of a cyclical nature. This is particularly clear {{in the case of the}} comparison between Frances and Germanys export performances. International trade, market shares, exports...|$|R

The impact of CNEs has been questioned by Le Canard enchaîné, which quoted the <b>INSEE</b> study, the ANPE's records and trade unions. Since the more-recent First Employment Contract (CPE) was rejected after months of protest, unions have also been trying to cancel the CNE. On the other hand, employers' unions (Medef) consider it a major reform. The Canard Enchaîné said that the governmental ACOSS numbers (400,000 contracts) was an inflated estimate.
