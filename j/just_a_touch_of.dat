500|$|Fargo was {{considered}} among the best television shows of 2015 by the American press. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds a 100% score based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 9.19 out of 10. The site's critical consensus reads: [...] "Season two of Fargo retains all the elements that made the series an award-winning hit, successfully delivering another stellar saga powered by fascinating characters, cheeky cynicism, and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> the absurd". The season also holds the rare distinction of having each episode maintain a perfect 100% rating as well. Metacritic gives the season a score of 96, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". It was the highest rated TV show of the year on the same site, {{as well as the}} 20th highest of all time.|$|E

While Jessie and Breezy sound remarkably different, Jessie J understands pretty well how to treat a Chris Brown song." [...] Brown himself praised her rendition, going to Twitter to give her praise, saying, [...] "you're beyond incredible!".|$|E
2500|$|The series' horror {{was mostly}} criticized; Henderson {{asserted}} [...] "it isn't really a horror title ... It's {{more of the}} psychological horror", while Wildsmith considered the stories were not [...] "scary enough to make this collection horror, nor are they thought provoking {{enough to make it}} a psychological thriller". Sherman said it [...] "isn't as unsettling as it could be: there are terrors, after all, which reflect the characters' primal fears, yet Esuno doesn't delve as deeply into 'em as he could". Most reviewers agreed it was not that scary, but at least featured [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "spooky" [...] moments. Santos felt that it [...] "would probably be a lot more horrifying ... if it didn't keep trying to be cute and funny with the characters", especially criticizing Hanako's role who [...] "make annoying quips that derail the creepy mood of the series". Zack Davisson of Japan Reviewed remarked that when it [...] "is playing with straight horror, it really shines" [...] so the second and third volumes were considered an improvement over the first as they relied less on [...] "cheap gags" [...] and [...] "panty-gags" [...] and [...] "deliver some actual horror". Ho also said it has [...] "an incredibly goofy sense of humour", and while Garrity concluded that [...] "promising blend of comedy and horror", the manga [...] "doesn't quite work as comedy or horror", some reviewers appreciated this humor and horror mix. Ed Sizemore of Comics Worth Reading affirmed it is a good reading for those who [...] "like light horror with sense of humor", and Henderson said it is [...] "a light read with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> the shiver factor".|$|E

[...] With breezy fatherliness which inspirited Una, he spoke of the {{possible}} presence of pneumococcus, of doing magic things with Romer's serum, of trusting in God, of the rain, of cold baths and digitalin. He patted Una's head and cheerily promised to return at dawn. He yawned and smiled at himself. He looked as roundly, fuzzily sleepy as a bunny rabbit, but in the quiet, forlorn room of night and illness he radiated trust in himself.

60|$|William {{came home}} again with his {{sweetheart}} at the Whitsuntide. He had one week of his holidays then. It was beautiful weather. As a rule, William and Lily and Paul {{went out in}} the morning together for a walk. William did not talk to his beloved much, except to tell her things from his boyhood. Paul talked endlessly to both of them. They lay down, all three, in a meadow by Minton Church. On one side, by the Castle Farm, was a beautiful quivering screen of poplars. Hawthorn was dropping from the hedges; penny daisies and ragged robin were in the field, like laughter. William, a big fellow of twenty-three, thinner now and even a bit gaunt, lay back in the sunshine and dreamed, while she fingered with his hair. Paul went gathering the big daisies. She had taken off her hat; her hair was black as a horse's mane. Paul came back and threaded daisies in her jet-black hair--big spangles of white and yellow, and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> pink <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> ragged robin.|$|R
3000|$|The {{capability}} {{to discriminate between}} two haptic stimuli is not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> sensitivity. While direct touch conveys cutaneous information about local surface features at the points of contact, probing movements (such as in hypertonia assessments) convey information mostly from proprioceptors [38]. The manner in which a user chooses to actively probe can influence the information gained {{and quality of the}} assessment. Visually impaired individuals use different exploration strategies which allow them to gain richer information content, and when sighted subjects are required to use similar strategies, their performance is radically improved [39]. Our haptic display is therefore a valuable tool to explore the haptic sensation of different neuro-mechanics and to determine the most informative probing motion(s) to be used in order to discriminate them [...]...|$|R

500|$|The {{video was}} ranked at number ten {{on a list}} of the ten most {{controversial}} music videos in pop music by AOL on September 29, 2011. Spears announced through her Twitter account on October 13, 2011, that the video would be released the following week. On October 17, 2011, she posted five GIF files with scenes from the video on her Tumblr. The video was released the same day on the iTunes Store; it reached the top position on its chart within minutes. Becky Bain of Idolator called it [...] "an epic mini-movie, full of romance, intrigue [...] a whole lot of unnecessary PDA between Brit and her beau. It was full of passion, joy and <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> madness — just like its star." [...] Bain also noted several influences, such as Alfred Hitchcock films and the music videos for Spears' [...] "Toxic" [...] (2004) and Green Day’s [...] "21 Guns" [...] (2009). A writer for Rolling Stone also compared it to a Hitchcock film and deemed the opening scene as [...] "a tribute to Old Hollywood". The reviewer found the scenes of physical abuse [...] "surprising" [...] and called the acting [...] "stiff", but said that [...] "from there on out, we're in the usual comfort zone of a Britney video – sexy dancing, sexy vamping – with the added bonus of gratuitous PDA between the pop star and her real-life boyfriend." ...|$|R
50|$|White {{begins by}} placing {{any of his}} tiles across the centre square. The players then take turns placing their pieces on the board, which is covered with numbers. Players must play within the white squares until they have {{achieved}} a score of 75 or more.The aim is to get as high a score as possible. Of the three pieces of each variety, one has an inscribed '2' above one square, and one has an inscribed '3' (the other is unmarked). When these pieces are played, the square on the board covered by the number written on the tile is multiplied by that number when it {{is added to the}} relevant player's score. Pieces may only be placed in positions where they are adjacent to (not <b>just</b> diagonally <b>touching)</b> <b>a</b> piece <b>of</b> either colour that has already been placed. The game ends when all 36 pieces have been placed on the board, and the highest score wins.|$|R

But too much care may lead to rebel of children. To prevent it from happening, a control application on mobile device will be very handful to every parents. Simple Launcher serves as a controlling app to ease the parents in monitoring their children' activities without interfering them and to check the record of their children when and where their children spent on past time. The methodology used in this project is Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Basically, Simple Launcher has PIN lock function that lock the app from the children. It can also filter the application which parents can select certain application installed {{to be allowed to}} their children to use. Furthermore, parents can use Simple Launcher to check the call log and message log to track their children' activities...|$|R

60|$|The {{first seven}} or eight months of our married life passed away happily enough. As soon as I was {{actually}} married to Césarine, that strange feeling I had at first experienced about her slowly wore off in the closer, commonplace, daily intercourse of married life. I almost smiled at myself for ever having felt it. Césarine was so beautiful and so queenly a person, that when I took her down home to Devonshire, and introduced her to the old manor, I really found myself immensely proud of her. Everybody at Teignbury was delighted and struck with her; and, what {{was a great deal}} more to the point, I began to discover that I was positively in love with her myself, into the bargain. She softened and melted immensely on nearer acquaintance; the Faustina air faded slowly away, when one saw her in her own home among her own occupations; and I came to look on her as a beautiful, simple, innocent girl, delighted with all our country pleasures, fond of a breezy canter on the slopes of Dartmoor, and taking an affectionate interest in the ducks and chickens, which I could hardly ever have conceived even as possible when I first saw her in Seymour Crescent. The imperious, mysterious, terrible Césarine disappeared entirely, and I found in her place, to my immense relief, that I had married a graceful, gentle, tender-hearted English girl, with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> pleasant occasional <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> southern fire and impetuosity.|$|R
5000|$|Thereafter, Walker {{appeared}} {{in all but}} one of Dutt's movies and the director encouraged him to ad lib and to draw on his varied life experiences. He was primarily an actor of comedic roles but towards {{the end of his life}} became disenchanted, saying, [...] "Earlier, comedians had a respectable position and an almost parallel role with the protagonist, now it is <b>just</b> to bring <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> humour. I don't buy that." [...] His attempts to portray heroic personae in the eponymous Johnny Walker and Mr. Quartoon were not successful but films such as Mere Mehboob, C.I.D., Pyaasa and Chori Chori made him a star. His heyday was in the 1950s and 1960s and his later career was affected by the death of Dutt, who had greatly influenced it, in 1964. He worked with directors such as Bimal Roy and Vijay Anand but his career faded in the 1980s. He was unwilling to adopt the cruder form of comedy and changed priorities that had become the vogue, saying that [...] "In those days we used to do clean comedy. We were aware that the person who had come to the cinema had come with his wife and children ... the story was the most important thing. Only after selecting a story would Abrar Alvi and Guru Dutt find suitable actors! Now it's all upside down ... they line up a big hero and find a story to fit in. The comedian has ceased to be a character, he's become something to fit in between scenes. ... I opted out because comedy had become hostage to vulgarity. I acted in 300 films and the Censor Board never cut even one line." ...|$|R
40|$|Gluing can be {{a highly}} {{efficient}} mechanism of prey capture, as it should require less complex sensory-muscular feedback. Whereas {{it is well known}} in insects, this mechanism is much less studied in arachnids, except spiders. Soil-dwelling harvestmen (Opiliones, Nemastomatidae) bear drumstick-like glandular hairs (clavate setae) at their pedipalps, which were previously hypothesized to be sticky and used in prey capture. However, clear evidence for this was lacking to date. Using high-speed videography, we found that the harvestman Mitostoma chrysomelas was able to capture fast-moving springtails (Collembola) <b>just</b> by <b>a</b> slight <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> the pedipalp. Adhesion of single clavate setae increased proportionally with pull-off velocity, from 1 μN at 1 μm s⁻¹ up to 7 μN at 1 mm s⁻¹, which corresponds to the typical weight of springtails. Stretched glue droplets exhibited characteristics of a viscoelastic fluid forming beads-on-a-string morphology over time, similar to spider capture threads and the sticky tentacles of carnivorous plants. These analogies indicate that viscoelasticity is a highly efficient mechanism for prey capture, as it holds stronger the faster the struggling prey moves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy of snap-frozen harvestmen with glued springtails revealed that the gluey secretions have a high affinity to wet the microstructured cuticle of collembolans, which was previously reported to be barely wettable for both polar and non-polar liquids. Glue droplets can be contaminated with the detached scaly setae of collembolans, which may represent a counter-adaptation against entrapment by the glue, similar to the scaly surfaces of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera (Insecta) facilitating escape from spider webs. 10 page(s...|$|R
