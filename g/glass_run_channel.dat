50|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> <b>channel</b> is a groove, {{normally}} made {{of rubber}} or plastic, that is found around windows (most commonly car windows). The {{primary purpose of}} a <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> <b>channel</b> {{is to provide a}} seal for the window.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWaist {{seals and}} <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> <b>channel</b> {{are used for}} sealing {{purposes}} of automotive opening windows. These seals also contribute in the acoustic performance of the system specifically in the 3 kHz frequency band known as the coincidence frequency. In this paper, we present the simulation of the acoustic transparency of a car window with seals around. In a first stage, the mounting of the seals around the windows is simulated by mean of a 2 D non linear static analysis {{in order to get}} the deformed and pre-stressed state of the seal. In a second stage, a 3 D mesh of the vibro-acoustic model is built. It is composed of the 600 x 600 x 4 mm glass surrounded by the seals. All components are meshed with volumic elements. A thickness of 10 cm air behind the glass is also meshed {{in order to get the}} radiated acoustic power at this distance allowing experimental-simulation comparisons. Infinite acoustic elements are finally added to simulate an infinite space. The window is excited by a diffused field. The acoustic transparency curves are presented up to 5200 Hz. Comparisons with tests show a good correlation and give confidence in the vibro-acoustic model for predictive purposes...|$|E

50|$|Car glass {{includes}} windscreens, {{side and}} rear windows, and glass panel roofs on a vehicle. Side windows {{can be either}} fixed or be raised and lowered by depressing a button (power window) or switch or using a hand-turned crank. The power moonroof, a transparent, retractable sunroof, may be considered {{as an extension of}} the power window concept. Some vehicles include sun blinds for rear and rear side windows. The window shield of a car is appropriate for safety and protection of debri in the road. It also comforts the driver as well. The majority of car glass is held in place by <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> <b>channels,</b> which also serve to contain any fragments of glass if the glass breaks.|$|R
50|$|EPM has a {{large number}} of uses due to the many ways in which the polymer can be designed, for example; it is used in {{automotive}} weather-stripping and seals, self-amalgamating tape, <b>glass</b> <b>run</b> <b>channels,</b> radiators, garden and appliance hoses, tubing, belts, roofing membranes, expansion joints, rubber mechanical goods, plastic impact modification, thermoplastic vulcanisates and motor oil additive applications. EPM is even more prevalent as an insulator for high-voltage cables since it has improved insulative characteristics over more traditional cables, such as cross-linked polyethylene, enabling a smaller cross sectional area for the same load carrying capacity. The cable is flexible and suited to applications where regular cable movement is required such as in the mining industry.|$|R
