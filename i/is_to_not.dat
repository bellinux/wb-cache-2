25|$|A third {{commonly}} used experiment used to demonstrate strong reciprocity preferences {{is the public}} goods game. In a public goods game, some number of participants are placed in a group. Each participant is given some amount of money. They are then allowed to contribute any of their allocation to a common pool. The common pool is then multiplied by some amount greater than one, then evenly redistributed to each participant, regardless of how much they contributed. In this game, for anyone trying to maximize their payoff, the rational nash equilibrium strategy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> contribute anything. However, in a 2001 study, Fischbacher observed average contributions of 33.5%.|$|E
25|$|Declarative {{programming}} languages {{describe what}} computation {{should be performed}} and not how to compute it. Declarative programs omit the control flow and are considered sets of instructions. Two broad categories of declarative languages are functional languages and logical languages. The principle behind functional languages (like Haskell) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> allow side effects, which {{makes it easier to}} reason about programs like mathematical functions. The principle behind logical languages (like Prolog) is to define the problem to be solved– the goal– and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself. The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is backtracked and another path is systematically attempted.|$|E
25|$|Despite the preeminence of Tikunei haZohar {{and despite}} the topmost {{priority}} of Torah study in Judaism, much of the Zohar has been relatively obscure and unread in the Jewish world in recent times, particularly outside of Israel and outside of Chasidic groups. Although some rabbis since the Shabbetai Tzvi debacle still maintain that one should be married and forty years old in order to study Kabbalah, {{since the time of}} Baal Shem Tov there has been relaxation of such stringency, and many maintain that it is sufficient to be married and knowledgeable in halakhah and hence permitted to study Kabbalah and by inclusion, Tikunei haZohar; and some rabbis will advise learning Kabbalah without restrictions of marriage or age. In any case the aim of such caution <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> become caught up in Kabbalah to the extent of departing from reality or halakhah.|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} stated, the Spanish government's policy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> request official membership. Despite {{being hit}} hard by the economic crisis after 2008, Spain is still the world's fourteenth largest economy by nominal GDP (the 5th in the European Union) and sixteenth largest by purchasing power parity, clearly exceeding the numbers of several current members of the G20 such as Argentina or South Africa. In addition, since the 1990s several Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America, where Spain is the second biggest foreign investor after the United States and keeps an important influence. These facts have reinforced the idea that Spain should seek permanent membership of the G20. On the other hand, Spain, which is a European country, is not a representation of Latin America, therefore some observers think another country from South America should be included as well as Argentina.|$|E
25|$|If {{the disks}} are {{connected}} to a RAID controller, it is most efficient to configure it as a HBA in JBOD mode (i.e. turn off RAID function). If a hardware RAID card is used, ZFS always detects all data corruption but cannot always repair data corruption because the hardware RAID card will interfere. Therefore, the recommendation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> use a hardware RAID card, or to flash a hardware RAID card into JBOD/IT mode. For ZFS {{to be able to}} guarantee data integrity, it needs to either have access to a RAID set (so all data is copied to at least two disks), or if one single disk is used, ZFS needs to enable redundancy (copies) which duplicates the data on the same logical drive. Using ZFS copies is a good feature to use on notebooks and desktop computers, since the disks are large and it at least provides some limited redundancy with just a single drive.|$|E

The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always, population growth has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use. The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels; that <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> exceed [...] "one planet" [...] consumption.
