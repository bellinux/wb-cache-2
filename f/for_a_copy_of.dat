5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her. On {{the way to the}} {{restaurant}} bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party room and eagerly snaps a picture of Homer and Kashmir. Bart brings the picture to school and gives a copy of it to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests from other students <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the picture. It is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees a copy of the picture at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves the picture in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals that it was his picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Plans for Armidas {{performance}} were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo {{died at the}} end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio {{was still}} asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy patron of the arts at whose Venetian palace Il combattimento had been performed in 1624.|$|E
5|$|After Clouzot's ban was lifted, he {{reestablished}} {{his reputation}} and popularity in France {{during the late}} 1940s with films such as Quai des Orfèvres and Manon. For Quai des Orfèvres, Clouzot asked the author Stanislas-André Steeman <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> his novel, Légitime défense, to adapt into a film. Clouzot started writing the script before the novel arrived for him to read. Quai des Orfèvres was released in 1947 and was the fourth most popular film in France, drawing 5.5million spectators in that year. Clouzot directed and wrote two films that were released in 1949. For Manon, he wanted to cast unknown actors. He scoured schools to find an actress for the lead role, and chose 17-year-old Cécile Aubry after viewing over 700 girls. Manon was released in 1948 and was watched by 3.4million filmgoers in France as well as winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Clouzot directed and wrote the short film Le Retour de Jean, {{which was part of}} anthology film Return to Life. Le Retour de Jean was influenced by the short period when Clouzot lived in Germany in the early 1930s and stars Louis Jouvet as a survivor of a concentration camp who finds a wounded Nazi war criminal whom he interrogates and tortures. Clouzot's next film was the comedy Miquette et Sa Mère, which was a financial failure. During the film's production, Clouzot met Véra Gibson-Amado, whom he married on 15 January 1950. Clouzot and Véra took a film crew with them to Véra's homeland in Brazil for their honeymoon, where Clouzot made his first attempt at directing a documentary film. The Brazilian government took issue with Clouzot filming the poverty of people in the favelas rather than the more picturesque parts of Brazil. The film was never finished because the costs became too high. Clouzot became fascinated with the region and wrote a book, Le cheval des dieux, recounting his trip.|$|E

Famed frontiersman and expeditionary photographer William Henry Jackson collaborated with Hebard as an illustrator in 1933 and 1934. He provided water colors and sketches for her unpublished manuscript.

25|$|Due to {{his long}} and {{difficult}} boxing career, Hardwick suffered from pugilistic dementia in his last years. In 1955, he wrote to the Navy asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> his discharge papers which he claimed were stolen with his Social Security card and was later admitted to the Veterans Administration Hospital in North Chicago. He died there on December 27, 1966 and is buried in Wood National Cemetery, section 36a, row 11, site 3, located {{in the state of}} Wisconsin. In 2011, Hardwick was inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2012.|$|E

25|$|The Scottish born German writer John Henry Mackay {{found out}} about Stirner while reading a copy of Friedrich Albert Lange's History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance. Later he looked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> The Ego and Its Own and after being fascinated with it he wrote a {{biography}} of Stirner (Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk), published in German in 1898. Mackay's propaganda of stirnerist egoism and of male homosexual and bisexual rights affected Adolf Brand who published the world's first ongoing homosexual publication, Der Eigene in 1896. Another later German anarchist publication influenced deeply by Stirner was Der Einzige. It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseud. for Salomo Friedlaender).|$|E
25|$|During this time, the FBI had {{intensified}} {{its efforts}} against the Gambino family, and in August 1983, {{three members of}} Gotti's crew – Angelo Ruggiero, John Carneglia, and Gene Gotti – were indicted for heroin trafficking. Castellano was against anyone in the family dealing narcotics. Castellano planned to kill Gene Gotti and Ruggiero if he believed they were drug traffickers. Castellano asked Ruggiero <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the government surveillance tapes that had Ruggiero's conversations. To save Gene Gotti and Ruggiero, Dellacroce stalled the demand. Eventually, {{one of the reasons}} for Gotti's killing Castellano was to save his brother and Ruggiero. The FBI had bugged Ruggiero's house and telephone, and Castellano decided he needed copies of the tapes to justify his impending move to Dellacroce and the family's other capos.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Rand was {{approached}} by the Russian-born actress Eugenie Leontovich, who had read We the Living and heard that an adaptation had been written. Like Rand, Leontovich came from a family that suffered after the revolution; her three brothers, {{who served in the}} anti-Communist White Army, were tortured and killed by the Bolsheviks. Leontovich asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the script, which she sent to her friend George Abbott, a successful Broadway producer. Abbott decided to produce and direct the adaptation; he hired scenic designer Boris Aronson, who like Rand and Leontovich was a Russian immigrant, to create the sets. Rand hoped the theatrical adaptation of her novel would create interest among Hollywood producers in doing a film version. This hope was bolstered when the Warner Bros. studio invested in the stage production.|$|E

500|$|John Lennon {{wrote the}} song in January 1966, with lyrics adapted from the book [...] by Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, and Ralph Metzner, which was in turn adapted from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Although Peter Brown {{believed}} that Lennon's source for the lyrics was the Tibetan Book of the Dead itself, which, he said, Lennon had read whilst {{under the influence of}} LSD, George Harrison later stated that the idea for the lyrics came from Leary, Alpert, and Metzner's book; Paul McCartney confirmed this, stating that when he and Lennon visited the newly opened Indica bookshop, Lennon had been looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> The Portable Nietzsche and found a copy of The Psychedelic Experience that contained the lines: [...] "Whenever in doubt, turn off your mind, relax, float downstream".|$|E

[...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] is MSNBCs fourth favorite episode, citing Homer's realization that Planet of the Apes is set on Earth as [...] "pure genius". Empire magazine named it a [...] "contender for greatest ever episode", and listed it as the third best movie parody in the show. In his book, Planet Simpson, Chris Turner names the episode as being one of his five favorites, saying it is [...] "second to none", despite listing [...] "Last Exit to Springfield" [...] as his favorite episode. He described the long sequence that begins with Homer eating potato chips in the space shuttle and ends with Kent Brockman's dramatic speech as being [...] "simply among the finest comedic moments {{in the history of}} television". The Daily Telegraph also named the episode among their ten favorites.|$|E
500|$|When Massey {{took over}} the Physics Department, most of his physicists, {{including}} Bates, Buckingham, Burhop and Robert Boyd, moved with him. Like the Mathematics Department, {{it was still in}} temporary accommodation owing to bomb damage during the war. A new building was under construction, but to develop the technical infrastructure, Massey hired Harry Tomlinson, who had worked for him in the British Mission in Berkeley. The Department acquired several accelerators, including a 20 MeV synchrotron from the Atomic Energy Authority. Dick Jennings and Franz Heymann built two microtrons. Under Massey, the Physics Department moved away from researching the physics of metals and liquids, and focused on [...] particle physics and upper atmosphere physics. Massey saw the potential of computers. He arranged with Andrew Booth <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> his All Purpose Electronic Computer, and recruited two programmers, Joan Lawson and Jane Wallace. When the University of London established a computing unit, Buckingham left to head it.|$|E

500|$|Hammerstein, meanwhile, was in Los Angeles at {{the filming}} of South Pacific. [...] While at the commissary, he met {{longtime}} friend, Joe Fields, who mentioned that he was negotiating {{for the rights to}} The Flower Drum Song. [...] Intrigued by the title, Hammerstein asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the novel, and decided that it had potential as a musical – the lyricist described it as [...] "sort of a Chinese Life with Father". [...] Hammerstein consulted with Rodgers, and they agreed to make it their next work, to be written and produced in association with Fields. [...] Hammerstein began work in mid-1958. [...] In July, however, he fell ill and was hospitalized for a month. [...] This forced him to hurry his writing, as the production team had hoped to have the show in rehearsal by the start of September; this was postponed by two weeks. [...] In interviews, however, Hammerstein pointed out that he had, when necessary, written songs for previous shows while in rehearsals for them.|$|E
500|$|The Mission Valley Viaduct was {{recognized}} by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) as the [...] "Outstanding Civil Engineering Project for 1973 in the San Diego Area"; {{it was designed to}} match the close-by Mission San Diego de Alcalá with its columns that look similar to cathedral windows, and arch-like shapes etched into the textured concrete. The viaduct was designed to span , and use squared-off support columns instead of traditional cylindrical supports. Octagonal columns were to be used on the ramps and the ends of the bridge. Over 600tons of steel bars were to be used, and the bridge was constructed as high as [...] above I-8. The Adams Avenue Bridge over I-805 was also recognized for its [...] span and two tapered supports on the ends of the bridge; in 1968, a Princeton University engineering professor asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> the design from Caltrans for educational purposes. The construction supervisor, in fact, compared the construction of this bridge to building a boat, and it was constructed from the middle outward rather than the conventional method of building from the ends inward. The span was designed to be [...] long, and [...] high.|$|E

He not only collected British works but imported Greek and Latin classics, and in 1790, he acquired the collection of Count Charles de Revicksky, paying an initial £1000, and then £500 annually until the count's death, only three years later. George often paid great fees for rare books, including a woodcut of St Christopher dated to 1423, believed {{at that time to}} be the oldest work in ink with a date on it, the Papal Indulgence Letters of 1452, the Mazarin Bible of 1455, the Mentz Psalter of 1457, and some of the earliest works form the printing presses of Augsburg and Nuremberg such as Bonaventurae and Comestiorum Vitiorum. In 1812, George John was involved in an intense bidding war with his cousin, The Duke of Marlborough, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> Boccacio's The Decameron of 1471, one of only three known copies.

500|$|In New Mexico, they {{obtained}} false identification, {{and purchased}} several pistols. Their {{intention was to}} purchase guns which were difficult to trace.

[...] Caldwell said she and Stork went to a university library to find the identity [...] "of someone dying very young", next went [...] "to public records and asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> a birth certificate" [...] and described how [...] "we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt".

The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus. Caldwell said that she and Stork traveled by bus back to the Rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors.|$|E
