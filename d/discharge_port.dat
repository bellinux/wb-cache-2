Paquette held the opinion that {{negligence}} caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said, [...] "in my opinion, all the subsequent events arose because (McSorley) kept pushing that ship and didn't have enough training in weather forecasting to use common sense and pick a route out of the worst of the wind and seas." [...] Paquette's vessel was the first to reach a <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> after the November 10 storm; she was met by company attorneys who came aboard Sykes. He told them that Fitzgeralds foundering was caused by negligence. Paquette was never asked to testify during the USCG or NTSB investigations.|$|E
500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, the bareboat charter, and {{contract}} of affreightment. In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the <b>discharge</b> <b>port.</b> In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments. A completed chartering contract {{is known as a}} charter party.|$|E
5000|$|Reciprocating pistons. As the {{cylinder}} block rotates, the exposed {{ends of the}} pistons are constrained to follow {{the surface of the}} cam plane. Since the cam plane is at an angle to the axis of rotation, the pistons must reciprocate axially as they precess about {{the cylinder}} block axis. The axial motion of the pistons is sinusoidal. During the rising portion of the piston's reciprocation cycle, the piston moves toward the valve plate. Also, during this time, the fluid trapped between the buried end of the piston and the valve plate is vented to the pump's <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> through one of the valve plate's semi-circular ports - the <b>discharge</b> <b>port.</b> As the piston moves toward the valve plate, fluid is pushed or displaced through the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> of the valve plate.|$|E

50|$|In a split volute or double volute pump, {{the path}} along the volute is partitioned, {{providing}} two distinct discharge paths.

50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the pump's inlet port. As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the pump's inlet to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the pumping chamber and inlet port is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> again and the pumping cycle starts over.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a simulation model developed {{to predict the}} performance of rolling-piston compressors with {{special attention to the}} suction and discharge processes. The relevant input data required by the model, such as clearances between moving parts, valve stiffness and natural frequency and electric motor efficiency, were obtained experimentally. Correlations for effective flow and force areas associated with the suction and discharge processes were derived from flow simulations. It was found that the position of the rolling piston in relation to the suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>ports</b> must be included to fully characterize the effective flow and force areas. Numerical predictions of the thermodynamic inefficiencies associated with a R 22 rolling-piston compressor were compared with measurements and good agreement was found at different operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve its}} working performance, the flow ripple {{characteristics}} of an axial piston pump were investigated with software which uses {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) technology. The simulation accuracy was significantly optimized {{through the use of}} the improved compressible fluid model. Flow conditions of the pump were tested using a pump flow ripple test rig, and the simulation results of the CFD model showed good agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, the composition of the flow ripple was analyzed using the improved CFD model, and the results showed that the compression ripple makes up 88 % of the flow ripple. The flow dynamics of the piston pump is mainly caused by the pressure difference between the intake and <b>discharge</b> <b>ports</b> of the valve plates and the fluid oil compressibility...|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of helical screw conveyor, solid bowl {{centrifuges}} separate two substances with different densities by the centrifugal force formed under fast rotation. Feed slurry enters the conveyor and is delivered into the rotating bowl through <b>discharge</b> <b>ports.</b> There is a slight speed difference between the rotation of conveyor and bowl, causing the solids to convey from the stationary zone where the wastewater is introduced to the bowl wall. By centrifugal force, the collected solids moves along the bowl wall, {{out of the pool}} and up the dewatering beach located at the tapered end of the bowl. At last the solids separated go to solid discharge while the liquids go to liquid discharge. The clarified liquid flows through the conveyor in the opposite direction through adjustable overflow parts.|$|R
5000|$|The volute of a {{centrifugal}} pump is the casing that receives the fluid being pumped by the impeller, {{slowing down the}} fluid's rate of flow. A volute is a curved funnel that increases in area as it approaches the <b>discharge</b> <b>port.</b> [...] The volute converts kinetic energy into pressure by reducing speed while increasing pressure, helping to balance the hydraulic pressure on the shaft of the pump.|$|E
5000|$|Once in the <b>discharge</b> <b>port,</b> {{the cargo}} is pumped ashore using the cargo pumps. As the tank empties, the vapour space is filled by either gas from ashore or by vaporising some cargo {{in the cargo}} vaporiser.

50|$|A {{flexible}} {{impeller pump}} is a positive-displacement pump that, by deforming impeller vanes, draws the liquid into the pump housing and moves {{it to the}} <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> with a constant flow rate. The flexibility of the vanes enables a tight seal to the internal housing, making the pump self-priming, while also permitting bi-directional operation. The output from these pumps tends to be smooth or gentle {{when compared to the}} operation of a reciprocating pump (for example). In 1938, Arthur M. Briggs filed a patent for this type of pump.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{suction process}} of a scroll {{compressor}} was investigated. The investigation started from the numerical simulation {{of the entire}} scroll compressor working process. The simulation included the upper main bearing housing, thrust plate, scrolls, dummy and <b>discharge</b> <b>ports,</b> check valve, plenum, and discharge line. The basic geometric features and physical mechan-isms that the scroll compressor performance is associated with were simulated first. The work-ing fluid was Refrigerant 134 a. The suction process was studied {{as a part of}} the integrated working environment. The fundamental mechanism of the suction process was defined. The interaction of the compressor design features was quantified. The overall parameters were cal-culated from the field quantities. The relationship between design details, flow physics, and per-formance characteristics was established. The methodology developed and the data obtained can be applied to the design and optimization of scroll compressors...|$|R
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{never have}} a suction valve, but depending on the application {{may or may not}} have a discharge valve. The use of a dynamic discharge valve is more prominent in high pressure ratio applications, typical of refrigeration. Typically, an air-conditioning scroll does not have a dynamic discharge valve. The use of a dynamic discharge valve improves scroll compressor efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions, when the operating pressure ratio is well above the built-in pressure ratio of the compressors. If the compressor is designed to operate near a single operating point, then the scroll compressor can actually gain efficiency around this point if there is no dynamic discharge valve present (since there are additional discharge flow losses associated with the presence of the discharge valve as well as <b>discharge</b> <b>ports</b> tend to be smaller when the discharge is present).|$|R
50|$|Shale shakers are {{the primary}} solids {{separation}} tool on a rig.

Once processed by the shale shakers the drilling fluid is deposited into the mud tanks where other solid control equipment begin to remove the finer solids from it. The solids removed by the shale shaker are discharged out of the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> into a separate holding tank where they await further treatment or disposal.|$|E

The refrigerating fluid is sometimes also circulated in a jacket around the trough. Crystals precipitate on the cold surfaces of the screw/discs, from which they are removed by scrapers and settle {{on the bottom of}} the trough. The screw, if provided, pushes the slurry towards a <b>discharge</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Semi-submersible {{ships were}} {{developed}} to move large (project) cargoes, but have now been adapted for yacht shipping. These ships are semi-submersible. This means that by ballasting, they can submerge their cargo holds. Yachts motor under their own power into the flooded cargo holds to load. Once all the yachts are in position and secured, divers weld hull supports into place. The ship deballasts and sails away.

50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and <b>discharge</b> <b>ports,</b> to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|R
40|$|For a given ocean outfall, {{improvement}} of dispersal of sewage effluent {{is accomplished by}} use of a multiple jet manifold or diffuser {{at the end of}} the outfall sewer. If the sewage is discharged at a single port or "en masse", its dispersion and dilution will be slower than if it is discharged over a large area through a number of ports, as explained in the preceding lecture. In fact, without the use of multiple-outlet diffusers, other conditions being equal, much longer outfalls into deeper water are necessary to provide the same degree of dispersion and consequent shore protection. An effective and simple type of diffuser is one which distributes the outflow through many ports over a large area with minimum head loss. The following discussion presumes a diffuser consisting of one long pipe, or several branching ones, with <b>discharge</b> <b>ports</b> at intervals along the pipes...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{mechanism}} of the novel rotary spool compressor has been described previously by Kemp (2008, 2010). The device combines various aspects of rotary and reciprocating devices currently well understood. A dimensionless variable, the Zsoro number, was developed which represents the geometric configuration of the compressor and has been described previously by Orosz (2012). This number in combination with extensive numerical modeling as described by Bradshaw (2012) has allowed for continued improvement in the spool compressors efficiency and operating range. Compressors tested have nominal capacities on R 410 a between 1 and 5 tons of cooling capacity at standard air conditioning conditions. A new platform with improved aspect ratio based on these analysis has been constructed and tested as well as optimization of sub-components such as the tip seals, side seals and <b>discharge</b> <b>porting.</b> Improvements in performance will be presented as well comparison to currently available technologies...|$|R
