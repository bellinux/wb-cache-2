This paper is mainly focused on the application of two of the Altman models (the revised model of 1983 and the revised model of 1993) to firms that operate in Albania, to see how its models can predict the future of Albanian firms. To assess the accuracy and the possibility of applying these models in the case of Albania, the study includes 80 firms (large firms) that operate in the service sector. To classify bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms, this study is based on the Albanian legislation on bankruptcy (Law no. 8901), according to which bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in case of a state of insolvency, when the firm is overburdened with debts or when the <b>earnings</b> <b>after</b> <b>tax</b> of the firm is negative for a period of 3 years. According to the Albanian legislation on bankruptcy, 24 (from 80) firms involved in the study result legally bankrupt. The first revised model (The 1983 model) of Altman predicts accurately these firms by 75 %. Regarding the non-bankrupt firms (according to Albanian legislation on bankruptcy) inaccuracy in the forecast is even higher than in the case of bankrupt firms. From 56 non-bankrupt firms involved in the study, 23 are classified as insolvent company under the first revised model of Altman, while these firms are not bankrupt. In case of application of the second revised model of Altman (The 1993 model) the results are consistent with the results of the first model in terms of bankrupt firms. Meanwhile, what is striking is the significant reduction in the percentage of Type II error (from 41 % to 23 %) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} the implementation in Greece {{of a type}} of poll tax, namely the ‘trad ing duty’. In the past, the poll tax was chiefly a fixed tax charge applied to an individual, irrespective of the latter's income, property and consumer expenditure. Similarly, the ‘trading duty’ is a fixed tax levy which runs contrary to modern perceptions of society as a who le regard ing proportional and progressive taxation. Nowadays, a fair d istribution of the tax burden must be characterized by both horizontal and vertical tax equality. The principles of universality of taxation, taxation equality, justice and certainty and the princ ip le that no tax measures should be retroactive are embodied in the Greek Constitution. In Greece, {{the last three years}} have seen the approval of numerous tax laws, non-tax laws containing artic les on tax provis ions and Ministry of Finance decisions and decrees, while, in 2012, for the first time after many decades, all sectors of the economy are ‘in the red’. Despite the gloomy financ ial environment in Greece, in fiscal year 2012 a type of poll tax was imposed as a ‘trading duty’ for traders who filed Natural Person Income Tax (NPIT) returns. The implementation of the ‘trading duty’ allows for an extension from the terms ‘Operating Leverage’ (OL) and ‘Financial Leverage’ (FL) to the term ‘Tax Leverage’ (TL). Thus, when a percentage change in Earnings Before Tax (EBT) trans lates into growth of <b>Earnings</b> <b>After</b> <b>Tax</b> (EAT), then the phenomenon of the magnifying effect may be called Tax Leverage (TL) and it will be due to the possible constancy of the tax burden (e. g. trading duty, poll tax). In this study, through a detailed examp le, financ ial results (Degrees of Operating, Financial and Tax Leverage) determined at different levels of sales volume exhib it similar financial characteristics. Statistically they show linearity and a strong correlation, which create reasonable grounds for introducing a new termino logy in F inance. We consider it a given that OL is determined to a large extent by techno logy and can increase or decrease as a result of decisions relating to the investment budget. Furthermore, FL is positively related to the profitab ility of Assets, when EBIT/Assets>Borrowing Costs. Then, {{on the basis of the}} data and limitations of this study, TL is positively related to the profitab ility of Assets, when EBT/Assets>Tax Costs, while the Degree of Tax Leverage and the size of EAT are directly related accordingly. Lastly, a specific degree of combined leverage can be achieved through a different mix of OL, FL and TL, in order to offset any negative results that may arise from one of the three...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{give an account}} of {{extensive}} research into the Icelandic income distribution that we have undertaken in recent years. We place our research into context with previous research. The main novelty of this paper is new data and new decompositional analysis of the drivers of inequality developments, before and after the financial collapse. Our research shows that income inequality increased greatly from 1995 to 2007, following a period of increased equality from 1988 to 1993. The extent of the increase after 1995 was exceptional by international standards. The increased inequality is most marked when all disposable <b>earnings</b> (<b>after</b> <b>tax)</b> are taken account of, but it is also extensive even though financial earnings are partly or fully excluded. Employment earnings also became more unequally distributed. Tax policy increased the extent of inequality in the same period. After the financial collapse of 2008 the income distribution became significantly more equal up to 2010. New comparison of income inequality developments in the Nordic countries shows that inequality increased in all of them from 1995 to 2008, varying though between countries and years. The Nordic nations had the most equal income distributions before the period of change and still remain amongst the most equal. Iceland however galloped way ahead in the inequality development from 2001 up to 2007. The hypotheses of no significant changes in the Icelandic income distribution between 1995 and 2007 are rejected. No valid data supports such claims.

Helstu nýmæli greinarinnar eru ný gögn og ítarleg sundurgreining áhrifavalda ójafnaðarþróunarinnar, fyrir og eftir hrun. Niðurstöður sýna að tekjuskiptingin varð ójafnari frá og með árinu 1995 og allt til 2007, eftir tímabil aukins jöfnuðar frá 1988 til 1993. Umfang breytinganna frá 1995 var óvenjumikið á alþjóðavísu. Aukning ójafnaðar er mest þegar allar tekjur eru meðtaldar (ráðstöfunartekjur eftir skatt) en einnig miklar þó fjármagnstekjum sé sleppt að hluta eða alveg. Atvinnutekjur urðu líka ójafnari, þótt í minna mæli væri. Skattastefnan jók umfang ójafnaðar með umtalsverðum hætti á tímabilinu fyrir hrun. Á árinu 2008 til 2010 snerist þróunin við og tekjuskiptingin varð aftur mun jafnari. Nýr samanburður á þróun ójafnaðar ráðstöfunartekna á Norðurlöndunum fimm frá 1995 til 2008 sýnir að ójöfnuður jókst umtalsvert í öllum löndunum, þó að mishratt væri og nokkrar sveiflur séu milli ára.

While it is commonly accepted that price per earnings ratio and corporate earnings are the main determinants of stock market returns, this assertion may not hold equally for monthly and daily stock returns. In addition, does this assertion hold equally for stock returns regardless {{of the stock market}} index? This work uses nonparametric spectral estimation to study the underlying properties of stock returns and uses monthly corporate <b>earnings</b> (corporate profits <b>after</b> <b>tax)</b> and 3 -month Treasury bill interest rate (proxy for price per earnings ratio) to forecast the monthly stock returns of S&P 500, DJIA, and NASDAQ indices. Since corporate earnings are issued quarterly, this data set had to be interpolated to produce the monthly corporate earnings. Overall, the analyses and forecasting were facilitated with both statistical and digital signal processing techniques. Some examples of the techniques used include Hurst exponent to determine predictability, nonparametric spectral estimation to determine the underlying properties of the stock returns, and correlation and root mean square error to determine the forecasting accuracy. The results of this study provide evidence to support that economic and financial time series such as interest rates, corporate earnings, and stock market returns are time varying and nonGaussian with smooth compactly supported and essentially bandlimited power spectral density estimates. It further shows that the forecasts of the different stock market returns align well with the desired values and the S&P 500 forecasted stock returns were the best...|$|R
