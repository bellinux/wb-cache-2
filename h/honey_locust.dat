25|$|The seed coat {{develops}} {{from the}} maternal tissue, the integuments, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed {{can be a}} paper-thin layer (e.g. peanut) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in <b>honey</b> <b>locust</b> and coconut), or fleshy as in the sarcotesta of pomegranate. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury, predators and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either bitegmic or unitegmic. Bitegmic seeds form a testa from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually parts of the testa or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of lignified sclereids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Honey</b> <b>locusts,</b> Gleditsia triacanthos, {{can reach}} {{a height of}} 20 - 30 m, with fast growth, and are {{relatively}} short-lived; their life spans are typically about 120 years, though some live up to 150 years. They are prone to losing large branches in windstorms. The leaves are pinnately compound on older trees but bipinnately compound on vigorous young trees. The leaflets are 1.5 - 2.5 cm (smaller on bipinnate leaves) and bright green. They turn yellow in the fall (autumn). <b>Honey</b> <b>locusts</b> leaf out relatively late in spring, but generally slightly earlier than the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). The strongly scented cream-colored flowers appear in late spring, in clusters emerging {{from the base of}} the leaf axils.|$|R

25|$|Besides {{topographical}} settings, {{the environment}} of the Lake George site was extremely favorable for occupation. In prehistoric times the rich soils and the varying ecologies supported a vast array of plant and animal species. The natural levees created by deposits from the Mississippi were made of rich sandy and silty loams which allowed the common Southeastern deciduous hardwoods, such as hickory, elm, ash, cottonwood, maple, pecan, hackberry, <b>honey</b> <b>locust,</b> sycamore, and even gums and oaks to flourish. The swamps surrounding the site supported an entirely different ecosystem including alligators, small reptiles and aquatic plants. The streams and rivers also provided fish, shellfish, and other aquatic fauna, which can be seen from excavations of shell middens and deposits of the site. These waterways also provided a major form of communication. This abundant region was obviously utilized by many different peoples over the course of prehistory as the Holly Bluff Site shows.|$|E

40|$|In honey, {{the content}} of proteins, {{including}} the enzymes, is relatively low and has a minor nutritive significance. On the other hand, the proteins, including the enzymes, are usually used as honey quality evaluation parameters. This is because protein content and enzyme activities vary regarding the botanical origin of the honey. Since the results of protein content, glucose-oxidase, and acid phosphatase, for honeys produced in Croatia, are not available, four of the most abundant honey types produced in Croatia (black locust, sage, chestnut, and honeydew honey) are characterised according to the protein and proline content and enzyme activities. The characterisation was done to determine specificities {{and contribute to the}} characterisation of unifloral honeys. Dark honey types (honeydew and chestnut honey) had a higher proline content, and diastase, invertase, and glucose-oxidase activity than lighter sage and black <b>locust</b> <b>honey.</b> Black <b>locust</b> <b>honey</b> has a naturally low enzyme activity and showed the highest acid phosphatase activity among the analysed honey types, while honeydew honey, otherwise known to possess high proline content and enzyme activity, had a low protein content comparable to black <b>locust</b> <b>honey.</b> Statistically significant correlations were obtained between all analysed parameters, with the exception of acid phosphatase activity...|$|R

50|$|Black locust {{is a major}} {{honey plant}} in the eastern US, and has been planted in European countries. In many European countries, it {{is the source of}} the renowned acacia honey.

30|$|Previous {{workers have}} {{observed}} that rural households in Nigeria derived up to 80 % of their incomes from the sales of NTFPs (Jimoh et al. 2013). In addition, Ogunsawa and Ajala (2002) and Zaku et al. (2013) reported that over 70 % of the country’s households depend directly on fuelwood as their main sources of energy, with daily consumption estimated at 27.5 million kg/day. Thus, harvesting and processing of NTFPs in many areas in the country have shifted from subsistence exploitation and sales at the local markets to international cross-boundary trade. For example, in the high forest zones of Eastern and Western Nigeria, harvesting of game meat and snails for sales are now major income generating activities almost all year round (Onuche 2011). While in the Savannah zone of Central and Northern Nigeria, <b>honey,</b> fuelwood, <b>locust</b> bean seeds, gum arabic, and charcoal production generate lots of incomes for the rural households (Jimoh and Haruna 2007; Jimoh et al. 2013).

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and sensory characteristics vary significantly within different honey types. In {{order to determine}} botanical origin of honey, {{it is necessary to}} conduct rather complicated and time consuming analytical methods. IR spectroscopy has not yet been experimentally explored for honey analysis in Croatia, so the aim {{of this study was to}} determine claimed botanical origin of honey using both, standard and alternative (IR spectroscopy) methods, for the purpose of their comparison, Altogether 144 samples of nine different unifloral <b>honey</b> types (black <b>locust,</b> sweet chestnut, lime, sage, heath, rosemary, lavender, mandarin and strawberry tree) were collected from different Croatian regions directly from the beekeepers. In order to confirm claimed botanical origin of collected honey samples, melissopalinological analysis, moisture and electrical conductivity measurements were conducted. Infrared spectra of honey samples were recorded using the ABB Bomem MB 102 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR spectrometer). Selected IR spectral regions were analyzed by multivariate data analysis, principal components analysis (PCA). Preliminary PCA of IR spectra showed significant clustering of the analyzed samples by botanical origin. The results of this study showed that IR spectroscopy provides reliable results, but also represents rapid and cheap analytical tool in comparison to commonly used standard analytical methods.
