5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This {{was overcome by}} reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> engine to the sides. The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing737 with CFM56 engines.|$|E
5|$|The beam {{of light}} seen shining <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> UFO in the episode was {{achieved}} by compositing several shots together, with elements including a crane carrying a spotlight—borrowed from the Canadian Coast Guard—and the spray from an aerosol combined to create the final shot.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 probe {{observed}} in 1989 {{a handful of}} geyser-like eruptions of nitrogen gas and entrained dust <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> surface of Triton in plumes up to 8km high. Triton is thus, along with Earth, Io, and Enceladus, {{one of the few}} bodies in the Solar System on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed. The best-observed examples are named Hili and Mahilani (after a Zulu water sprite and a Tongan sea spirit, respectively).|$|E

5|$|The high intelligence, {{initiative}} and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who during a 2001 emergency placed an unconscious {{human being in}} the recovery position, retrieved his mobile phone <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> car, fetched a blanket and covered him, barked at nearby dwellings for assistance, and then ran to a nearby hotel to obtain help. A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{design is}} based on cantilevered, {{prefabricated}} steel roof and terrace structuring. It is an all-seater arena with a seating capacity of 24,826. The stands are rectangular and both {{the northern and southern}} stands have supporting steel girders suspended <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> roof. The four stands are of approximately the same height, however the stadium is not totally enclosed, leaving four exposed corners.|$|E
5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E

5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
5|$|Mulder finds Scully {{underground}} in Antarctica, {{in a large}} facility containing many {{humans in}} ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully's confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. Just after the agents escape to the surface, a huge alien vessel emerges <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains consciousness. Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up. She hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal, the bee that stung her, noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas; Scully informs Mulder that she is willing to continue working with him.|$|E
5|$|Multistage rocket: Although {{there is}} still some {{ambiguity}} as to whether the earliest rockets of the 13th century were first developed in Europe (i.e. 'ignis volantis in aere' in the work of Marcus Graecus around 1232, although Needham and Davis assert it was most likely a fire lance), the Middle East (i.e. 'sahm al-Khitāi' or 'arrows of China' as referred to by Hasan al-Rhammāh in 1280) or China (i.e. 'di lao shu' or 'ground rat' mentioned in 1264 or the 'chong' mortar used by the armies of the Song Dynasty and invading Mongols during the 1270s), during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) the term 'fire arrow' once implied to mean incendiary arrows during the Tang Dynasty was then used to describe the true rocket, producing a headache, as Needham says, for historians; the Huolongjing written by military officer Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and the Song dynasty Chinese philosopher and politician Liu Bowen (1311–1375) during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) described several types of rockets, one of them being a multistage rocket known as the 'huo long chu shui' or 'fire dragon issuing from the water' which, despite its name, was not launched <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> water from a primitive submarine but rather at near water-level maintaining a flat trajectory; defined as a two-stage rocket, it employed booster rockets that, when about to burn out of use, ignited a swarm of smaller rocket arrows fired from {{the front end of the}} missile shaped as a dragon's mouth.|$|E

25|$|Shakespeare's pen {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} stolen and replaced since, and the paint has been renewed.

25|$|Fresh water {{remains a}} concern of Kiribati – {{during the dry season}} (Aumaiaki), water has been drilled for instead of using rain water tanks. In recent years, there has been a longer than usual Aumaikai season {{resulting}} in additional water having to be drilled <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> water table. This has introduced water-borne illnesses, compounding the health problems within Kiribati.|$|E

25|$|The {{landscape}} of Wales has assumed its present shape {{over the last}} 2.6 million years i.e. during the Quaternary period which reaches to the present day.

25|$|Dark-halo craters {{are formed}} when an impact excavates lower albedo {{material}} <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> surface, then deposits this darker ejecta around the main crater. This can occur when {{an area of}} darker basaltic material, such as that found on the maria, is later covered by lighter ejecta derived from more distant impacts in the highlands. This covering conceals the darker material below, which is later excavated by subsequent craters.|$|E
