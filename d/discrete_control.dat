40|$|An {{optimal control}} problem is considered, for systems {{governed by a}} {{nonlinear}} elliptic partial differential equation, with control and state constraints. Since this problem may have no classical solutions, it is also formulated in the relaxed form. The classical problem is discretized by using a finite element method, where the controls are approximated by elementwise constant, linear, or multilinear, controls. Our first result is that strong accumulation points in L 2 of sequences of admissible and extremal <b>discrete</b> <b>controls</b> are admissible and weakly extremal classical for the continuous classical problem, and that relaxed accumulation points of sequences of admissible and extremal <b>discrete</b> <b>controls</b> are admissible and weakly extremal relaxed for the continuous relaxed problem. We then propose a penalized gradient projection method, applied to the discrete problem, and a corresponding discretization-optimization method, applied to the continuous classical problem, that progressively refines the discretization during the iterations, thus reducing computing time and memory. We prove that accumulation points of sequences generated by the first method are admissible and extremal for the discrete problem, and that strong classical (resp. relaxed) accumulation points of sequences of <b>discrete</b> <b>controls</b> generated by the second method are admissible and weakly extremal classical (resp. relaxed) for the continuous classical (resp. relaxed) problem.

40|$|We {{consider}} an optimal control problem described by semilinear parabolic partial differential equations, with control and state constraints. Since this problem {{may have no}} classical solutions, it is also formulated in the relaxed form. The classical control problem is then discretized by using a finite element method in space and the implicit Crank-Nicolson midpoint scheme in time, while the controls are approximated by classical controls that are bilinear on pairs of blocks. We prove that strong accumulation points in L- 2 of sequences of optimal (resp. admissible and extremal) <b>discrete</b> <b>controls</b> are optimal (resp. admissible and weakly extremal classical) for the continuous classical problem, and that relaxed accumulation points of sequences of optimal (resp. admissible and extremal relaxed) <b>discrete</b> <b>controls</b> are optimal (resp. admissible and weakly extremal relaxed) for the continuous relaxed problem. We then apply a penalized gradient projection method to each discrete problem, and also a progressively refining version of the discrete method to the continuous classical problem. Under appropriate assumptions, we prove that accumulation points of sequences generated by the first method are admissible and extremal for the discrete problem, and that strong classical (resp. relaxed) accumulation points of sequences of <b>discrete</b> <b>controls</b> generated by the second method are admissible and weakly extremal classical (resp. relaxed) for the continuous classical (resp. relaxed) problem. For nonconvex problems whose solutions are non-classical, we show that we can apply the above methods to the problem formulated in Camkrelidze relaxed form.

40|$|We study {{a zero-sum}} {{differential}} game with hybrid controls {{in which both}} players are allowed to use continuous as well as <b>discrete</b> <b>controls.</b> <b>Discrete</b> <b>controls</b> act on the system at a given set interface. The state {{of the system is}} changed discontinuously when the trajectory hits predefined sets, an autonomous jump set A or a controlled jump set C, where one controller can choose to jump or not. At each jump, the trajectory can move to a different Euclidean space. One player uses all the three types of controls, namely, continuous controls, autonomous jumps, and controlled jumps; the other player uses continuous controls and autonomous jumps. We prove the continuity of the associated lower and upper value functions $V^{−}$ and $V^{+}$. Using the dynamic programming principle satisfied by $V^{−}$ and $V^{+}$, we derive lower and upper quasivariational inequalities satisfied in the viscosity sense.
