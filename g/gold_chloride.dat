25|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>chloride</b> is {{dissolved}} in water, mixed with other chemicals and poured on clean glass {{that has been}} treated with stannous chloride. The gold layer is delicate and usually translucent. To make an opaque, affordable and adherent mirror, a layer of silver is deposited over the gold. Glass gilders use the term 'angel gilding' to distinguish the chemical process from gold leaf gilding also known as verre églomisé.|$|E
25|$|Justus von Liebig, widely {{credited}} with inventing the modern process for silvering glass, also worked on gilding glass with <b>gold</b> <b>chloride.</b> James Pratt, a British glass worker, {{was the first}} to realize that he could make affordable gold mirrors by depositing a layer of silver on top of the gold. He was granted a British patent in 1885. Gold mirrors and gold mirrored signs were very popular in English public houses (pubs) in the late Victorian era and many wonderful examples of the art can be found all over Britain today. Felix Andres, a sign painter in San Francisco, introduced a process for spray gilding glass in 1923, but the fashion for elaborate detail in signs was changing to the modern neon style and his business was not successful.|$|E
2500|$|In 1879, Dr. Leslie Keeley {{announced}} {{the result of}} a collaboration with John R. Oughton, which was heralded as a [...] "major discovery" [...] by Keeley. The discovery, a new treatment for alcoholism—developed from a partnership with John Oughton, an Irish chemist, and a merchant named Curtis Judd—resulted in the founding of the Keeley Institute. The institute's work was pioneering in its field; Keeley aimed to treat alcoholism as a disease rather than as a vice. Keeley managed to amass a fortune, becoming a millionaire through the institute and its famous slogan, [...] "Drunkenness is a disease and I can cure it." [...] The Keeley Institute eventually had over 200 branches throughout the United States and Europe, and by 1900, the so-called Keeley Cure, injections of <b>gold</b> <b>chloride,</b> had been administered to more than 300,000 people. After 1900, the patient numbers were lower with 100,000 additional people taking the cure between 1900 and 1939.|$|E

40|$|Prussian blue analogues are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} formed by the reaction between metal salt and potassium hexacyanoferrate (II/III). In our earlier report, the formation of Au@Prussian blue nano-composite was noticed on potential cycling the glassy carbon electrode in a medium containing <b>gold</b> (III) <b>chloride</b> and potassium hexacyanoferrate (III). Hence in this work, the formation of gold hexacyanoferrate was attempted by a simple chemical reaction. The reaction of <b>gold</b> (III) <b>chloride</b> with potassium hexacyanoferrate (II/III) was examined by UV–Vis spectroscopy and found {{that there is no}} redox reaction between <b>gold</b> (III) <b>chloride</b> and potassium hexacyanoferrate (III). However, the redox reaction occurs between <b>gold</b> (III) <b>chloride</b> and potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) leading to the formation of charge transfer band and the conversion of hexacyanoferrate (II) to hexacyanoferrate (III) was evidenced by the emergence of new absorption peaks in UV–Vis spectra. The oxidation state of gold in Au–Fe complex was found to be + 1 from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The stability of the Au–Fe complex was also studied by cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetric results indicated the presence of high spin iron in Au–Fe complex. Hence ‘as formed’ Au complex may be KFex[Au(CN) 2]y. The results revealed that the formation of gold hexacyanoferrate was not feasible by simple chemical or electrochemical reaction in contrast to other Prussian blue analogue...|$|R
