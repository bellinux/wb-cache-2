5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the <b>extra</b> point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an <b>extra</b> point the placekick must be kicked at the 15-yard line and on <b>extra</b> points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed <b>extra</b> point or two-point conversion attempt. In general, the <b>extra</b> point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, <b>extra</b> point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.|$|E
