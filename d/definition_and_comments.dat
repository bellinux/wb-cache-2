In spite of enormous effort geared towards AI, its boundary and interference to other fields are yet undefined. The controversy in AI’s boundary has bred some concepts which are in no practical sense different from the goal of AI. Most of these concepts are; computational intelligence (CI), soft computing (SC), natural computing (NC), machine learning (ML), approximating reasoning (AR), fuzzy logic (FL) and adaptive computing (AC). There is still not an objective boundary of these concepts. This paper investigates the conceptual controversies between AI and CI.

Many of these prescriptions do not benefit patients and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Research to improve evidence-based management requires clear definitions of clinical entities. We aimed to generate definitions for common LRTIs that are applicable to clinical practice and low-intensity investigation research settings in European primary care. Methods: Candidate definitions identified through a systematic review and a nominal group meeting were put to a Delphi panel of selected experts from Europe and the US over three rounds. The definitions achieving high consensus were then tested for face validity by an expert panel. Results: 253 papers met our search criteria. The nominal group meeting generated highly-ranked definitions for two LRTIs.

Unfortunately, unwanted immunogenic responses to BPs, in particular those affecting clinical safety or efficacy, remain among the most common negative effects associated with this important class of drugs. To manage and reduce risk of unwanted immunogenicity, diverse communities of clinicians, pharmaceutical industry and academic scientists are involved in: interpretation and management of clinical and biological outcomes of BP immunogenicity, improvement of methods for describing, predicting and mitigating immunogenicity risk and elucidation of underlying causes.

40|$|Bose-Einstein {{condensation}} and {{the related}} topic of Gross-Pitaevskii equation have become {{an important source of}} models and problems in mathematical physics and analysis. In particular, in the last decade, the interest in low-dimensional systems that evolve through the nonlinear Schroedinger equation has undergone an impressive growth. The reason is twofold: on the one hand, effectively one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates are currently realized, and the investigation on their dynamics isnowadays a well-developed field for experimentalists. On the other hand, in contrast to its higher-dimensional analogous,the one-dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger equation allows explicit solutions, that simplify remarkably the analysis. The recentliterature reveals an increasing interest for the dynamics ofnonlinear systems in the presence of so-called defects, namelymicroscopic scatterers, which model the presence of impurities. We review here some recent achievements on such systems, withparticular attention to the cases of the ``Dirac's delta'' and ``delta prime'' defects. We give rigorous <b>definitions,</b> recall <b>and</b> <b>comment</b> on known results for the delta case, and introduce new results for the delta prime case.

40|$|In {{focus point}} supersymmetry, all squarks and sleptons, {{including}} those of the third generation, have multi-TeV masses without sacrificing naturalness. We examine the implications of this framework for low energy constraints and the light Higgs boson mass. Undesirable contributions to proton decay and electric dipole moments, generic in many supersymmetric models, are strongly suppressed. As a result, the prediction for alpha_s in simple grand unified theories is 3 to 5 standard deviations closer to the experimental value, and the allowed CP-violating phases are larger by one to two orders of magnitude. In addition, the very heavy top and bottom squarks of focus point supersymmetry naturally produce a Higgs boson mass at or above 115 GeV without requiring heavy gauginos.

Methods: We used a mixed-methods approach that included a literature analysis and a consensus procedure, including an interdisciplinary expert panel and surveys, to develop a comprehensive <b>and</b> acceptable <b>definition</b> for the term “integrative oncology. ” Results: The themes identified in the literature and from the expert discussion were condensed into a two-sentence definition.

40|$|In {{geometrical}} metrology, morphological {{filters are}} useful tools for the surface texture analysis and functional prediction. Although {{they are generally}} accepted and regarded as the complement to mean-line based filters, they are not universally adopted in practice due {{to a number of}} fatal limitations in their implementations —they are restricted to planar surfaces, uniform sampled surfaces, time-consuming and suffered from end distortions and limited sizes of structuring elements. A novel morphological method is proposed based on the alpha shape with the advantages over traditional methods that it enables arbitrary large ball radii, and applies to freeform surfaces and non-uniform sampled surfaces. A practical algorithm is developed based on the theoretical link between the alpha hull and morphological envelopes. The performance bottleneck due to the costly 3 D Delaunay triangulation is solved by the divide-and-conquer optimization. Aiming to overcome the deficits of the alpha shape method that the structuring element has to be circular and the computation relies on the Delaunay triangulation, a set of <b>definitions,</b> propositions <b>and</b> <b>comments</b> for searching contact points is proposed and mathematically proved based on alpha shape theory, followed by the construction of a recursive algorithm. The algorithm could precisely capture contact points without performing the Delaunay triangulation. By correlating the convex hull and morphological envelopes, the Graham scan algorithm, originally developed for the convex hull, is modified to compute morphological profile envelopes with an excellent performance achieved. The three novel methods along with the two traditional methods are compared and analyzed to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages. The end effects of morphological filtration on open surfaces are discussed and four end effect correction methods are explored. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of using the proposed discrete algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Whereas newer machine {{learning}} techniques, like artifficial neural net-works and support vector machines, have shown superior performance in various benchmarking studies, {{the application of}} these techniques remains largely restricted to research environments. A more widespread adoption of these techniques is foiled by their lack of explanation capability which is required in some application areas, like medical diagnosis or credit scoring. To overcome this restriction, various algorithms have been proposed to extract a meaningful description of the underlying `blackbox' models. These algorithms' dual goal is to mimic {{the behavior of the}} black box as closely as possible {{while at the same time}} they have to ensure that the extracted description is maximally comprehensible. In this research report, we first develop a formal <b>definition</b> of`rule extraction <b>and</b> <b>comment</b> on the inherent trade-off between accuracy and comprehensibility.
