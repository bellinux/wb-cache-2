At the receiver side, a joint sequence maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector is used to exploit {{the correlation between the}} two sources as well as the redundancy left in the quantizer’s indices, the channel’s soft-decision outputs, and noise memory. The MAC’s sub-channels are modeled via non-binary Markov noise discrete channels recently shown to effectively represent point-to-point fading channels. For the simple case of quantizing the sources with two levels, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the joint sequence MAP decoder can be reduced to a simple instantaneous symbol-by-symbol decoder. Then, using numerical results obtained by system simulation, it is observed that when the sources are highly correlated and soft-decision quantization is used, JSCC can profit from a high correlation in the channel noise process and provide significant signal-to-distortion ratio improvements of up to 6. 3 dB over a fully <b>interleaved</b> <b>channel.</b> Index Terms—Joint source-channel coding, correlated Gaussian sources, multiple access channels, MAP decoding, channels with memory, time-correlated fading channels, scalar quantization.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that blur and contrast discrimination thresholds are limited by a common stage of contrast energy transduction, and that this explains the characteristic “dipper” functions found for contrast and blur discrimination. To test this conjecture, thresholds for discriminating increments from decrements in sharpness/blur, and similarly for contrast, were measured using the same chessboard stimuli with the Method of Single Stimuli (Experiment 1). Using a generic human contrast sensitivity function (HCSF) to calculate energy, thresholds were significantly lower for blur than for contrast. They could be made more similar only by using an implausibly narrow band-pass version of the HCSF. In separate sessions (Experiment 2), observers also attempted to discriminate between blur and contrast changes when they were randomly <b>interleaved</b> (<b>channel</b> discrimination). Channel discrimination thresholds were similar to those predicted from noisy independent channels, consistent with separate labeled lines for the two channels. Experiment 3 measured subthreshold summation of contrast and blur signals, in either energy-add or energy-subtract modes with a two-alternative forced choice task. Both add and subtract modes lowered thresholds. Experiment 4 measured standard T versus C (“dipper”) functions for blur, and compared these with T versus C functions when a contrast cue was added to keep energy constant. The finding of a “dipper” function in the latter case suggests that it does not arise from a common energy transduction stage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Personal {{communications}} services (PCS’s) and future broad-band wireless systems are {{and will continue}} to be driven mainly by three challenging objectives: high-spectrum reuse efficiency, high-quality channels, and low infrastructure costs. We propose a new interleaved narrow-beam trisector cell (INBTC) architecture with a newly developed <b>interleaved</b> <b>channel</b> assignment (ICA) scheme to achieve these three objectives. Originating from the ICA scheme, we introduce the concept of interleaved cluster, within which a channel set can be assigned more than once. The INBTC architecture with interleaved clusters can enhance the performance of cellular/PCS systems from several perspectives. We demonstrate that to achieve highspectrum efficiency, specifically in the range of reuse factors N = 2 – 7, the INBTC system improves 3 – 5 dB at the 90 th and 95 th percentiles of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) compared to conventional cellular systems. For a typical cellular environment, with a shadow fading standard deviation = 8 dB and an SIR requirement of 17 dB at the 90 th percentile, the INBTC system can increase system capacity by 75 % over current systems. Because the INBTC architecture can utilize the basestation equipment of current cellular/PCS systems, implementing it should be simple and carry no attendant infrastructure costs. Hence, the proposed INBTC system (the cell layout plus the channel assignment scheme) has significant potential value in future cellular/PCS systems, as well as in broad-band wireless applications.
