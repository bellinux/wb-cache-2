40|$|Software is an {{important}} part of <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> control systems. However, the state-of-the-practice for developing <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> control software still has several key challenges that need to be addressed (e. g., migration to platforms of different vendors, lack of automation). This paper introduces a model-driven engineering approach to the development of <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> control software, which is based on the ProcGraph domain-specific modeling language. The paper discusses and offers solutions to several of the development challenges that have not been addressed by existing techniques in the process controls domain. The contributions of the paper are a model-driven engineering approach for the <b>industrial</b> <b>process</b> control domain and a supporting tool infrastructure. The approach is demonstrated by a case study focused on the development of a control system for a TiO 2 (titanium dioxide) pigment production subprocess. 1...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it {{necessary}} {{to find a new}} water supply. Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame. <b>Industrial</b> <b>processes</b> had polluted the river however, and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply. Today, waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.|$|E

5|$|Like all <b>industrial</b> <b>processes,</b> {{injection}} moulding can produce flawed parts. In {{the field of}} {{injection moulding}}, troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with {{the design of the}} mould or the characteristics of the process itself.

5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain <b>industrial</b> <b>processes,</b> {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|By June 1942, the Manhattan Project {{had reached}} the stage where the {{construction}} of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on {{where they should be}} located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like a big step, given that many <b>industrial</b> <b>processes</b> do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by <b>industrial</b> <b>processes</b> like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} that half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E
