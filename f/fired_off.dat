5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 March, Kent and Glasgow {{approached}} Cumberland Bay; their appearance was relayed back to Dresden by one of her pinnaces, which {{had been sent to}} patrol the entrance to the bay. Dresden was unable to maneuver, owing to her fuel shortage, and Lüdecke signaled that his ship was no longer a combatant. The British disregarded this message, as well as a Chilean vessel that approached them as they entered the bay. Glasgow opened fire, in violation of Chile's neutrality; Britain had already informed Chile that British warships would disregard international law if they located Dresden in Chilean territorial waters. Shortly thereafter, Kent joined in the bombardment as well. The German gunners <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> three shots in response, but the guns were quickly knocked out by British gunfire.|$|E
5|$|The villa {{was soon}} cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost {{returned}} to the beach, {{he found that the}} machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of 'Nelson'; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached the beach and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 {{but there was no sign}} of the naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered 'Nelson' to guard the inland approaches to the beach and then <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> an emergency signal flare; soon after that the naval force was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on the beach, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six landing craft landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering at the top of the cliff.|$|E
5|$|When {{the boats}} first {{started for the}} port, the Tripolitanians began firing upon them with their shore batteries. The {{shelling}} lasted until 11:00 PM and delayed the assault until 1:00 AM when the Nerid began escorting the boats in closer to shore. Though at first the second Sardinian attack was unnoticed by the Tripolitanians, a sentry sighted the approaching force at 2:30 AM. Despite resistance from the Tripolitanian fleet and forces ashore, Mamelli pushed his force onward through grapeshot and musket fire. He soon reached the Tripolitanian brig and had his force board her, killing its officers and captain {{as well as a}} large portion of its crew. A second section of boats assaulted the schooners, taking them by boarding. At the same time, the third section of Sardinian boats managed to force their way ashore despite heavy opposition, capturing the dockyard and routing its Tripolitanian defenders. At 3:30 AM Mamelli <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> two rockets to signal a retreat, and burned the Tripolitanian ships his force had captured.|$|E

25|$|A third pirate {{vessel was}} intercepted on 13 January. RFA Fort Victoria <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> warning shots {{to stop the}} vessel and then {{launched}} a boarding party. All of the pirates surrendered without incident and search uncovered several RPGs and automatic weapons. Royal Marines held the captured pirates for further investigation.|$|E
25|$|As the galleys approached, Salomon <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> {{a number}} of warning shots but without success. The galleys then formed out of line, {{becoming}} an arrowhead formation. As this was happening, Salomon soon targeted the lead ship and began to find its target. The lead galleys sheared away almost violently with the first suffering damage that ultimately forced it to withdraw. Soon the other English ships began to fire; Minion and Margaret and John shielded the lighter armed vessels. Centurion, the biggest ship, was held back in reserve.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish ship <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> a {{friendly}} salute, {{and as soon}} as the ship was in range, the Tiger opened fire. The Spanish ship was the Santa Maria de San Vicente the flagship of the Santo Domingo squadron of the Spanish Flota, captained by Alonzo de Cornieles. At near 400 tons Santa Maria de San Vicente was a richly laden galleon having sailed from Havana with nearly 300 crew, soldiers and passengers. She was struggling to catch up with the main convoy of thirty ships much farther ahead, having been forced to heave-to by gale-force winds.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October {{the siege}} began when Frobisher's ships arrived and {{blockaded}} the fort (which {{was still not}} finished) and <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> a desultory bombardment before the land force arrived. The besieging army arrived soon after and began to open trenches on 11 October, supported by canon fire from the sea by English ships. The besiegers however suffered from the Spanish artillery fire during the installation of wicker filled gabions, trenches and artillery emplacements. They also {{had to cope with}} sorties from the Spanish bastions, day and night, so that the siege positions were not permanently positioned.|$|E
25|$|Recalde's ships {{remained}} {{within their}} shelter for several days, and a crown force led by Thomas Norris (brother of the soldier, John Norris) and Edward Denny (husband of Lady Denny) arrived in Dingle {{to guard against}} a landing. Recalde sent a reconnaissance party ashore, but all eight members were captured. At one stage a westerly gale caused Portugal to collide with San Juan de Bautista, and when the wind died down another ship, Santa Maria de la Rosa (900 tons, 297 men: Guipuzcoa squadron), entered the sound {{from the north and}} <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> a gun by way of distress signal.|$|E

25|$|Salomon {{soon began}} {{to run out of}} powder as did Margaret and John. Centurion soon came up along with Elizabeth which so far had <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> very little. Now with both ships in action, Centurions fire {{soon began to}} tell and the Spanish galleys were not getting {{anywhere}} near enough to board. Eventually after nearly six hours of fighting, the last of the Spanish galleys had been repelled with some in a sinking state. Doria's galleys had all suffered much damage and losses in galley slaves, soldiers and sailors had been heavy. With this in mind, {{he had no choice but}} to go into port and so withdrew immediately to Algeciras after temporarily shadowing the English ships.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir Krutov {{was sent}} to the penalty box at the 6:47 mark of the third period for high-sticking. The Americans, who had managed only two shots on Myshkin in 27minutes, had a power play and a rare {{offensive}} opportunity. Myshkin stopped a Mike Ramsey shot, then U.S. team captain Mike Eruzione fired a shot wide. Late in the power play, Dave Silk was advancing into the Soviet zone when Valeri Vasiliev knocked him to the ice. The puck slid to Mark Johnson. Johnson <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> a shot that went under Myshkin and into the net at the 8:39 mark, as the power play was ending, tying the game at 3. Only a couple of shifts later, Mark Pavelich passed to Eruzione, who was left undefended in the high slot. Eruzione, who had just come onto the ice, fired a shot past Myshkin, who was screened by Vasili Pervukhin. This goal gave Team USA a 4–3 lead, its first of the game, with 10minutes remaining.|$|E
25|$|At about 4:00 PM, a {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} flying the red flag with children in the lead had assembled but when {{at the behest of}} their leaders they let out a shout and tried to descend on the riverfront, a Japanese naval landing force came ashore and firstly shot blanks but then <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> several live rounds. The rioters then retreated and surged like an avalanche out of the concession, plundering all the way. Though the rioters stubbornly refused to move out once they had reached Pinghe Street, when the Japanese landing party was compelled to fire off warning shots with their machine guns {{in the direction of the}} Honganji temple’s embankment the crowd fled. The crowd which was thus driven from the Japanese concession attacked Japanese businesses located in the concessions of other countries. They attacked a restaurant where six sailors were dining, beat them mercilessly, and then carried them away and imprisoned them at the headquarters of the communist-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions. That night, 25 Japanese people escaped to the British ship HMS Bee and were protected. Dojin Hospital also pulled out from Hankou.|$|E

25|$|These gains {{caught the}} Japanese by surprise, but they quickly regained their {{composure}} and began counter-attacking. Two groups of engineers attacked the Australian company around Pirivi from {{east and west}} along the KokodaOivi road, while Tsukamoto detached a company of infantry from {{the main body of}} the 1st Battalion, 144th Infantry to attack the company at Kokoda. The company that had attacked Pirivi subsequently withdrew back to via Komondo village carrying their wounded with them, arriving at Deniki in two groups on 9 and 10 August. Meanwhile, Symington's company, which had occupied Kokoda, held it against several determined attacks. In an effort to make the main Australian force aware that they had taken the village, Symington <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> a red signal flare, and dispatched messengers to go back to Cameron to advise him to send reinforcements and supplies. As the fighting around Kokoda intensified, the Australians continued to hold out in the hope of being reinforced or resupplied by air, but this hope faded mid-morning when the expected aircraft overflew Kokoda without landing. Finally, running low on ammunition and food, and having not received the promised aerial resupply, Symington's company was forced to withdraw west of Kokoda at 7:00pm on 10 August, crossing Madi Creek south of the airstrip by means of a precipitous wire bridge before falling back south through the scrub. They subsequently re-crossed to the eastern side of Madi Creek before halting on the western side of Faiwani Creek, before moving on to the village of Naro where they were met by a small patrol which led them to Isurava, which they reached on 13 August.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1500s a larger arquebus {{known as the}} musket appeared. The heavy musket, while being rather awkward to handle, {{requiring}} a fork rest to fire properly, {{had the advantage of}} being able to penetrate the best armor within a range of 180 meters, regular armor at 365 meters, and an unarmed man at 548 meters. However, both the musket and arquebus were effectively limited to a range of only 90 to 185 meters regardless of armor since they were incredibly inaccurate. According to some sources, a smoothbore musket was completely incapable of hitting a man sized target past the 73 meter mark. While rifled guns did exist at this time in the form of grooves cut into the interior of a barrel, these were considered specialist weapons and limited in number. In some aspects this made the smoothbore musket an inferior weapon compared to the bow. The average Mamluk archer for example was capable of hitting targets only 68 meters far away but could keep up a pace of six to eight shots per minute. In comparison, sixteenth century matchlocks <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> one shot every several minutes, and much less when taking into consideration misfires and malfunctions which occurred up to half the time. This {{is not to say that}} firearms of the 16th century were inferior to the bow and arrow, for it could better penetrate armor and required less training, but the disadvantages of the musket were very real, and it would not be until the 1590s that archers were for the most part phased out of European warfare. This was possibly a consequence of the increased effectiveness of musket warfare due to the rise of volley fire in Europe as first applied by the Dutch. At this time gunners in European armies reached as high as 40 percent of infantry forces.|$|E

The team left the field to the song Happy Trails while the cannon in right field that had been fired every time a Calgary player hit a home run <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> a 21-gun salute.|$|E

500|$|During the campaign, Missouri was {{involved}} in a friendly fire incident with the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate [...] According to the official report, on 25 February, Jarretts Phalanx CIWS engaged the chaff fired by Missouri as a countermeasure against enemy missiles, and stray rounds from the firing struck Missouri, one penetrating through a bulkhead and becoming embedded in an interior passageway of the ship. Another round struck the ship on the forward funnel, passing completely through it. One sailor aboard Missouri was struck in the neck by flying shrapnel and suffered minor injuries. Those familiar with the incident are skeptical of this account, however, as Jarrett was reportedly over [...] away at the time and the characteristics of chaff are such that a Phalanx would not normally regard it as a threat and engage it. There is no dispute that the rounds that struck Missouri did come from Jarrett, and that it was an accident. The suspicion is that a Phalanx operator on Jarrett may have accidentally <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> a few rounds manually, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this.|$|E
500|$|Brazil's , {{the lead}} ship, was {{laid down by}} Armstrong on 17April 1907, while its sister [...] {{followed}} thirteen days later at Vickers. Completion of the partial hull needed to launch Minas Geraes was delayed by a five-month strike to 10 September 1908. São Paulo followed on 19 April 1909. Both were christened in front of large crowds by the wife of Francisco Régis de Oliveira, the Brazilian ambassador to the United Kingdom. After fitting-out, the period after a warship's launch where it is completed, Minas Geraes was put through multiple trials of the speed, endurance, efficiency, and weaponry of the ship in September, including what {{was at that time}} the heaviest broadside ever <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> a warship, Minas Geraes was completed and handed over to Brazil on 5 January 1910.

500|$|Jefferis {{took the}} {{prototype}} Baby Bombard apart {{on the floor}} of his office in MD1 and rebuilt it, and then combined it with a hollow-charge mortar bomb to create what he called the 'Jefferis Shoulder Gun'. Jefferis then had a small number of prototype armour-piercing HEAT rounds made, and took the weapon to be tested at the Small Arms School at Bisley. A Warrant Officer took the Shoulder Gun down to a firing range, aimed it at an armoured target, and pulled the trigger; the Shoulder Gun pierced a hole in the target, but unfortunately also wounded the Warrant Officer when a piece of metal from the exploding round flew back and hit him. Jefferis himself then took the place of the Warrant Officer and <b>fired</b> <b>off</b> several more rounds, all of which pierced the armoured target but without wounding him. [...] Impressed with the weapon, the Ordnance Board of the Small Arms School had the faults with the ammunition corrected, renamed the Shoulder Gun as the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank, and ordered that it be issued to infantry units as a hand-held anti-tank weapon. Production of the PIAT began at the end of August 1942.|$|E
