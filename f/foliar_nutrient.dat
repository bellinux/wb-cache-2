40|$|Summary. The {{effects of}} <b>foliar</b> absorbed <b>nutrients</b> on root {{processes}} related to assimilation of nitrogen under {{presence or absence}} of molybdenum (Mo) were studied. Pea plants (Pisum sativum L.), var. Avola were grown until the 15 th day in a glasshouse on liquid nutrient solution both without and with Mo added to the media. Plants were inoculated with bacterial suspension of Rhizobuium leguminosarum bv. Viciae strain D 293 at approximately 108 cells per cm 3. Application of a liquid foliar fertilizer at a concentration of 0. 3 % was performed twice a week by spraying under high pressure. The effects of <b>foliar</b> supplied <b>nutrients</b> in addition to root nutrition on dry biomass accumulation, protein content, root nodulation and activities of the enzymes of primary nitrogen assimilation (nitrate reductase (NR- NADH, EC 1. 6. 6. 1), and glutamine synthetase (GS: EC 6. 3. 1. 2) during the early stage of nodulation were studied. <b>Foliar</b> application of <b>nutrients</b> had a positive effect on the activities of NR and GS enzymes in shoots of Mo-supplied plants. It was found that <b>foliar</b> application of <b>nutrients</b> reduced the inhibitory effect of Mo shortage on root nodulation, plant dry biomass and protein content.

There were significant differences in <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations between two canopy positions (upper outer and lower outer canopy) sampled, between summer and winter, and between the two sites. This highlights that <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations are influenced by sampling and environment. Significant genetic variations in <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations were detected between the clones, between the female parents, and between the male parents of the clones in both sampling seasons at both sites. Depending on the nutrient concerned, canopy position, season, and site sampled, the clones accounted for 4. 7 - 33. 9 % of the total variation in <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> concentrations, the clone female parents for 0 - 25. 1 % and the clone male parents for 0 - 28. 6 %. The site-by-clone interactions were statistically significant for foliar N, P, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe and mineral concentrations at the upper outer canopy in summer, and for foliar N concentration in winter. There were significant, positive correlations between clone means of foliar d 13 C and N concentration at the upper outer canopy in summer for the wet site, while clone foliar d 13 C was also positively related to clone foliar N concentration at both canopy positions in summer for the dry site. This suggests that clone WUE as reflected in foliar d 13 C may be improved by selecting elite clones with higher foliar N concentration and increased photosynthesis, leading to enhanced tree growth when both water and N are the major growth-limiting factors. This {{is supported by the}} positive correlation detected between clone tree height and foliar N concentration at the upper outer canopy for both sites.

Four healthy eucalypts in a neighbouring State Forest were also studied. The study region had suffered severe climatic stress between 1972 and 1976 when dieback was first observed by residents and when high populations of defoliating insects were observed. Dieback trees {{had a higher}} proportion of foliage damaged by insects and higher {{concentrations of}} <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrients</b> than did matched healthy trees. The study period was one of low climatic stress during which dieback and healthy trees followed similar seasonal patterns of predawn xylem pressure potential. Dieback trees developed lower daytime minimum xylem pressure potentials than did matched healthy trees, and differed in their stomatal responses. A model of initiation and development of rural eucalypt dieback is proposed. This may have general application to many non‐specific rural diebacks in which heavy insect damage is implicated. The balance between rural eucalypts and their insect herbivores is precarious. Any factor capable of causing extensive defoliation, or an increase in foliar nitrogen, or an increase in populations of insect herbivores may upset this balance. A positive feedback loop may be activated, whereby the production of nitrogen rich epicormic foliage enhances a build up of insect populations. Repeated insect defoliation leads to tree dieback.

However, we have a poor {{understanding}} of how the effects of altitude-related warming varies across geology. Therefore, this study examined the independent and interactive effects of altitude and geology and species on plant growth and <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> status. Methods We determined leaf growth rates and concentrations of major nutrients (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) in leaves of five species across two altitudinal gradients (1200 – 2200 m) in the Dolomites (south-eastern Alps, Italy). The two transects were located on carbonate bedrock and silicate bedrock, respectively. We also determined concentrations of inorganic and organic N and P forms in soils, and δ 15 N signature in leaves and soils. Important Findings Foliar N concentrations were unrelated to bedrock geology. The negative foliar δ 15 N signature suggested that organic N was the primary source of N supply across the gradients. Foliar P concentrations were strongly affected by bedrock geology and their altitudinal patterns depended on the concentrations of organic and inorganic P forms in the soil. Phosphates and organic P appeared to be the main sources of P supply. Leaf growth rates increased with higher altitude on silicate bedrock and decreased with higher altitude on carbonate bedrock and presented a significant positive correlation with foliar N : P. In conclusion, bedrock geology interacted with altitude in controlling the <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> status mainly owing to availability of soil P and its effect on <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> stoichiometry...|$|E

Due to the positive impact that fertilizers have on crop yields, researchers frequently try to evaluate the correlations between yield and <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> contents. This work's objective was to present fruit yields from the 4 th to the 6 th cropping seasons, evaluate <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrient</b> contents (on the 5 th cropping season), and estimate the correlations between these two groups of traits for 20 half-sibling custard apple tree progenies. The progenies were evaluated in a random block design with five replicates and four plants per plot. One hundred leaves were collected from the middle third of the canopy (in height) of each of four plants in each plot. The leaves were collected haphazardly, i. e., in a random manner, but without using a drawing mechanism. In the analysis of variance, the nutrient concentrations in the leaves from plants of each plot were represented by the average of four plants in the plot. Fruit yield in the various progenies did not depend on cropping season; progeny A 4 was the most productive. No Spearman correlation was found between leaf nutrient concentrations and fruit yield. Increased nutrient concentrations in the leaves were progeny-dependent, i. e., with regard to Na (progenies FE 5 and JG 1), Ca (progeny A 4), Mg (progeny SM 7), N (progeny A 3), P (progeny M), and K contents (progeny JG 3).

Results show that at the suggested concentrations to be used at the field level for <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrients</b> and fungicides, these enzymes maintain enough activity to produce damage on the plant tissues. Also, {{the high levels of}} enzymes activities found in the presence of high concentrations of metal ions or at different temperatures could relate to the behavior of these enzymes in the infection process of plant tissues in field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Tropical soils {{often are}} assumed to be highly {{weathered}} and thus nutrient-depleted, but this prediction applies primarily to geomorphically stable surfaces. Topography complicates the assumption of nutrient depletion, because erosion can enhance the supply of nutrients to tropical ecosystems. Consequently, understanding nutrient availability across landscapes requires a spatially explicit assessment of the relative strength of depletion and enhancement. We document the relationship between <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrients</b> and topographic position across a 20 -km 2, 4 - to 5 -million-year-old eroded landscape in Kaua'i, Hawai'i, and use this relationship to build a bottom-up map of predicted nutrient availability across this landscape. Only ≈ 17 % of the landscape is nutrient-poor, mostly on stable uplands; nutrient availability on slopes and valley bottoms is much higher, in some cases similar to the most fertile montane forests in the Hawaiian Islands. This pattern was corroborated by top-down remote sensing of area-integrated canopy phosphorus concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Myrcia tomentosa (Aubl.) DC., Myrtaceae, {{found in}} Central Brazilian Cerrado and {{popularly known as}} "goiaba-brava", belongs to the Myrcia genus, which has several species with {{medicinal}} properties such as: hypoglycemic, diuretic, hypotensive, antidiarrheal, antimicrobial and antitumor. The present study aimed to analyzed the environmental influence on concentrations of phenolic metabolites in M. tomentosa leaves. Compounds assayed in the leaves were: total phenols, tannins by protein precipitation, hydrolysable tannins and total flavonoids and mineral nutrients, while soil fertility was also analyzed, all over during one year. The results were submitted to Pearson Correlation Analysis and stepwise Multiple Regression Analysis to investigate the relationship between phenolics and environment data. Analysis of variance and Cluster Analysis allowed indicated a high variability in samples from different sites. The results obtained suggests that content of phenolics from M. tomentosa leaves are influenced by environmental factors, particularly some <b>foliar</b> <b>nutrients</b> (N 1, Ca 1 and Mn 1), soil nutrients (Ca s and Ks) and Rainfall...|$|R
