5|$|Kelly {{was much}} in demand as a sideman for recordings, and {{appeared}} on albums {{by most of}} the major jazz leaders in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In April 1957, for instance, he appeared as a guest in an enlarged version of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, for an album later released as Theory of Art; this band included trumpeter Lee Morgan, with whom Kelly had recorded a few weeks earlier. The recording sessions continued four days later, with Kelly joining Blakey, Morgan and others on Griffin's A Blowin' Session; this was followed by three studio days for Gillespie, and another for trumpeter Clark Terry, {{before the end of the}} month. Later that year, Kelly made a rare appearance playing bass, for one track of vocalist Abbey Lincoln's That's Him!, after the regular bassist, Paul Chambers, became drunk and <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the studio.|$|E

The Interview ended when Liddell asked the host who {{he would like to}} fight. UFC President Dana White, along with Liddell's head coach Scott VanGilder, explained that Liddell had pneumonia and had taken a large dose of sedatives the night before the interview.|$|E

25|$|During {{a meeting}} with Chantrey, Ellen-Jane {{expressed}} to him {{a clear idea of}} what she wanted. She told Chantrey of how in the past she had watched as her daughters <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> each other's arms and this is how she wanted them represented. She had also taken inspiration from Thomas Banks’ Boothby Monument in St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. The statue depicts the daughter of Sir Brooke Boothby who had died during childhood. Chantrey visited this monument and then returned to his home to make a model of his proposed sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for Goram, he {{overheated}} while hard at work, drank a giant {{quantity of}} ale, and <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> his favourite (stone) chair, whilst Vincent paced himself better and completed his channel. (One version depicts Goram as lazy and Vincent as keen and industrious.) The geographical {{point is to}} explain the narrow gorge of the Hazel Brook (a tributary of the river Trym) in Henbury and the dramatic Avon Gorge through which the Avon now flows. The onomastic point is {{to account for the}} name of the Avon Gorge, but this is a bit feeble since the river has had this name from time immemorial.|$|E
25|$|According to the texts, a {{merchant}} 500 yearsa ago named Manga Oswal from Nagarparkar {{had gone to}} Pattan to purchase some items. He was informed in a dream that an image was buried under {{the house of a}} local Muslim that Oswal was instructed to acquire. Oswal bought the image by paying 125 dramma or 500 pieces (taka), and was instructed in another dream to place the image on a cart and to move forward without looking back. The cart is said to have broken down near Nagarparkar, where Oswal then <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> <b>In</b> his next dream, he was informed that underneath him lay marble and treasure, and instructed him to recruit craftsmen to build a fine temple in which to worship the idol, which was bestowed with the name Gori. The temple's construction was supervised by an architect from Sirohi, while the shikhar of the temple was completed by his son Mahio. The image was formally reconsecrated by Acharya Merutunga Suri of Anchala Gachchha, thus establishing the Gori Parshvanth Tirth, and the temple as a place of pilgrimage for Jains from afar.|$|E

It was traditionally believed that a person who <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the forest might be brought a pillow by an aye-aye. If the pillow was for one's head, he or she would become rich, but if it was for the feet, that person would be subject to evil sorcery. Similarly, the indri is considered sacred and may not be hunted, killed or eaten.|$|E
500|$|After George’s recovery, his popularity, {{and that}} of Pitt, {{continued}} to increase {{at the expense of}} Fox and the Prince of Wales. His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity. James Hadfield's failed attempt to shoot the King [...] in the Drury Lane Theatre on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister Truelock. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that he <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the interval.|$|E
500|$|In April 1996, Downey {{was arrested}} for {{possession}} of heroin, cocaine and an unloaded [...]357 Magnum handgun while he was speeding down Sunset Boulevard.

He was sentenced to three years of probation and required to undergo compulsory drug testing. In 1997, he missed one of the court-ordered drug tests and had to spend six months in the Los Angeles County jail.|$|E

500|$|The {{drafting}} of Wheatley had been hotly contested. [...] Some Giant draft war-room personnel {{had wanted to}} select Korey Stringer and others {{had an interest in}} Rashaan Salaam when the Giants' selection came. [...] After Wheatley was selected with the seventeenth pick, running backs Napoleon Kaufman, James Stewart and Rashaan Salaam were chosen with the eighteenth, nineteenth and twenty-first selections, respectively. Reeves made it no secret that he would have selected Salaam over Wheatley in the draft. [...] Wheatley's introduction to the Giants was a contract squabble that kept him from getting to training camp on time. [...] Then, in rookie season training camp, he had the misfortune of pulling a hamstring while running sprints on the first day. [...] Speculation had been that the injury had occurred in a stumble in a June track meet. [...] Reeves held the prompt injury against the running back he never wanted. [...] Wheatley later <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> a meeting which drew a fine from Reeves. [...] Although he only actually <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> one meeting, he also had mental concentration issues in practice. [...] He was not known for living erratically so his falling asleep and loss of concentration was enough of a problem that the Giants had Wheatley evaluated. [...] On top of this, Wheatley was fined several times for tardiness to team meetings.|$|E
500|$|For the New York Dolls' debut album, Mercury {{wanted to}} find a record {{producer}} who could make the most out of the group's sound and the hype they had received from critics and fans in New York. At the band's first board meeting in Chicago, Johansen <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> Mercury's conference room while record executives discussed potential producers. He awoke when they mentioned Todd Rundgren, a musician and producer who by 1972 had achieved unexpected rock stardom with his double album Something/Anything? and its hit singles [...] "I Saw the Light" [...] and [...] "Hello It's Me". Rundgren had socialized at venues such as Max's Kansas City and first saw the New York Dolls when his girlfriend at the time, model Bebe Buell, brought him there to see them play.|$|E
500|$|Cwrt (...) , now a large farm, was the {{administrative}} centre of Bardsey Abbey's mainland estates, and {{was known as}} the [...] "Court of Bardsey". The steepest cliffs in the Llŷn Peninsula are at Y Parwyd, the scene of a local ghost story. In 1794 a newly married couple moved into a cottage nearby. Within a few years they were disturbed by a phantom, but when they read a verse from the Bible, the phantom would retreat towards Y Parwyd and hover over the cliff edge before disappearing; the couple finally moved to Bodferin. In 1801 a ship pilot was put ashore on the rocks below the cliffs. Although very drunk, he managed to climb the cliff face and, reaching the top, <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> a sheep pen. In the early morning, he awoke and, still drunk, headed for home; he walked in the wrong direction, however, and disappeared over the cliff edge into the sea.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{factors such}} as {{temperature}} and relative humidity in the bedroom and {{in the space between}} the bed and the coverlet were analyzed in relation to ease of falling <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> summer and autumn. The following results were obtained. 1. Many subjects reported that they <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> more easily <b>in</b> autumn than in summer. They felt that they slept more deeply in autumn than in summer. However, the incidence of sleep interruption at night did not differ between summer and autumn. 2. The subjects adjusted their bedclothes and nightclothes appropriatery in both summer and autumn. 3. The temperature and relative humidity within the bedroom were significantly higher in summer (27. 06 ℃ and 70. 36 %) than in autumn (18. 82 ℃ and 67, 46 %). 4. The temperature within the bedroom correlated significantly with the temperature in the space between the bed and the coverlet in both summer and autumn. The correlation was particularly high in summer. 5. The bedroom temperature was significantly higher for subjects who did not fall <b>asleep</b> easily <b>in</b> summer than for subjects who <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> easily <b>in</b> summer. The relative humidity in the bedroom tended to be higher for subjects who did not fall <b>asleep</b> easily <b>in</b> summer than for subjects who <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> easily <b>in</b> summer. 6. These results indicate that not only adjustment of bedclothes but also adijustment of room temperature (using an air-conditioner, etc.) is important for falling asleep easily and achieving a stable sleep pattern...|$|R
500|$|At {{some point}} in early-to-mid 1828 a Mrs Haldane, whom Burke {{described}} as [...] "a stout old woman", lodged at Hare's premises. After she became drunk, she <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the stable; she was smothered and sold to Knox. Several months later Haldane's daughter (either called Margaret or Peggy) also lodged at Hare's house. She and Burke drank together heavily and he killed her, without Hare's assistance; her body was put into a tea-chest and taken to Knox where Burke was paid £8. The next murder occurred in May 1828, when an old woman joined the house as a lodger. One evening while she was intoxicated, Burke smothered her—Hare was not present in {{the house at the}} time; her body was sold to Knox for £10. Then came the murder of Effy (sometimes spelt Effie), a [...] "cinder gatherer" [...] who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings. Effy was known to Burke, and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his cobbling business. Burke tempted her into the stable with whisky, and when she was drunk enough he and Hare killed her; Knox gave £10 for the body. Another victim was found by Burke too drunk to stand. She was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when Burke offered to take her there himself; the policeman obliged, and Burke took her back to Hare's house where she was killed. Her corpse raised a further £10 from Knox.|$|E
500|$|In 1830 {{the company}} opened new offices {{at the corner}} of Northgate and Union Street in Darlington. Between 1831 and 1832 a second track was laid between Stockton and the foot of Brusselton Bank. Workshops were built at Shildon for the {{maintenance}} and construction of locomotives. In 1830 approximately 50 horses shared the traffic with 19 locomotives, but travelled at different speeds, so to help regulate traffic horse-drawn trains were required to operate in groups of four or five. This had led to horses, startled by a passing locomotive and coming off their dandy cart, being run down by the following train. On one occasion a driver <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the dandy cart of the preceding train and his horse, no longer being led, came to a stop and was run down by a locomotive. The rule book stated that locomotive-hauled trains had precedence over horse-drawn trains, but some horse drivers refused to give way and on one occasion a locomotive had to follow a horse-drawn train for over [...] The committee decided in 1828 to replace horses with locomotives on the main line, starting with the coal trains, but there was resistance from some colliery owners. After the S bought out the coach companies in August 1832, a mixed passenger and small goods service began between Stockton and Darlington on 7 September 1833, travelling at locomotive-hauled services began to Shildon in December 1833 and to Middlesbrough on 7 April 1834. The company had returned the five per cent dividend that had been promised by Edward Pease, and this had increased to eight per cent by the time he retired in 1832. When the treasurer Jonathan Backhouse retired in 1833 to become a Quaker minister he was replaced by Joseph Pease.|$|E

In March 1982, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old named John Howlett as he (Nilsen) drank in a pub located close to Leicester Square. Howlett was lured to Nilsen's flat on the promise of continuing drinking with Nilsen. At Cranley Gardens, both Nilsen and Howlett drank as they watched a film, before Howlett walked into Nilsen's front room and <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> <b>in</b> the bed (which was located in the front room at this time). One hour later, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to rouse Howlett, then {{sat on the edge of}} the bed drinking rum as he stared at Howlett, before deciding to kill him. Following a ferocious struggle (in which Howlett himself attempted to strangle his attacker), Nilsen strangled Howlett into unconsciousness with an upholstery strap before returning to his living room, shaking from the [...] "stress of the struggle" [...] in which he had believed he would be overpowered. On three occasions over the following ten minutes, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to kill this victim after noting he had resumed breathing, before deciding to fill his bathtub with water and drown him.|$|E
