5|$|Early 4X {{games were}} {{influenced}} by board games and text-based computer games from the 1970s. Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and Reach <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.|$|E

5|$|Elves {{sometimes}} {{appear to}} age under great stress. Círdan {{appeared to be}} aged himself, since he is described as looking old, save <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> in his eyes; {{this may be due}} to all the sorrows he had seen and lived through since the First Age. Also, the people of Gwindor of Nargothrond had trouble recognizing him after his time as a prisoner of Morgoth.|$|E

5|$|In {{seventeenth century}} Spain, Lope de Vega, with a {{detailed}} knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance La Arcadia (1598), {{it leads to}} absurdity; in his novela Guzman el Bravo (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> Calderón de la Barca wrote the 1641 comedy Astrologo Fingido (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright Thomas Corneille for his 1651 comedy Feint Astrologue.|$|E
5|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the meaning of}} the glyphs, Dietrich matched traditional Polynesian names for stars & astronomical bodies with the pictorial representations of rongorongo. This method revealed a high degree of consistency, suggesting that most if not all of the glyphs represent astronomical and navigational concepts. Dietrich argues that other researchers have been misled by the literal resemblances of the glyphs, not realizing that they are abstract symbols <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> (cf. western astronomical symbols). This fits a pattern consistent among many cultures, in which constellations are identified with people, animals, objects, and mythological beings.|$|E

5|$|In Greek antiquity {{the ideas}} of {{celestial}} spheres and rings {{first appeared in the}} cosmology of Anaximander in the early 6th century BC. In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, {{but there are so many}} such wheels <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original sphere of fire wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings. Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{began on}} 30 July at Headingley in Leeds, where the Loughborough Lightning faced the Yorkshire Diamonds. The Lightning batted first and scored 128 for nine, led by 52 runs from their New Zealand international, Sophie Devine. The Diamonds began their {{response}} well, and their captain, Lauren Winfield scored 23 runs from just 13 balls {{before she was}} run out. There was some controversy regarding the dismissal; Winfield felt {{that she had been}} impeded by the bowler, but the umpires upheld the dismissal. Regular wickets and miserly bowling from the Lightning attack restricted Yorkshire's batsmen, and they were eventually all out for 85, giving the Lightning a 43-run victory. The following day saw two low-scoring matches; the Surrey Stars were restricted to 85 runs from their 20 overs by a economic Southern Vipers bowling attack. Nat Sciver managed to score 36 runs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> late in the innings, but the Vipers scored 66 runs from their opening partnership, including 41 runs from 43 balls for Georgia Adams to help them towards their target. They won with six wickets and 28 balls to spare. In the other fixture that day, the Lancashire Thunder reached 65 for four, but then a spell of bowling from Heather Knight and Stafanie Taylor for the Western Storm saw the Thunder dismissed all out for 83 runs. Taylor finished with four wickets, while Knight took three. In their batting response, Knight and Taylor were again the best performers; Knight scored 23 and Taylor 14 as the Storm chased down the total with 27 balls remaining.|$|E

25|$|In the 1998 off-season, {{after falling}} just short in the Western Conference Finals, the Stars added what they {{believed}} was the final piece toward winning a championship: star goalscoring winger Brett Hull.
