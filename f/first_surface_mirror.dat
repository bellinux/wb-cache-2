25|$|Telescopes {{and other}} {{precision}} instruments use front silvered or <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirrors,</b> where the reflecting surface {{is placed on}} the front (or <b>first)</b> <b>surface</b> of the glass (this eliminates reflection from glass <b>surface</b> ordinary back <b>mirrors</b> have).

50|$|A <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirror</b> or {{front surface}} mirror (also {{commonly}} abbreviated FS mirror or FSM) is a mirror with the reflective surface being above a backing, {{as opposed to}} the conventional, second surface mirror with the reflective surface behind a transparent substrate such as glass or acrylic. In cases where the mirror is subjected to extreme cold (as low as 33 K as in the James Webb Space Telescope), a polished pure beryllium mirror is used without a first surface coating in order to obviate buckling caused by differing coefficients of thermal expansion.|$|E
50|$|Mirrors made by {{this method}} are {{classified}} as either back-silvered, with the silvered layer viewed through the glass; or front-silvered, (called a <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirror)</b> with the reflective layer on the surface towards the incoming light or image. Most common household mirrors are back-silvered, since this protects the fragile reflective layer from corrosion, scratches, and other damage. However, precision optical surfaces normally need the reflective material on the front surface of the glass to avoid introducing optical aberrations. First surface mirrors use the substrate to keep form. There are optical mirrors such as Mangin mirrors that are back-silvered (reflective coating on the rear surface) {{as part of their}} optical design.|$|E

The {{stereoscopic display}} system {{is composed of}} one monitor and one acrylic <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirror.</b> The mirror reflects one image {{for one of the}} eyes. The geometrical transformations to compute correctly the stereo pair is presented and is the core of this paper. System considerations such as mirror placement and implications are also discussed. In contrast to other similar solutions, we do not use two monitors, but just one. Consequently one of the images needs to be skewed. Advantages of the system include absence of ghosting and of flickering. We also developed the rendering engine for DVR of volumetric datasets mostly for medical imaging visualization. The skewing process in this case is integrated into the ray casting of DVR. Using geometrical transformations, we can compute precisely the directions of the rays, producing accurate stereo pairs...|$|E

50|$|Speculum metal {{found an}} {{application}} in early modern Europe {{as the only}} known good reflecting <b>surface</b> for <b>mirrors</b> in reflecting telescopes. In contrast to household mirrors, where the reflecting metal layer is coated {{on the back of}} a glass pane and covered with a protective varnish, precision optical equipment like telescopes needs <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirrors</b> that can be ground and polished into complex shapes such as parabolic reflectors. For nearly 200 years speculum metal was the only mirror substance that could perform this task. One of the earliest designs, James Gregory’s Gregorian telescope could not be built because Gregory could not find a craftsman capable of fabricating the complex speculum mirrors needed for the design.|$|R
50|$|Telescopes {{and other}} {{precision}} instruments use front silvered or <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirrors,</b> where the reflecting surface {{is placed on}} the front (or <b>first)</b> <b>surface</b> of the glass (this eliminates reflection from glass <b>surface</b> ordinary back <b>mirrors</b> have). Some of them use silver, but most are aluminium, which is more reflective at short wavelengths than silver.All of these coatings are easily damaged and require special handling.They reflect 90% to 95% of the incident light when new.The coatings are typically applied by vacuum deposition.A protective overcoat is usually applied before the mirror is removed from the vacuum, because the coating otherwise begins to corrode as soon as it is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the air. Front silvered mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality. There are optical mirrors such as mangin mirrors that are second <b>surface</b> <b>mirrors</b> (reflective coating on the rear surface) as part of their optical designs, usually to correct optical aberrations.|$|R
40|$|A {{selected}} set of optically transparent specimens and <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirror</b> specimens {{have been}} examined subsequent to on-orbit exposure. Certain specimens were from the Passive Optical Sample Assembly I and II experiments flown on the MIR Space Station. Other specimens were from the Energetic Oxygen Interaction with materials III experiment flown on the STS in August 1992. A comparison of pre- and post-flight transmission of reflectance measurements, as appropriate, has been carried out. Data from different specimens includes results of measurements for IR, optical, UV and/or vacuum UV wavelength intervals. Results of these measurements clearly show the effects of molecular contamination deposits on the surfaces during the on-orbit exposures. Surface analysis on a attracted set of specimens provides and estimate of contaminant thickness and composition and provides an insight into on-orbit deposition rates and surface oxidation reactions. For both the EOIM III and POSA I & II experiments, {{the primary source of}} contamination were outgassed silicones. Both experiments received approximately the same fluence of atomic oxygen (approx. 1 - 2 x 1020 atoms per square centimeter). ROSA specimens received between approx. 400 and 580 equivalent sun hours (ESH) of solar radiation over an 18 month period in orbit. The EOIM specimens were on an STS flight of about 1 week duration and received only approx. 5 - 10 ESH of solar radiation...|$|E
50|$|Fused quartz {{has nearly}} ideal {{properties}} for fabricating <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{such as those}} used in telescopes. The material behaves in a predictable way and allows the optical fabricator to put a very smooth polish onto the surface and produce the desired figure with fewer testing iterations. In some instances, a high-purity UV grade of fused quartz {{has been used to}} make several of the individual uncoated lens elements of special-purpose lenses including the Zeiss 105mm f/4.3 UV Sonnar, a lens formerly made for the Hasselblad camera, and the Nikon UV-Nikkor 105mm f/4.5 (presently sold as the Nikon PF10545MF-UV) lens. These lenses are used for UV photography, as the quartz glass has a lower extinction rate than lenses made with more common flint or crown glass formulas.|$|R

50|$|A {{non-reversing}} mirror (sometimes {{referred to}} as a flip mirror) is a mirror that presents its subject as it would be seen from the mirror. A non-reversing mirror can be made by connecting two regular mirrors at their edges at a 90 degree angle. If the join is positioned so that it is vertical, an observer looking into the angle will see a non-reversed image. This can be seen in public toilets when there are mirrors on two walls which are at right angles. Looking towards the corner, such an image is visible. The problem with this type of non-reversing mirror {{is that there is a}} big line down the middle interrupting the image. However, if <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> <b>mirrors</b> are used, and care is taken to set the angle to exactly 90 degrees, the join can be made invisible.|$|R
50|$|The {{interferometer}} {{is made up}} of two mirrors, made of {{the thickest}} glass possible. The Fresnel reflection from the <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> of the <b>mirror</b> acts as a beam splitter. The incident light is split into two rays, parallel to each other and displaced by an amount depending on the thickness of the mirror. The rays are recombined at the second mirror, and ultimately imaged onto a screen.|$|R
50|$|The fisheye and {{spherical mirror}} {{distortion}} features allow Stellarium to be projected onto domes. Spherical mirror distortion {{is used in}} projection systems that utilize a digital video projector and a <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> convex spherical <b>mirror</b> to project images onto a dome. Such systems are generally cheaper than traditional planetarium projectors and fish-eye lens projectors {{and for that reason}} are used in budget and home planetarium setups where projection quality is less important.|$|R
40|$|It was {{possible}} to build sections of <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> glass <b>mirrors</b> of 30 x 60 cm with parabolic trough profiles {{in order to get}} a kind of mosaics. Using these mosaic segments, it {{was possible}} to get a parabolic trough concentrator with an aperture of 2. 37 m and 1. 14 m long. Using the following methodology {{was possible to}} get such concentrator. A male mold with parabolic trough geometry previously fabricated with stainless steel sheet described by Almanza et al. 1982, was used to get small segments of mass-rock¨, a mexican material which is a combination of pozzolan, synthetical and natural microfibers, and cementitions materials. When such material is hydrated, its behavior has a very easy molding behavior. Mass-rock segments (female) were built over the male mold. Along the hardening of this material, no deformation was detected and such material works up to 800 C almost without any deformation. Float soda-lime glass was used as substrate and the trough glass segments were fabricated by thermally sagged method up to 600 C over the female mass-rock ¨ molds. To this temperature, the glass can get the parabolic geometry and conserve its smoothness when they are inside the oven between 20 and 60 minutes, depending on the number of glasse...|$|R
5000|$|BNCR is a {{lens mount}} {{developed}} by Mitchell {{for use with}} their REFLEX 35 mm movie cameras (long back-focus; Bausch & Lomb SUPER BALTARs, e.g., and equivalents). It was an update of the BNC mount (short back-focus; Bausch & Lomb BALTARs, e.g., and equivalents) done to accommodate the reflex viewer in the later cameras. BNC mount lenses cannot be used in reflex Mitchell cameras as their shorter back-focus will hit and damage the reflex viewer, which, in various versions, was a pellicle (partially silvered) mirror or a (100-percent silvered, <b>first</b> <b>surface)</b> rotating <b>mirror.</b> The abbreviation stands for [...] "Blimped Newsreel Camera Reflex", which meant {{that it is a}} 35 mm camera originally intended for news reporting but included a blimp housing for sound stage shooting plus a reflex viewer to allow the camera operator to view the action through the lens while filming.

40|$|In this work, high quality, {{transparent}} multifunctional {{and smart}} anatase TiO 2 and wurtzite ZnO top protective coatings used for CSP silver based <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> thick glass <b>mirrors</b> are studied. The TiO 2 and ZnO top coatings are deposited using chemical spray pyrolysis technique which conserves {{a very good}} specular reflectance of the mirrors 94 reflectance in the Near Infrared range. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared top coatings is evaluated using the methylene blue dye MB as a model molecule, and the highest activity is observed for ZnO top coating, with a degradation efficiency of 42. Moreover, the effect of post annealing treatment on the photocatalytic degradation of the top coatings is pointed out, and is {{explained in terms of}} crystallinity and surface morphology. The increase of the photocatalytic activity can be achieved by increasing surface roughness, which is a conflicting requirement with optical transparency needed for concentrated solar power CSP top coating application. Furthermore, it is pointed out that TiO 2 and ZnO top protective thin films exhibit a photo induced switching of their wetting properties only after 30 min of UV exposure, and their usability as multifunctional top protective layers for CSP application is discusse...|$|R

The implementation of the approved CXRS diagnostic principle on ITER faces significant challenges: First, a comparatively low CXRS signal intensity is expected, together with a high noise level due to bremsstrahlung, while the requested measurement accuracy and stability for the core CXRS system go far beyond the level commonly achieved in present-day fusion experiments. Second, the lifetime of the <b>first</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>surface</b> is limited due to either erosion by fast particle bombardment or deposition of impurities. Finally, the hostile technical environment on ITER imposes challenging boundary conditions for the diagnostic integration and operation, including high neutron loads, electro-magnetic loads, seismic events and a limited access for maintenance.

40|$|Although laser {{rangefinder}} technologies {{have been around}} for decades in military, cartography, building, industrial and research applications it is only in recent years that more generally applicable and cheaper consumer grade laser range finder sensors have become available. This project investigates the possibilities and limitations of creating a mobile 360 degree, two-dimensional obstacle detection system using off-the-shelf available electronic components. Using a Lidar Lite 3 from Garmin Ltd., an Arduino compatible microcontroller based on Atmel 328 P, a Raspberry Pi 3 from The Raspberry Pi Foundation and an electronic speed controlled brushless DC motor driving the rotation, it is shown how range data measurements can be collected, communicated, processed and displayed at measurement rates between 500 and 1000 Hz. At 5 Hz update rate of a complete 360 -degree data set, this translates to a worst case angular resolution of 2. 5 degrees at ranges reaching 10 meters depending on target reflectivity. Configured for these faster measurement rates, at static measurements of a white painted wall, the measurements show a standard deviation of 0. 06 m at a five-meter range, going up to 0. 19 m at a range of 10 meters. A modular and mobile prototype was designed and built. The modularity allowed testing and verification of two configurations. Configuration A uses a slip ring for power and data transfer to the rotating sensor. Configuration B allows the laser range finder to be stationary and instead rotates a <b>first</b> <b>surface</b> aluminum <b>mirror</b> positioned at 45 degrees above the sensor. The measurement results show that increasing range has a notable adversely effect on the number of successful readings in a setting demanding faster measurement rates of above 500 Hz. The number of successful readings decreases at ranges above 5 meters, and this decrease of successful readings is more pronounced in the configuration using a mirror to reflect the measurement. The mirror reflected version does on the other hand allow an electromechanically simpler, more silent and durable system. Using a density based clustering algorithm it is shown how person sized objects in the point cloud data can be robustly detected at ranges up to 5 meters. ...|$|R
