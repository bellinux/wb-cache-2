500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a tropical house, EDM, and electropop song with elements of bashment, featuring a drum and horn instrumentation. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, the song is composed in the key of A minor, and has a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Lipa's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. In the lyrics, the singer sets a list of rules that prevent her from getting back together with an ex-boyfriend. The rules are: [...] "One: Don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone / Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again / Three: Don't be his friend, you know you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> in his bed in the morning." [...] Lipa confessed in an interview with NPR that [...] "hey're not necessarily rules I've been able to stick by. But [...] rules that I feel like it's important to be able to tell yourself, to tell your friends... There's a reason people break up, and it's probably the same reason why you shouldn't get back together." [...] Warren explained through an annotation on website Genius that the track was a self-reminder for people recovering from a break-up to not succumb to a momentary temptation since it is not [...] "a good idea in the long term".|$|E
2500|$|Guthrie was a {{prolific}} writer, penning {{thousands of pages}} of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography. Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood. During this time Guthrie met Marjorie Mazia, a dancer in New York who would become his second wife. Mazia was an instructor at the prestigious Martha Graham Dance School, where she was assisting Sophie Maslow with her piece Folksay. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by Carl Sandburg, Folksay included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads for the dance. Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography. The end product, Bound for Glory, was completed with the patient editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943. It is vividly told in the artist's down-home dialect, with the flair and imagery of a true storyteller. Library Journal complained about the [...] "too careful reproduction of illiterate speech." [...] But Clifton Fadiman, reviewing the book in the New York Times, paid the author a fine tribute: [...] "Someday people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> to the fact that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession, like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world."

60|$|The {{distrust}} of eternity at which our friend hints {{is perhaps the}} painfulest of his newly discovered differences between youth and age. Resting so serenely {{as it does in}} practically unlimited time, with ideals and desires which scarcely vary from year to year, youth has no fears of infinity. It is not afraid but it shall have abundant occupation in the æons before it, or that its emotions or volitions shall first be exhausted. Its blithe notion of immortality is that it is immortal youth. It has no conception of age, and could not imagine an eternity of accomplished facts. It is, perhaps, for this reason that doubt of immortality never really comes to youth. One of the few things which our friend still believes is that every sceptic who deals honestly with his only history must be aware of an hour, almost a moment, of waning youth, when the vague potentiality of disbelief became a living doubt, thence-forward to abide with him till death resolve it. Endless not-being is unthinkable before that time, as after it endless being is unthinkable. Yet this unthinkable endless being is all that is left to age, and it is in the notion of it alone that age can get back to the long, long thoughts in which is surcease from unrest. Our old friend may accuse us of proposing the most impossible of paradoxes when we invite him to take refuge from his whirling ideals, not in an unavailing endeavor to renew the conditions of youth in time, but in the forecast of youth in eternity. We think that the error of his impatience, his despair with the state he has come to here, is largely if not wholly through his failure to realize that he is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> old in some other being, but young, and that the capacity of long, long thoughts will be renewed in him with the renewal of his life. The restlessness of age, its fickleness, its volatility, is the expression of immense fatigue. It tosses from side to side and tries for this and that like a sick man from sheer weakness; or, rather, if the reader prefers another image, it is like some hapless wild thing caught by rising floods on a height of land which they must soon submerge, and running incessantly hither and thither as the water more narrowly hems it in.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{the number of}} {{distributed}} families has increased, {{making it harder for}} family members to maintain a feeling of intimacy. In the traditional, closely located family, family members such as grandparents, and cousins are involved in a child’s everyday life, contributing to his informal education and creating consistent intimate relationships. Current communication technology (such as telephone and email) doesn’t support this kind of interpersonal relationship in distributed families. This paper presents an early prototype of CASY – a new communication tool, designed with children in mind. Using CASY, children send other family members video snippets in the context of routine daily activities, such as “good morning ” and “good night ” snippets. The recipient views the video snippets asynchronously, in the context of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep or <b>waking</b> <b>up,</b> creating a non-stressful, continuous communication channel. CASY is designed to enhance connectedness and intimacy between distributed family members in a subtle and appropriate way...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo foi analisar como se constituem os espa??os sociais para vivenciar a velhice e as sociabilidades que geram identidade e pot??ncia aos idosos, transformando-os em atores sociais.

O instrumento foi um roteiro de pesquisa com quest??es abertas, e a interpreta????o foi a partir de an??lise de conte??do. A partir dos resultados afirma-se que os idosos vivenciam diferentes din??micas de vida e n??o querem ser vistos como doentes ou coitadinhos. Os tipos ideais encontrados foram: Idosas Vi??vas e Solit??rias; Idosos Militantes Pol??ticos; Idosos engajados em movimentos culturais;Idosos espiritualizados e solid??rios e Idosos que trabalham e estudam a quest??o do envelhecimento. Mas s??o os espa??os de sociabilidades que permitem a que os idosos se potencializem e adquiram identidade pela suas a????es. ?? nos processos de intera????o (socia????o), que se constituem como sujeitos atuantes e constroem as diferentes velhices (tipos ideais) que se encontra hoje na esfera p??blica. Os idosos, que participam de diferentes socia????es enriquecem o seu c??rculo social e tamb??m seu pr??prio desenvolvimento, intensificando diferentes intera????es, seja na forma pol??tica, {{cultural}} ou religiosa. A movimenta????o na esfera p??blica acontece quando suas a????es impulsionam-se pela subjetividade, possibilitando maior reflexividade, a partir dos movimentos sociais. Essa reflexividade lhe estimula para suas escolhas, para o engajamento e participa????o pol??tica ou para o hedonismo e a religiosidade e os conselhos de direitos t??m o dever e obriga????o de possibilitar acesso a esses conhecimentos, assim como tamb??m ??s Universidades. Os idosos detentores de engajamento pol??tico, apresentam uma lideran??a e um carisma que os potencializa para a a????o em suas comunidades, que constituem seus territ??rios de a????o e trazem esse conhecimento a m??o em suas trajet??rias de vida. O idoso ainda ?? representado por pol??ticos, intelectuais e demais pessoas interessadas em tirar proveito da quest??o social do envelhecimento. Aos poucos v??o se acordando para essa realidade e iniciam sua participa????o, mas pelo elevado n??mero de idosos do Brasil, essa participa????o pol??tica ainda ?? irris??ria e por isso se diz que os idosos ainda n??o s??o legitimamente protagonistas na esfera p??blica, pois a sua movimenta????o ainda ?? uma novidade at?? mesmo entre os pr??prios idosos. The {{purpose was}} to analyze how the social spaces are constituted to experience the old age and the sociability that generate identity and power to the elderly, transforming them into social actors. The methodological referential was qualitative. The subjects were 22 elderly. The interviewed were indicated by known people, via snow ball method: each interviewed showed references/indications from other closeable individuals {{to participate in the}} study in question. The instrument was a research guide with open questions and the interpretation was from analyzes of categories. From the results we can affirm that the elderly experience different dynamics of life and they don?t want to be seen as sick or poor people. The ideal types found were: lonely and widow female elderly; Military Politician elderly; elderly engaged in cultural movements; spiritualized and solidary elderly and elderly who work and study the question of aging. But the sociability spaces are what allow that the elderly who potentiate and acquire identity by their actions. Its in the interaction processes (association) that are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be constituted as acting subjects and building the different old ages (ideal kinds) that we find today in the public sphere. The elderly who participate in different associations enrich their social circle and also their own development, intensifying different interactions, in the political, cultural or religious means. The movement in the public sphere happens when its actions are boosted by the subjectivity, what enable it to have more reflectivity, from the social movements. This reflectivity stimulates it to its choices, to the engagement and political participation or to the hedonism and the religiosity and the advices of right have duty and the obligation to enable the access to this knowledge, as well as the Universities. The elderly who have political engagement present a leadership and charisma that potentiate them to the action and bring this knowledge to the hand on their life journey. The elderly is still represented by politicians, intellectuals and other people interested in benefiting from the aging social question. Few people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> this reality and they start their participation, but by high number of elderly in Brazil, this political participation is still negligible and so we can say that the elderly aren?t the real protagonists in the public sphere yet, because their movementaction is still something new even among the elderly themselves...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} {{towards a}} low carbon society requires modifying current energy consumption patterns in households. Considering the insufficient results achieved so far by policies {{aimed at reducing}} energy consumption, this suggests a need for ‘escaping’ from the obsessive rationality-efficiency perspective. This implies departing from an ‘expert’ view and basing the analysis on those energy-related practices that are meaningful for the practitioners (e. g. people do not ‘consume gas’ but shower before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> or cook meals for their children, etc). In order {{to look at this}} multidimensional issue of energy consumption through innovative lenses, we use an alternative conceptual framework building on the concept of habitualpractice. The rationale is to provide a precise characterisation of household energy-related practices allowing for a good understanding of their content (i. e. meaning, competences, understanding, etc) together with a clearer picture of how they are formed and sustained over time and whether they are subject to context variability and/or stability. One key element is that practices themselves embody the elements of constraint, ability and stability, sometimes referred to as ‘seeds of change’. The aim of this research is to identify and describe these ‘seeds’, which we call ‘grips’. The reason is that energy policies could lean on the grips that emerge all along the processes involved in the dynamics of practices and can be ‘(de-) activated’ for supporting a behavioural change. For instance, when elaborating on reward-based tools, policy-makers should account for skilfulness since the feeling of being competent in performing a practice provides internal reward and/or social recognition. The added value of specifying grips arises from the fact that they can contribute to the identification of consumption profiles and then be used as a dialogue interface between those profiles and the design of innovative energy-saving tools.
