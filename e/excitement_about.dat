25|$|CAPA {{was able}} to use the groundswell of popular {{interest}} in the theater to convince business and government leaders to support saving the theater. In late 1969 money was raised to purchase the Ohio and it immediately began presenting shows and concerts under the management of CAPA. These concerts included rock musicians like The Grateful Dead, Frank Zappa, and Alice Cooper. The Columbus Symphony Orchestra badly needed a permanent home and began performing at the Ohio in the fall of 1969, enjoying an increase in ticket sales thanks to <b>excitement</b> <b>about</b> the new venue.|$|E

25|$|Speaking {{about his}} {{activities}} in popularizing science, Sagan {{said that there}} were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters. The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own <b>excitement</b> <b>about</b> science to others.|$|E
25|$|However, the 1988–89 season {{would be}} a big turning point for the franchise. In 1987, coin {{collector}} Bruce McNall purchased the Kings from Buss and turned the team into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight. On August 9, 1988, McNall acquired the league's best player, Wayne Gretzky, in a blockbuster trade with the Edmonton Oilers. The trade rocked the hockey world, especially north of the border where Canadians mourned the loss of a player they considered a national treasure. McNall changed the team colors to silver and black. Gretzky's arrival generated much <b>excitement</b> <b>about</b> hockey and the NHL in Southern California, and the ensuing popularity of the Kings is credited with the arrival of another team in the region, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (later renamed to Anaheim Ducks in 2006), and the NHL's expanding or moving into other Sun Belt cities such as Dallas, Phoenix, Tampa, Miami and Nashville.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche's works did {{not reach}} a wide {{readership}} during his active writing career. However, in 1888 the influential Danish critic Georg Brandes aroused considerable <b>excitement</b> <b>about</b> Nietzsche {{through a series of}} lectures he gave at the University of Copenhagen. In the years after Nietzsche's death in 1900, his works became better known, and readers have responded to them in complex and sometimes controversial ways. Many Germans eventually discovered his appeals for greater individualism and personality development in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but responded to them divergently. He had some following among left-wing Germans in the 1890s; in 1894–1895 German conservatives wanted to ban his work as subversive. During the late 19th century Nietzsche's ideas were commonly associated with anarchist movements and appear to have had influence within them, particularly in France and the United States. H. L. Mencken produced the first book on Nietzsche in English in 1907, The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, and in 1910 a book of translated paragraphs from Nietzsche, increasing knowledge of his philosophy in the United States. Nietzsche is known today as a precursor to expressionism, existentialism, and postmodernism.|$|E

5000|$|Waters is {{well known}} for the immense amount of {{research}} she completes for her novels. Researching for The Night Watch gave her background that she used in The Little Stranger, leading her to call 1947 [...] "a miserable year"; much of her time preparing for this novel was spent in Warwickshire estate homes and local newspaper archives. She told The Globe and Mail I read a lot of novels from the period. And diaries were a wonderful resource. I also watched films from that period and went to museums and archives to look at ephemera from the period. I like to try to capture the idiom and slang... A writer at that time wouldn't have used profanity in a respectable novel. But if you look at diaries or letters, people were swearing all the time, in very modern-sounding ways. One of the <b>excitements</b> <b>about</b> writing about the past from the present is that you can put {{in a lot of the}} details that the mainstream novelists of the time couldn't because of the conventions of the time.|$|R

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the process of deciphering the tablets, Pettinato made claims about a possible connections between Ebla and the Bible, citing an alleged references in the tablets to the existence of Yahweh, the Patriarchs, Sodom and Gomorrah and other Biblical references. However, much of the initial media <b>excitement</b> <b>about</b> a supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely discredited and the academic consensus is that Ebla [...] "has no bearing on the Minor Prophets, the historical accuracy of the Biblical Patriarchs, Yahweh worship, or Sodom and Gomorrah". In Ebla studies, the focus has shifted away from comparisons with the Bible; Ebla is now studied as a civilization in its own right. The claims led to a bitter personal and academic conflict between the scholars involved, as well as what some described as political interference by the Syrian authorities.|$|E
