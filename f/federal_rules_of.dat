The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Civil Procedure.|$|E

25|$|Garner {{has contributed}} to the field of {{procedural}} rules. From 1992 to 1994, he revised all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules—Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal—for the United States Judicial Conference. In the mid-1990s, he restyled the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Appellate Procedure and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Criminal Procedure, which were adopted by the Judicial Conference, then by the United States Supreme Court, and enacted by Congress. The <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> Civil Procedure were restyled in 1993–1994 and adopted on December 1, 2007. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has printed and distributed Garner's booklet Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules (1st ed. 1996, 5th ed. 2007). Garner has revised the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Judicial Council Rules, the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and the Rules on Judicial-Conduct and Disability Proceedings (for federal courts). In 2015, after a 15-year hiatus, he returned as a style consultant to the U.S. Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.|$|E

40|$|This article makes three {{important}} contributions. First, it establishes {{that the right}} of grand jury secrecy enjoys constitutional protection. The Supreme Court has never had occasion {{to determine whether the}} right to indictment by a grand jury established by the Fifth Amendment encompasses a right to secrecy, but the recent amendments to <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Criminal Procedure 6 (e) all but guarantee that the Court will face this issue. These amendments decimate the grand jury secrecy fiercely protected under the common law and the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> procedure for nearly a millennium. They put to the test the Court’s long-held position that secrecy is “indispensable” to the grand jury process. Second, the article demonstrates that even setting aside their constitutionality, the exceptions to the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> grand jury secrecy created by the hasty amendment <b>of</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Criminal Procedure 6 (e) are unsound public policy. In creating these exceptions, Congress took measures beyond those necessary to achieve the legitimate goal of preventing and responding to threats to our national security. It granted the Department of Justice unprecedented authority to disclose grand jury materials with no supervision by the courts or by Congress. Third, the article proposes an amendment to <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Criminal Procedure 6 (e) that would preserve the right of secrecy and bring the new exceptions within constitutional limits without sacrificing national security interests...|$|R
