However, Maude lacks the formal tools to perform some of these analyses and thus they can only be done by <b>hand.</b> The Heterogeneous <b>Tool</b> <b>Set</b> Hets is an institution-based combination of different logics and corresponding rewriting, model checking, and proof tools. We present in this paper an integration of Maude into Hets that allows to use the logics and tools already integrated in Hets with Maude specifications. To achieve such integration we have defined an institution for Maude based on preordered algebras and a comorphism between Maude and CASL, the central logic in Hets...|$|R

40|$|Everyone uses <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> {{in their}} daily life, like knife and fork. Moreover, many people use <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> in their {{profession}} as well as during leisure time. It is important that they can work with <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> that provide comfort. Until now, the avoidance of discomfort was emphasized during the design process of <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> like screwdrivers, <b>hand</b> saws and paint brushes. In the near future, the focus will shift towards providing comfort. However, some questions need to be answered to make this shift, like: What does the end-user mean with comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools?</b> How can we translate this into <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> design and the design proces? How can we evaluate <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> on comfort? These questions are answered in the current thesis. Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|To design {{comfortable}} <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> {{knowledge about}} comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> is required. We investigated which factors determine comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> according to users. Therefore, descriptors of comfort/discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> {{were collected from}} literature and interviews. After that, the relatedness of a selection of the descriptors to comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> was investigated. Six comfort factors could be distinguished (functionality, posture and muscles, irritation and pain of hand and fingers, irritation of hand surface, handle characteristics, aesthetics). These six factors can be classified into three meaningful groups: functionality, physical interaction and appearance. The main conclusions were that (1) the same descriptors were related to comfort and discomfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> (2) descriptors of functionality are most related to comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> followed by descriptors of physical interaction and (3) descriptors of appearance become secondary in comfort in using <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} devoted to {{application}} of whole genome sequence comparisons in taxonomy. Driven by the rapid progress in sequencing technologies, “low budget” bacterial genomes become increasingly available in a nearly unlimited number. During finalizing this chapter, completed genomes representing 1, 604 bacterial and 85 archaeal species {{were present in the}} public data bank ([URL] reflecting the enormous progress made within sequencing microbial genomes in the last years. With the advent of next generation sequencing, whole genome sequence comparisons will be more and more important for taxonomy, especially valuable in elucidating relationship of groups of closely related bacterial strains which might form a single taxon, a subspecies or just an ecovar within a given species. The aim of this chapter is to <b>hand</b> out a <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> for applying genomics to the interested taxonomist. Using these tools might prove as being useful especially in refining groups of closely related strains, which are not resolved by their 16 S rRNA sequence. Here, we will exemplify this approach by selecting a specific group of plant – associated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains with plant growth promoting properties. In recent years, those strains were increasingly applied as biological substitutes of agrochemicals, mainly used as biofertilizer and for biocontrol of phytopathogenic microorganisms, and nematodes (Chen et al., 2007).

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} same factors {{underlie}} comfort in using {{different kinds of}} <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> (screwdrivers, paintbrushes and handsaws). The underlying factors of the <b>hand</b> <b>tools</b> are identified using principal components analysis. The relationships between comfort descriptors (i. e. statements in end-users' own words {{that are related to}} comfort) and comfort factors (i. e. groups of comfort descriptors) with comfort experience are calculated. It is concluded that the same factors (functionality, physical interaction adverse effects on skin and in soft tissues) underlie comfort in different kinds of <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> however their relative importance differed. Functionality and physical interaction are the most important factors of comfort in using screwdrivers and paintbrushes (beta 0. 73 and 0. 67, respectively) and functionality was {{the most important factor in}} using handsaws (beta 0. 72). Moreover, the most important comfort descriptors differ between different kinds of <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> 'Has a nice feeling handle' (beta 0. 27), 'fits the hand' (beta 0. 43) and 'offers a high task performance' (beta 0. 43) are the most important comfort descriptors in using screwdrivers, paintbrushes and handsaws, respectively. Moreover, similarities are seen: 'Fits the hand' is associated with comfort in all studied <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> The results are applied in a flow chart, which designers can use to address the appropriate comfort descriptors in the <b>hand</b> <b>tool</b> design process. © 2006 Elsevier B.
