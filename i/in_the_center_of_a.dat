Beckett and two more starting pitchers (John Lackey and Jon Lester) were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> controversy where the three drank alcohol during games, where they weren't pitching, and also ate fried chicken and played video games.

5|$|Possibly the gem of the Sycamore Historic District is the DeKalb County Courthouse. The Courthouse sits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> square facing Illinois Route 64, {{directly}} across the north/south street, Main, from the Sycamore Public Library.

5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} was {{produced}} during a photo shoot which remains the most expensive one to be ever developed in Romania, with the total costs amounting to €15,000. It was shot by Edward Aninaru at the Media Pro Pictures studios in Buftea. Over 50 male and female models were featured in the shooting, which consisted of two different images — an uncensored one leaked onto {{the internet and the}} photograph used to commercialize the album.

5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> huge administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal {{on the assumption that}} it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|Expectations {{were high}} for the 2008 season, but Cleveland {{finished}} last in the AFC North with a 4–12 record. Anderson shared starts with Ken Dorsey, who the Browns had acquired by trading away Trent Dilfer, and Brady Quinn, a young quarterback the team drafted in 2007. The Browns never contended during 2008 and failed to score a touchdown in the final six games. Near {{the end of the}} season, two scandals shook the team. It was revealed that several Browns players, including Winslow, were suffering from staph infections, which raised questions about sanitation in the Browns' Berea practice facilities. In November, Savage found himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> media storm after an angry e-mail exchange with a fan was published on Deadspin, a sports blog. Shortly after the final game, a 31–0 loss to the Steelers, Lerner fired Savage and, a day later, Crennel.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1870, flags {{were created}} for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for {{other members of the}} {{imperial}} family. At first, the Emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting in the center of an artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monocolored background. These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag. With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Fort Donelson, which began on February 12, took place {{shortly after the}} {{surrender}} of Fort Henry, Tennessee, on February 6, 1862. Fort Henry had been a key position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> line defending Tennessee, and the capture of the fort now opened the Tennessee River to Union troop and supply movements. About 2,500 of Fort Henry's Confederate defenders escaped before its surrender by marching the 12 miles (19km) east to Fort Donelson. In the days following the surrender at Fort Henry, Union troops cut the railroad lines south of the fort, restricting the Confederates' lateral mobility to move reinforcements into the area to defend against the larger Union forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} was suggested on 1 November 1943 by Robert Serber. The {{idea was to}} measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere. The test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression. The gamma ray source was located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> metal sphere. The increase of thickness (of hollow shells) and density (of solid spheres) as the compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of gamma rays outside of the sphere; the lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough {{to interfere with the}} experiment. The gamma rays had to be intense and of the right energy. Too low energy, and they would be fully absorbed in the surrounding metal; too high energy and the difference of attenuation during the implosion would be too low to be practical. The detectors had to provide high speed and large area; fast ionization chambers, then under development, were the only devices then available satisfying the requirements.|$|E

25|$|Using {{the above}} methods for simple polygons, we allow that {{particular}} regions within the polygon may have their area multiplied {{by a factor}} which we call {{the density of the}} region.

The two triangular regions of a cross-quadrilateral (like a figure 8) have opposite-signed densities, and adding their areas together can give a total area of zero for the whole figure.|$|E
