40|$|In this {{qualitative}} research project, I examine {{the development of}} landscapes of care for, and by, identified trafficked people {{and its implications for}} rebuilding a sense of place and identity. Through in-depth interviews and ethnographic data, I argue that discourse, place and identity interact to form complex landscapes within both providers and clients/patients that emerge as distinct experiences of care or non-care experiences. Each analytical chapter examines a particular production of care: a merging of psycho-legal care, the interactions of formalized informal caring relationships, and the burden of <b>external</b> <b>identification</b> in the configuration of self-identity among identified trafficked people. Building on anthropological theories of care (Giordano 2014; Mulla 2014; Stevenson 2014; Mattingly 2010), these chapters build the argument that, in contrast to humanitarian human trafficking and trauma discourse that focuses on a specific kind of trafficking experience; the complex assemblage of trafficking experience and subsequent care should be considered within what I term “structural trafficking. ” Becoming identified as trafficked is beneficial for receiving specific rights and services. However, this identity can also be detrimental for rebuilding a sense of self and place, because it assumes a fixed experience that translates to fixed care packages. I examine multiple landscapes of care to better understand potentials for care by expanding identity and coordinating existing and novel systems of care...|$|E

However being Malaysian – Chinese is not a simple matter of government imposed labeling, as youth construct their own sense of ethnic identification that is specifically adapted to their own life circumstances in a modernized and multiethnic setting and in interaction with family and peers. Furthermore, it will show how not only the state influences people’s identification, but also how people change state practices and ideology as Chinese Malaysian youth and their middle class peers imagine the future nation ethnicity free...|$|E

In this paper we suggest the formal method of constructing a topological model of system functioning. The topological functioning model shows a system from the computation independent viewpoint as a mathematical topological space of functional features interconnected by cause-and-effect relations. Topological and functional properties of the model allow formal identification of a system model from the topological space of an environment, model refinement and abstraction. The topological functioning model allows capturing information in a formal way {{at the very beginning of}} software development, thus it gives a well-defined opportunity to get a high-quality end result within the framework of MDA. The suggested method supposes formal obtaining of the system model from the informal verbal description of the system. The main stages of the method, which are described in this paper, are as follows: system inner object <b>identification,</b> <b>external</b> system <b>identification,</b> system functional feature definition, cause-and-effect relation identification among the found functional features, and topological model of system functioning mathematical separation from the topological space of system environment.

40|$|This study explores how Swedish {{migrants}} on the Costa del Sol in Spain create {{belonging and}} how this is expressed in migration stories and practiced in the daily life. The migrants {{are part of a}} migration phenomenon that is conceptualized as lifestyle migration, often to destinations in association with tourism and leisure. Based on ethnographical fieldwork carried out among Swedish migrants within the Swedish infrastructure of institutions, organizations and private enterprises on the Costa del Sol, the thesis examines how belonging is created adopting a phenomenological and constructivist perspective on transnational and diasporic practices. This is accomplished through studying migration stories, where the migration experience is being told, structured and made meaningful for the migrants. In addition, it focuses on internal and <b>external</b> <b>identification</b> and positioning on location on the Costa del Sol. Another concern is the study of how the migrants relate to notions and practices of new home, and old home.

40|$|This study {{reflects}} on Pakhtun {{sense of belonging}} and suggests a complex and dynamic process of identification that involves multiple aspects. The multilayered, contextual and contested identification process among Pakhtuns indicates segmentary ethnicity that has intra ethnic, inter ethnic and national aspects. It argues that the literature on Pakhtun identity highlights the internal stratification and ecological variation amongst Pakhtuns but stop short of establishing any relationship between this internal stratification {{and the process of}} identification. The literature also fails to see the significance of the continuous and progressive identification of Pakhtuns with Pakistan and Islam. Focusing on generative processes (internal and <b>external</b> <b>identification)</b> in time of flux this thesis remains contemporary in its approach to ethnicity and identity. It also contributes to the debate in Social Anthropology about the relative emphasis on ‘boundary’ or the ‘cultural stuff’. The research focuses on Malakand in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Pakistan), which in its changing administrative status has hybridity of the ‘autonomous’ Tribal Areas and ‘governed’ Settled Districts. Such transforming status has a greater significance to investigate identity processes in time of flux and in the context of Pakhtun ecological variation. I have argued in this study that Pakhtuns in Malakand categorize each other as Khanan and Ghariban in times of socio economic change. These categories in reciprocal opposition maintain categorical boundary through a meaning system that is informed by particular patterns of social conduct. The two categories are also involved in contextual contestation over the ethnic identity i. e who is Pakhtun? The contestation involves alternative emphasis on ascribed and performing aspects of Pakhtunness in local and non local contexts. Pakhtuns also reflect on their Pakistani and Muslim identities in a progressive way. Although Pakhtun identity remains primary in relation to Pakistani identity, they do perceive themselves as belonging to a multi ethnic Pakistani identity. The non ideological and non sectarian Muslim identity remains significant to Pakhtuns. However, the current religious unrest in the region has generated a discourse that reconsiders the relationship between Pakhtun cultural code and Islam. The thesis thus concludes that dynamic identification processes among Pakhtuns of Pakistan indicate multilayered, contested and contextual Pakhtunness. This also alludes to the segmentary nature of ethnicity and the complexity of relationship between ethnicity and Islam in Pakistan. ...|$|E

At the monastery of Bury St. Edmunds, the abbatial seat remained vacant from 1212 to 1215, partly because of a dire struggle between two parties within the monastic community. An anonymous monk, himself involved in the battle, wrote a short but detailed chronicle, especially devoted to the story of the conflict. This paper argues that this account is one the first medieval analyses of practical politics. The author is consciously critical of the liturgical and juridical forms of action, and explores a wide range of political tactics: anticipation, internal and <b>external</b> pressure, <b>identification</b> and disqualification of enemies, alliances, and so on. This must not be seen as a harbinger of democratic debates, but as an early assertion of the autonomy of the political field, just before the Magna Carta and in relation to the intense experience of action during the Anglo-Norman period.
