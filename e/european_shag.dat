2500|$|No {{consistent}} distinction {{exists between}} cormorants and shags. The names 'cormorant' and 'shag' were originally the common {{names of the}} two species of the family found in Great Britain, Phalacrocorax carbo (now referred to by ornithologists as the great cormorant) and P. aristotelis (the <b>European</b> <b>shag).</b> [...] "Shag" [...] refers to the bird's crest, which the British forms of the great cormorant lack. As other species were discovered by English-speaking sailors and explorers elsewhere in the world, some were called cormorants and some shags, depending on whether they had crests or not. Sometimes the same species is called a cormorant {{in one part of}} the world and a shag in another, e.g., the great cormorant is called the black shag in New Zealand (the birds found in Australasia have a crest that is absent in European members of the species). Van Tets (1976) proposed to divide the family into two genera and attach the name [...] "cormorant" [...] to one and [...] "shag" [...] to the other, but this flies in the face of common usage and has not been widely adopted.|$|E

40|$|The 2001 {{season for}} seabirds on the Isle of May was characterised by high {{interspecific}} variation, particularly in breeding success. Thus some species had their most productive season since monitoring began, while others had their least productive. Timing of breeding in auks and Northern fulmars was normal, while <b>European</b> <b>shags</b> and black-legged kittiwakes laid later than in recent years. Return rates were generally close to {{or above the}} long-term average, except for common guillemots which were lower. Sandeels and clupeids were the predominant prey items, but varied in importance between species. <b>European</b> <b>shags</b> had an excellent breeding season. Although breeding started later than in 2000, overall breeding success (1. 53 chicks per incubated nest) was the highest recorded since intensive monitoring began in 1986.

50|$|This is a medium-large black bird, 68 to 78 cm {{long and}} with a 95 to 110 cm wingspan. It has a longish tail and yellow throat-patch. Adults have a small crest in the {{breeding}} season.

Among those differences are that a shag has a lighter, narrower beak; and the juvenile shag has darker underparts. The European shag's tail has 12 feathers, the great cormorant's 14 feathers.

40|$|Studies of the fine-scale use of {{foraging}} habitat {{are essential}} for understanding the role of seabirds in marine ecosystems. However, until recently, relationships between foraging and habitat usage were only possible at a coarse scale. We used miniaturized bird-borne digital still-picture camera loggers to obtain high-quality images of the foraging habitat used by 9 <b>European</b> <b>shags</b> Phalacrocorax aristotelis. Underwater images revealed that shags are almost exclusively benthic feeders, but used 2 very distinct foraging habitats: sandy areas and rocky areas with brittlestars, soft corals and kelp. We {{found no evidence that}} individuals specialize on a particular habitat. Birds were recorded in rocky and sandy areas {{over the course of a}} day and in some cases within a trip. Foraging behaviour differed markedly between habitats. In rocky areas birds foraged solitarily, over a wide range of depths (10 to 40 m) and travelled along the bottom while searching for bottom-living fish such as butterfish Pholis gunnellus. In contrast, shags using sandy habitat frequently fed with conspecifics, foraged mainly at 2 depths (24 or 32 m) and spent the bottom phase of the dive probing into the sand with their bill, presumably to catch lesser sandeels Ammodytes marinus, the major prey item in the diet. This study highlights the flexible foraging strategy of <b>European</b> <b>shags</b> and illustrates how image and dive data can be combined to improve our understanding of the factors influencing the foraging success of benthic feeders...|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamics {{results in}} two {{characteristic}} speeds of flying birds: the minimum power speed and the maximum range speed. The minimum power speed requires the lowest rate of energy expenditure per unit time to stay airborne and the maximum range speed maximizes air distance traveled {{per unit of}} energy consumed. Therefore, if birds aim to minimize the cost of transport under a range of wind conditions, they are predicted to fly at the maximum range speed. Furthermore, take-off is predicted to be strongly affected by wind speed and direction. To investigate the effect of wind conditions on take-off and cruising flight behavior, we equipped 14 <b>European</b> <b>shags</b> Phalacrocorax aristotelis with a back-mounted GPS logger to measure position and hence ground speed, and a neck-mounted accelerometer to record wing beat frequency and strength. Local wind conditions were recorded during the deployment period. Shags always took off into the wind regardless of their intended destination and take-off duration was correlated negatively with wind speed. We combined ground speed and direction during the cruising phase with wind speed and direction to estimate air speed and direction. Whilst ground speed was highly variable, air speed was comparatively stable, although it increased significantly during strong head winds, because of stronger wing beats. The increased air speeds in head winds suggest that birds fly at the maximum range speed, not at the minimum power speed. Our study demonstrates that <b>European</b> <b>shags</b> actively adjust their flight behavior to utilize wind power to minimize the costs of take-off and cruising flight...|$|R
40|$|The global {{increase}} in tidal stream turbine installations creates {{a need to}} identify and mitigate any impacts on seabird populations. Within Scotland, UK, the vulnerability of black guillemots Cepphus grylle and <b>European</b> <b>shags</b> Phalacrocorax aristotelis is dependent on their tendency to exploit microhabitats characterised by fast mean horizontal current speeds (≥ 2 ms– 1), and tidal states with maximum current speeds, within tidal stream environments. Identifying consistencies in their relative use of different microhabitats (fast versus slow mean horizontal current speeds) and tidal states (increasing/decreasing versus maximum currents) across these habitats could assist risk assessment and mitigation measures at both a regional and development site level. Datasets from shore-based surveys collated across 6 tidal stream environments showed that the probability of detecting foraging black guillemots and <b>European</b> <b>shags</b> tended to be higher in fast and slow microhabitats, respectively. However, differences between microhabitats were reversed and/or marginal in 3 out of the 5 sites used for each species. Differences between tidal states were almost always marginal. These variabilities show that a species' vulnerability could differ greatly among development sites, and environmental impact assessments (EIA) must quantify habitat-use using dedicated and site-specific surveys to reduce uncertainty. However, {{a greater understanding of}} the mechanisms underlying variation in the use of tidal stream environments is needed when selecting a suite of potential development sites that reduce the possibility of population-level impacts. The current collection of physical and biological data across tidal stream environments could therefore prove invaluable for the protection of seabird populations...|$|R
