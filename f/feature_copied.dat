50|$|Tests proved, that Sum was a {{successful}} design, with much better performance, than Karaś. The only major faults were with a mechanism of retracting of the underbelly gondola (the gondola for a bombardier, with a machine gun at the rear, was a <b>feature</b> <b>copied</b> from Karaś, where it was a fixed one. It was rare feature in light bombers' construction and its usefulness was questionable, as it reduced performance).|$|E
50|$|The main chapel {{was built}} {{at an angle}} that could {{maximise}} the natural light. The windows are tall, glazed slits. The walls are constructed from white calcined flint aggregate concrete blocks in three sizes arranged to give a distinctive pattern. The chapel has tall, angled fins that provide dramatic shapes. The use of light and colour {{has been compared to}} the effects seen in Coventry Cathedral, also designed by Spence. From the main buildings a simple concrete cross can be seen, positioned on a small hill, a <b>feature</b> <b>copied</b> from Gunnar Asplund's Woodland Crematorium in Stockholm. Overall the crematorium design achieves 'calmly expressionist forms'. The design stands out from the other 250 or so crematoria across the UK.|$|E

50|$|The castle was demilitarized in 1871, {{and most}} of its {{remaining}} structures were destroyed, except for a portion of its moats and two gates. The castle site became a city park. One corner yagura was reconstructed in 1958. However, it is not a historically accurate reconstruction, and contains various <b>features</b> <b>copied</b> from other structures to make it more visually appealing.|$|R
50|$|Below the hill, a Baroque {{ornamental}} garden, modelled on the parterre at Versailles, {{was constructed}} in 1745. The Great Fountain was built at the centre of this garden in 1748. Frederick never saw the fountain playing because the engineers employed in the construction had little understanding of the hydraulics involved. From 1750, marble statues were placed around the basin of the fountain. This again was a <b>feature</b> <b>copied</b> from Versailles: figures of Venus, Mercury, Apollo, Diana, Juno, Jupiter, Mars and Minerva, as well as allegorical portrayals of the four elements Fire, Water, Air and Earth. Venus and Mercury, {{the works of the}} sculptor Jean Baptiste Pigalle, and two groups of hunters, allegories of the elements (wind and water) by Lambert Sigisbert Adam, were presented by Versailles's owner, the French King Louis XV. The remaining figures came from the workshop of François Gaspard Adam, a renowned sculptor in Berlin. By 1764, the French Rondel, as it came to be known, was completed.|$|E
5000|$|Maximum {{deemed the}} Saturn version [...] "a mildly {{entertaining}} but graphically impoverished title for {{fans of the}} original only." [...] They criticized the port's many graphical shortcomings, particularly the jerky frame rate, heavy slowdown in two-player mode, lack of texture mapping on enemy craft, and clipping polygon scenery which can cause the player's craft to become stuck. They also took issue with the control configuration and bizarre [...] "hot seat" [...] multiplayer mode, though they praised the additional courses and selection of cars. In contrast, Rad Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine called it [...] "a brilliant title", applauding the varied abilities and handling of the vehicles, the combat elements, the assortment of multiplayer modes, and the hover vehicle physics. While noting that the conversion was not as outstanding as Sega's arcade ports, he nonetheless found it of acceptable quality. GamePro concurred with Maximum that the game has a strong selection of cars and tracks but poor graphics. They also criticized the loose, unresponsive controls and the sounds. Next Generation likewise commented that [...] "With its blocky graphics, devilishly slow frame-rate, and nebulous controls, Hi-Octane simply lacks the focus of most console games." [...] He added that the game was very similar to, but clearly inferior to, its contemporaries Cyber Speedway and Wipeout. However, he also stated that [...] "One truly awesome concept introduced ... is the realtime morphing tracks which add {{a great deal to}} the game's challenge and is sure to be a <b>feature</b> <b>copied</b> in future racing titles." ...|$|E
5000|$|... the {{question}} of whether there has been substantial copying focuses on whether the <b>copied</b> <b>features</b> constitute a substantial part of the plaintiff’s work [...] not whether they amount to a substantial part of the defendant’s work. However, if the differences are so great that the work, viewed as a whole, is not an imitation but rather a new and original work, then there is no infringement. The trial judge concluded that, despite any differences between the works, it was still possible to identify in Sucroë <b>features</b> <b>copied</b> from Curiosity and that these features constituted a substantial part of Robinson’s work.|$|R

5000|$|... {{while the}} Computer Associates test may prove useful in {{determining}} whether substantial portions of works such as computer programs have been copied, many types of works do not lend themselves to a reductive analysis.

50|$|Although {{ground was}} broken in 1866, {{it was not}} until 1881 that the {{elaborate}} spire (with <b>features</b> <b>copied</b> from Senlis Cathedral, France) with protruding gargoyles and statues of the four evangelists, was added. The spire features a richly crocheted area near the top. The original height of the spire was 200 ft. On August 1, 1922 a gilded cross, which measured 7 ft was installed {{at the top of the}} spire. A moving picture was made of the unusual event and was shown on screens throughout the country.|$|R

Though the jacket was similar to the U.S. design, the trousers maintained the battledress design, but with some <b>features</b> <b>copied</b> from American olive drab (OD) herringbone twill trousers.
