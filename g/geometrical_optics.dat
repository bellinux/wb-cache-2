5|$|<b>Geometrical</b> <b>optics</b> {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E

25|$|The early writers {{discussed}} here treated vision {{more as a}} geometrical than as a physical, physiological, or psychological problem. The first known author of a treatise on <b>geometrical</b> <b>optics</b> was the geometer Euclid (c. 325 BC–265 BC). Euclid began his study of optics as he began his study of geometry, {{with a set of}} self-evident axioms.|$|E
25|$|Plato first {{articulated}} the emission theory, {{the idea that}} visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the parity reversal of mirrors in Timaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid wrote a treatise entitled Optics where he linked vision to geometry, creating <b>geometrical</b> <b>optics.</b> He based his work on Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that {{a beam of light}} from the eye could instantaneously light up the stars every time someone blinked. Ptolemy, in his treatise Optics, held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. He summarised much of Euclid and went on to describe a way to measure the angle of refraction, though he failed to notice the empirical relationship between it and the angle of incidence.|$|E

25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by <b>geometrical</b> <b>optics.</b> Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} <b>geometrical</b> two-photon <b>optics</b> of Bessel-Gaussian modes generated in spontaneous parametric down-conversion of a Gaussian pump beam. We provide a general theoretical expression for the {{orbital angular momentum}} (OAM) spectrum and Schmidt number in this basis and show how this may be varied by control over the radial degree of freedom, a continuous parameter in Bessel-Gaussian modes. As a test we first implement a back-projection technique to classically predict, by experiment, the quantum correlations for Bessel-Gaussian modes produced by three holographic masks, a blazed axicon, binary axicon and a binary Bessel function. We then proceed to test the theory on the down-converted photons using the binary Bessel mask. We experimentally quantify the number of usable OAM modes and confirm the theoretical prediction of a flattening in the OAM spectrum and a concomitant increase in the OAM bandwidth. The results have implications for the control of dimensionality in quantum states. Comment: 8 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Electron optics {{was born}} in 1927, when Hans Busch showed that the {{elementary}} lens equation is applicable to electron image formation. Interest was soon awakened in France and {{a book on the}} subject by Louis de Broglie appeared in 1950. We draw attention to the highlights of electron optics and microscopy over the decades, with particular reference to aberration correction, and to some little known French contributions to the story of the scanning electron microscope and to Fourier optics. The natural starting-point for this occasion is the book Optique électronique et corpusculaire by Louis de Broglie, published in 1950 and based on lectures delivered in the Institut Henri Poincaré during the academic years 1946 – 47 and 1947 – 48. This is a remarkably complete work, all the more impressive in that de Broglie had not contributed to <b>geometrical</b> electron <b>optics</b> and, according to his preface, had not had access to any recent books on electron optics and electron microscopy; the only works on electron optics cited are the early text of Brüche and Scherzer (1934) and the dissertatio...|$|R
