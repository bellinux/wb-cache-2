5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot resembled a real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in scaring off insectivorous birds. In another experiment using peacock butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been rubbed off, insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) were much less effectively frightened off, and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, and the actual eyespot pattern, contribute to the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deimatic display.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Breitenfeld, in 1631, Adolphus {{proved the}} <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changes made to his army, by {{defeating}} Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes {{were able to}} fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery, and their infantry's linear formations helped ensure they didn't lose any ground. Battered by cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke ranks and fled.|$|E
5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929.

In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E

Shaughnessy's successes showcased the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> T {{formation}} and encouraged its widespread adoption. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1968.

5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, {{although}} they never finished lower than fourth in the table. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly {{after the death of}} Roy Kilner in 1928. The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained at something approaching his bowling peak. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} to seal off the river with a chain or a boom {{stretching}} between the blockhouse and Tilbury Fort on the other bank, which was eventually accomplished {{at a cost of}} £305.

The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E
