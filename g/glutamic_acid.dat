5|$|Many {{important}} proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} have biological functions. For example, {{in the human}} brain, glutamate (standard <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid)</b> and gamma-amino-butyric acid ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Hydroxyproline, {{a major component of}} the connective tissue collagen, is synthesised from proline. Glycine is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells. Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|E

Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.|$|E
40|$|As {{the nucleus}} accumbens shell plays an {{important}} role in the control of eating behaviour, the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in: (a) the level of aspartic and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> in the accumbens shell of conditioned rats after the presentation of an aversive diet containing thiamine-free food; (b) the temperature of interscapular brown adipose tissue, effector of thermogenesis related to food intake. The concentration of aspartic and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> in the accumbens shell, and brown adipose tissue temperature were monitored in conditioned male Sprague-Dawley rats before and after the presentation of thiamine-free food or standard laboratory food. The aspartic and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> were collected using a microdialysis probe and quantified by HPLC. Food intake was also measured. The results indicated that an intake of standard laboratory food induced an increase in the level of aspartic and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids,</b> and an elevation in temperature of brown adipose tissue; whereas an intake of thiamine-free food blocks these increases in the conditioned animals. The thiamine-free diet modifies the release of excitatory amino acids in the nucleus accumbens of conditioned animals. This diet also affects thermogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Uptake of radiolabeled {{peptides}} in {{the kidneys}} may obscure abdominal tumors in radiopeptide scintigraphy. This problem {{is much more}} pronounced in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (i. e., radiopeptide therapy), possibly leading to renal damage or even failure. Cationic peptide uptake in the kidneys can be reduced by the application of cationic amino acids, such as lysine or arginine. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a suitable method to reduce anionic peptide uptake in the kidneys. (111) In-Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid dGlu(1) -minigastrin ((111) In-DTPA-dGlu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH(2)) was chosen as a model compound with a sequence of 6 negatively charged <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> in a chain and an additional aspartic acid. METHODS: TT (human medullary carcinoma cells) -bearing nu/nu mice of the Institute of Cancer Research genotype received intraperitoneal injections of different chain lengths and weights of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids,</b> aspartic acids, and derivatives of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids.</b> Uptake in tumors and organs was determined and compared with the values for untreated control mice. RESULTS: Accretion of (111) In-DTPA-dGlu(1) -minigastrin in the kidneys could be reduced by up to 90 %. The uptake values for all other organs and the tumors were not affected. These results were obtained with a chain of 5 or more <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids,</b> whereas uptake in kidneys was affected not at all or only slightly with poly-d-glutamic or polyaspartic acids and with Glu(x) (x = 1 - 4). CONCLUSION: These studies indicated a specific blocking of uptake by Glu(5) sequences in the kidneys. Application of polyglutamic acids is a new, successful method of reducing uptake of negatively charged peptides in the kidneys during radiopeptide therapy...|$|R

5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} {{muscimol}} are structurally {{related to each}} other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A short {{review on}} the {{discovery}} of the relation between vitamin K and the syn-thesis of clotting factors and on the development of anticoagulant herapy is given. The pro-coagulant actiyity induced by vitamin K resides in the postribosomal modification of N-terminal <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> in y-COOH <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids.</b> The mode of action of oral anticoagulants is explained. The concentration-effect relations and the choice ofan oral anticoagulant is dis-cussed.

5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a <b>glutamic</b> <b>acid</b> analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E

40|$|Scaffold {{proteins}} bind to and functionally link protein {{members of}} signaling pathways. Interaction of the scaffold proteins, myosin phosphatase target subunit (MYPT 1) and myosin phosphatase-RhoA interacting protein (MRIP), causes co-localization of myosin phosphatase and RhoA to actomyosin. To examine biophysical properties of interaction of MYPT 1 with MRIP, we employed analytical ultracentrifugation and surface plasmon resonance. In regard to MRIP, its residues 724 - 837 are {{sufficient for the}} MYPT 1 /MRIP interaction. Moreover, MRIP binds to MYPT 1 as either a monomer or a dimer. With respect to MYPT 1, its leucine repeat region, LR (residues 991 - 1030) is sufficient {{to account for the}} MYPT 1 /MRIP interaction. Furthermore, point mutations that replace <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> 998 - 1000 within LR reduced the binding affinity toward MRIP.

40|$|Antifreeze {{proteins}} (AFPs) {{function to}} protect organisms from freezing in subzero temperatures. AFPs in insects {{have been discovered}} {{to be the most}} effective in decreasing the freezing point of water without affecting the melting point, apparently a phenomenon known as thermal hysteresis (TH). AFPs in the common mealworm Tenebrio molitor(TmAFPs) and the fire-colored beetle Dendroides canadensis (DAFPs) both share amino acid sequence similarity and secondary structure. In previous work the antifreeze activity of DAFP- 1 was shown to be enhanced by molecules such as trehalose, glycerol, and nicotinamide adeinine dinucleotide (NADH). It has been demonstrated that this enhancement activity is due to the arginine residues present in DAFPs. Unlike DAFP- 1, TmAFP does not contain arginines. Our hypothesis is that the negatively charged residues such as aspartic and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> of TmAFP might play a role in enhancement. Interactions with positively charged molecules such as aminoglycosides may enhance the TH activity of TmAFP, and suggest that the interaction between these compounds and the aspartic and <b>glutamic</b> <b>acids</b> is responsible for this effect.
