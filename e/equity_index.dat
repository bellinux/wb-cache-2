40|$|This study extends prior {{research}} (e. g., Bensimon, Hao & Bustillos, 2006; Perna, et al., 2006) that has examined postsecondary access and equity in enrollments for underrepresented student groups. Descriptive statistics {{are used to}} examine the status of equity in undergraduate enrollments for Black, Latino and low-income students, as well as trends in the status of equity for these groups from 1994 to 2004, at public flagship campuses and at other public four-year universities. Multivariate regression analyses are used to test the study's conceptual model which explores whether a relationship exists between variables shaped by human capital and institutional isomorphism, and institutions' <b>equity</b> <b>indices.</b> This study advances understandings {{of the degree to which}} the public four-year sector is adequately enrolling students from underrepresented groups, the relationship between institutions' flagship status and the enrollment <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> for various groups of, the relationship between the pursuit of prestige and equity in undergraduate enrollments, and how variables within institutions' purview of control are related to their enrollment <b>equity</b> <b>indices.</b> The study's findings suggest that Black, Latino and low-income students do not achieve equity in undergraduate enrollments at public four-year universities or flagship campuses in a majority of states. In most states, Black and low-income students are more likely to achieve equity at public four year universities than at flagships, while Latinos are more likely to achieve equity at flagship campuses than at other public four-year universities. Of all three student groups, however, low-income students are most likely to be underrepresented in undergraduate enrollments at both public four-year universities and flagship campuses. 	The descriptive analyses also show that, over a 10 -year period, the enrollment <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> for Black and Latino students have decreased at public four-year institutions and flagship campuses in a majority of states. Conversely, the enrollment <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> for low-income students increased at public four-year and flagship universities in a majority of states during the same time period. However, despite the upward trend in the enrollment <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> for low-income students, in 2004 this group achieved equity at public four-year universities in only five states and at the public flagship university in only one state. The results of the multivariate analyses suggest that a relationship exists between human capital and institutional isomorphism variables, and the enrollment <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> for Black, Latino and low-income students. The analyses also reveal a statistically significant negative relationship between institutions' flagship status and their enrollment <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> for Black and low-income students, but not for Latino students. The study's findings have implications for policy, practice and research. Specifically, the findings underscore the need to examine the status of equity within state-specific contexts, and to calculate separate <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> for different institutional sectors.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{proposes a}} {{non-linear}} programming optimization model that could simultaneously consider the ramp metering efficiency and <b>equity</b> issue. <b>Equity</b> <b>indexes</b> are defined {{to capture the}} degree of equity of the ramp metering, which are formulated as constraints in the model. Dynamic penalty method is adopted {{to deal with the}} constraints since they are soft in nature in which solutions with small violations could be acceptable. A modified cell transmission model (MCTM) is chosen to simulate the traffic flow propagation in the network where the objective function value is derived from it. The results of the case study show that the proposed methodology could give better solutions compared to initial solutions. However, the <b>equity</b> <b>indexes</b> obtained are low.

40|$|This article aims {{to extend}} {{evaluation}} of the classic multifactor model of Carhart (1997) for the case of global <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> and to expand analysis performed in Sakowski et. al. (2015). Our intention is to test several modifications of these models {{to take into account}} different dynamics of equity excess returns between emerging and developed <b>equity</b> <b>indices.</b> Proposed extensions include a volatility regime switching mechanism (using dummy variables and the Markov approach) and the fifth risk factor based on realized volatility of index returns. Moreover, instead of using data for stocks of a particular market (which is a common approach in the literature), we check performance of these models for weekly data of 81 world investable <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> in the period of 2000 - 2015. Such an approach is proposed to estimate an equity risk premium for a single country. Empirical evidence reveals important differences between results for classical models estimated on single stocks (either in international or US-only frameworks) and models evaluated for <b>equity</b> <b>indices.</b> Additionally, we observe substantial discrepancies between results for developed countries and emerging markets. Finally, using weekly data for the last 15 years we illustrate the importance of model risk and data overfitting effects when drawing conclusions upon results of multifactor models...|$|R
25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} delivery month of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many <b>equity</b> <b>index</b> and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of <b>equity</b> <b>index</b> futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E
25|$|On August 2, 2010, the TSE {{main index}} (TEPIX) reached a record level of 16,056 points, despite US-sponsored {{sanctions}} against Iran. Thus, TEDPIX became the world’s second-best performing <b>equity</b> <b>index.</b> Factors {{such as the}} global spike in oil and metal prices, government support for industries and oil sectors {{as well as the}} growth of stock market liquidity flow contributed to the boom. Experts commented that the growth was also partly due to a government decision to sell off 20 percent of its equity in two major automakers. Given the relative low market valuation of TSE stocks in 2010, the upward trend was expected to continue over the long run, rather than being a bubble. TEPIX reached a new record on September 18, 2010, when it hit 18,658, up from 11,295 {{at the start of the}} year. As of December 2010, the TSE index rose about 64 percent since the start of 2010.

Using high-frequency intraday data, I find a large and significant response of Asian, European, and Latin American <b>equity</b> <b>indexes</b> to U.

In this paper, I use two proxies for monetary policy surprises: a surprise change to the current target federal funds rate, and a revision to the path of future monetary policy (Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2004)). Consistent with results for the U. S. equity market, this paper finds that in most cases foreign <b>equity</b> <b>indexes</b> react only to a surprise change in the current target rate. On average, a hypothetical unanticipated 25 -basis-point cut in the federal funds target rate {{is associated with a}} 1 / 2 to 21 / 2 percent increase in foreign <b>equity</b> <b>indexes.</b> The variation of the response across countries appears to be more related to the degree of financial integration with the United States than it is to trade linkages with the United States or the degree of exchange rate flexibility.

40|$|<b>Equity</b> <b>indices</b> {{are known}} to exhibit an {{asymmetric}} leverage effect, meaning that negative returns have {{a greater impact on}} volatility than positive returns of the same magnitude. We reevaluate the presence of leverage effect in a large sample of 21 <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> around the world.

Using realized volatility as a benchmark allows us for a more precise comparison of volatility models. Moreover, we also study models based directly on realized volatility. We find that all the 21 <b>equity</b> <b>indices</b> analyzed exhibit the leverage effect. In order to investigate whether asymmetric models produce more accurate volatility forecasts than symmetric models, three pairs of volatility models are compared. Within each pair, two models are almost identical. The only difference is that one model allow for the leverage effect, whereas the other model is a restricted version, which does not allow for the leverage effect. We find that the volatility models that allow for the asymmetric leverage effect produce significantly more accurate forecasts than the symmetric volatility models...|$|R
