40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} ice nucleation {{ability of}} oxalic acid in the immersion mode {{has been investigated}} by controlled expansion cooling runs with airborne, ternary solution droplets composed of, (i), sodium chloride, oxalic acid, and water (NaCl/OA/H 2 O) and, (ii), sulphuric acid, oxalic acid, and water (H 2 SO 4 /OA/H 2 O). Polydisperse aerosol populations with median diameters ranging from 0. 5 – 0. 7 μm and varying solute concentrations were prepared. The expansion experiments were conducted in the AIDA aerosol and cloud chamber of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at initial temperatures of 244 and 235 K. In the ternary NaCl/OA/H 2 O system, solid inclusions of oxalic acid, presumably nucleated as oxalic acid dihydrate, were formed by temporarily exposing the ternary solution droplets to a relative humidity below the efflorescence point of NaCl. The matrix of the crystallised NaCl particulates triggered the precipitation of the organic crystals which later remained as solid inclusions in the solution droplets when the relative humidity was subsequently raised above the deliquescence point of NaCl. The embedded oxalic acid crystals reduced the critical ice saturation ratio required for the homogeneous freezing of pure NaCl/H 2 O solution droplets at a temperature of around 231 K from 1. 38 to about 1. 32. Aqueous solution droplets with OA inclusions larger than about 0. 27 μm in diameter efficiently nucleated ice by condensation freezing when they were activated to micron-sized cloud droplets at 241 K, i. e., they froze well above the homogeneous freezing temperature of pure water droplets of about 237 K. Our results on the immersion freezing potential of oxalic acid corroborate the findings from a recent study with emulsified aqueous solutions containing crystalline oxalic acid. In those experiments, the crystallisation of oxalic acid diyhdrate was triggered by a preceding homogeneous freezing cycle with the emulsion samples. The expansion cooling cycles with ternary H 2 SO 4 /OA/H 2 O solution droplets were aimed to analyse whether those findings can be transferred to ice nucleation experiments with airborne oxalic acid containing aerosol particles. Under our experimental conditions, the efficiency by which the surface of homogeneously nucleated ice crystals triggered the precipitation of oxalic acid dihydrate was very low, i. e., less than one out of a hundred ice crystals that were formed by homogeneous freezing in a first expansion cooling cycle left behind an ice-active organic crystal that acted as immersion <b>freezing</b> <b>nucleus</b> in a second expansion cooling cycle...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Number {{concentrations}} {{and mean}} sizes of ice crystals and derived microphysical and optical properties of subvisible cirrus clouds (SVCs) formed by homogeneous freezing of supercooled aerosols are investigated {{as a function}} of temperature and updraft speed of adiabatically ascending air parcels. The properties of such clouds are insensitive to variations of the aerosol number and size distribution. Based on criteria constraining the optical extinction, sedimentation time, and existence time of SVCs, longer-lived (> 10 min) clouds, capable of exerting a measurable radiative or chemical impact, are generated within a narrow range of updraft speeds below 1 − 2 cm s− 1 at temperatures below about 215 K, with concentrations of ice crystals not exceeding 0. 1 cm− 3. The clouds do not reach an equilibrium state because the ice crystals sediment out of the formation layer typically before the supersaturation is removed. Two important conclusions emerge from this work. First, the above characteristics of SVCs may provide an explanation for why SVCs are more common in the cold tropical than in the warmer midlatitude tropopause region. Second, it seems likely that a limited number (< 0. 1 cm− 3) of effective heterogeneous <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> that nucleate ice below the homogeneous freezing threshold can control the formation and properties of SVCs, although homogeneous <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> are far more abundant. ...|$|R

The three different dusts are Asia Dust- 1 (AD 1), Sahara Dust- 2 (SD 2) and Arizona test Dust (ATD). The dust samples used had particle concentrations of sizes that were log-normally distributed with mode diameters between 0. 3 and 0. 5 &mu;m and standard deviations, &sigma;g, of 1. 6 – 1. 9. The results from the freezing experiments {{are consistent with the}} singular hypothesis of ice nucleation. The dusts showed different nucleation abilities, with ATD showing a rather sharp increase in ice-active surface site density at temperatures less than &minus; 24 &deg;C. AD 1 was the next most efficient <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> and showed a more gradual increase in activity than the ATD sample. SD 2 was the least active <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei.</b> We used data taken with particle counting probes to derive the ice-active surface site density forming on the dust as a function of temperature {{for each of the three}} samples and polynomial curves are fitted to this data. The curve fits are then used independently within a bin microphysical model to simulate the ice formation rates from the experiments in order to test the validity of parameterising the data with smooth curves. Good agreement is found between the measurements and the model for AD 1 and SD 2; however, the curve for ATD does not yield results that agree well with the observations. The reason for this is that more experiments between &minus; 20 and &minus; 24 &deg;C are needed to quantify the rather sharp increase in ice-active surface site density on ATD in this temperature regime. The curves presented can be used as parameterisations in atmospheric cloud models where cooling rates of approximately 1 &deg;C min&minus; 1 or more are present to predict the concentration of ice crystals forming by the condensation-freezing mode of ice nucleation. Finally a polynomial is fitted to all three samples together in order to have a parameterisation describing the average ice-active surface site density vs. temperature for an equal mixture of the three dust samples...|$|R
40|$|Nitric acid (HNO 3) in cirrus ice {{crystals}} has been {{measured in the}} last decade during airborne field campaigns at latitudes 53 °S– 68 °N. The HNO 3 content in {{ice crystals}}, expressed in terms of HNO 3 /H 2 O molar ratio, and the fraction of HNO 3 in ice derived from those measurements exhibit a clear upward trend with decreasing temperature. The observations are explained by a novel model describing dissolution of HNO 3 in liquid aerosol particles serving as <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> and subsequent trapping of HNO 3 during ice crystal growth. The efficiency of trapping increases with decreasing temperature. Efficient trapping occurs via diffusional burial of the ambient HNO 3 below about 203 K, because of long residence times of HNO 3 molecules at the ice surface. This opens the possibility for HNO 3 -induced modifications of processes affecting ice crystal growth. At warmer temperatures, molecular processes in the ice surface layer cause an increasingly rapid escape of adsorbed HNO 3 into the gas phase and render trapping less efficient despite faster ice growth rates...|$|R

Two sub-deposition nucleation modes were identified (one- and two-stage freezing). The nonlinear signal at the water–mica interface was found to drop following the formation of a thin film on the surface regardless of (1) the formed phase (liquid or ice) and (2) the freezing path (one or two step), indicating similar molecular structuring.

However, the experimental quantification of contact freezing is challenging. Here we report an experimental method allowing to determine the temperature dependent ice nucleation probability of size selected aerosol particles. The method uses supercooled charged water droplets suspended in a laminar flow of air containing aerosol particles as contact <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The rate of droplet–particle collisions is calculated numerically with account for Coulomb attraction, drag force and induced dipole interaction between charged droplet and aerosol particles. The calculation is verified by direct counting of aerosol particles collected by a levitated droplet. By repeating the experiment on individual droplets for a sufficient number of times, we are able to reproduce the statistical freezing behavior of a large ensemble of supercooled droplets and measure the average rate of freezing events. The freezing rate is equal to the product of the droplet–particle collision rate and the probability of freezing on a single contact, the latter being a function of temperature, size and composition of the contact ice nuclei.

40|$|Cirrus clouds, {{composed}} of water ice, cover 30 % {{of the global}} surface and affect climate by scattering incoming solar radiation and scattering and absorbing outgoing terrestrial radiation. Despite their ubiquity, ice clouds are not accurately represented in global climate models and provide {{one of the largest}} uncertainties in predictions of climate change. This is, in part, because our understanding of ice particle formation processes in the atmosphere is low. Recent evidence has shown that pure ice clouds are dominated by heterogeneous ice nucleation, and, therefore, are dependent on presence of rare (5) ice <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei.</b> While it is known that mineral dust aerosol is an efficient ice nucleus, much less is known about organic-inorganic species, which composed a significant fraction of cirrus ice residuals. In this study we have probed the ice nucleation efficiencies of organic, organic-sulfate, and organic-sea-salt species using a Knudsen cell flow reactor and a Raman microscope coupled to an environmental cell. Specifically, we have probed the ice nucleation efficiency of thin films of crystalline monocarboxylic acids from 180 to 200 K, liquid-liquid phase separated particles containing ammonium sulfate and organic polyols from 210 to 235 K, simulated secondary organic aerosol derived from aqueous processes with and without ammonium sulfate from 215 to 230 K, and synthetic sea-salt particles with and without a proxy for dissolved organic carbon from 215 to 225 K. The hygroscopic phase transitions of the above particles were also explored up to 260 K. From these experiments we find that certain subsets of organic-inorganic particles may be very efficient heterogeneous ice nuclei in the upper troposphere. These subsets include crystalline organics with a high O:C ratio, sugar-like glassy organics particles or coatings/shells, and effloresced ammonium sulfate or sea-salt with liquid organic/inorganic coatings...|$|R
40|$|The {{suggestion}} that {{galactic cosmic rays}} (GCR) as modulated by the solar wind are the carriers of the component of solar variability that affects weather and climate has been discussed in the literature for 30 years, and {{there is now a}} considerable body of evidence that supports it. Variations of GCR occur with the 11 year solar cycle, matching the time scale of recent results for atmospheric variations, as modulated by the quasibiennial oscillation of equatorial stratospheric winds (the QBO). Variations in GCR occur on the time scale of centuries with a well defined peak in the coldest decade of the little ice age. New evidence is presented on the meteorological responses to GCR variations on the time scale of a few days. These responses include changes in the vertical temperature profile in the troposphere and lower stratosphere in the two days following solar flare related high speed plasma streams and associated GCR decreases, and in decreases in Vorticity Area Index (VAI) following Forbush decreases of GCR. The occurrence of correlations of GCR and meteorological responses on all three time scales strengthens the hypothesis of GCR as carriers of solar variability to the lower atmosphere. Both short and long term tropospheric responses are understandable as changes in the intensity of cyclonic storms initiated by mechanisms involving cloud microphysical and cloud electrification processes, due to changes in local ion production from changes in GCR fluxes and other high energy particles in the MeV to low GeV range. The nature of these mechanisms remains undetermined.

Gao et al. (2004) suggest that the formation of clusters of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) on ice at low temperatures might explain the observations of enhanced relative humidity over ice (RHI) in cirrus clouds (Delta-ice hypothesis). Here we evaluate in situ-observations of reactive nitrogen species, ice water content (IWC) and relative humidity in tropical, sub-tropical and polar cirrus clouds performed with the high altitude research aircraft Geophysica. Above 205 K, the fraction of total HNO 3 bound to cirrus ice crystals and the nitric acid (HNO 3) content of the ice crystals, expressed in HNO 3 /H 2 O molar ratios in ice, increase with decreasing temperature. The observations can be explained by uptake of HNO 3 in ternary aerosol serving as <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> and subsequent trapping of HNO 3 during ice crystal growth. A particularly cold cirrus cloud has been detected on 29 November 2005 for almost two hours by in situ-instruments onboard the Geophysica and by the Lidar on the DLR-Falcon during the SCOUT campaign from Darwin. The cirrus particles were measured at potential temperatures up to 390 K in the lowest stratosphere in connection to a large-scale convective system. At temperatures below 200 K, a high nitric acid content of the ice crystals coincides with enhanced values of RHI within the cirrus cloud. A recent compilation of NOy observations in cirrus clouds (Voigt et al., 2006) will be extended to low temperatures and with observations of RHI to test the Delta-ice hypothesis. Further the impact of experimental uncertainties and integration times on the data interpretation will be discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the LIMA (Liquid Ice Multiple Aerosols) quasi two-moment microphysical scheme, which {{relies on the}} prognostic evolution of an aerosol population, and the careful description of the nucleating properties that enable cloud droplets and pristine ice crystals to form from aerosols. Several modes of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> (IFN) are considered individually. A special class of partially soluble IFN is also introduced. These "aged" IFN act first as CCN and then as IFN by immersion nucleation at low temperatures. All the CCN modes are in competition with each other, as expressed by the single equation of maximum supersaturation. The IFN are insoluble aerosols that nucleate ice in several ways (condensation, deposition and immersion freezing) assuming the singular hypothesis. The scheme also includes the homogeneous freezing of cloud droplets, the Hallett–Mossop ice multiplication process and the freezing of haze at very low temperatures. LIMA assumes that water vapour is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the population of cloud droplets (adjustment to saturation in warm clouds). In ice clouds, the prediction of the number concentration of the pristine ice crystals is used to compute explicit deposition and sublimation rates (leading to free under/supersaturation over ice). The autoconversion, accretion and self-collection processes shape the raindrop spectra. The initiation of the large crystals and aggregates category {{is the result of}} the depositional growth of large crystals beyond a critical size. Aggregation and riming are computed explicitly. Heavily rimed crystals (graupel) can experience a dry or wet growth mode. An advanced version of the scheme includes a separate hail category of particles forming and growing exclusively in the wet growth mode. The sedimentation of all particle types is included. The LIMA scheme is inserted into the Meso-NH cloud-resolving mesoscale model. The flexibility of LIMA is illustrated by two 2 -D experiments. The first one highlights the sensitivity of orographic ice clouds to IFN types and IFN concentrations. Then a squall line case discusses the microstructure of a mixed-phase cloud and the impacts of pure CCN and IFN polluting plumes. The experiments show that LIMA responds well to the complex nature of aerosol–cloud interactions, leading to different pathways for cloud and precipitation formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{aeronautics}} {{industry has}} established that {{a threat to}} aircraft is posed by atmospheric conditions of substantial ice water content (IWC) where equivalent radar reflectivity (Z e) does not exceed 20 – 30 dBZ and supercooled water is not present; these conditions are encountered almost exclusively {{in the vicinity of}} deep convection. Part 1 (Fridlind et al., 2015) of this two-part study presents in situ measurements of such conditions sampled by Airbus in three tropical regions, commonly near 11 km and − 43 °C, and concludes that the measured ice particle size distributions are broadly consistent with past literature with profiling radar measurements of Z e and mean Doppler velocity obtained within monsoonal deep convection in one of the regions sampled. In all three regions, the Airbus measurements generally indicate variable IWC that often exceeds 2 g m - 3 with relatively uniform mass median area-equivalent diameter (MMD eq) of 200 – 300 μm. Here we use a parcel model with size-resolved microphysics to investigate microphysical pathways that could lead to such conditions. Our simulations indicate that homogeneous freezing of water drops produces a much smaller ice MMD eq than observed, and occurs only in the absence of hydrometeor gravitational collection for the conditions considered. Development of a mass mode of ice aloft that overlaps with the measurements requires a substantial source of small ice particles at temperatures of about − 10 °C or warmer, which subsequently grow from water vapor. One conceivable source in our simulation framework is Hallett–Mossop ice production; another is abundant concentrations of heterogeneous ice <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> acting together with copious shattering of water drops upon freezing. Regardless of the production mechanism, the dominant mass modal diameter of vapor-grown ice is reduced as the ice-multiplication source strength increases and as competition for water vapor increases. Both mass and modal diameter are reduced by entrainment and by increasing aerosol concentrations. Weaker updrafts lead to greater mass and larger modal diameters of vapor-grown ice, the opposite of expectations regarding lofting of larger ice particles in stronger updrafts. While stronger updrafts do loft more dense ice particles produced primarily by raindrop freezing, we find that weaker updrafts allow the warm rain process to reduce competition for diffusional growth of the less dense ice expected to persist in convective outflow...|$|R
40|$|The Midlatitude Continental Convective Cloud Experiment (MC 3 E) {{will take}} place in central Oklahoma during the April-May 2011 period. The {{experiment}} is a collaborative effort between the U. S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radition Measurement Program and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Ground Validation program. The Intensive Observation Period leverages the unprecedented observing infrastructure currently available in the central United States, combined with an extensive sounding array, remote sensing and in situ aircraft observations, NASA GPM ground validation remote sensors and new ARM instrumentation purchased with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding. The overarching goal is to provide the most complete characterization of convective cloud systems, precipitation and the environment that has ever been obtained, providing constraints for model cumulus parameterizations and space-based rainfall observations over land that have never before been available. Several different components of convective processes tangible to the convective parameterization problem are targeted such as, pre-convective environment and convective initiation, updraft / downdraft dynamics, condensate transport and detrainment, precipitation and cloud microphysics, influence on the environment and radiation and {{a detailed description of the}} large-scale forcing. MC 3 E will use a new multi-scale observing strategy with the participation of a network of distributed sensors (both passive and active). The approach is to document in 3 -D not only the full spectrum of precipitation rates, but also clouds, winds and moisture in an attempt to provide a holistic view of convective clouds and their feedback with the environment. A goal is to measure cloud and precipitation transitions and environmental quantities that are important for satellite retrieval algorithms, convective parameterization in large-scale models and cloud-resolving model simulations. This will be accomplished through the deployment of several different elements that complement the existing (and soon to become available) ARM facilities: a network of radiosonde stations, NASA scanning multi-frequency/parameter radar systems at three different frequencies (Ka/Ku/S), high-altitude remote sensing and in situ aircraft, wind profilers and a network of surface disdrometers. In addition to these special MC 3 E instruments, there will be important new instrumentation deployed by DOE at the ARM site including: 3 networked scanning X-band radar systems, a C-band scanning radar, a dual wavelength (Ka/W) scanning cloud radar, a Doppler lidar and upgraded vertically pointing millimeter cloud radar (MMCR) and micropulse lidar (MPL). To fully describe the properties of precipitating cloud systems, both in situ and remote sensing airborne observations are necessary. The NASA GPM-funded University of North Dakota (UND) Citation will provide in situ observations of precipitation-sized particles, ice <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> and aerosol concentrations. As a complement to the UND Citation's in situ observations, the NASA ER- 2 will provide a high altitude satellite simulator platform that carrying a Ka/Ku band radar and passive microwave radiometers (10 - 183 GHZ) ...|$|R
40|$|Most ice {{in nature}} forms because of {{impurities}} which boost the exceedingly low nucleation rate of pure supercooled water. However, the microscopic details of ice nucleation on these substances remain largely unknown. Here, we have unraveled the molecular mechanism and the kinetics of ice formation on kaolinite, a clay mineral playing {{a key role}} in climate science. We find that the formation of ice at strong supercooling in the presence of this clay is about 20 orders of magnitude faster than homogeneous <b>freezing.</b> The critical <b>nucleus</b> is substantially smaller than that found for homogeneous nucleation and, in contrast to the predictions of classical nucleation theory (CNT), it has a strong two-dimensional character. Nonetheless, we show that CNT describes correctly the formation of ice at this complex interface. Kaolinite also promotes the exclusive nucleation of hexagonal ice, as opposed to homogeneous freezing where a mixture of cubic and hexagonal polytypes is observed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} view of <b>freezing</b> {{holds that}} <b>nuclei</b> {{of the crystal}} phase form in the metastable fluid through purely stochastic thermal density fluctuations. The possibility {{of a change in}} the character of the fluctuations as the freezing point is traversed {{is beyond the scope of}} this perspective. Here we show that this perspective may be incomplete by examination of the time autocorrelation function of the longitudinal current, computed by molecular dynamics for the hard-sphere fluid around its freezing point. In the spatial window where sound is overdamped, we identify a change in the long-time decay of the correlation function at the known freezing points of monodisperse and moderately polydisperse systems. The fact that these findings agree with previous experimental studies of colloidal systems in which particle are subject to diffusive dynamics, suggests that the dynamical signature we identify with the freezing transition is a consequence of packing effects alone...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reviews the}} main {{results on the}} {{long-term}} behavior of SON 68 nuclear glass towards alpha decay accumulation. The effects of the radiation damage induced by alpha decay were investigated by doping a glass with a short-lived actinide 244 Cm, by using ionic irradiations and by molecular dynamic simulations. The analysis {{of the behavior of}} the glass structure subjected to ballistic effects with various spectroscopic studies has identified some local order changes around born and silicon atoms. Moreover a modification of the medium-range order has also been demonstrated through changes in the bond angles between network formers and broadening of the ring size distributions, indicating increasing disorder of the glass structure. This structural evolution induced by alpha decays would be driven by the reconstruction of the glass disorganized by displacement cascades of the recoil <b>nuclei,</b> <b>freezing</b> a glass structure with a higher fictive temperature.

40|$|Aerosol from {{aircraft}} {{can affect}} the environment in three ways: First, soot aerosol has been implicated to cause Icing-tern ozone depletion at mid-latitudes in the lower stratosphere {{at a rate of}} approx. 5 % per decade. This effect is in addition and unrelated to the polar ozone holes which are strongly influenced by heterogeneous chemistry on polar stratospheric clouds. Second, the most obvious effect of jet aircraft is the formation of visible contrails in the upper troposphere. The Salt Lake City region experienced an 8 % increase in cirrus cloud cover over a 15 -year period which covariates with an increase in regional commercial air traffic. If soot particles act as <b>freezing</b> <b>nuclei</b> to cause contrail formation heterogeneously, they would be linked to a secondary effect to cloud modification that very likely is climatologically important. Third, a buildup of soot aerosol could reduce the single scatter albedo of stratospheric aerosol from 0. 993 + 0. 004 to 0. 98, a critical value that has been postulated to separate stratospheric cooling from warming. Thus arises an important question: Do aircraft emit sufficient amounts of soot to have detrimental effects and warrant emission controls? During the 1996 SUCCESS field campaign, we sampled aerosols in the exhaust wake of a Boeing 757 aircraft and determined emission indices for sulfuric acid (EI(sub H 2 SO 4) = 9. 0 E- 2 and 5. 0 E- 1 g/kg (sub FUEL) for 75 and 675 ppm fuel-sulfur, respectively) and soot aerosol (2. 2 E- 3 less than EI(sub SOOT) = l. lE- 2 g/kg (sub FUEL)). The soot particle analysis accounted for their fractal nature, determined electron-microscopically, which enhanced the surface area by a factor of 26 and the volume 11 -fold over equivalent-volume spheres. The corresponding fuel-sulfur to H 2 SO 4 conversion efficiency was 10 % (for 675 ppmm fuel-S) and 37 % (for 75 ppmm fuel-S). Applying the H 2 SO 4 emission index to the 1990 fuel use by the worlds commercial fleets of 1. 3 E 11 kg, a conversion efficiency of 30 % of 500 ppmm fuel-S would have led to an annual contribution to the atmospheric sulfur budget by aircraft of 2. E 7 kg H 2 SO 4. This is about one part in 1. E 4 of anthropogenic sulfate from other sources. The soot emission index given above yielded a 1990 injection of soot aerosol by aircraft of 1. E 6 kg. Thus, soot amounts to only five percent of the aerosol generated by aircraft. Its reactivity with ozone would have to be 20 times that of sulfuric acid particles to make it chemically significant. Nevertheless, the findings, of stratospheric soot loadings commensurate with aircraft fuel consumption, based on the emission index given above and the assumption of stratospheric residence times of the order of one year implicate aircraft as stratospheric polluters. A trend similar to soot of H 2 SO 4 aerosol loading could not be deciphered, neither from in situ measurements nor SAGE II satellite extinction, against the "noise" due to volcanic eruptions. Observation of soot particles at 20 km altitude which, if emitted by aircraft were generated at 10 - 12 km altitude, suggests a displacement of those particles against gravity. Because eddy mixing is virtually absent in the lower stratosphere and isentropic mixing explains lofting to only about 15 km, radiometric forces acting on morphologically and chemically asymmetric soot particles must be considered a possibility. The consequence could be an extended residence time of soot against that of sulfuric acid aerosol that would lower the single scatter albedo with time...|$|R
40|$|Biomass burning {{represents}} a major global source of aerosols impacting direct radiative forcing and cloud properties. Thus, {{the goal of}} a number of current studies involves developing {{a better understanding of how}} the chemical composition and mixing state of biomass burning aerosols evolve during atmospheric aging processes. During the Ice in Cloud Experiment – Layer Clouds (ICE-L) in fall of 2007, smoke plumes from two small Wyoming Bureau of Land Management prescribed burns were measured by on-line aerosol instrumentation aboard a C- 130 aircraft, providing a detailed chemical characterization of the particles. After ~ 2 – 4 min of aging, submicron smoke particles, produced primarily from sagebrush combustion, consisted predominantly of organics by mass, but were comprised primarily of internal mixtures of organic carbon, elemental carbon, potassium chloride, and potassium sulfate. Significantly, 100 % of the fresh biomass burning particles contained minor mass fractions of nitrate and sulfate, suggesting that hygroscopic material is incorporated very near or at the point of emission. The mass fractions of ammonium, sulfate, and nitrate increased with aging up to ~ 81 – 88 min and resulted in acidic particles, with both nitric acid and sulfuric acid present. Decreasing black carbon mass concentrations occurred due to dilution of the plume. Increases in the fraction of oxygenated organic carbon and the presence of dicarboxylic acids, in particular, were observed with aging. Cloud condensation nuclei measurements suggested all particles > 100 nm were active at 0. 5 % water supersaturation in the smoke plumes, confirming the relatively high hygroscopicity of the freshly emitted particles. For immersion/condensation <b>freezing,</b> ice <b>nuclei</b> measurements at − 32 °C suggested activation of ~ 0. 03 – 0. 07 % of the particles with diameters greater than 500 nm...|$|R
40|$|In {{support to}} the {{development}} of the Northern Aerosol Regional Climate Model, a single column model with explicit aerosol and cloud microphysics is described. It is designed specifically to investigate cloud–aerosol interactions in the Arctic. A total of 38 size bins discretize the aerosol and cloud spectra from 0. 01 - to 500 -μm diameter. The model is based on three equations describing the time evolution of the aerosol, cloud droplet, and ice crystal spectra. The following physical processes are simulated: coagulation, sedimentation, nucleation, coalescence, aggregation, condensation, and deposition. Further, the model accounts for the water–ice phase interaction through the homogeneous and heterogeneous <b>freezing,</b> ice <b>nuclei,</b> and the Bergeron effect. The model has been validated against observations and other models. In this paper, the model is used to simulate diamond dust and ice fog in the Arctic during winter. It is shown that simulated cloud features such as cloud phase, cloud particle diameter, number concentration, and mass concentration are in agreement with observations. The observed vertical structure of mixed-phase cloud is also reproduced with the maximum mass of liquid phase in the upper part of the cloud. Based on simulations, a hypothesis is formulated to explain the thermodynamical unstable mixed-phase state that can last several days in diamond dust events. The ice supersaturation time evolution is assessed and is compared to its evolution in cirrus clouds. It is shown that the supersaturation relaxation time, defined as the time required for supersaturation to decrease by a factor e, is more than 10 times the value found in cirrus clouds. Finally, the radiative contribution of arctic diamond dust and ice fog to the downward longwave radiation flux at the surface is evaluated and compared to observations...|$|R
