These instantons produce insertions of BPS baryonic or mesonic operators of the four-dimensional N= 1 quiver gauge theory. We {{argue that these}} systems underlie, via the near-horizon limit, the familiar AdS/CFT map between BPS operators and D 3 -branes wrapped on supersymmetric 3 -cycles on the 5 <b>d</b> <b>horizon.</b> The relation implies that there must exist E 3 -brane instantons with appropriate fermion mode spectrum and couplings, such that their non-perturbative effects on the D 3 -branes induce operators forming a generating set for all BPS operators of the quiver CFT. We provide a constructive argument for this correspondence, thus supporting the picture. Comment: 43 pages, 13 figures. v 4 : Published versio...|$|E

In the Intermittent Predictive Control, the Laguerre functions are used to describe the control trajectories between two sample points to save the com- putational time and make the implementation feasible in the situation of the fast sampling of a dynamic system. In the nonlinear predictive control, the Laguerre polynomials are used to describe the trajectories of the nonlinear control signals so that the reced- <b>ing</b> <b>horizon</b> control principle are applied in the design with respect to the nonlinear system constraints.

40|$|Litho-, bio-, and chemostratigraphy of the Cretaceous forearc basin sediments {{exposed in}} Hokkaido, {{northern}} Japan allow {{a synthesis of}} the faunal, sedimentological, and environmental history of the north-west Pacific margin. Although the succession, named the Yezo Group, has yielded an abundant record of mid- to late Cretaceous invertebrates, monotonous lithologies of sandstone and mudstone, showing occasional lateral facies changes, have caused confusion regarding the lithostratigraphic nomenclature. Based on our wide areal mapping of the sequence, and analysis of litho- and biofacies, a new lithostratigraphic scheme for the Yezo Group is proposed. In ascending order, the scheme is as follows: the Soashibetsugawa Formation (Lower Aptian mudstone unit); the Shuparogawa Formation (Lower Aptian–lower Upper Albian sandstone-dominant turbidite unit); the Maruyama Formation (lower Upper Albian tuffaceous sandstone unit); the Hikagenosawa Formation (Upper Albian–Middle Cenomanian mudstone-dominant unit); the Saku Formation (Middle Cenomanian–Upper Turonian sandstone-common turbidite unit); the Kashima Formation (Upper Turonian–Lower Campanian mudstone-dominant unit); and the Hakobuchi Formation (Lower Campanian–Paleocene shallow-marine sandstone-conglomerate unit). In addition, we designate two further lithostratigraphic units, the Mikasa Formation (Upper Albian–Turonian shallow-marine sandstone-dominated unit) and the Haborogawa Formation (Middle Turonian–Campanian shelf mudstone/sandstone unit), which correspond in age to the shallower facies of the Saku and Kashima formations, respectively. Despite a lack of so-called “black shales”, because of siliciclastic dilution, our stratigraphic integration has revealed the horizons of oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) in the Yezo Group. The OAE 1 a horizon in the Soashibetsugawa Formation {{is characterized by a}} lack of foraminifers, macrofossils and bioturbation, and a prominent positive excursion of δ 13 Corg. A significant hiatus during the late Aptian and early Albian removed the OAE 1 b horizon. The OAE 1 c horizon in the Maruyama Formation shows a distinct negative excursion of δ 13 Corg with a concomitant high productivity of radiolarians. The OAE 1 <b>d</b> <b>horizon</b> in the middle part of the Hikagenosawa Formation consists of weakly laminated, pyrite-rich mudstone. Planktonic and calcareous benthic foraminifers are absent, whereas radiolarians are abundant above the OAE 1 <b>d</b> <b>horizon.</b> The mid-Cenomanian event (MCE) horizon is identified {{at the top of the}} Hikagenosawa Formation.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} demand among home owners for cost effective sustainable energy production such as solar energy to provide heating and electricity. A lot of research has focused on the assessment of the incoming solar radiation on roof planes acquired by, e. g., Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS). However, solar panels can also be mounted on building facades in order to increase renewable energy supply. Due to limited reflections of points from vertical walls, ALS data is not suitable to perform solar potential assessment of vertical building facades. This paper focuses on a new method for automatic solar radiation modeling of facades acquired by Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) and uses the full 3 D information of the point cloud for both the extraction of vertical walls covered by the survey and solar potential analysis. Furthermore, a new method isintroduced determining the interior and exterior face, respectively, of each detected wall in order to calculate its slope and aspect angles that are of crucial importance for solar potential assessment.

40|$|This article aims {{to propose}} an {{approach}} for estimating the three-dimensional (3 D) variability of denitrification. The concept of functional horizons {{is applied to}} the process of biological denitrification and 3 D soil horizon cartography is used to estimate its spatial variation. On one hand, detailed fieldwork (186 pedological auger holes) was undertaken to map 3 <b>D</b> <b>horizon</b> distribution within a 3 -ha riparian area using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). On the other hand, three classes of denitrifying capacities were defined according to the distribution of the denitrifying enzyme activity of 51 samples. The relationship between the process of denitrification and the cartography is assessed through soil characteristics, which both differentiate soil horizons and control the process of denitrification: organic carbon and textural fractions. This allows a class of denitrifying capacity to be attributed to each soil horizon. This information was inserted into the 3 D soil horizon cartography and the denitrifying functional horizons could be delimited. With this approach, field criteria are used and variations of the 3 D distribution of denitrification are considered in order to estimate the spatial variation of denitrification within the riparian area being studied...|$|E

The dual theory has the symmetries of the 2 d Galilean Conformal Algebra, a contraction of two copies of the Virasoro algebra, which is isomorphic to BMS 3. We study flat holography as a limit of AdS 3 /CFT 2 to semi-classically compute the density of states in the dual, exactly reproducing the bulk entropy in the limit of large charges. Our flat horizons, remnants of the BTZ inner horizons also satisfy a first law of thermodynamics.

In 2007, squares L'XXIV, M'XXIV, M'XXIH and M'XXII, which were investigated in 2005 to the horizon c, dated {{to the end of the}} 5 th and the beginning of the 6 th centuries, were completely excavated to the level of the porch of the earlier fortification of Romuliana (Plan 1). The stratigraphy of the cultural layers in these squares is as follows (Fig. 1) : Below horizon c there is a layer of construction rubble mixed with brownish-yellow, clay like, sandy soil, 50 - 75 cm thick, comprising the finds dated in the last quarter of the 4 th- 5 th centuries, layer D; The level of layer D is <b>horizon</b> <b>d,</b> where a structure destroyed in a conflagration, house 1 / 07, was discovered in squares M'XXII and M'XXIII. It could be dated, on the basis of the preserved household (pottery, metal and antler items, coins, etc.), from the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th century; <b>Horizon</b> <b>d</b> 1 is a mortar floor discovered beneath <b>horizon</b> <b>d,</b> which presents the earlier phase of house 1 / 07; <b>Horizon</b> <b>d</b> 2 is the earliest mortar floor inside the house 1 / 07, covered with a later mortar floor (<b>horizon</b> <b>d</b> 1) and a levelling layer of yellow sand and gravel, which comprises the finds dating also to the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th centuries; Layer E, 15 - 40 cm thick, is below <b>horizon</b> <b>d,</b> comprising dark brown soil with rubble and lenses of soot at the bottom, together with finds dated to the second half of the 4 th century; Horizon e is covered with layer E, and spread across all the squares which were investigated to the south and to the east of Galerius' bath, where 8 large postholes, which outlined a space 7 x 3 m large and probably some kind of porch, were found along with two furnaces and two pits; Layer F, about 30 cm thick, is the substructure of horizon e and it comprises crushed stone and pebbles mixed with lime mortar, and in places has a levelling of reddish-brown sand. Finds here were dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries; Horizon f is a mortar floor of the later fortification of Felix Romuliana at a level of 184. 75 m in the west and 184. 55 m in the east (an average level of 184. 64 m), which was interrupted by a trench running in an east-west direction along the southern section of squares L'-M'XXIV. The trench was filled with soot, small rubble and reddish-brown sand and comprised a large amount of artifacts, such as pottery and glass fragments, metal and bone items and coins dated to the second half of the 3 rd century (Fig. 4). Layer G consists of dark brown and yellowish-brown clay with small rubble and soot. It was a levelling layer above the intense construction rubble from the previous horizon and a substructure of horizon f. This layer comprised archaeological finds dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries and to the prehistoric period (Early Iron Age); Horizon g is a mortar floor of the porch of the southern and eastern rampart of the earlier fortification of Romuliana. 4 pillars of the eastern porch (pillars 1 - 4, discovered in 2004 - 2005), a corner pillar in an L-shape (pillar 5) and one pillar of the southern porch (pillar 6) have been ascertained. From this level the water and sewage canals were dug (Fig. 5). In squares K'XXII-XXIII a trench, measuring 4 x 2 m, in an east-west direction, was opened which aimed to investigate the layers beneath the Roman horizon g. The stratigraphy in this trench is as follows: - Layer G at a level of about 184. 53 m; - Layer H, about 35 cm thick, is greenish-yellow clay in which Roman canals were buried, comprising the fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery and fragments of reddish rammed earth (Fig. 2); Layer I, about 20 cm thick, is greenish-brown clay, comprising the scarce fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery; Virgin soil consists of yellow clay starting from a level of 184. 00 m in the west and of 183. 60 m in the east. In 2008, the remains of an earlier building were discovered beneath the floor of the apodyterium of Galerius' bath found in 2002 and below the foundation of the sudatorium and the tepidarium of the same structure, which were found in 2005. Also, for the purposes of conservation and restoration of the thermae, an apsidal room next to the west wall of the apodyterium, so called 'Galerius' dressing room', was completely filled with construction rubble, among which was found a part of an abraded vault (Fig. 6). Excavations proved that the apsidal room had been a pool with cold water, a frigidarium, which was twice renovated and was decorated with mosaic made of black, white and grey stone cubes (Fig. 7). The phases of reconstruction of the frigidarium could also be noticed in its eastern wall (Fig. 8). Also in the rubble inside the pool, glass mosaic cubes of deep blue and golden colours were discovered, indicating the decoration of the vault. In the latest phase, two pillars were constructed to carry the stairs made of stone slabs (Fig. 8). The earliest phase of this room, which had a rectangular layout and a mortar floor, could be part of the building dating back to before Galerius' bath (Plan 2). During the cleaning of the eastern wall of the frigidarium, a semicircular niche with a fresco decoration of geometrical and figural motives, painted in black, dark red, orange and blue on an ochre surface, was discovered (Fig. 3). Under Galerius' bath, a large earlier building was investigated (trenches 1 - 5 / 08). Only its foundation zone is preserved. The walls of the Imperial bath were founded on the earlier walls, which were 0. 65 m thick and had foundations which were 0. 90 m thick (Plan 2). The pilaster of the west faeade of the thermae was also founded on the earlier wall, but it destroyed a water canal (canal A discovered inside the south room of Galerius' bath in 2004), which was constructed after the earlier structure and before the Imperial bath (Fig. 9). It is interesting that the part of the earlier building to the west of the thermae was not demolished during the construction of the Imperial residence. It was adapted and incorporated into the plan of the fortified palace. The original construction was a large public building, probably theprincipia, with a row of rooms around a large courtyard, the atrium. The entrance, which had a porch and a pylon with two square towers and thresholds made of stone slabs, was in the north. (Figs. 10 - 14) Previously, this building was mistakenly dated to the 4 th- 5 th centuries, because it had been reused in Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. (Figs. 15 - 18) However, based on the results of the new research, it could be dated to the 3 rd century. ...|$|R
40|$|The deeply {{weathered}} profile interests many geologists {{and soil}} scientists (Loughnan, 1969; Valeton, 1971). This paper interprets and also correlates {{some of the}} equivalent terminology in use. In the in situ theory of laterization a minimum of 25 in of rain per annum (Harder, 1949) is required to leach all the soluble elements (K +, Na +, Ca ++, Mg ++ and Fe ++) {{and most of the}} partially soluble elements (S? +) from the profile, and to concentrate the insoluble elements (AP +, Fe 3 + and Ti ~+) under the optimum conditions of high temperature, long duration, flat topography and a chemically unstable parent rock. More rainfall will induce laterization even if some variables are unfavourable. The profile is classified into four horizons A, B, C and D, or into four major zones: soil, concretionary, leached and parent material, as illustrated in Fig. 1, where the soil profile (Winters & Simonson, 1951) is compared with the bauxite profile (Owen, 1954).

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{study was}} {{conducted}} over approximately 191, 000 acres in central Klamath County, Oregon. The research had three objectives: first, to describe and classify the seral and near-climax vegetation by using polyclimax principles; secondly, to determine the southern extension of five plant associations and one plant associes as previously described by C. T. Dyrness within the Weyerhaeuser Antelope Unit; and thirdly, to determine the inherent variability {{of these and other}} plant communities on young pumice soils over various elevation and relief patterns. The sampling was limited to those soils derived from aerially deposited pumice of Mt. Mazama origin. These included the widely distributed Lapine soil series and the less prevalent Longbell and Shanahan soil series. Their profiles are characterized by an A 00, Al, AC, C, and <b>D</b> <b>horizon</b> sequence. A qualitative reconnaissance method permitted the gathering of vegetation, soil and physiographic data from a large number of variable-sized sample locations. These locations were statified to obtain a homogeneous vegetation-soil sampling unit. The association table was used to synthesize the analytical stand data into units of similar ecology. The mechanics of association table construction are described. The Pinus ponderosa/Purshia tridentata, the Pinus ponderosa/Purshia tridentata/Festuca idahoensis, the Pinus ponderosa/Purshia tridentata-Arctostaphylos parryana var. pinetorum, the Pinus ponderosa/Ceanothus velutinus-Purshia tridentata, the Pinus ponderosa/Arctostaphylos parryana var. pinetorum-Ceanothus velutinus and the Abies concolor/Ceanothus velutinus association plus the Pinus ponderosa/Ceanothus velutinus associes are defined and characterized as they occur in the study area. Factor compensation plays a significant role in determining the location of these classification units since any single plant community may occur over several different soil and physiographic situations. The appearance of these associations over the landscape is presently determined by the young soils and the local physiographic features. Therefore, their representative stands are designated as edaphic or topo-edaphic climaxes depending upon the location of these stands in relation to the typical elevational range of the association. The Pinus ponderosa/Ceanothus velutinus associes is considered to be an early successional stage of the Abies concolor/Ceanothus velutinus association as evidenced by the rapid encroachment in the Pinus ponderosa/Ceanothus velutinus understory of mesic-tending tree and herbaceous species. In addition, the characteristic species which are common to both communities express similar presence and dominance values, and their physical environments are similar. Heavy seed pressure from mesic species on locally favorable, micro-environments permit fragmentary expressions of the Abies concolor/Ceanothus velutinus association to appear in the adjacent ecosystems representative of more xeric-tending effective environments. The variability in the species' presence and relative dominance as they occur among and within ecological units can be partially explained by the species' autecological requirements in relation to the physical environments typical of each ecological unit. The influence of an effective environment upon some species is reflected in the growth form, vigor and phenology of these species and their competitive relationships to other species in the stand. The utilization of this ecological knowledge is related to the timber, range and wildlife resources of the Upper Williamson River Basin. As emphasized, however, effective resource management is achieved only by an understanding of the plant and animal environment, a realization of the biological principles related to these environments, and the economical regulation of resource use within the framework of these biological limitations...|$|E

Quasar characteristics imply their central engines possess an intrinsic magnetic field compatible with the pres- ence of an electrically charged toroidal dark hole, an eternally collapsing structure lack- <b>ing</b> an event <b>horizon.</b> The possibility {{is consistent with the}} inability of black holes to capture particles in a universe of finite age, Einstein’s dismissal of the Schwarzschild metric as unphysical and the implausibility of the various paradoxes invoked by black hole existence. The uncloaked innards of these dark holes would expose immense vac- uum accelerations at their cores, inevitably tempered by Planck scale physics. The Unruh effect predicts that intense yet highly localised heating should occur there. As thermal energy gradually amasses and dissipates, radiation would eventually start to escape into the surrounding environment. Virtual from the d ark hole perspective, the emissions could not decrease the dark hole’s mass: the energy source must instead be the universal vacuum, the likely repository of dark energy. In analogy with core- collapse supernovae, neutrinos should dominate the cooling flows. Red-shifting to low energies upon escape, quantum degenerate haloes should for m predominantly around the largest galaxies. This mechanism is promising from the perspective of enabling the future universe to efficiently sustain aquatic life before stars become scarce, offering a biological yet decidedly non-anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem...|$|R

The optimized MLP presents predictions similar to or even better than conventional and reference methods such as ARIMA techniques, Bayesian inference, Markov chains and k-Nearest-Neighbors. Moreover we found that the data pre-processing approach proposed can reduce significantly forecasting errors of about 6 % compared to conventional prediction methods such as Markov chains or Bayesian inference.

Ocean acidification maybe responsible for sporadic low abundances of planktic foraminifera compared to radiolarians and benthic foraminifera associated with increased volcanogenic CO 2 production during {{the formation of the}} Southern and Central Kerguelen Plateaus. Sea surface temperature may have cooled to 11 °C in the late Aptian but increased gradually during the Albian. The Aptian/Albian boundary is placed at a negative carbon isotope excursion associated with the lowest occurrence of Microhedbergella renilaevis, typically found within the Niveau Kilian black shale of OAE 1 b. Third-order sea level cycles, particularly in the middle Albian, produced cyclic changes in the abundance of inoceramid prisms that increased during inferred times of falling sea level. The late Albian OAE 1 c and OAE 1 <b>d</b> coincide with <b>horizons</b> of intense pyritization and the absence of all biocomponents suggesting the development of euxinia. Warm Tethyan waters reached the Exmouth Plateau during the latest Albian based on the presence of thermocline dwelling keeled planktic foraminifera including Planomalina buxtorfi...|$|R
40|$|The Caerwys tufa in North Wales (UK) {{contains}} basal deposits {{thought to}} represent carbonate precipitation during the Late-glacial interstadial. These deposits {{are used to}} test whether stable isotope data record {{all or part of}} a warming-cooling-warming trend through the transition of the Late-glacial interstadial, Younger Dryas stadial and early Holocene. The d 18 O values and molluscan abundance data suggest that deposition of the Late-glacial tufa occurred mainly during a relatively warm period (? GL- 1 c or 1 e) followed by cooling, the latter likely to be the transition into the Younger Dryas stadial. Tufa deposition is not recorded in the coldest part of the stadial: it is replaced by a sandy <b>horizon.</b> <b>d</b> 13 C values around - 8. 5 ‰ in the basal Late-glacial interstadial tufas show there was a significant influence from isotopically light soil-zone CO 2, consistent with development of birch scrub and woodland further south in North Wales. During climatic cooling into the Younger Dryas stadial a 1 ‰ decrease in tufa d 13 C is interpreted to represent decreasing phytoplankton photosynthetic activity in pools causing less isotopic enrichment of the tufa d 13 C. In the (pre- 9000 cal. years BP) early Holocene tufas at Caerwys, palaeo-water temperatures calculated from d 18 O in tufa calcite and from shell carbonate of Lymnaea peregra agree well and suggest summer water temperatures in the range 13 to 16. 5 °C. d 13 C data from these early Holocene pool-micrite tufas demonstrate that phytoplanktonic photosynthetic activity within the water column resumed under the warmer conditions causing isotopic enrichment of the tufa d 13 C values...|$|R
40|$|Makridakis and Hibon (2000) {{summarize}} {{four main}} {{implications of the}} latest forecasting competition, which we paraphrase as: (a) 'simple methods do best'; (b) 'the accuracy measure matters'; (c) 'pooling helps'; and (<b>d)</b> 'the evaluation <b>horizon</b> matters'. We applaud the detailed empirical investigations, are unsurprised by their summary; but are surprised by the assertion that 'the strong empirical evidence, however, has been ignored by theoretical statisticians'. Having successfully published two books {{and more than a}} dozen papers across a wide range of journals, which inter alia analyze their four points, we refute the claim that the issue is being 'ignored', and doubt the implicit suggestion of hostility by the profession. What must be the relationship between the world to be forecast and the models with which we forecast for conditions (a) -(d) not to hold? The research summarized in Clements and Hendry (1998 b, 1999) (henceforth CH 98 and CH 99) shows that in weakly stationary processes, a congruent, encompassing model in-sample will dominate in forecasting at all horizons. (2) When the data generating process (DGP) is complicated, as is likely in economics, then so will be the dominant model, subject to possible losses from parameter estimation (CH 98, ch. 12). Causal variables will dominate non-causal (CH 99, ch. 1), forecast accuracy will deteriorate as the horizon increases, and there will be no forecast-accuracy gains from pooling forecasts across methods or models: indeed, pooling refutes encompassing. These are perhaps the 'optimality' claims that Makridakis and Hibon (2000) correctly doubt are empirically relevant. The results of the forecasting competitions are manifestly at odds with such strong 'theoretical predictions'. This discrepancy between theory and practice (noted by, e. g., Fildes & Makridakis, 1995), and the systematic mis-forecasting and forecast failure that has periodically blighted macroeconomics, stimulated the research summarized in CH 98 and CH 99. The 'textbook' paradigm discussed in the previous paragraph offers no explanation for observed forecast failures, although they have sometimes been attributed to 'mis-specified models', 'poor methods', 'inaccurate data', 'incorrect estimation', 'data-based model selection' and so on, without those claims being proved: our research demonstrates the lack of foundation for such 'explanations'. The reason that (a) -(d) hold in practice is that economies are non-stationary and evolving processes which are not reducible to stationarity by differencing, thereby generating moments that are non-constant over time. Modern economies are regularly subject to major institutional, political, financial, legal, fashion, and technological changes which manifest themselves as structural breaks in models relative to the underlying DGP. Models are far from being facsimiles of the DGP, and even if they closely resembled it in-sample, unanticipated structural change could seriously reduce their usefulness for forecasting. Our research suggests that models which are relatively robust to, or adapt rapidly to, structural change are most likely to be successful in forecasting. Specifically, shifts in deterministic terms appear to be especially injurious to forecasting, and to be a primary factor underlying systematic forecast failure, as they cause a shift in the model's forecast mean relative to the data mean. Other breaks are surprisingly difficult to detect and have relatively benign effects on forecasts (see Hendry & Doornik, 1997; Hendry, 2000). The remaining potential sources of forecast failure, ranging from model mis-specification, a lack of parsimony - including failure to impose restrictions such as unit roots and cointegration inaccurate forecast-origin data, through to inefficient estimation, may all exacerbate forecast failure, but generally just play supporting roles...|$|R
40|$|EGU General Assembly 2015, held 12 - 17 April, 2015 in Vienna, Austria. id. 1200 The {{replacement}} of native beech forests (Fagus sylvatica) by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) afforestation may exert changes in soil properties, particularly in {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) (Carceller and Vallejo, 1996). Stable isotopic signatures of light elements (d 13 C, d 15 N) in soils and plants are valuable proxies for the identification of biogeochemical processes and their rates in the pedosphere (Andreeva et al., 2013 and refs therein). In this work the C and N stable isotopic analysis {{is used as a}} proxy to detect changes in SOM surrogated to the effect of centennial {{replacement of}} beech by the Scots pinewood. Two acid soil profiles, developed on quartzites under a humid climate at an altitude of 1400 - 1500 masl, have been sampled in Moncayo (Iberian range, NE-Spain). For each soil profile three O-layers (litter: OL, fragmented litter OF and humified litter OH) and mineral soil horizons (Ah, E, Bhs and C) were sampled. Content and bulk isotopic signature of light elements (C and N) were analysed in a Flash 2000 elemental micro-analyser coupled via a ConFlo IV interface to a Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Isotopic ratios are reported as parts per thousand deviations from appropriate standards. The standard deviations of d 13 C and d 15 N were typically less than 0. 05 per thousand, 0. 2 per thousand, respectively. After 100 years since the pine afforestation, no differences on C content were observed in the O-layers, ranging from 30 - 47 % in pine soils and 37 - 47 % in beech soils. Similarly, no differences on N content were observed in the O-layers, ranging from 1. 24 - 1. 86 % in pine soils and 1. 70 - 1. 71 % in beech soils. C and N contents decrease progressively in depth with the exception of E-horizons where the lowest C and N content values were found. C/N ratio is higher in pine soil (20. 7 - 38. 1) than in beech O soil horizons (21. 8 - 27. 5), showing similar behavior with soil depth. Pine biomass was slightly enriched in 13 C as compared to that from beech (OL enrichment factor= 1. 24 0. 13 per thousand). Along the soil profile the C isotopic signature (d 13 C) reflects the main vegetation signature being higher in pine than beech in the organic soil horizons (OL, OF and OH) down to the first mineral Ah horizon. At deeper <b>horizons</b> <b>d</b> 13 C value tends to equal that of the original beech soil indicating a limited influence of the afforested specie with depth even 100 years after afforestation. A consistent enrichment in d 15 N with depth was observed in the two profiles. This N enrichments have been related with progressive N losses being particularly pronounced in forest soils (Szpak, 2014 and refs therein). This phenomenon can be also related to migrations of N forms in a more evolved organic matter. In this view N losses in organic layers under beech seem to be less pronounced that under the alien pine.
