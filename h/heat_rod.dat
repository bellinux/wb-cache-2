The heat buildup using even my own power supply design (inefficient type) {{would have been too}} great. Steve Jobs tapped an Atari engineer, Rod Holt, to design a switching power supply that was much more efficient and generated less <b>heat.</b> <b>Rod</b> also keyed us into the fact that the plastic case wouldn't conduct heat well. At this point in time we took pride in being the first computer to use a switching power supply. Steve was {{proud of the fact that}} we didn't need a fan and seems to hold to that ideal to this day. By the way, Rod joined us as the 5th of 5 key Computerteam members for the first couple of years." [...] —Steve Wozniak During the early development of the Apple II, Apple Inc.'s co-founder, Steve Jobs asked his former boss, Atari's Al Alcorn for help with the power supply. Alcorn redirected Jobs to Holt, who saw himself as [...] "a second-string quarterback" [...] at Atari. He was initially [...] "skeptical of Jobs and of Apple" [...] (Swaine and Freiberger note that Holt [...] "had trouble understanding the West Coast culture that shaped Apple's Founders") telling Jobs that his rate was $200 per day. Jobs, however, replied that [...] "we can afford you" [...] and Holt joined the Apple II team in part responding to Alcorn's request to [...] "help the kids out." [...] Holt thus began to work [...] "after hours at Atari on Apple's television interface and power supply." [...] According to Apple's first CEO, Michael ("Scotty") Scott, [...] "One thing Holt has to his credit is that he created the switching power supply that allowed us to do a very lightweight computer compared to everybody else's that used transformers."However, one history reports over a dozen computer systems with a switching power supply came out in years prior to the Apple II, including the PDP-11/20 minicomputer in 1969, the IBM 5100 portable computer in 1975, and the decsystem 20 in 1976.

40|$|Thermal {{stratification}} is {{encountered in}} large {{pool of water}} increasingly being used as heat sink in new generation of advanced reactors. These large pools at near atmospheric pressure provide a heat sink for heat removal from the reactor or steam generator, and the containment by natural circulation {{as well as a}} source of water for core cooling. For examples, the PAFS (passive auxiliary feedwater system) is one of the advanced safety features adopted in the APR+(Advanced Power Reactor Plus), which is intended to completely replace the conventional active auxiliary feedwater system [1, 2]. The PAFS cools down the steam generator secondary side and eventually removes the decay heat from the reactor core by adopting a natural convection mechanism. In a pool, the heat transfer from the PCHX (passive condensation heat exchanger) contributed to increase the pool temperature up to the saturation condition and induce the natural circulation flow of the PCCT (passive condensate cooling tank) pool water [3]. When a <b>heat</b> <b>rod</b> is placed horizontally in a pool of water, the fluid adjacent to the <b>heat</b> <b>rod</b> gets heated up. In the process, its density reduces and by virtue of the buoyancy force, the fluid in this region moves up. After reaching the top free surface, the heated water moves towards the other side wall of the pool along the free surface. Since this heated water is cooling, it goes downward along the wall at the other side wall. Above heater rod, a natural circulation flow is formed. However, there is no flow below heater rod until pool water temperature increases to saturation temperature. In this study, velocity measurement was conducted to reveal a natural circulation flow structure in a small pool using PIV (particle image velocimetry) measurement technique...|$|E
40|$|This project aims at {{designing}} and implementing a fuzzy controller for Multiple Input Single Output temperature process. Temperature control {{of water in}} the tank is achieved by varying current to the <b>heating</b> <b>rod</b> and inlet flow rate by a fuzzy controller. The system consists of a tank, reservoir, variable speed pump, temperature sensor placed inside a heating tank containing the <b>heating</b> <b>rod,</b> voltage controlled current source and computer. Water is pumped into the tank from reservoir and RTD measures the current temperature. The signal from the temperature sensor is sent to the DAQ interfaced to the computer. LabVIEW software is used to acquire the input signal and send the output signal that is determined by the control algorithm. Fuzzy logic controller is designed in LabVIEW. Based on the set point temperature, the controller sets the appropriate current to the <b>heating</b> <b>rod.</b> If the required temperature is less than that sensed by the temperature sensor, the flow rate of water into the tank is controlled by a variable speed pump. While conventional controllers are analytically described by a set of equations, the FLC is described by a knowledge-based algorithm. Thus this system is highly efficient in both heating and reducing the temperature of the tank. A fuzzy logic controller gives faster response, is more reliable and recovers quickly from system upsets.

In order to better understand this phenomena for the specific geometry of vertical, <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> in water, an experimental facility was designed and constructed at Oregon State University. This facility, named the Laser-Imaged Natural Circulation (LINC) facility, consists of a water tank capped with a custom cooling plate through which two <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> pass into the tank. The LINC facility enables flow patterns in the channel between the <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> to be imaged and quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV).

The boundary layer thickness analysis consists of a test matrix of 5 test cases including symmetrical and asymmetrical heating in which the thickness of the boundary layer is measured using the velocity field between the heater rods. The velocity profile analysis centered on an effective vertical length of 100 mm along the entrance region between the two rods at one symmetrical rod power.
