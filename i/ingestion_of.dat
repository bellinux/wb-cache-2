5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> zinc coins.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> {{food or water}} contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E

5000|$|Ferrous {{gluconate}} may be toxic {{in case of}} overdose. Children {{may show}} signs <b>of</b> toxicity with <b>ingestions</b> <b>of</b> 10-20 mg/kg of elemental iron. Serious toxicity may result from <b>ingestions</b> <b>of</b> more than 60 mg/kg. Iron exerts both local and systemic effects: it is corrosive to the gastrointestinal mucosa, it can {{have a negative impact}} on the heart and blood (dehydration, low blood pressure, fast and weak pulse, shock), lungs, liver, gastrointestinal system (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting blood), nervous system (chills, dizziness, coma, convulsions, headache), and skin (flushing, loss of color, bluish-colored lips and fingernails). The symptoms may disappear in a few hours, but then emerge again after 1 or more days.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} iron {{ingested}} may give {{a clue to}} potential toxicity. The therapeutic dose for iron deficiency anemia is 3-6 mg/kg/day. Toxic effects begin to occur at doses above 10-20 mg/kg <b>of</b> elemental iron. <b>Ingestions</b> <b>of</b> more than 50 mg/kg of elemental iron are associated with severe toxicity.|$|R
5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans are rare, <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> ferric chloride {{can result in}} serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cryogenic}} liquid, {{liquid nitrogen}} {{can be dangerous}} by causing cold burns on contact, although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure (about one second). <b>Ingestion</b> <b>of</b> liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, {{a young woman in}} England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of potassium metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. <b>Ingestion</b> <b>of</b> large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system. Potassium chloride {{is used in the}} United States for lethal injection executions.|$|E
50|$|Whole bowel {{irrigation}} is {{also used}} in certain poisoning situations. It is usually reserved for patients who have ingested toxic doses of medications not absorbed by activated charcoal (such as iron and lithium), potentially toxic <b>ingestions</b> <b>of</b> sustained-release or enteric-coated drugs, or in the situation <b>of</b> packaged drug <b>ingestion</b> (body packing/stuffing).|$|R
5000|$|Vomiting and {{diarrhea}} {{are often the}} first clinical signs of grape or raisin toxicity. They often develop {{within a few hours}} <b>of</b> <b>ingestion.</b> Pieces <b>of</b> grapes or raisins may be present in the vomitus or stool. Further symptoms include weakness, not eating, increased drinking, and abdominal pain. Acute renal failure develops within 48 hours <b>of</b> <b>ingestion.</b> [...] A blood test may reveal increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, phosphorus, and calcium.|$|R

5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{symptoms}} of poisoning appear within {{three hours of}} <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> the mushroom as visual hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular and slow heart beat and agitation. Severe cases involving coma, convulsions, or death are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> clay minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as diarrhoea. Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E
5|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have been reviewing cadmium's bioinorganic aspects for its toxicity. The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in metal fume fever but may progress to chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and death.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ingestion</b> <b>of</b> {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. <b>Ingestion</b> <b>of</b> lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ingestion</b> <b>of</b> plastic flotsam {{is another}} problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that <b>ingestion</b> <b>of</b> plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Other {{details about}} the {{poisoning}} have always been in dispute. While some argue that Claudius was in Rome, others claim he was in Sinuessa on the night he was poisoned.
