25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{a probability}} space or a probability triple is a mathematical construct that models a real-world process (or “experiment”) consisting {{of states that}} occur randomly. A probability space is constructed with a specific <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation</b> or experiment in mind. One proposes that each time a situation of that kind arises, the set of possible outcomes is the same and the probabilities are also the same.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} cases where large {{differences}} between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning {{system and the}} actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes. JMA attributed the reason behind such discrepancy in the warning to the system's inability to separate two different earthquakes that happened at around same time, and also the reduced amount of available seismometer due to power outage and connection fail. The system's software was subsequently modified to handle this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Faced {{with another}} state side the MCC were again in trouble, this time under Colin Cowdrey's captaincy. John Snow was rested after {{damaging}} his toes in Melbourne and a stiff and sore Alan Ward strained a calf muscle during the game. In a rain affected match the New South Wales captain and wicket-keeper Brian Taber won the toss {{and decided to}} bat. They were 82/3 when Doug Walters came in and made 201 not out, adding 132 with Geoff Davies (57) and 145 with Kerry O'Keeffe (55 not out) before Taber declared at 410/5. Geoff Boycott (36) and Brian Luckhurst (42) added 54 for the first wicket and the MCC passed 100 with one wicket down. The leg-spinner O'Keeffe showed his all-round skills by taking 6/69 and they collapsed to 204 all out and were forced to follow on 206 runs behind. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation</b> that brought {{out the best in}} Geoff Boycott (129 not out) and he added 228 for the first wicket with Brian Luckhurst (135) and 97 for the second with Keith Fletcher (51 not out) to ensure a draw.|$|E

[...] The single also strengthened Maroon 5's appeal, and helped position them {{as one of the}} year's break-out bands in 2004.

500|$|One of Jolie's {{requests}} was {{to rework}} the third act, which originally had Salt rescue {{his wife and son}} from a coalition of villains, because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation.</b> Wimmer decided to then make Salt more crucial to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into [...] "a place harder than Fort Knox" [...] – after considering Camp David, Wimmer settled on the White House. When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said [...] "I think that it’s just been a continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character. But the ideas – the locomotive of ideas that drive the film are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian mole, and has to go on the run to defend himself. That’s been the same since day one. The tone of the film has changed in this evolution. In the same way, I guess, as – you know – action thrillers have changed {{along the lines of the}} Bond films and the Bourne films".|$|E

2500|$|Early trover cases {{involved}} the keeping or taking of a bailment by the bailee (the person charged {{to hold them}} with [...] "ordinary care"). Others concerned the use of lost chattels found by another. Who was the real owner? Early on, there was difficulty in dealing with situations where chattels held by a bailee were used by a third party. Examples could be sheep, horses, farm goods, grains or other chattels left {{in the care of}} a person who was required to exercise ordinary care. If negligence led to damages, an action could be had. A third person might use the chattel, returning it in a damaged condition. [...] The early common law had some difficulty in dealing with this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation.</b> This led to expansions of actions in trover.|$|E

We gave a mobile phone with video capability to users who then watched mobile videos in different situations.

It appears that {{there are at least two}} <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> in which the use of a mobile video phone seems natural.
