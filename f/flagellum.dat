5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend {{in such a way}} that the tip of the <b>flagellum</b> whips in a circle. The eukaryotic <b>flagellum,</b> also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each {{individual}} animal is distinctly male or female, and cross-fertilization can occur. The sex ratio is 1:1. The structure of the <b>flagellum</b> of the spermatozoon is unique: the <b>flagellum</b> {{is divided into two}} parts.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single <b>flagellum</b> (monotrichous), a <b>flagellum</b> at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The <b>flagellum</b> is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives {{the motion of the}} filament, which acts as a propeller.|$|E
5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial <b>flagellum</b> shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial <b>flagellum,</b> which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} <b>flagellum,</b> where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the <b>flagellum</b> is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial <b>flagellum</b> are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|The Chytridiomycota are {{commonly}} known as chytrids. These fungi are distributed worldwide. Chytrids and their close relatives Neocallimastigomycota and Blastocladiomycota (below) are the only fungi with active motility, producing zoospores that are capable of active movement through aqueous phases with a single <b>flagellum,</b> leading early taxonomists to classify them as protists. Molecular phylogenies, inferred from rRNA sequences in ribosomes, suggest that the Chytrids are a basal group divergent from the other fungal phyla, consisting of four major clades with suggestive evidence for paraphyly or possibly polyphyly.|$|E
5|$|A sponge's body is {{hollow and}} {{is held in}} shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like {{substance}} made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one <b>flagellum</b> per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable inlet valves. Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all {{other parts of the}} mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those {{at the base of the}} animal are responsible for anchoring it.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{such as the}} long, narrow kidney with reflexed ureter {{and closed}} {{secondary}} ureter, the penial complex with distinct penis, which is continuous with the epiphallus, epiphallic caecum (a <b>flagellum</b> and an appendix), unbranched gametolytic duct, lack of vaginal accessory organs, and the basic condition of the nervous and retractor muscle systems support the inclusion of Amphidromus in the family Camaenidae. This group of snails occur {{in a wide variety}} of habitats in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia, and is one of the most diverse families in the clade Stylommatophora. Though Laidlaw & Solem (1961) provided no more additional details on the anatomy of Amphidromus, subsequent studies by distinct authors, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have demonstrated that the reproductive system can provide valuable data for species recognition.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central <b>flagellum.</b> These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the <b>flagellum</b> (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} therefore {{explains why}} wheels are an unlikely {{solution to the}} problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the <b>flagellum,</b> the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation.|$|E
5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and <b>flagellum</b> (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm <b>flagellum.</b> Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E
25|$|Flagella are organelles for {{cellular}} mobility. The bacterial <b>flagellum</b> {{stretches from}} cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They {{are long and}} thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. A different type of <b>flagellum</b> is found in archaea and a different type is found in eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|Amastigote form {{found in}} the {{mononuclear}} phagocyte and circulatory systems of humans. It is an intracellular and non-motile form, being devoid of external <b>flagellum.</b> The short <b>flagellum</b> {{is embedded in the}} anterior end without projecting out. It is oval in shape, and measures 3–6µm in length and 1–3µm in breadth. The kinetoplast and basal body lie towards the anterior end.|$|E
25|$|The male gamete, a {{spermatozoon}} (produced {{within a}} testicle), {{is a small}} cell containing a single long <b>flagellum</b> which propels it.|$|E
25|$|He omitted, as Derosier {{pointed out}} in the Nova documentary, that Derosier wrote that {{bacterial}} <b>flagellum</b> looked like it was designed by a human. Derosier went on to add that in fact, the evidence pointed to evolution. That is not explicit in the article, but Derosier is known as an evolution proponent, so Behe should have known, since he quotes Derosier seemingly as in agreement, that Derosier disagreed with him regarding whether the bacterial <b>flagellum</b> points to evolution or Intelligent Design.|$|E
25|$|Other organelles {{are also}} {{suggested}} to have endosymbiotic origins, {{but do not}} contain their own DNA (notably the <b>flagellum</b> – see evolution of flagella).|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterial}} <b>flagellum</b> {{consists of}} three basic components: a whip-like filament, a motor complex, and a hook that connects them. The filament is approximately 20nm in diameter and consists of several protofilaments, each made up of thousands of flagellin subunits. The bundle is held together by a cap and {{may or may not}} be encapsulated. The motor complex consists of a series of rings anchoring the <b>flagellum</b> in the inner and outer membranes, followed by a proton-driven motor that drives rotational movement in the filament.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{findings}} indicate the parasite {{is unable to}} survive in the bloodstream without its <b>flagellum.</b> This insight gives researchers a new angle with which to attack the parasite.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} system of Xerocrassa geyeri {{was described by}} Gittenberger (1993): there is no appendage in the genital atrium, that is the distinguishing characteristic of the genus Xerocrassa Monterosato, 1892. There are two rudimentary dart-sacs near the mucus glands. The <b>flagellum</b> and the epiphallus have approximately the same length.|$|E
25|$|Spiny {{lobsters}} {{have typically}} a slightly compressed carapace, lacking any lateral ridges. Their antennae lack a scaphocerite, the flattened exopod of the antenna. This is fused to the epistome (a plate between the labrum and {{the basis of}} the antenna). The <b>flagellum,</b> {{at the top of the}} antenna, is stout, tapering, and very long. The ambulatory legs (pereopods) end in claws (chelae).|$|E
25|$|Some cell types, such as plant cells, do {{not contain}} well defined MTOCs. In these cells, microtubules are {{nucleated}} from discrete sites in the cytoplasm. Other cell types, such as trypanosomatid parasites, have a MTOC but it is permanently found {{at the base of}} a <b>flagellum.</b> Here, nucleation of microtubules for structural roles and for generation of the mitotic spindle is not from a canonical centriole-like MTOC.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{segments}} in an antenna varies considerably amongst insects, with higher flies having only 3-6 segments, while adult cockroaches can have over 140. The general {{shape of the}} antennae is also quite variable, but the first segment (the one attached to the head) is always called the scape, and the second segment is called the pedicel. The remaining antennal segments or flagellomeres are called the <b>flagellum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Males {{are usually}} smaller than females, with {{relatively}} longer legs. Unlike females, the males bear {{a pair of}} flagella, one on each chelicera. In the accompanying photograph of a male solifugid, one <b>flagellum</b> is just visible near the tip of each chelicera. The flagella, which bend back over the chelicerae, are sometimes called horns and {{are believed to have}} some sexual connection, but their function has not yet been clearly explained.|$|E
25|$|Promastigote {{is formed}} in the {{alimentary}} tract of the sandfly. It is an extracellular and motile form. It is considerably larger and more highly elongated, measuring 15–30µm in length and 5µm in width. It is spindle-shaped, tapering at both ends. A long <b>flagellum</b> (about the body length) is projected externally at the anterior end. The nucleus lies at the centre, {{and in front of}} which are kinetoplast and basal body.|$|E
25|$|Animals are {{generally}} considered to have emerged within flagellated eukaryota. Their closest known living relatives are the choanoflagellates, collared flagellates that have a morphology similar to the choanocytes of certain sponges. Molecular studies place animals in a supergroup called the opisthokonts, which also include the choanoflagellates, fungi and a few small parasitic protists. The name comes from the posterior location of the <b>flagellum</b> in motile cells, such as most animal spermatozoa, whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella.|$|E
25|$|Schizomida is {{an order}} of arachnids that tend {{to live in the}} top layer of soils. Schizomids present the prosoma covered by a large protopeltidium and smaller, paired, mesopeltidia and metapeltidia. There are no eyes. The opisthosoma is a smooth oval of 12 {{recognisable}} somites. The first is reduced and forms the pedicel. The last three are much constricted, forming the pygidium. The last somite bears the <b>flagellum,</b> which in this order is short and consists of not more than four segments.|$|E
25|$|Some {{elongated}} protists have distinctive {{ends of the}} body. In such organisms, the {{end with}} a mouth (or equivalent structure, such as the cytostome in Paramecium or Stentor), or the end that usually points {{in the direction of}} the organism's locomotion (such as the end with the <b>flagellum</b> in Euglena), is normally designated as the anterior end. The opposite end then becomes the posterior end. Properly, this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always planktonic (not normally attached to a surface), although the term can also be applied to one that is sessile (normally attached to a surface).|$|E
25|$|The Chihuahuan Desert {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} {{ecosystem}} which {{is home to a}} large variety of mammals. The most common mammals in the desert include: Desert cottontail Sylvilagus audubonii, black-tailed jackrabbit Lepus californicus, hooded skunk Mephitis macroura, cactus mouse Peromyscus eremicus, swift fox Vulpes velox, white-throated woodrat Neotoma albigula, pallid bat Antrozous pallidus, and coyote Canis latrans. The most observed reptiles in the desert include: Mohave rattlesnake Crotalus scutulatus, twin-spotted rattlesnake Crotalus pricei, prairie rattlesnake Crotalus viridis, ridge-nosed rattlesnake Crotalus willardi, whip snake Masticophis <b>flagellum,</b> New Mexico whiptail Cnemidophorus neomexicanus, and red-spotted toad Bufo punctatus.|$|E
25|$|L. donovani was {{independently}} {{discovered by}} two British medical officers William Boog Leishman in Netley, England, and Charles Donovan in Madras, India, in 1903. However, the correct taxonomy {{was provided by}} Ronald Ross. The parasite requires two different hosts for a complete life cycle, humans as the definitive host and sandflies as the intermediate host. In {{some parts of the}} world other mammals, especially canines, act as reservoir hosts. In human cell they exist as small, spherical and unflagellated amastigote form; while they are elongated with <b>flagellum</b> as promastigote form in sandflies. Unlike other parasitic protists they are unable to directly penetrate the host cell, and are dependent upon phagocytosis. The whole genome sequence of L. donovani obtained from southeastern Nepal was published in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Solifugae is a {{group of}} 900 species of arachnids, {{commonly}} known as camel spiders, wind scorpions, and sun spiders. The name derives from Latin, and means those that flee from the sun. Most Solifugae live in tropical or semitropical regions where they inhabit warm and arid habitats, but some species have been known to live in grassland or forest habitats. The most distinctive feature of Solifugae is their large chelicerae. Each of the two chelicerae are composed of two articles forming a powerful pincer; each article bears a variable number of teeth. Males in all families but Eremobatidae possess a <b>flagellum</b> on the basal article of the chelicera. Solifugae also have long pedipalps, which function as sense organs similar to insects' antennae and give the appearance of the two extra legs. Pedipalps terminate in reversible adhesive organs.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Leishmania is {{completed}} in two hosts, humans and sandflies. The adult female sandfly is a bloodsucker, usually feeding at night on sleeping prey. When the fly bites an individual infected with Leishmania, the pathogen is ingested along with the prey's blood. The protozoan is in the smaller of its two forms, called an amastigote, which is round, non-motile, and only 3–7 micrometers in diameter. Inside the stomach of the sandfly, the amastigotes quickly transform into elongated and motile forms called the promastigotes. Promastigote is spindle-shaped, triple {{the size of the}} amastigote, and has a single <b>flagellum</b> that allows mobility. The promastigotes live extracellularly in the alimentary canal, reproducing asexually, then migrate to the proximal end of the gut where they become poised for a regurgitational transmission. As the fly bites, the promastigotes are released from the proboscis and introduced locally at the bite site.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina is {{more than}} twice the length of the oviduct. Oviduct about half as long as the {{proximal}} part of the pedunculus, which is longer than the distal part. Basally the pedunculus is much broader than the adjoining oviduct. The bursa of the bursa copulatrix is separate from the spermoviduct; it reaches hardly further than the diverticulum. Male part of the genitalia with a single retractor muscle, without <b>flagellum</b> or caecum. Penis is tripartite as far as can be judged {{on the basis of the}} transparent genital slides, forming a loop with a sharp curvature about halfway. Proximal half formed by (1) a short segment with a relatively simple luminal surface, followed by (2) a clearly broader and about three times longer part with some longitudinal ridges with zigzag borders. Distal half, with the insertion of the retractor muscle slightly distal from halfway, about as broad or little broader than the narrow part of the proximal half; penial segment (3) with a relatively simple luminal surface; epiphallus (4) with a vague pattern of small pustulae, most clearly seen at its distal end. Vas deferens, a short part of the penis and nearly as much as the proximal half of the vagina united by a common sheath.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina {{is short}} to very short. Oviduct is {{measuring}} about 2/3 {{of the length}} of the proximal part of the pedunculus, which is clearly shorter than its much narrower distal segment. Proximal part of the pedunculus about as broad as the proximal half of the oviduct, which is twice as broad as the distal half; the much narrower diverticulum reaches somewhat further than the bursa of the bursa copulatrix, which is separate from the spermoviduct. Male part of the genitalia forming a loop because the vas deferens and a short, most proximal part of the penis are united by a common sheath; with a single retractor muscle, inserting rather close {{to the beginning of the}} vas deferens, without a <b>flagellum</b> or caecum. The luminal structure, as far as visible in the transparent genital slides, enables the distinction of three segments: (1) a short broadest part with a relatively simple, longitudinal, luminal structure, (2) a much longer part, with a more complicated luminal surface of many protuberances that very gradually decrease in size towards segment (3), which has a wall structure with very small, irregular protuberances and changes into the epiphallus near the insertion site of the retractor muscle, without an obvious boundary.|$|E
