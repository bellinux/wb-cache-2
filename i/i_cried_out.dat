500|$|While at Duino, Rilke and Princess Marie {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} collaborating on a translation of Dante Alighieri's La Vita Nuova (1295). After the Princess left to join her husband at their Lautschin estate, Rilke spent {{the next few weeks}} at the castle preparing to focus on work. [...] During these weeks, he was writing Marien-Leben (The Life of Mary). While walking along the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic Sea near the castle, Rilke claimed to hear a voice calling to him speaking the words of the first line, Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen? ("Who, if <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out,</b> would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?") which he quickly wrote in his notebook. [...] Within days, he produced drafts of the first two elegies in the series and drafted passages and fragments that would later be incorporated into later elegies—including the opening passage of the tenth elegy.|$|E
500|$|The Duino Elegies are {{intensely}} religious, mystical {{poems that}} weigh beauty and existential suffering. The poems employ a rich symbolism of angels and salvation {{but not in}} keeping with typical Christian interpretations. [...] Rilke begins the first elegy in an invocation of philosophical despair, asking: [...] "Who, if <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out,</b> would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?" [...] (Wer, wenn ich schriee, hörte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen?) and later declares that [...] "every angel is terrifying" [...] (Ein jeder Engel ist schrecklich). [...] While labelling of these poems as [...] "elegies" [...] would typically imply melancholy and lamentation, many passages are marked by their positive energy and [...] "unrestrained enthusiasm." [...] Together, the Duino Elegies are described as a metamorphosis of Rilke's [...] "ontological torment" [...] and an [...] "impassioned monologue about {{coming to terms with}} human existence" [...] discussing themes of [...] "the limitations and insufficiency of the human condition and fractured human consciousness... man's loneliness, the perfection of the angels, life and death, love and lovers, and the task of the poet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beyond Gisborne Court is Fen Court, a 20th-century {{building}} partially on stilts. Fen Court {{was built}} between 1939 and 1941 from designs by H. C. Hughes {{and his partner}} Peter Bicknell. It was amongst the earliest buildings in Cambridge designed {{in the style of}} the Modern Movement pioneered by Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus. The carved panel by Anthony Foster over the entrance doorway evokes the mood in Britain as the building was completed. It bears the inscription DE PROFUNDIS CLAMAVI MCMXL — [...] "out of the depths have <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> 1940". These are the first words of Psalm 130, one of the Penitential Psalms. Alongside the inscription is a depiction of St Peter being saved from the sea.|$|E

2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. <b>I</b> <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E
