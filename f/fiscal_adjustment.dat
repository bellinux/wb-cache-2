In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustment</b> and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E

The goal is to understand from successful adjustments, what policies can help the governments of countries which will soon have to implement vigorous fiscal retrenchments.

That is, are successful <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustments</b> typically achieved by means of expenditure cuts or tax increases? Which components in the expenditure and revenue sides should be adjusted?

40|$|Empirical {{studies on}} the effects of <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustments</b> apply {{different}} approaches to identify discretionary changes in fiscal policy. While the results of one strand of literature suggest that the effects of <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustments</b> on GDP are small or even positive, particularly for spending cuts (expansionary austerity), this strand of literature is under criticism because of an incomplete cyclical adjustment strategy. I compare the macroeconomic effects of <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustments</b> using five different identification strategies for a panel of 30 OECD countries over the period 1980 to 2012 and show that the strategy chosen for identifying fiscal policy has a crucial impact on the estimated effects. My results suggest that large <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustments</b> (both revenue and spending based) lead to economic contractions, after appropriate controlling for cyclical effects and one-off capital transfers. These findings indicate that a great deal of previous empirical research on <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustments</b> and expansionary austerity is based on an incomplete measure of fiscal policy and needs to be reevaluated. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of large current account deficits via financial account surpluses became problematic as investors became more risk averse to emerging market exposure {{as a consequence}} of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998. After crafting a <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustment</b> program and pledging progress on structural reform, Brazil received a $41.5billion IMF-led international support program in November 1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that the real would no longer be pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation helped moderate the downturn in economic growth in 1999 that investors had expressed concerns about over the summer of 1998. Brazil's debt-to-GDP ratio of 48% for 1999 beat the IMF target and helped reassure investors that Brazil will maintain tight fiscal and monetary policy even with a floating currency.|$|E

So <b>fiscal</b> <b>adjustment</b> must resolve the conundrum of being neither too fast nor too slow. Shaping a Goldilocks fiscal consolidation is all about timing. What is needed is a dual focus on medium-term consolidation and short-term support for growth and jobs. That may sound contradictory, but the two are mutually reinforcing.
