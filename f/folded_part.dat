The feeling in Saskatoon was that the {{franchise}} needed a new image to help people forget about the failure in 1992. A fan [...] "name the team" [...] contest was held and the winning entry was the Saskatoon Slam. The team no longer needed to appeal to the entire province as the Storm had, therefore held their entire home schedule in Saskatoon at what is now known as Credit Union Centre. The NBL tipped off in 1993 and featured teams in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. Unlike the WBL, the league had no height restriction and as a result teams featured players over the [...] mark. The league was fraught with problems during its initial season and saw the Montreal Dragons fold early into the inaugural campaign and the Hamilton Skyhawks moved to Edmonton for their playoff games. As well, the entire 1993 NBL Final was held in Saskatoon, as the Cape Breton Breakers did not have enough money to travel back to Sydney, Nova Scotia, for their home games. In the best-of-five series, Saskatoon did win the championship three games to one and in the process won the only professional league title in Saskatoon's history. The NBL returned for a second season in 1994, but <b>folded</b> <b>part</b> way through that season.|$|E

40|$|Intercalated discs usually {{consisted}} {{of three or four}} transverse steps of folded cell membrane connected by straight parts running longitudinally. The transverse <b>folded</b> <b>parts</b> contained a variable number of interlocking processes from contiguous cells. Large processes were frequently flanked by smaller ones. Nexuses appeared to be better developed on the straight parts of intercalated discs than on the <b>folded</b> <b>parts.</b> They varied in size, shape and particle-packing density. The largest nexus observed was almost perfectly circular. It covered an area of 0. 087 micron 2, contained 530 particles and had a particle-packing density of 6078 particles/micron 2. The sarcoplasmic reticulum formed a uniform mesh of fine tubes which was distributed in sheets between bundles of myofilaments and longitudinally aligned mitochondria. Neither extended junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum nor fenestrations in the sarcoplasmic reticulum were observed. Peripheral couplings were numerous and widespread. They were not restricted to the sarcolemma in the regions of the Z-line, H- or I-bands. Transitional cells combine the characteristics of contractile and conducting cells in varying proportions. There is some speculation about the mechanism of nexus formation and the interconvertibility of contractile and conducting cells via the intermediary of the transitional cell...|$|R
