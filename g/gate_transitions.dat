A general empiric definition for a Hill coefficient (nH) for channel <b>gating</b> <b>transitions</b> that is analogous to the logarithmic potential sensitivity function of Almers is derived. This definition provides a novel framework for interpreting the meaning of the Hill coefficient.

R → A mutants eliminated individual positive charge while substantially reducing side chain volume and hydrophilic character. Their novel effects on gating may thus {{have been the result}} of electrostatic and/or structural perturbations. To address this issue, and to gain further insights into the roles that S 4 plays in the regulation of Kv 4. 3 <b>gating</b> <b>transitions,</b> we comparatively analyzed arginine to glutamine (R → Q) mutations at positions 290, 293, and 296. This maneuver maintained positive charge elimination of the R → A mutants, while partially restoring native side chain volume and hydrophilic properties. R → A and R → Q mutant pairs produced similar effects on the forward gating process of activation. In contrast, {{significant differences between the two}} substitutions were discovered on deactivation, CSI, and recovery, with the R → Q mutants partially restoring wild type characteristics. Our results argue that modification of individual S 4 residue properties may result in altered localized interactions within unique microenvironments encountered during forward and reverse <b>gating</b> <b>transitions.</b> As such, predominant effects appear on the reverse <b>gating</b> <b>transitions</b> of deactivation and recovery.

We particularly focused on gating characteristics of macroscopic (open state) versus closed state inactivation (CSI) and recovery. In the absence of KChIP 2 b Δ 2 – 39 did not significantly alter the steady-state activation “a 4 ” relationship or general CSI characteristics, but it did slow the kinetics of deactivation, macroscopic inactivation and macroscopic recovery. Recovery kinetics (for both WT KV 4. 3 and Δ 2 – 39) were complicated and displayed sigmoidicity, a process which was enhanced by Δ 2 – 39. Deletion of the proximal N-terminal domain therefore appeared to specifically slow mechanisms involved in regulating <b>gating</b> <b>transitions</b> occurring after the channel open state(s) had been reached. In the presence of KChIP 2 b Δ 2 – 39 recovery kinetics (from both macroscopic and CSI) were accelerated, with an apparent reduction in initial sigmoidicity.

KChIP 2 b-mediated remodeling of KV 4. 3 <b>gating</b> <b>transitions</b> was therefore not obligatorily dependent upon an intact N-terminus. To account for these effects we propose that KChIP 2 regulatory domains exist in KV 4. 3 α subunit regions outside of the proximal N-terminal.

These transitions, which have not been well characterized previously, produce a distinct fast component in the gating current tails. Two intermediate transitions contribute to the fast component and carry 23 % of the total gating charge.

In the {{cystic fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channel, this interaction with ATP generates a gating cycle between a closed (C) and two open (O 1 and O 2) conformations. To understand better how ATP controls channel activity, we examined <b>gating</b> <b>transitions</b> from the C to the O 1 and O 2 states and from these open {{states to the}} C conformation.

Previously, we identified a slow gating mutation, T 171 A in the Kir 6. 2 subunit, which dramatically reduces rates of burst to interburst transitions in Kir 6. 2 ΔC 26 channels without SUR 1 {{in the absence}} of ATP. Here, we constructed all possible mutations at position 171 in Kir 6. 2 ΔC 26 channels without SUR 1.

Moreover, we investigated the role of individual Kir 6. 2 subunits in the gating by comparing burst to interburst transition rates of channels constructed from different combinations of slow 171 A and fast T 171 “wild-type” subunits. The relationship between <b>gating</b> <b>transition</b> rate and number of slow subunits is exponential, which excludes independent gating models where any one subunit is sufficient for inhibition gating.

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} two decades, the view of gap {{junction}} (GJ) channel gating has changed from one with GJs having a single transjunctional voltage-sensitive (Vj-sensitive) gating mechanism to one with each hemichannel of a formed GJ channel, as well as unapposed hemichannels, containing two, molecularly distinct gating mechanisms. These mechanisms are termed fast gating and slow or ‘loop’ gating. It appears that the fast gating mechanism is solely sensitive to Vj and induces fast <b>gating</b> <b>transitions</b> between the open state and a particular substate, termed the residual conductance state. The slow gating mechanism is also sensitive to Vj, but {{there is evidence that}} this gate may mediate gating by transmembrane voltage (Vm), intracellular Ca 2 + and pH, chemical uncouplers and GJ channel opening during de novo channel formation. A distinguishing feature of the slow gate is that the <b>gating</b> <b>transitions</b> appear to be slow, consisting of a series of transient substates en route to opening and closing. Published reports suggest that both sensorial and gating elements of the fast gating mechanism are formed by transmembrane and cytoplamic components of connexins among which the N terminus is most essential and which determines gating polarity. We propose that the gating element of the slow gating mechanism is located closer to the central region of the channel pore and serves as a ‘common’ gate linked to several sensing elements that are responsive to different factors and located in different regions of the channel...|$|R

Here, we show that a new KCNQ 1 activator, ML 277, can enhance IKs amplitude in adult guinea pig and canine ventricular myocytes. We probe its binding site and mechanism of action by computational analysis based on our recently reported KCNQ 1 and KCNQ 1 /KCNE 1 3 D models, followed by experimental validation. Results from a pocket analysis and docking exercise suggest that ML 277 binds to a side pocket in KCNQ 1 and the KCNE 1 -free side pocket of KCNQ 1 /KCNE 1. Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations based on the most favorable channel/ML 277 docking configurations reveal a well-defined ML 277 binding space surrounded by the S 2 -S 3 loop and S 4 -S 5 helix on the intracellular side, and by S 4 –S 6 transmembrane helices on the lateral sides. A detailed analysis of MD trajectories suggests two mechanisms of ML 277 action. First, ML 277 restricts the conformational dynamics of the KCNQ 1 pore, optimizing K+ ion coordination in the selectivity filter and increasing current amplitudes. Second, ML 277 binding induces global motions in the channel, including regions critical for KCNQ 1 <b>gating</b> <b>transitions.</b> We conclude that ML 277 activates IKs by binding to an intersubunit space and allosterically influencing pore conductance and <b>gating</b> <b>transitions.</b> KCNE 1 association protects KCNQ 1 from an arrhythmogenic (constitutive current-inducing) effect of ML 277, but does not preclude its current-enhancing effect...|$|R

In pLGICs, binding of agonist to the extracellular domain {{triggers a}} structural rearrangement {{that leads to}} the opening of an ion-conducting pore in the transmembrane domain and, in the continued presence of neurotransmitter, the channels desensitize (close). The flexible loops in each subunit that connect the extracellular binding domain (loops 2, 7, and 9) to the transmembrane channel domain (M 2 -M 3 loop) are essential for coupling ligand binding to channel gating. Comparing the crystal structures of two bacterial pLGIC homologues, ELIC and the proton-activated GLIC, suggests channel gating is associated with rearrangements in these loops, but whether these motions accurately predict the motions in functional lipid-embedded pLGICs is unknown. Here, using site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and functional GLIC channels reconstituted into liposomes, we examined if, and how far, the loops at the ECD/TMD gating interface move during proton-dependent <b>gating</b> <b>transitions</b> from the resting to desensitized state. Loop 9 moves ∼ 9 Å inward toward the channel lumen in response to proton-induced desensitization.
