40|$|Mercury-free <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> {{have been}} studied {{by means of a}} radial-dependent model. Xenon and indium iodide are chosen as start gas and buffer, respectively. Local {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium is assumed with a single temperature for all species. The model consists of the coupled description of the balance equation for the plasma temperature with the radiation transport equation. The plasma composition is calculated according to the Guldberg–Waage, Boltzmann and Saha laws. These laws were supplemented by additional equations specifying the total pressure, constant element ratios and quasineutrality. The model takes into account atomic, molecular as well as continuum radiation. The broadening of the optically thick lines is approximated by Stormberg's approach. The predicted spectrum is compared with a measured one and shows good agreement on a qualitative scale. From this comparison it is concluded that the largest part of the continuum radiation is produced by the free–free and free–bound AX transition in InI...|$|R
40|$|Low-pressure <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> obey {{a set of}} {{physical}} laws that {{are different from those}} of <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps.</b> In this paper, these differences are addressed. Based on a recently developed HID lamp model frame, a semi-theoretical fluorescent lamp model that can be determined by genetic algorithms and simple electrical measurements is presented. This model does not require any lamp data from lamp manufacturers. Its parameters can be determined from electrical voltage and current measurements of the lamps under ac operation at mains frequency. With the same set of parameters, the model can predict the lamp terminal characteristics accurately under low, medium and high frequency operations. Good simulation results were achieved when the lamp power was reduced to 60 % of rated power and when the lamp was operated under step-up and step-down transient processes. Simulation results for different sizes of tubular and compact fluorescent lamps agree well with their experimental results. Particularly, the differences between simulation results and experimental results under rated power are less than 10 %. Hence, the proposed model shows a good degree of accuracy: 1) for different types of fluorescent lamps; 2) at different operating frequencies; 3) under different dimming levels; and 4) during step-up and step-down transient processes. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{details of the}} following: 1. ab initio {{calculations}} {{of a set of}} electron impact cross sections for atomic Zn; and 2. transport coefficients and distribution functions for an electron swarm in Zn vapour, obtained from a multiterm solution of Boltzmann's equation using these cross sections, over a range of reduced fields, E/N, and gas temperatures of practical interest. Our work has been motivated, in part, by recent suggestions that zinc could be an attractive replacement for mercury in making <b>high-pressure</b> gas <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> more environment-friendly (Born M 2001 J.

40|$|Thomson {{scattering}} (TS) {{experiments have}} been performed on <b>high-pressure</b> Hg <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps.</b> These lamps were filled with different amounts of Hg (15, 30, 50 and 70 mg) and were operating at different powers (150, 200 and 240 W) with a square-wave ballast. As in the previous studies (Zhu X et al 2004 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 37 736 – 43) a triple grating spectrograph was used to suppress the false stray light and Rayleigh scattered photons. This set-up had to be modified for this special application. The collective TS spectra have been fitted using both a calibration using Raman scattering and a form fitting procedure. It {{was found that the}} electron temperature fluctuates around a certain value that seems rather constant in the central region. The value of electron temperature (Te) varies between 5500 and 7600 K in the central region (r = 0. 3 R). The spatial-averaged Te value increases with the lamp power. The electron density was found to be of the order of 1021 m- 3 which is high at the centre and decreases as r increases. The ne value also increases with the lamp power. Moreover the results of TS are compared with those from x-ray absorption measurement. The comparison shows that the plasmas in such lamps are not in local thermal equilibrium in the sense that -gas temperature and locally the rate of ionization is much larger than that of three body recombination...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{constitutes}} {{the third part}} of a series of work with the goal of developing a three-dimensional computational model to help understand the various physical mechanisms involved in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> arcs. The effect of an externally applied magnetic field on the convection and temperature characteristics is studied in the present effort. The classic experiment of Kenty is first simulated. It is found that the magnetic field can induce a downward velocity to the hot gas core to offset the buoyancy-induced nonuniformity in the temperature field. Separate pairs of contra-rotating recirculating eddies resulting from the magnetic and buoyancy effects can be identified. Qualitative as well as quantitative agreements between Kenty's experiment and the present prediction are observed. The feasibility of applying the magnetic control to optimize the operation of the modern <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp</b> is then investigated. The model reveals that convection strengthens if either the pressure inside the arc-tube or the magnitude of the magnetic field increases. Furthermore, with the same geometry, the required strength of the magnetic field to center the hot core and maintain a symmetric temperature distribution is linearly proportional to the arc-tube pressure. This finding yields a very useful method for optimizing the <b>discharge</b> <b>lamp</b> design. © 1992...|$|R
