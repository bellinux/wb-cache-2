5|$|The {{earliest}} Ardhanarishvara {{images are}} dated to the Kushan period, {{starting from the}} first century CE. Its iconography evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era. The Puranas and various <b>iconographic</b> treatises write about the mythology and iconography of Ardhanarishvara. While Ardhanarishvara remains a popular <b>iconographic</b> form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, very few temples are dedicated to this deity.|$|E
5|$|An <b>iconographic</b> {{tradition}} of representing Sun and Moon with faces {{developed in the}} late medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Haripriya Rangarajan, in {{her book}} Images of Varahi—An <b>Iconographic</b> Study, {{suggests}} that Varahi {{is none other than}} Vak devi, the goddess of speech.|$|E
5|$|No other {{examples}} of owls in an <b>iconographic</b> context exist in Mesopotamian art, nor are there textual references that directly associate owls with a particular god or goddess.|$|E
5|$|In <b>iconographic</b> {{representations}} of the myth of Shiva vis-à-vis Vishnu, Sharabha form has been built around Narasimha but substantially embellished with wings to represent Kali and Durga to denote the female powers (shaktis) of Shiva; Sharabha is also shown with a bird head and a serpent in his beak head.|$|E
5|$|Kaali's {{most common}} four armed <b>iconographic</b> image shows each hand {{carrying}} variously a sword, a trishul (trident), a severed head, {{and a bowl}} or skull-cup (kapala) catching {{the blood of the}} severed head.|$|E
5|$|The Tantric texts Tantrasara, Shakta Pramoda and Mantra-mahodadhih {{give details}} about the worship of Chhinnamasta and other Mahavidyas, {{including}} her yantra, mantra and her dhyanas (meditative or <b>iconographic</b> forms). The Sri Chhinnamasta Nityarcana by Shri Swamiji (1979) details the rituals for the daily worship of Chhinnamasta.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular <b>iconographic</b> forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines {{dedicated}} to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. There is ample evidence from texts and the multiple depictions of the Ardhanarishvara in stone to suggest that a cult centred around the deity may have existed. The cult may have had occasional followers, but was never aligned to any sect. This cult focusing on the joint worship of Shiva and the Goddess may even have had a high position in Hinduism, but when and how it faded away remains a mystery. Though a popular <b>iconographic</b> form, temples dedicated to the deity are few. A popular one is located in Thiruchengode, while five others are located in Kallakkurichi taluk, all of them in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Bhikshatana {{is discussed in}} all Shaiva Agamic texts, including Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama, Karanagama and the <b>iconographic</b> work Shilparatna; the texts are mostly South Indian in origin. The iconography is quite {{similar to that of}} the Kankala-murti aspect who, like Bhikshatana, is associated with the legend of Shiva's atonement for severing Brahma's head. The chief difference is that Bhikshatana is nude and Kankala-murti is clothed.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of this old constellation of <b>iconographic</b> elements {{can still be}} seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer {{in a gesture of}} protection or fearlessness (abhaya mudra). The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, which is a very popular theme.|$|E
5|$|Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin {{is a large}} oil and tempera on oak panel painting, usually dated between 1435 and 1440, {{attributed}} to the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. Housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it shows Luke the Evangelist, patron saint of artists, sketching the Virgin Mary as she nurses the Child Jesus. The figures are positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards a courtyard, river, town and landscape. The enclosed garden, illusionistic carvings of Adam and Eve on the arms of Mary's throne, and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting's many <b>iconographic</b> symbols.|$|E
5|$|The <b>iconographic</b> 16th century work Shilparatna, the Matsya Purana and Agamic texts like Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama and Karanagama – {{most of them}} of South Indian origin – {{describe}} the iconography of Ardhanarishvara. The right superior {{side of the body}} usually is the male Shiva and the left is the female Parvati; in rare depictions belonging to the Shaktism school, the feminine holds the dominant right side. The icon usually is prescribed to have four, three or two arms, but rarely is depicted with eight arms. In the case of three arms, the Parvati side has only one arm, suggesting a lesser role in the icon.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} {{of the first generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, <b>iconographic</b> elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E
5|$|The {{posture of}} Ardhanarishvara may be tribhanga – bent in three parts: head (leaning to the left), torso (to the right) and right leg {{or in the}} sthanamudra {{position}} (straight), sometimes standing on a lotus pedestal, whereupon it is called samapada. Seated images of Ardhanarishvara are missing in <b>iconographic</b> treatises, but are still found in sculpture and painting. Though the canons often depict the Nandi bull as the common vahana (mount) of Ardhanarishvara, some depictions have Shiva's bull vahana seated or standing near or behind his foot, while the goddess's lion vahana is near her foot.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is rich in}} {{symbolism}} and <b>iconographic</b> elements, to an extent far more pronounced than that in The Madonna Standing. An iris grows {{to the side of}} the aedicula, representing the Virgin's sorrow at the Passion, and on the other side a columbine, recalling the Sorrows of the Virgin. This symbolic use of flowers is again a van Eyckian motif. While they may appear incongruous with the architectural setting, this was probably the effect that van der Weyden was seeking.|$|E
5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or jug), oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (incense burner), {{and in the case}} of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient <b>iconographic</b> evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E
5|$|Deivanai is {{generally}} depicted with her husband, particularly in an <b>iconographic</b> form called Senapati. She {{sits on the}} left thigh of the six-headed and twelve-armed Kartikeya. One of his arms holds her waist. Numerous depictions of the two exist at Tirupparankunram, the location of their marriage. However, in many south-Indian representations, when Murugan is depicted only with one consort, Valli is favoured over Devasena. In most South-Indian depictions, Murugan is depicted with both his consorts standing besides him; Devasena is on his left-hand side. Her complexion is yellow; she is often depicted adorned with a crown, earrings, necklaces and ornaments. She wears a traditional sari and has two arms. She holds a lotus in her left arm, while his right hand hangs down.|$|E
5|$|No prototypes for the {{painting}} are known in Sweden, and while {{the painting}} is occasionally associated with the Danube school, much about its stylistic and <b>iconographic</b> history remains to be investigated. A possible stylistic prototype is the illustrated Bible of Erhard Altdorfer (brother of the more famous Albrecht Altdorfer). Begun in 1530, it {{was inspired by the}} works of Cranach and Dürer, but also renewed the genre by combining commonplace details with an undertone of approaching disaster. In particular, Altdorfer's apocalyptic illustrations for the Revelation to John deliver an evangelic message {{similar to that of the}} Vädersolstavlan. Historical documents show that Olaus Petri, who commissioned the painting, combined biblical quotations related to the Apocalypse with the painting hanging in the church. Copies of Erhard Altdorfer's apocalyptic woodcuts may have been available in Stockholm through the German merchant Gorius Holste who lived by Järntorget square and who was a friend of both Petri and Martin Luther.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti {{was influenced by}} Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the <b>iconographic</b> depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu {{iconography of}} Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the Hephthalite Empire, and Kushan Empire. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found {{from the wall}} {{painting}} from Penjikent on the river Zervashan. In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread ("Yajnopavita"). He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress. A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh. Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls. It is also noted that Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the <b>iconographic</b> appearance of Shiva.|$|E
25|$|The {{fragments}} have, up to now, allowed {{restoration of}} five statues for this <b>iconographic</b> type.|$|E
25|$|The coinage of that ruler is {{distinguished}} by its variety, {{the use of}} new <b>iconographic</b> types and the precise engraving.|$|E
25|$|As to {{subsequent}} developments, {{important issues}} in Schele's <b>iconographic</b> work have been elaborated by Karl Taube. New approaches to Maya art include studies of ancient Maya ceramic workshops, {{the representation of}} bodily experience and the senses in Maya art, and of hieroglyphs considered as <b>iconographic</b> units. Meanwhile, the number of monographs devoted to the monumental art of specific courts is growing. A good impression of recent Mexican and North American art historical scholarship can be gathered from the exhibition catalogue 'Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya' (2004).|$|E
25|$|Another {{feature of}} the room was the stuffed {{alligator}} hanging from the ceiling, in homage to the alchemists' <b>iconographic</b> salamander, which could live in fire without burning.|$|E
25|$|The coastal Moche culture also co-existed (or {{overlapped}} in time) {{with the}} slightly earlier Recuay {{culture in the}} highlands. Some Moche <b>iconographic</b> motifs {{can be traced to}} Recuay design elements.|$|E
25|$|Abstract: The work {{deals with}} the {{production}} of bronzeworks under Bernward at Hildesheim. The main focus here too is on the description of individual scenes in theological and <b>iconographic</b> terms.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls of}} the chapel are covered with {{majolica}} tiles, dated 1584 and signed by Francisco de Matos. They combine stylized naturalistic images with geometric patterns and <b>iconographic</b> elements related to St. Roch.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} Dogmatic {{sarcophagus}} {{in the same}} museum, this sarcophagus {{is one of the}} oldest surviving high-status sarcophagi with elaborate carvings of Christian themes, and a complicated <b>iconographic</b> programme embracing the Old and New Testaments.|$|E
25|$|Abstract: The work is {{dedicated}} {{mostly to the}} <b>iconographic</b> and theological meaning of the scenes, but in an introductory chapter it also offers an overview of previous scholarship and a historical background from which the Hildesheim doors emerged.|$|E
25|$|Abstract: The work {{synthesis}} previous scholarship, {{but without}} references. In {{the description of}} the individual scenes {{the focus is on the}} theological and <b>iconographic</b> connections: the perfection of the creation of man and woman by Christ and his church.|$|E
25|$|In pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, {{evidence}} {{for the practice of}} trephination and an assortment of other cranial deformation techniques comes from a variety of sources, including physical cranial remains of pre-Columbian burials, allusions in <b>iconographic</b> artworks and reports from the post-conquest period.|$|E
25|$|The simple modernist {{design is}} both {{functional}} and <b>iconographic</b> to express its religiosity. From the main portico, the Door of Christ brings {{attention to the}} transcendence of God. It represents the themes of Father, Son and Holy Spirit with iconic imagery.|$|E
25|$|Swastika, {{in various}} <b>iconographic</b> forms, {{is one of}} the hate symbols {{identified}} to be in use as graffiti in the schools of the United States, and {{is a part of the}} 1999 US Department of Education's emergency school-wide response trigger.|$|E
25|$|In {{the more}} recent times of postclassical pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, {{evidence}} {{for the practice of}} trepanation and an assortment of other cranial deformation techniques comes from a variety of sources, including physical cranial remains of burials, allusions in <b>iconographic</b> artworks and reports from the post-colonial period.|$|E
25|$|Indra's weapon, {{which he}} used to kill evil Vritra, is the Vajra or thunderbolt. Other {{alternate}} <b>iconographic</b> symbolism for him includes a bow (sometimes as a colorful rainbow), a sword, a net, a noose, a hook, or a conch. The thunderbolt of Indra is called Bhaudhara.|$|E
25|$|Works of art {{produced}} {{during this period}} are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to <b>iconographic</b> detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.|$|E
