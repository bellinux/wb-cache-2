She decided to experiment with merengue music on the album, saying [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} merengue—that {{was a big part of}} my life, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> it." [...] Merengue is recognized as the national music of the Dominican Republic and the singer travelled to the country to work with Dominican songwriter and record producer El Cata, resulting in songs like [...] "Loca" [...] and [...] "Rabiosa". Shakira said that the recording of the two songs took place in [...] "this tiny studio in the middle of nowhere", and that [...] "it wasn't planned, I was just following my instincts.

6000|$|I {{found little}} to {{interest}} {{me in the}} people who came to the store for they were [...] "just ordinary folk" [...] from Illinois, and Iowa, and I had never been a youth who made acquaintances easily, so with nothing of the politician in me, I seldom inquired after the babies or gossiped with the old women about their health and housekeeping.

60|$|The {{first day}} I {{worked in the}} bowling alley, the barkeeper, {{according}} to custom, called us boys up {{to have a drink}} after we had been setting up pins for several hours. The others asked for beer. I said I'd take ginger ale. The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny. Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me. I had offended the barkeeper. A bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer; and it was up to me, if I wanted to hold my job, to drink beer. Besides, beer was food. I could work better on it. There was no food in ginger ale. After that, when I couldn't sneak out of it, I drank beer and wondered what men found in it that was so good. I was always aware that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> something.|$|E
6000|$|... "That has puzzled {{me a good}} deal. I quite {{saw that}} if I {{disappeared}} suddenly they might take it into their heads that {{something had happened to}} me, and might go to the police office and say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing.</b> But that would not be the worst. Simcoe might guess, when he heard that I had gone without notice and left my things behind me, that I had been put there to watch him. He certainly would not suspect that he could have been overheard, for he must know that it would be quite impossible for any words to be heard through the doors; still, he would be uneasy, and might even have the child moved to some other locality. So I have written a note, which we can talk over when we get in. Of course they may think that I have behaved very badly in throwing them over like this, but it is better that they should do that than they should think there was anything suspicious about it. My wages are due to-morrow; like the girl I succeeded, I was to have eight pounds a year. I have left my box open, so that the mistress can see for herself that there is none of the lodgers' property in it. There are two or three print dresses--I put on my Sunday gown when I came out--and the underclothes are all duly marked Jane Clotworthy." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{arrived at}} last at the clear {{realisation}} that my political associates, and I in my association with them, were oddly narrow, priggish, and unreal, that the Socialists {{with whom we}} were attempting co-operation were preposterously irrelevant to their own theories, that my political life didn't in some way comprehend more than itself, that rather perplexingly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>missing</b> the thing I was seeking. Britten's footnotes to Altiora's self-assertions, her fits of energetic planning, her quarrels and rallies and vanities, his illuminating attacks on Cramptonism and the heavy-spirited triviality of such Liberalism as the Children's Charter, served to point my way to my present conclusions. I {{had been trying to}} deal all along with human progress as something immediate in life, something to be immediately attacked by political parties and groups pointing primarily to that end. I now began to see that just as in my own being there was the rather shallow, rather vulgar, self-seeking careerist, who wore an admirable silk hat and bustled self-consciously through the lobby, and a much greater and indefinitely growing unpublished personality behind him--my hinterland, I have called it--so in human affairs generally the permanent reality is also a hinterland, which is never really immediate, which draws continually upon human experience and influences human action more and more, but which is itself never the actual player upon the stage. It is the unseen dramatist who never takes a call. Now it was just through the fact that our group about the Baileys didn't understand this, that with a sort of frantic energy they were trying to develop that sham expert officialdom of theirs to plan, regulate, and direct the affairs of humanity, that the perplexing note of silliness and shallowness that I had always felt and felt now most acutely under Britten's gibes, came in. They were neglecting human life altogether in social organisation.|$|E
