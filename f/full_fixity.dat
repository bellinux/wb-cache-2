[Rodenbeck, ii. 35: in Anonymous of Hamburg (iv. 241-245) Friedrich's Two Marches, towards {{and from}} Berlin (7th-17th October, to Lubben; thence, 20th October-3d November, to Torgau).] With <b>full</b> <b>fixity</b> of purpose as usual; but with as gloomy an outlook as ever before. Daun, we said, is now arrived in those parts: Daun and the Reich {{together}} are near 100,000; Daun some 60,000,--Loudon having stayed behind, and gone southward, for a stroke on Kosel (if Goltz will permit, which he won't at all!),--and the Reich 35,000. Saxony is all theirs; cannot they maintain Saxony? Not a Town or a Magazine now belongs to Friedrich there, {{and he is}} in number as 1 to 2. [...] "Maintain Saxony; indisputably you can!" [...] that is the express Vienna Order, as Friedrich happens to know. The Russians themselves have taken Camp again, and wait visibly, about Landsberg and the Warta Country, till they see Daun certain of executing said Order; upon which they intend, they also, to winter in those Elbe-Prussian parts, and conjointly to crush Friedrich into great confinement indeed. Friedrich is aware of this Vienna Order; which {{is a kind of}} comfort in the circumstances. The intentions of the hungry Russians, too, are legible to Friedrich; and he is much resolved that said Order shall be impossible to Daun. [...] "Were it to be possible, we are landless. Where are our recruits, our magazines, our resources for a new Campaign? We may as well die, as suffer that to be possible!" [...] Such is Friedrich's fixed view. He says to D'Argens:-- ...|$|E

The dial gauge was checked for proper functioning before it was mounted in the position, and the contact between the dial gauge tip and the frame surface was ensured.

40|$|In the {{hitherto}} developed network-topological {{formulation of}} linear structural analysis each member and each support joint {{was assumed to}} provide <b>full</b> <b>fixity</b> in all directions considered, and all distort ion components In a -member were incorporated In the stiffness or flexibility matrix of the member. In actual structures it is often desirable to prescribe additional conditions on individual force or displacement vector components. In this report, the network formulation is extended so that arbitrary specifications of releases and constraints for both members and joints {{can be incorporated into}} the general formulation without destroying its simplicity and compactness. As a special case of joint releases, a convenient procedure for the treatment of symmetrical and antisymmetrical structures is described. The theory is developed for both the stiffness and flexibility methods; however, only the implementation of the stiffness formulation has' been carried out and is presented herein.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present fatigue-related results {{obtained}} from finite element analyses of a typical riveted railway bridge. The first part of the paper deals with past case studies related to the fatigue assessment of various riveted railway bridges. The second part of the paper presents the results obtained from the finite element analyses of the wrought-iron bridge under typical present-day and assumed historical train loadings. These results are in the form of fatigue damage and associated remaining life estimates of the riveted connections. By fatigue-ranking the connections on an S-N basis and under different detail classifications, the most fatigue-critical connections are identified as being the inner stringer-to-cross-girder connections assuming <b>full</b> rotational connection <b>fixity.</b> Dynamic amplification is shown to affect remaining fatigue life estimates considerably...|$|R
30|$|Nakashima (1992, 1996), Suzuki and Nakashima (1986), Nakashima and Igarashi (1987) studied {{extensively}} the behaviour of shallowly embedded column bases under cyclic loading. They embedded {{the conventional}} exposed column bases in reinforced concrete. They {{found that the}} embedding depth and detailing of the reinforcement around the embedded column base had significant effect on its rigidity, strength and deformation. The deeply embedded column bases, with he ≥ 2 D (where he: embedding depth, D: column width), could guarantee the <b>full</b> <b>fixity</b> of the connections. Recommendations on this embedding depth have been made for different column shapes, Morino et al. (2003). Kohzu et al. (1991), studied very shallow embedded steel column bases under vertical and horizontal loading. The general conclusion of the studies is that the embedding of the base plate improves its seismic behaviour by increasing the strength and ductility. The degree of {{the improvement of the}} behaviour depends on parameters such as the depth and details of the embedding reinforcement. Recommendations have also been given for wide-flange profiles with embedding depth ranging from 1 D to 2 D, Pertold et al. (2000 a, b).|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{study was}} done on the {{macroscopic}} effects on a frame's behavior when cladding panels are structurally incorporated into the analysis. The following is {{a report on the}} effects of cladding panels on the natural vibration frequencies of a structural frame. The microscopic effects of the panel's inclusion, i. e. the stresses internal to the panel itself, are not studied. A two story, one bay frame with a single cladding panel at mid-height was used throughout the analysis. The cladding panel was represented by five different models; 4 noded, 16 DOF (degrees-of-freedom) rectangular finite element, 4 noded, 12 DOF rectangular finite element, 4 and 8 noded quadrilateral plane stress elements with only two translational DOF at each node, and an analogous frame model. To analyze the effect of discretization on the results with each model, the cladding panel was subdivided into meshes varying from 1 to 16 elements. The results of each model with the various meshes were compared. Frame behavior as a function of panel height was also studied. Ratios of panel height to story height of 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % were used. The degree of fixity of the elements connecting the panel to the frame varied from a pinned connection to <b>full</b> <b>fixity.</b> The data indicates that incorporation of cladding panels results in a dramatic reduction in a structure's natural periods of vibration...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study is}} carried out on several aspects of the dynamic response of liquid containing, cylindrical steel tanks that may experience partial uplifting of their base during intense ground shaking. The tanks are presumed to rest on a rigid base and {{to be subjected to}} unidirectional horizontal ground motion. The objective is to formulate a method of analysis with which the dynamic response of such systems may be evaluated reliably and cost-effectively. The study consists of two parts: the first deals with the static uplifting resistance of the flexible base plate, and the second deals with the dynamic response of the uplifting system. In Chapters 2 and 3, an insight into the behavior of the uplifting plate is gained {{with the help of a}} prismatic beam solution. In Chapter 2, the solution is implemented 'exactly' whereas, in Chapter 3 it is implemented approximately by use of the Ritz energy procedure with a set of judiciously selected deflection shape functions. In Chapter 4, the 'exact' solution of the axisymmetrically uplifted plate is obtained. A detailed comparison is then made between the plate and the beam solutions in order to ascertain the suitability of the beam model for the plate analysis. The insight gained from this comparison is then utilized in the formulation of an approximate method of analysis for the solution of an asymmetrically uplifted plate. In obtaining the beam and plate solutions, due consideration is given to the effects of membrane forces associated with large deflections, plastic yielding in the base plate, and the restraining action of the tank wall at the plate boundary. In Chapter 5, an approximate method of analysis is formulated for efficiently computing the seismic response of uplifting tanks. Both unanchored tanks and partially anchored tanks for which the number of anchor bolts at the base is insufficient to ensure <b>full</b> <b>fixity</b> are considered. The responses examined include the hydrodynamic pressures, the base uplift at critical locations, the plastic rotation at the plate-shell junction, and the maximum compressive stress in the tank wall. The parameters that are varied include the intensity of ground shaking, the geometric and material properties of the tank, and the degree of base fixity...|$|E
