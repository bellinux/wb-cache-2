50|$|Concerns about {{chemicals}} ingested {{by children}} when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission {{to order a}} temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of {{which is based on}} an opinion by the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) “in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children”. Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including Musk Xylene, MDA, <b>HBCDD,</b> DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015.|$|E

A broad suite of EFRs and legacy flame retardants (FRs) including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (<b>HBCDDs)</b> were determined in indoor air and dust taken from offices and homes in Birmingham, UK. Comparison with previous data, suggests that temporal trends in contamination with EFRs and legacy FRs reflect changes in production and use of such compounds as a result of bans and restrictions on the use of legacy FRs. Using inter alia a simple, single compartment, steady state pharmacokinetic model, human exposure to FRs via air inhalation, dust ingestion and diet was estimated for different age groups and the relative importance of each exposure route to overall exposure assessed under different exposure scenarios. Concentrations of target EFRs were detected for the first time in UK human milk samples (n= 35).

40|$|The {{brominated}} {{flame retardant}} hexabromocyclododecane (<b>HBCDD)</b> was added to Annex A {{of the list of}} persistent organic pollutants (POPs) of the Stockholm Convention. Thus, production and use of <b>HBCDD</b> will be banned, and the recycling of HBCDD-containing foam waste will be restricted. In reaction a special polymeric {{brominated flame retardant}} (PolyFR) was developed to replace <b>HBCDD</b> in expanded and extruded polystyrene foams for building and construction applications. A decision has to be made at some future time whether expanded and extruded polystyrene foam waste is to be subjected to incineration (with <b>HBCDD)</b> or to recycling (without <b>HBCDD).</b> Therefore, an appropriate and rapid field method is required to distinguish between foams containing <b>HBCDD</b> and foams free from <b>HBCDD.</b> Here we present a screening method for identifying <b>HBCDD</b> containing expanded and extruded polystyrene foams.

40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are toxic chemicals {{that can be}} found in various matrices in all corners of the planet, including remote areas such as the Arctic.   Several POPs are known and monitored but given the abundance of new chemicals in commerce about which little is known, chemicals that may be new POPs are constantly being screened for. The use of flame retardants, particularly brominated flame retardants (BFRs), has been increasing for decades.  PBDEs and <b>HBCDDs</b> are two types of BFRs that have historically been used in large volumes but recently faced legislative restrictions.  However, in order to meet fire safety standards, these BFRs have been replaced by a variety of emerging flame retardants (EFRs) about which little is known especially concerning their toxicity, production volumes, and environmental behavior. The main purpose of this thesis was to investigate the occurrence and fate in indoor and outdoor environments of several EFRs and compare them with PBDEs, <b>HBCDDs,</b> and legacy POPs. Several indoor environments in the city of Stockholm, Sweden were sampled for dust, indoor air, and ventilation system air (Paper II).   Results from these samples revealed a number of EFRs that humans are exposed to and that are emitted from buildings through ventilation systems. These included DDC-CO, DBE-DBCH, PBT, HBB, EHTBB, and BEH-TEBP. PBDE levels seem to be declining compared to previous studies in Stockholm.   Outdoor air and soil were sampled across transects of Stockholm (Paper II) and Birmingham, United Kingdom (Paper III).   Results from these samples showed the presence of many of the same EFRs in the outdoor environment that were found in indoor environments.   Urban pulses in air were discovered for PBDEs in both cities and for some EFRs in Stockholm, indicating that the cities are sources of EFRs to the outdoor environment.   Atmospheric deposition samples were taken at two sites in northern Sweden (Paper I).   Three EFRs (DDC-CO, DBE-DBCH, and BTBPE) and two current-use pesticides (trifluralin and chlorothalonil) were identified, indicating these compounds’ potential for long range transport and global contamination.   Other legacy POPs such as HCH, PCBs, and PBDEs were measured in the deposition samples as well.   The bulk of deposition was comprised of HCH and PCBs with only minor contributions from PBDEs, chlordanes, and emerging compounds.   Finally, passive and active air sampling methods were compared for BFRs in offices in Beijing, China.   Some EFRs were identified in indoor air from China; however, BDE- 209 was the most predominant compound found (Paper IV).   Air samples collected with passive samplers generally had measured FR concentrations within a factor of 2 - 3 of those collected with active samplers. The use of a GFF in the passive samplers resulted in concentrations of particle-bound contaminants such as BDE- 209 that were more comparable to those in active samples. The positioning of the PUF in the passive samplers affected the sampling rates for gaseous compounds and particle retention on PUFs was shown to be a large source of uncertainty in passive sampling.

Median concentrations of total hexabromocyclododecanes (ΣHBCDDs) from soils from the UK (n =  24) were 0. 73  ng g− 1 dry weight (range   0. 05) from those of HBCDDs; thereby underlining {{the extent to which}} HBCDDs have migrated into the UK environment. Moreover, PCB concentrations in this study are not markedly lower than those recorded in UK soils sampled in the mid- 1980 s indicating that the initial rapid decline in UK contamination with PCBs following bans on their manufacture and use, has not been maintained. Degradation products of HBCDD: pentabromocyclododecenes (PBCDs) and tetrabromocyclododecadienes (TBCDs) were detected in some UK soil samples with semi-quantitative concentrations ranging between 0. 01 and 7. 3  ng g− 1 for ΣPBCDs and 0. 01 – 1. 3  ng g− 1 for ΣTBCDs. In Australian soils only ΣTBCDs were detected at concentrations ranging from 0. 0023 to 0. 45  ng g− 1. Chiral signatures of HBCDDs were racemic or non-racemic in all samples indicating minimal edaphic enantioselective degradation. A horizontal transect at the most contaminated UK location (a suburban garden) revealed a marked decrease in concentrations of HBCDDs with increasing distance from buildings...|$|E

Eight neutral OHCs were analyzed: one polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB: CB- 153), 4, 4 '-DDE, five polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs: BDE- 47, BDE- 99, BDE- 100, BDE- 153, and BDE- 154), and hexabromocyclododecane (<b>HBCDD).</b> Five phenolic OHCs were analyzed: three hydroxylated PCBs (40 H-CB- 107, 40 H-CB- 146, and 40 H-CB- 187), one hydroxylated PBDE (60 H-BDE- 47), and pentachlorophenol (PCP). All OHCs, except 60 H-BDE- 47, were present in maternal and cord serum. The historically identified OHCs showed the highest concentration: 4, 4 ′'-DDE (median value 89 ng/g lipid in maternal serum and 68 ng/g lipid in cord serum) and PCP (median value 970 pg/g serum in maternal serum and 1500 pg/g serum in cord serum). <b>HBCDD</b> and the PBDEs were present atmuchlowerconcentrations.

40|$|AbstractThis study collates and synthesises UK data on {{environmental}} levels of POP-BFRs published between 1999 and March 2015. Target POP-BFRs are: the {{polybrominated diphenyl ether}} (PBDE) formulations Penta-BDE, Octa-BDE, and Deca-BDE (the latter as a candidate Stockholm Convention POP), as well as hexabromocyclododecane (<b>HBCDD).</b> Environmental compartments covered include: sediments (freshwater and marine), atmospheric deposition (both measured directly and inferred from sediment core data), soil, herbage, outdoor air, indoor air, indoor dust, freshwater (rivers and lakes), human tissues (blood serum and milk), wildlife, and the human diet. Temporal trends in contamination were examined for evidence of environmental responses to regulatory and voluntary actions banning/restricting the manufacture and use of POP-BFRs. Good evidence exists that – with some exceptions – concentrations of Penta-BDE congeners like BDEs- 47 and 99 have responded well to the use restrictions introduced in the mid- 2000 s. However, it appears that human body burdens of these contaminants {{do not appear to}} have responded in a similar way, as levels in UK human milk in 2010 – 2012, are not discernibly different to those reported in 2002 – 03. The evidence for <b>HBCDD</b> and BDEs- 183 and 209 is less abundant, but signs exist that absolute concentrations of BDE- 183 are falling in the UK environment. With respect to BDE- 209, evidence from analysis of lake sediment core and UK diet samples, suggests that levels have yet to respond discernibly to the more recent curbs on manufacture and use of Deca-BDE. The limited evidence for <b>HBCDD</b> is strongly consistent with a declining trend in environmental contamination with this chemical. Broadly, examination of the UK database in an international context, suggests UK levels are generally within the range of those found in other industrialised countries. Interestingly, while UK concentrations of BDE- 209 in abiotic matrices such as indoor dust, are at the high end of those reported globally; concentrations in UK human milk are amongst the lowest reported to date. This suggests that the bioavailability of BDE- 209 from indoor dust is likely very low. An environmental budget was estimated for the UK burden of POP-BFRs. As with previous comparable exercises for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated dioxins, the majority (> 90 %) of the UK burden of POP-BFRs resides in soil. Moreover, the POP-BFR burden identifiable as present in the UK environment is much lower than data on production and use of POP-BFRs in Europe. This may be explained by POP-BFRs: (a) undergoing environmental transport away from the UK; (b) undergoing environmental degradation; (c) remaining in use; and (d) entering the waste stream. While the UK database appears relatively strong for some environmental compartments and POP-BFRs – e. g. BDEs- 47 and - 99 are well-characterised in the human diet, indoor air/dust, and human milk – substantial gaps exist for BDE- 209 and <b>HBCDD</b> in air (indoor and outdoor), herbage, and soil...|$|E

Azodyes, 3, 3 ′-dimethoxybenzidine, 4 -aminobenzidine, p-cresidine, and allergenic and carcinogenic dyes were detected in textiles [30, 31]. Heavy metals such as chromium III, chromium VI, tin, cadmium, nickel, lead, and antimony were measured in textiles [30, 31]. <b>HBCDD</b> was detected in textiles [31] and in packaging [19]. TBTO and various fluorinated compounds were found in textiles [31]. Phthalates were found in textiles [30, 31] and in various plastic articles [21].

40|$|The Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety) Regulations 1988 is {{the major}} driver {{for the use of}} {{chemical}} flame retardants (FRs) in soft furnishings marketed in the UK. While these regulations specify the level of flame retardancy required, they do not specify how such levels should be achieved. Consequently, it remains unclear which FRs are present in UK soft furnishings. This is important not only to help assess what FRs we may be exposed to currently, but which FRs are currently entering the waste stream with concomitant potential for release into the environment. To address this data gap, concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (<b>HBCDD)</b> and a range of chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were measured in samples of domestic and office waste soft furnishings products entering the UK waste stream in 2011 and 2012. This preliminary study measured the FR content of: carpets (n = 4), curtains (n = 7), mattress fabrics (n = 2), furniture foam (n = 9), and furniture upholstery textiles (n = 10). Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (<b>HBCDD)</b> were not found at significant concentrations (below detection limits in most samples) in any of the twenty two analysed products. In contrast, 7 of the 9 furniture foam samples were treated with tris(2 -chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) at a mean concentration of 1. 9 % w/w, with another single foam sample containing tris(1, 3 -dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) at 1. 1 and 0. 5 % respectively. By comparison, PBDE concentrations are within the range reported previously for UK indoor dust [18], rather than the percent by weight levels required to impart flame retardancy...|$|E

40|$|The report summarises the {{monitoring}} activities within the National Swedish Contaminant Programme in marine biota. Time series of analysed contaminants (heavy metals, organochlorines, brominated flame retardants, perfluorinated substances and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in biota are presented together with summaries {{of the results}} from the statistical analyses. The data represent the bioavailable portion of the investigated contaminants i. e. the portion that has effectively passed through biological membranes and may cause toxic effects. The report does not in general give background or explanations to significant changes found in the time series. Thus, increasing concentrations highlight the need for intensified studies. - There was no general trend in heavy metal concentrations except for lead that is generally decreasing over the study period (in time series of sufficient length), supposedly due to the elimination of lead in gasoline. - Generally, decreasing concentrations were observed for organochlorines (DDT’s, PCB’s, HCH’s, HCB), also including TCDD-equivalents over the whole study period, but not during the last decades. The chlorinated compounds generally show higher concentrations in the Bothnian Sea and/or Baltic Proper when compared to the Bothnian Bay and the Swedish west coast. - Increasing trends of brominated flame retardants in guillemot eggs from late 1960 s until early 1990 s for polybrominated diphenyl ethers such as BDE- 47, - 99 and - 100 and until mid- 2000 s for <b>HBCDD,</b> but with decreasing concentrations during the more recent time period.
