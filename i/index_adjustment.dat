40|$|A new {{technique}} of modulation <b>index</b> <b>adjustment</b> for pure wavelength modulation spectroscopy second harmonic signal waveforms recovery is presented. As the modulation index {{is a key}} parameter in determining the exact form of the signals generated by the technique of wavelength modulation spectroscopy, the method of modulation <b>index</b> <b>adjustment</b> is applied to recover the second harmonic signal with wavelength modulation spectroscopy. By comparing the measured profile with the theoretical profile by calculation, {{the relationship between the}} modulation index and average quantities of the scanning wavelength can be obtained. Furthermore, when the relationship is applied in the experimental setup by point-by-point modulation index modification for gas detection, the results show good agreement with the theoretical profile and signal waveform distortion (such as the amplitude modulation effect caused by diode laser) can be suppressed. Besides, the method of modulation <b>index</b> <b>adjustment</b> can be used in many other aspects which involve profile improvement. In practical applications, when the amplitude modulation effect can be neglected and the stability of the detection system is limited by the sampling rate of analog-to-digital, modulation <b>index</b> <b>adjustment</b> can be used to improve detection into softer inflection points and solve the insufficient sampling problem. As a result, measurement stability is improved by 40 %...|$|E

The purpose was to use the bioelectrical vector analysis (BIVA) as a tool to adjust the intensity of ultrafiltration and achievement of dry weight in HD patients. We performed monthly measurements of bioimpedance in 24 HD patients pre-and post-dialysis for four months. We plotted the patient´s vectors in the RXc graph in order to meet individually hydration status and adjust the dry weight.

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the dietary patterns of Iranian adults and examine its association with metabolic syndrome. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 973 persons were selected using multi-stage cluster, random sampling method in Khorramabad city. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated, 168 food-item, self-administrated, and semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). To identify the dietary patterns, factor analysis was used for principal components. Results: Three major dietary patterns were identified: the western dietary pattern (WDP), the healthy dietary pattern (HDP), and the traditional dietary pattern (TDP). Participants in the highest quintile of HDP had lower odds of MetS (OR: 0. 45; 95 % CI: 0. 27 - 0. 77) than those in the lowest quintile, whereas those in the highest quintile of the WDP score had greater odds of the MetS (OR: 3. 44; 95 % CI: 2. 08 - 5. 70) than participants of the lowest quintile. Multi linear regression showed that the WDP score was associated negatively with serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and positively with other components of MetS.

To investigate the relationship between circulating FGF- 23 levels and the response of forearm blood flow to ischemia (flow-mediated vasodilatation, FMD) and nitroglycerin, we tested 183 patients with stage 3 – 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). None of them had cardiovascular complications or were taking drugs interfering with vascular function. Patients with FGF- 23 levels above the median had significantly lower glomerular filtration rate, FMD, and fetuin-A levels (an anti-inflammatory molecule and potent inhibitor of calcification). They also had higher proteinuria and phosphate levels when compared to patients whose FGF- 23 levels were below the median. The response to nitroglycerin was not different between the two groups.

The {{relative importance of}} genetic and environmental factors in these associations is unclear. We examined the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences to the association between blood pressure and serum lipids in 75 pairs of female twins using path analysis and maximum-likelihood model fitting. Associations between systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol (r = 0. 44, P < 0. 001), and LDL-C (r = 0. 38, P < 0. 001), but not HDL-C (r = 0. 05, N.

The remaining variance was explained by age and/or unique environmental influences. Using bivariate models, we demonstrated genetic (P = 0. 017) and unique environmental covariance (P = 0. 011) of cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. Significant genetic covariance (P = 0. 038) was observed between LDL-C and systolic blood pressure. The association between blood pressure and total cholesterol in these twins results from shared genetic and similar unique environmental influences. The association between LDL-C and blood pressure {{is partly due to}} shared genetic influences. We conclude that both additive genetic and environmental factors unique to the individual are important determinants of the relationships between serum lipids and blood pressure...|$|E

Design: This was a retrospective cohort study. Setting: Male pupils who attended a single school in Southern England were part of the study. Participants: Participants in the study were a cohort of 1028 men born between 1927 and 1956 with anthropometric measures between 9 and 18 yr and adulthood serum IGF levels. Main Outcome Measure: The study measured serum IGF-I and IGF binding protein- 3 at mean age 63 yr. Results: Age at peak height velocity (APHV) was inversely associated with adult IGF-I levels. IGF-I decreased by 3. 7 ng/ml (95 % confidence interval 1. 0 - 6. 4, P = 3 D 0. 007) for each SD increase in APHV.

40|$|Aims.   To {{determine}} the influence of breastfeeding on overweight and obesity, as determined by body mass index in early adulthood. Background.   Obesity is a contemporary epidemic and linked to increased risk of later cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The success of long-term treatment is modest. Protective factors, such as potentially, and breastfeeding, are few and very important. There are uncertainties as to whether breastfeeding has a protective effect, especially in adults, or whether it is a reflection of other markers of obesity that are more linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk. Some studies suggest that breastfeeding is protective in later life for cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Design.   Epidemiological analysis of longitudinal data set. Methods.   We collected data about breastfeeding duration, body mass index of children at 21 years and confounding variables from an ongoing longitudinal study of a singleton birth cohort of 7223 children in Brisbane. We assessed the duration of breastfeeding at six months and prevalence of overweight and obesity at 21 years by body mass <b>index.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> for potential confounders was by multivariable multinomial logistic regression.

This study examines health risks associated specifically with hip circumference in a cohort of Swedish women, to determine whether information may be lost by excluding the hip circumference from health surveys. Research Methods and Procedures: The subjects described in this report constitute a population-based sample of 38 -to 60 -year-old women who underwent anthropometric examinations in 1968. The 24 -year incidence rates have been ascertained for myocardial infarction, combined cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. All-cause, cardiovascular, and myocardial infarction mortality also were evaluated. Results: Hip circumference was a significant independent inverse risk estimator for all endpoints studied.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the meanings and the problems of Reformed Pension Scheme in Sweden by making clear the features of the present pension systems. The present Swedish pension systems - the National Basic Pension and the National Supplementary Pension Scheme - were established a generation ago with the introduction of the Supplementary Pension Scheme in 1960. The pluralistic dynamism has brought the present pension systems in Sweden into the instability, the inequity, the distortion and the dualism. In 1990 the Commission presented the findings and proposals of the systems. Many considered that more far-reaching changes were necessary than those proposed by the Commission. The Working Group on Pension was therefor set up. In 1994, the bill containing guidelines for the reformed system was submitted to the Swedish Parliament. Parliament decided that these guidelines should form the basis for future reform. The features of the pension reform in Sweden have been formulated in following way: it is worthy of special mention to resume the contribution-payment of the employees and to take away financial difficulties by introducing the lifetime earning principle, the income <b>index</b> <b>adjustment,</b> the defined contribution scheme, and the coefficient of the average life expectancy. In this sense Sweden can obtain excellent results of the pension reform in 1998. But instead of the contribution-payment of the employees, the Swedish neo-corporatism guaranteed a wage increase, and can't lighten the burden of the employers. LO has gotten the advantage over the employers in the pluralistic society...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{measure the}} {{economic}} burden of cerebral palsy (CP) in China {{is to provide}} information on CP's societal impacts to policy-makers. Methods The economic burden of CP includes direct healthcare costs, direct non-healthcare costs, developmental costs and indirect costs such as productivity loss. The incidence approach is employed to estimate the lifetime economic burden of a new CP birth and that of all new cases in China in 2003. Caregivers of 319 CP patients were interviewed in specialty hospitals in five cities in 2004. Average expenditure and utilization rates for different services by age groups from this sample were obtained to estimate the economic burden of CP. Chinese CP patients' life expectancy and survival rate were simulated with reference to Australian data with Human Development <b>Index</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Results From the societal perspective, the average lifetime economic burden of a new CP case in China was US$ 67, 044 in 2003, and the life-span total economic loss due to all new CP cases in 2003 amounted to US$ 2 - 4 billion. Indirect (productivity) costs are responsible for 93 % of total economic loss, and direct healthcare and developmental costs make up 3 % each. There are several factors which contribute to the extraordinarily high economic burden of CP, including productivity loss, reduced life expectancy, dependency, progressive deterioration of motor physical function, and recurrent use of rehabilitation services. Conclusion The economic burden of CP in China is substantial for {{the family of a}} CP patient, as well as to society.

Levels of circulating IgM immune complexes were elevated (above the 95 % normal control range) in 10 (17 %) of 58 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, which was {{not significantly different from}} the normal controls or from dystrophy controls (by Mann Whitney U test). Levels of IgG complexes were only increased in 10 % of patients. Lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A (Con A), assessed by increase in 3 H-thymidine incorporation, did not differ between 14 patients and 18 normal subjects. The proliferative response to Coxsackie B virus antigen did not differ between chronic fatigue patients and normal subjects when expressed either as an increase in counts or as a stimulation <b>index.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> of the counts in relation to the proliferation response to Con A, as an indication of the overall proliferative response of the cell preparation, did not reveal any hidden difference. IgM antibodies to Coxsackie B viruses were not found in any of 20 patients and in 1 of 20 dystrophy controls. Significant levels of neutralizing antibodies to Coxsackie B viruses 1 - 5 were found in 6 out of 19 (32 %) patients compared with 4 out of 17 (24 %) dystrophy controls, which does not differ from currently expected normal incidence. Antibody titres to other respiratory viruses were also not notably different between the patient and control groups. In conclusion we can find no evidence for a definable viral aetiology for the chronic fatigue syndrome, neither in terms of a persistent infection nor an altered ability to respond to virus...|$|E
50|$|The base {{value for}} the index was 1404.60 points on base date December 31, 1980, when it had a total market {{capitalization}} of $1,404.596 billion. On that date, each one-index-point change in the index was equal to $1 billion. However, <b>index</b> divisor <b>adjustments</b> due to corporate actions and index composition changes have changed the relationship over time, so that by 2005 each index point reflected a change of about $1.2 billion in the index’s total market capitalization.|$|R
40|$|Prolactin (PRL) has {{roles in}} various {{physiological}} functions. Although experimental {{studies showed that}} PRL has both beneficial and adverse effects on type 2 diabetes mellitus, clinical findings in subjects with hyperprolactinemia indicate adverse effects on glucose metabolism. However, effects of PRL within the physiological range in human are controversial. A population-based study of 370 Japanese men enrolled in the 2014 Iwaki study (aged 52. 0 ± 14. 8 years). In this cross-sectional study, associations between serum PRL levels and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) indices representing glucose metabolism in a physiological setting were examined using multivariable regression analysis. Although univariate linear regression analyses showed significant associations between serum PRL levels and HOMA <b>indices,</b> <b>adjustment</b> with multiple factors made the association with HOMA-ß (insulin secretion) insignificant, while those with HOMA-R (insulin resistance) remained significant (ß = 0. 084, p = 0. 035). Non-linear regression analyses showed a regression curve with a peak at serum PRL level, 12. 4 ng/mL and a positive association of serum PRL level with HOMA-R below the peak (ß = 0. 119, p = 0. 004). Higher serum PRL levels within the physiological range seem {{to be associated with}} insulin resistance in men...|$|R
