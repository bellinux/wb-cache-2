A neural network model based on the training of a black box model with experimental data was developed as a method based on experimental results predicting the state conditions of air at the process and regeneration stream. The model development was followed by a Sensitivity Analysis performed on these predicted results. The key parameters were the thermodynamic condition of process and regeneration air streams, the sensible heat factor of the room, and the mass air flow ratio of the regeneration and process streams. The results of this analysis revealed that all investigated parameters influenced the performance of the desiccant unit.

Solar-powered cooling is one of the technologies which allows to obtain, by using the renewable solar source, an important energy saving compared to traditional <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> plants. The paper describes different technical installations for solar cooling, their way of operation, advantages and limits. The objective of the present study has been to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of solar absorption cooling systems, designed for two different application fields: <b>industrial</b> refrigeration and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning.</b> The possibility to replace or integrate the existing plants is studied, by considering the refrigeration requirements of a company, which works in meat manufacturing, and the heating and cooling demands of a hotel located in a tourist town in Italy. In the first case, the system comprises an absorption chiller coupled to solar flat plate collectors, whereas the second application is about a hybrid trigeneration plant, known as thermo-solar trigeneration; this option allows having greater operational flexibility at sites with demand for energy in the form of heating as well as cooling, for example in a hotel. In this way the authors could compare different results obtained by a technical and economic experimental analysis based on existing users and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages in order to suggest the best solution for the two studied cases.

Therefore, standards have to be met in buildings just as for the other room features light, climate and air quality. While energy-saving lamps and energy-efficient air conditioning systems are obvious considerable reserves still exist in the sound-absorbing components. They are obstacles to the air transport and the effort to over-come this resistance has to be provided in terms of energy by increased power of fans. Thus, in its optimized configuration lies potential for energy savings while improving the acoustic quality. The article analyzes the acoustic boundary conditions taking into account the effects of energetic consequences in the use of silencers. Solutions for their design will be presented and demonstrated with examples of achievable energy savings. As a kind of a flagship project serves a painting facility: Only through the exchange of conventional by innovative silencers in a large <b>industrial</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system it was possible to reduce both noise pollution and to achieve an annual energy savings worth more than 500 000 Euro. In this way, innovative silencers link high, appropriate attenuation effects to low flow resistance, ex-pressed by the pressure loss.

40|$|For {{industrial}} complexes artificial microclimate (ICAM) {{proposed a}} methodology {{to develop a}} comprehensive mathematical model of <b>industrial</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{in the space of}} a condition that involves the analysis of the structure of an automatic control system (ACS) and the development of appropriate control algorithms. On the basis of the developed methodology received a comprehensive model for technological schemes of industrial air conditioners as a single multidimensional control object. For the proposed methods use dynamic models of climatic equipment in the space of States. For the General model ICAM presents matrices that define a comprehensive model of industrial air conditioner with a steam humidifier. The algorithm of synthesis of multidimensional linear-quadratic digital controller (LQDC) for ICAM developed. The problem of synthesis of optimal LQDC considered and synthesized matrix feedback LQDC, which the state parameters of the control object determines the trajectory of the vector of optimal exposure that minimizes the quadratic criterion. From the classical procedure of synthesis LQDC the proposed algorithm is characterized by the presence of the logical selection of accessories for optimal control. This approach allows us to rethink the synthesis of ACS, as air conditioning is based on the separation of the mutual impact of the regulatory options. This allows you to transfer the control system is conditioned to a qualitatively new level and ensures the efficient use of energy for artificial microclimate systems. The obtained formulas are recommended experts on design automation of control systems and optimization of existing ones. ??? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} concern about energy savings {{in recent years the}} Japan Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) revised the {{performance}} rating of <b>industrial</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems in October, 2006. The coefficient of performance (COP), the conventional factor, does not consider the actual operation of air conditioning systems corresponding to seasonal temperature changes. Instead it is evaluated under constant temperature conditions. In actual operation, the capacity and power consumption of cooling and heating varies according to outside air temperatures. As a result, the annual performance factor (APF) was adopted as the new criteria to evaluate energy savings performance. Under this method, model cases were designed in order to conduct proper evaluations that are approximately equal to real operation. Factors were estimated by calculations of annual total energy consumption and thermal building load. As the efficiency characteristics of the APF and COP are respectively indicated, calculation of conversion factors became necessary in order to compare their energy saving capabilities. In this study, the energy consumption and its characteristics of the APF and COP machines were calculated using the annual operating data of electric driven heat pumps (EHP) under equivalent load conditions. Effective efficiency was defined as a parameter to estimate conversion factors as follows: Effective efficiency = Annual generated heat amount / Annual energy consumption Using these conversion factors, the performance of machines can be easily compared when evaluation standards change. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to gas engine driven heat pumps (GHP) ...|$|E

The {{aim is to}} provide a more comprehensive framework of the buyer’s behavioral response in the business to business context by integrating both trust elements and industrial brand attributes (brand performance and industrial brand image). In addition, the study explores the mediation effects of trust and brand attributes on industrial buyers’ responses such as loyalty and long-term commitment. Design/methodology/approach (mandatory) Using a survey approach, the study includes respondents working in the HVAC industry in Malaysia, and data are collected in the <b>industrial</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> segment. The research model was tested with SEM. Findings (mandatory) Findings show that brand performance and industrial brand image directly affect brand trust but with different effects on buyers’ commitment and loyalty. Interestingly, industrial brand image only mediates the responses via brand trust, while brand performance has a direct effect. Thus, both brand performance and industrial brand image build buyer trust. But in this context, it is brand performance rather than industrial brand image that influences long-term commitment and loyalty. The study concludes that in the HVAC industry, brand performance, industrial brand image, buyer trust, industrial loyalty, and commitment build brand equity. Originality/value (mandatory) Significant research reveals that, in business-to-business contexts, brand equity depends on the supplier’s brand trust and attributes of the brand such as brand image and brand performance. While useful in guiding a supplier’s or industry’s brand strategy, the study of both brand trust and brand attributes has led to only a partial explanation of the supplier’s or industry’s brand equity. The present research explores industrial brand equity, focusing on tangible assets (performance) and intangible assets (brand image), and their joint consequences...|$|E

Achieving stagnation temperatures exceeding 200 [*]°C, pertinent to these technologies, with unconcentrated sunlight requires spectrally selective absorbers with exceptionally low emissivity in the thermal wavelength range and high visible absorptivity for the solar spectrum.
