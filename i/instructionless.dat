40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 PUPS {{learning}} mechanisms {{center around}} {{the representation of}} causal relationships between objects or events. These learning mechanisms involve (1) a set of principles for inducing causal relationships in absence of a domain theory; (2) a set of analogical mechanisms for extrapolating the causal analysis of one situation in order to predict or problem solve in another situation; and (3) compilation procedures for turning these extrapolations into general production rules. These learning mechanisms are illustrated {{with respect to a}} detailed example from the algebra tutor where they {{do a good job of}} reproducing the <b>instructionless</b> learning we observe of students. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|Educational {{laboratory}} exercises cover a {{wide spectrum}} ranging from programmed and highly structured tasks to discovery-learning-based and unstructured experiences. In structured or directinstruction-based exercises, students are given lists of materials, step-by-step procedures, and often specific results to calculate. In unstructured or discovery-learning-based exercises, students are given an outline of steps and measurements (guided-inquiry-based instruction), or perhaps {{no more than a}} statement of goals (inquiry-based instruction). In the past 20 years, there has been a movement in science teaching – Chemistry, Biology, and Physics – toward inquiry-based instruction, also called discovery learning [1, 2, 3]. Tinnesand and Chan make a good case for a discovery-learning approach in their artfully titled article: “Step 1 : Throw Out the Instructions” [4]. “Before we tried <b>instructionless</b> labs, we assumed that the students couldn’t devise their own procedures [...] Much to our surprise the students show considerable skill in designing their own labs. ” (From Tinnesand and Chan [4]) 1 Discovery-learning-based instruction has been shown to help develop abstract reasoning [2], enhance two-year retention of concepts, and improve student’s attitude toward the subject matte...|$|E
