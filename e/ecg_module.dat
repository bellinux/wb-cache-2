For discussion will be divided into two discussions, one is about the making of EMG hardware and software modules. In making a module that uses EMG signals derived from muscle. The signals were detected on the skin surface is very low at the millivolt range, so that should also be strengthened several times. Characteristics of the EMG signal has a frequency range between 20 Hz - 500 Hz and voltage range between 0. 4 mV to 5 mV. In addition, EMG has a character unlike the ECG signal {{in the form of a}} wave pattern, but this signal is random and very messy, so take a few kinds of filters such as notch filter circuit with cut-off frequency of 50 Hz, Low Pass Filter with cutoff frequency of 500 Hz, and High Pass Filter 20 Hz, to filter the noise carried by reinforcement signals. So that the resulting EMG signal from this circuit a more perfect without the noise interference. Then the ADC converts the signal into digital data.

A total of 30 subjects {{used in this}} study were obtained from a non-invasive measurement called the Revitus <b>ECG</b> <b>module.</b> Each subject performed six physiological activities which are walking, going upstairs, going downstairs, natural gait, lying with position changed and resting while watching TV. Unique features were extracted in these different physiological conditions from the same subject using normalized QRS complex technique. One physiological activity acts as the enrolment template while the remaining five activities represent the recognition data. Cross correlation was used to measure the similarity between activities. Later, Multilayer Perceptron classifier was applied to evaluate the distinctiveness between subjects. The results of the experiment show that QRS complexes in different activities from the same subject were strongly correlated to each other by obtaining correlation values of more than 0. 9.

40|$|PURPOSE: : To {{assess the}} {{validity}} and the reliability of short-term resting heart-rate variability (HRV) measures obtained using the Polar S 810 heart-rate monitor and accompanying software. METHODS: : Measures of HRV were obtained from 5 -min R to R wave (RR) interval data for 19 males and 14 females during 10 min of quiet rest on three separate occasions at 1 -wk intervals using the Polar S 810. Criterion measures of HRV were obtained simultaneously using the CardioPerfect (CP; Medical Graphics Corporation, St Paul, MN) 12 -lead <b>ECG</b> <b>module.</b> Measures of validity of the Polar S 810 were estimated by regression analysis, and measures of reliability of both devices were estimated by analysis of change scores. Measures of the SD of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and the low-frequency (LF) and the high-frequency (HF) spectral power and their ratio (LF/HF) were analyzed after log transformation, whereas mean RR and LF and HF in normalized units were analyzed without transformation. RESULTS: : There were marginal differences between the Polar and the CP mean measures of HRV, and the uncertainty in the differences was small. The Polar S 810 demonstrated high correlations (0. 85 - 0. 99) with CP for all measures of HRV indicating good to near-perfect validity. Except for the low- and the high-frequency normalized units, Polar S 810 did not add any substantial technical error to the within-subject variability in the repeated measurements of HRV. CONCLUSION: : HRV measures obtained with the Polar S 810 and accompanying software have no appreciable bias or additional random error in comparison with criterion measures, but the measures are inherently unreliable over a 1 -wk interval. Reliability of HRV from longer (e. g., 10 min) and/or consecutive 5 -min RR recordings needs to be investigated with the Polar and criterion instruments...|$|E
40|$|Long interruptions of {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) {{in case of}} a sudden cardiac arrest result in higher failure rate of resuscitation. The current work concerns the filtering of the chest compression (CC) artefacts during CPR, which is essential for the CPR continuation during electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis by automated external defibrillators (AEDs). We have studied two possible approaches - one based on high-pass filter (HPF), and another using band-stop filter (BSF) with adjustable cut-off frequency. The purpose is {{to improve the quality of}} the signal provided to the <b>ECG</b> analysis <b>module,</b> aiming at a reliable decision to Stop CC if VF is present or to Continue CC for all other rhythms, including asystole (ASYS) or 'normal' rhythms with ventricular complexes (NR). The two filters are tested with artificially constructed ECG+CC signals, as well as with real ECGs recorded during CPR. The HPF passes the high-frequency components of the QRS complexes and effectively suppresses CC artefacts. This allows correct recognition of NR and ASYS. However, HPF suppresses the VF amplitude thus compromising the VF detection sensitivity. The BSF is favorable for detection of NR and VF but presents problems for ASYS detection because there are often attending residual high-frequency components belonging to the CC artefacts...|$|R

40|$|Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD) {{leads to}} {{sudden cardiac death}} due to {{irregular}} phenomenon of the cardiac signal by the abnormal case of blood vessel and cardiac structure. For last three decades, there is an enhanced interest in research for cardiac diseases [...] As a result, the death rate by cardiac disease in men has been falling gradually compared with relatively increasing the death rate for women due to CVD. The main reason for this phenomenon {{is due to the}} lack of seriousness to female CVD and different symptoms of female CVD compared with the symptoms of male CVD. Usually, because the CVDs for women accompany with ordinary symptoms not attributable to the heart abnormality signal such as unusual fatigue, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath, anxiety, chest discomfort, and indigestion dyspepsia, most women CVD patients do not realize that these symptoms are actually related to the CVD symptoms. Therefore, periodic ECG signal observation is required not only for women who have been diagnosed with heart disease but also for persons who want to examine their heart activity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to diagnose abnormality of heart. Among the medical checkup methods for CVDs, it is very an effective method for the diagnosis of cardiac disease and the early detection of heart abnormality to monitor ECG periodically. This dissertation proposes an effective ECG monitoring system for woman by attaching the system on woman 2 ̆ 7 s brassiere by using augmented chest lead attachment method. The suggested system called 2 ̆ 2 E-Bra system 2 ̆ 2 in this dissertation consists of an ECG transmission system and a computer installed program called 2 ̆ 2 E-Bra pro 2 ̆ 2 in order to display and analyze the ECG transmitted from the transmission <b>module.</b> The <b>ECG</b> transmission <b>module</b> consists of three parts such as ECG physical signal detection part with 3 stage amplifier and two electrodes, data acquisition with AD converter, and data transmission part with GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) communication, and it has very compact size that is attachable at the bottom layer of a brassiere for women. However, the ECG signal measured from the transmission module includes not only pure ECG components information; P waves QRS complex, and T wave, but also a motion artifact component (MA) due to subject movements. The MA component is one of the reasons for misdiagnosis. Therefore, the main purpose of the E-Bra system is to provide a reliable ECG data set identical to the quality of an ECG data set collected in hospital. Unfortunately, removing MA is a big challenge because the frequency range of the MA is duplicated on the frequency range of the pure ECG components, P-QRS-T. In this dissertation, two motion artifact removal algorithms (MARAs) with adaptive filter structure and independent component analysis concept are suggested, and the performance of the two MARAs will be evaluated by correlation values and signal noise ratio (SNR) values...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the realization of}} a compact, yet flexible BCI platform, which, when compared to most commercially-available solution, can offer an optimal trade-off between the following requirements: (i) minimal, easy experimental setup; (ii) flexibility, allowing simultaneous studies on other bio-potentials; (iii) cost effectiveness (e. g. < 1000 €); (iv) robust design, suitable for operation outside lab environments. The thesis encompasses all the project phases, from hardware design and realization, up to software and signal processing. The work started from {{the development of the}} hardware acquisition unit. It resulted in a compact, battery-operated module, whose medium-to-large scale production costs are in the range of 300 €. The module features 16 input channels and can be used to acquire different bio-potentials, including EEG, EMG, <b>ECG.</b> <b>Module</b> performance is very good (RTI noise < 1. 3 uVpp), and was favourably compared against a commercial device (g. tec USBamp). The device was integrated into an ad-hoc developed Matlab-based platform, which handles the hardware control, as well as the data streaming, logging and processing. Via a specifically developed plug-in, incoming data can also be streamed to a TOBI-interface compatible system. As a demonstrator, the BCI was developed for AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) system-control purposes, having in mind the following requirements: (i) online, self-paced BCI operation (i. e., the BCI monitors the EEG in real-time and must discern between intentional control periods, and non-intentional, rest ones, interpreting the user’s intent only in the first case); (ii) calibration-free approach (“ready-to-use”, “Plug&Play”); (iii) subject-independence (general approach). The choice of the BCI operating paradigm fell on Steady State visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Two offline SSVEP classification algorithms were proposed and compared against reference literature, highlighting good performance, especially in terms of lower computational complexity. A method for improving classification accuracy was presented, suitable for use in online, self-paced scenarios (since {{it can be used to}} discriminate between intentional control periods and non-intentional ones). Results show a very good performance, in particular in terms of false positives immunity (0. 26 min^- 1), significantly improving over the state of the art. The whole BCI setup was tested both in lab condition, as well as in relatively harsher ones (in terms of environmental noise and non-idealities), such as in the context of the Handimatica 2014 exhibition. In both cases, a demonstrator allowing control of home appliances through BCI was developed...|$|E
