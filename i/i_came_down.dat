500|$|Store Frøen's rural {{surroundings}} {{shaped the}} nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice {{at the age of}} two, on improvised skis. [...] At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby Huseby installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: [...] "I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... hen <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> again I bored into the snow up to my waist. The boys thought I had broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up." [...] Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of Telemark, where a new style of skiing was being developed. [...] "I saw this was the only way", wrote Nansen later.|$|E
500|$|Two {{directors}} {{were assigned to}} the series – Ken Hannam and Christopher Barry. Hannam had previously directed such series as Colditz and Paul Temple while Barry had worked extensively on Doctor Who, having directed some 31 episodes at the time, including the stories The Dæmons and The Mutants for Letts and Dicks, as well as episodes of Out of the Unknown, Paul Temple and The Onedin Line. [...] Hannam and Barry alternated directing the episodes between them with filming on Moonbase 3 beginning on 24 April 1973 at the BBC film studios in Ealing. The Ealing filming mainly centred around the scenes set on the lunar surface which proved a difficult experience for the actors. Star Donald Houston told the Radio Times that the spacesuits got [...] "hot and claustrophobic. In the end they had to have oxygen standing by. [...] the dust rose in clouds and the cameramen all wore surgical masks. The actors just choked". [...] Recalling his guest appearance on Moonbase 3, in the episode [...] "Behemoth", Peter Miles told TV Zone in 1991 that he was [...] "asked to be like a gazelle and leap as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> the hillock in full astronaut gear. [...] The tech crew wondered why I was steaming up furiously in my astronaut's head. They'd forgotten to put air holes into the helmet. [...] I said, 'Help help! Help help! I'm not breathing folks!' They took the helmet off before drilling the holes or I wouldn't be here now". [...] Filming continued at Ealing until 30 May 1973 before production moved to BBC Television Centre for the remaining scenes, mostly those set inside the moonbase, which would be recorded on videotape beginning on 18 June 1973. The episodes were recorded in a different order than that in which they were broadcast with [...] "Departure and Arrival" [...] recorded first followed by [...] "Castor and Pollux", [...] "Behemoth", [...] "View of a Dead Planet", [...] "Outsiders" [...] and, lastly, [...] "Achilles Heel" [...] with recording wrapping on 15 August 1973. [...] Music was provided by Dudley Simpson who, at this time, was the regular composer on Doctor Who. Simpson composed the main title theme that accompanied the opening and closing credits as well as approximately 60 minutes of incidental music.|$|E
2500|$|Colleen Hewett {{was born}} on 16 April 1950 in Bendigo. She has an older sister, Glenys Hewett, who was a pop vocalist from the early sixties to mid-seventies. Hewett began her music career {{at the age of}} 12 when she sang with The Esquires at the Bendigo YMCA. At about 13 years old she {{appeared}} on TV pop music series, The Go!! Show, fifty years later she recalled [...] "I wasn't of an age at that stage where I could go out on tour with anybody [...] <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> from Bendigo with a band I was working with there [...] then <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> again around my 14th birthday and did a solo spot on it ... they were just cover versions. I was just a little singer from Bendigo who came down on the train with the boys and did this amazing show that everybody watched".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter with Nebraska {{trailing}} by 6, Coach Callahan called {{what seemed to be}} a sweep play similar to ones they had used earlier in the game. However, when running back Marlon Lucky got the pitch, he threw a [...] touchdown pass to Nate Swift. The extra point gave Nebraska a one-point lead with 4:54 left in the game. Texas safety Aaron Ross took responsibility for over-pursuing on the run; [...] "It was my fault. The receiver did a great job pretending like he was blocking, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to force on the run, and they beat us deep." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'. I learnt well under pressure, but, like, four years passed by and I hit rock bottom, Breakaway just exploded everywhere. Everyone was making a lot of money, so everyone was pushing the train. That's when it finally all caught up with me. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with 'walking pneumonia' {{for the second time in}} a year. My body was physically giving up. I took six months off and went home. I love working, but at the end of the day you've got to take care of yourself." ...|$|E
