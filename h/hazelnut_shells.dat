5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shells</b> and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E
5|$|Farm Fields, a {{site near}} Kinloch, {{provides}} some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. Carbonized <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shells</b> found there have been dated to the Mesolithic period at 7700-7500 BC.; at this time the landscape was dominated by alder, hazel and willow scrub. A beach site above Loch Scresort has been dated to between 6500 and 5500 BC. The presence of this hunter-gatherer community may have been {{to take advantage of the}} local supplies of bloodstone, a workable material for the making of tools and weapons. There is a shell-midden at Papadil in the south and evidence of tidal fish traps at both Kinloch and Kilmory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{adsorption}} {{behavior of}} <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell</b> and its ash for cadmium ions from aqueous solution {{has been investigated}} {{as a function of}} appropriate equilibrium time, amount of adsorbent, concentration of adsorbate, pH and particle size using a batch system. Experiments were conducted by use of jar test apparatus. Studies showed that pH of aqueous solution affected cadmium adsorption as a result of removal efficiency increased with increasing solution pH but after pH about 6 the removal efficiency decreased. The maximum adsorption were about 98. 2 and 99. 1 % for <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell</b> and its ash, respectively, at pH 6, contact time 1 180 minutes and initial concentration of 30 mgL. Desorption of cadmium was 12 % at pH 6 the cadmium sorption obeyed both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The studies showed that <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell</b> ash was more favorable than <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell</b> in removing cadmium and thus, was a better adsorbent...|$|R

40|$|Fluidization is a {{favorable}} technology for thermochemical processing of biomass materials {{due to its}} inherent advantages such as flexibility to process fuels having {{a wide range of}} physical and chemical properties. In this study, fluidization characteristics are investigated and minimum fluidization velocities are determined for four different types of biomass (rice husk, sawdust, olive cake and <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell)</b> - silica sand mixtures in a laboratory scale fluidized bed. Generally, except olive cake, pure sawdust, <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell,</b> rice husk show poor fluidization characteristics with large gas voids.

40|$|Pyrolysis {{essentially}} is the thermal decomposition {{of organic matter}} under inert atmospheric conditions or in a limited supply of air, leading {{to the release of}} volatiles and formation of char. Modeling of pyrolysis implies the representation of the chemical and physical phenomena in a mathematical form. In this study, Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is applied and global optimum set of kinetic parameters are found out by minimizing the least square error between the experimental data reported and the results of simulated model for <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell.</b> Simulations are carried out to find the kinetic parameters of the proposed kinetic scheme.

40|$|Thermal {{behavior}} and combustion kinetic of coal, <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell,</b> and coal/hazelnut shell blends {{at the proper}} ratio were investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Four mass ratios (20, 30, 40, 50 mass%) of coal/biomass blends were prepared and oxidized under dynamic conditions from temperature 298 to 1, 173 K at different heating rates. TG analysis indicated that the combustion of blended samples divided into two stages namely devolatilization and char oxidation combined with coal combustion step. The influence of biomass blends on thermal and kinetic behavior of coal was studied under non-isothermal conditions. It {{was found that the}} thermal degradation temperature of coal was higher than that of blended samples due to the molecular structure strength. Ozawa-Flynn-Wall model was applied to deal with non-isothermal TG data for the evaluation of the activation energy corresponding to the combustions of coal, <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shell,</b> and coal/hazelnut shell blends. The average activation energy changed in the range of 90. 9 - 215. 3 kJ mol(- 1), respectively, depending on blending ratio...|$|R

Following this, the University of Aarhus, the Moesgård Museum, and the Horsens Museum cooperated in excavating the site. The conclusion was that the site was likely from the Ertebølle period and had been settled due to its convenient location with regards to fishing. Finds at the site included three wooden paddles made of ash wood, an antler axe, a dugout canoe, and a bow made of elmwood. There were also numerous stakes made of hazel wood, <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shells,</b> plant seeds, string, and flint flakes and tools.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} at Cramond {{have uncovered}} evidence of habitation dating to around 8500 BC, making it, for a time, {{the earliest known}} site of human settlement in Scotland. The inhabitants of the Mesolithic camp-site were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved around their territories according to the season of the year. Although no bones survived the acid soil, waste pits and stakeholes that would have supported shelters or windbreaks were excavated. Numerous discarded <b>hazelnut</b> <b>shells,</b> the waste product of the inhabitants' staple food, {{were found in the}} pits and used to carbon-date the site. It is thought the site was chosen for its location near the junction of the Firth of Forth and the River Almond, where the rich oyster and mussel beds proved a reliable natural resource.
