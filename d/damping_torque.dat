If the damping force is too large, then the pointer will come to rest slowly and this is called as over damping.|$|E
50|$|Jet damping or thrust damping is {{the effect}} of rocket exhaust {{removing}} energy from the transverse angular motion of a rocket. If a rocket has pitch or yaw motion then the exhaust must be accelerated laterally as it flows down the exhaust tube and nozzle. Once the exhaust leaves the nozzle this lateral momentum is lost to the vehicle and thus serves to damp the lateral oscillations. The jet damping is stabilizing as long as the distance from the instantaneous spacecraft center of mass to the nozzle exit plane exceeds the instantaneous transverse radius of gyration. Most rocket or missile configurations meet this criteria and the jet damping has a dynamic stabilizing effect. The jet <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> rotates at nutation frequency in the spacecraft frame.|$|E

40|$|Spin {{transfer}} torque in spin valves usually destabilizes {{one of the}} collinear configurations (either parallel or antiparallel) and stabilizes {{the second}} one. Apart from this, balance of the spin-transfer and <b>damping</b> <b>torques</b> can lead to steady precessional modes. In this letter we show that in some asymmetric nanopillars spin current can destabilize both parallel and antiparallel configurations. As a result, stationary precessional modes can occur at zero magnetic field.

30|$|The {{concept of}} <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> was first {{introduced}} to offer a physical insight to system stability problem on an SMIB system [25]. For an SMIB system, the <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> coefficient can be estimated using the system response by using the least square method [26, 27] or Kalman filter [28]. To extend the concept to multi-machine power systems, the first attempt in [29] estimates the <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> for each single generator using its own electrical torque, rotor angle and rotor speed trajectories based on the least square error. However, this intuitive extension {{is found to be}} valid only when the speed deviations for all other generators are zeros, while it is not tenable in general [30]. Another extension of this concept is mentioned in [31], where the <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> coefficient for the same generator is supposed to be different with respect to different oscillation modes such that it should be calculated separately for each mode. Thus, the <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> of a generator in a multi-machine system could be estimated using the system trajectories based on a certain modal analysis method, like total least square-estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (TLS-ESPRIT) [31] or Prony [32].|$|E
40|$|In a power system, Low Frequency Oscillations (LFOs) are {{dangerous}} and make system unstable. These oscillations {{are referred to}} small signal stability and they are mainly {{due to lack of}} <b>damping</b> <b>torque.</b> This insufficient <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> is because of high gain and low time constant of Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR). AVR is useful for maintaining the terminal voltage of synchronous machine as constant. While doing so, it will make the system <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> as negative. For providing required <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> thereby minimizing the LFOs, Power System Stabilizer is used in conjunction with AVR. In this paper for SMIB system, the stability is studied with the help of eigen values before and after placement of PSS with optimized PSS parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO).

Either the satellites were stable with attitude perturbations less than + or - 5 deg or their behavior tended towards a low frequency rigid body oscillation dominated by large yaw motions {{and in some}} cases by yaw inversions. A causal relationship between sun angle and the character of satellite behavior was observed which appears to indicate that thermal distortion is a critical factor in a gravity gradient satellite's dynamic behavior.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{nonlinear}} voltage regulator with one tunable parameter for multimachine power systems. Based on output feedback linearization, this regulator can achieve simultaneous voltage regulation and small-signal performance objectives. Conventionally output feedback linearization {{has been used}} for voltage regulator design by taking infinite bus voltage as reference. Unfortunately, this controller has poor small-signal performance and cannot be applied to multimachine systems without the estimation of the equivalent external reactance seen from the generator. This paper proposes a voltage regulator design by redefining the rotor angle at each generator with respect to the secondary voltage of the step-up transformer as reference instead of a common synchronously rotating reference frame. Using synchronizing and <b>damping</b> <b>torques</b> analysis, we show that the proposed voltage regulator achieves simultaneous voltage regulation and damping performance over a range of system and operating conditions by controlling the relative angle between the generator internal voltage angle delta and the secondary voltage of the step up transformer.

The <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> of the generator is given in Fig.  3 b.

Therefore, the shunt transformer-converter of UPFC has little impact on the SSR characteristics of the system, whereas the series transformer-converter of UPFC affects the SSR characteristics significantly. Meanwhile, the results given in Fig.  3 b also reveal that the <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> varies very little when UPFC transfers variable active and reactive power.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> analysis of power system oscillation stability as {{affected by the}} dynamic and control functions of an embedded voltage source converter (VSC). The objective {{of the study is}} to explain why and how the dynamic and basic control functions of the embedded VSC, ac and dc voltage regulation, provide damping to power system oscillations. The most important conclusion obtained in the paper is that both the dynamics and the dc voltage control of the VSC contribute a variable <b>damping</b> <b>torque,</b> which can be positive or negative, at different levels of system load conditions. More positive <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by the VSC at a heavier load condition. There exists a point of system load condition where the VSC provides no <b>damping</b> <b>torque</b> to power system oscillation hence dose not impose any influence on power system oscillation stability.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{internal combustion}} engine (ICE) produces an inherent oscillating torque which causes {{a significant amount of}} vibration and noise and also reduces the power train life time.

40|$|The modern grid rules forces DFIG to {{withstand}} and operate during single {{as well as}} multiple low voltage grid faults. The system must not lose synchronism during any type of fault for a given time period. This withstanding capacity is called {{low voltage ride through}} (LVRT). To improve performance during LVRT, enhanced field oriented control (EFOC) method is adopted in rotor side converter. This method helps in improving power transfer capability during steady state and better dynamic and transient stability during abnormal conditions. In this technique, rotor flux reference change from synchronous speed to some smaller speed or zero during the fault for injecting current at the rotor slip frequency. In this process, DC-Offset component of flux is controlled beyond decomposing to a lower value during faults and maintaining it. This offset decomposition of flux will be oscillatory in conventional FOC, whereas in EFOC with internal model controller, flux can damp quickly not only for single fault but during multiple faults. This strategy can regulate stator and rotor current waveform to sinusoidal without distortion during and after fault. It has better <b>damped</b> <b>torque</b> oscillations, control in rotor speed and generator flux during and after fault. The fluctuations in DC bus voltage across capacitor are also controlled using proposed EFOC technique.

This paper presents the applications of clamping torque analysis for DC bus implemented clamping control in power transmission networks in two examples.
