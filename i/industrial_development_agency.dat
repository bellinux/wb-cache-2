25|$|In 1971, the Erie Railroad {{demolished}} {{the wooden}} roundhouse at Salamanca, {{and the only}} structures remaining in the yard were the former fueling towers and the turntable.

In the late 1970s, the depot became vacant, and although plans to make it part of a museum and park by 1983 were proposed in 1982, they fell flat. The city struck a deal in April1983 to purchase the depot from Conrail for $25,000.

The garages will be built (and renovated) by the Community Initiatives Development Corporation of Hudson, New York, a nonprofit entity that will use the parking revenue to repay the bonds and pay a $3 million yearly land lease to the City of New York.

This paper analyses the changing role of Ireland in the global process R&D networks of the pharmaceutical companies. The paper is based on data collected in an email survey of all pharmaceutical establishments in Ireland and face-to-face interviews with 13 companies. The article outlines the various stages of the process R&D cycle and assesses the involvement of the Irish establishments at each stage. Far from a uniform undifferentiated activity, process R&D comprises a range of activities. The results show that although Irish plants are increasing their involvement in process R&D, this involvement tends to be concentrated in the last stages of the cycle...|$|R

40|$|Technology policy {{encompasses}} {{a number of}} different strands but can be sub-divided between institutional support e. g. development of educational and technological infrastructure, and financial support, or more specifically support at the enterprise level for R&D e. g. financial incentives to enterprises. It has been suggested that national technology policy tends to reinforce the strengths of a country’s industrial system, particularly in relation to large firms and the promotion of R&D in core technologies and focuses less on technology transfer which is often left to regional technological policy initiatives. In lagging regional economies, which are often dominated by SME’s, this presents specific challenges for technology policy. This paper presents a comparative analysis of technology policy at both the national and regional levels in Ireland and Northern Ireland respectively, over the 1990 s. In both Ireland and Northern Ireland the period from 1991 - 99 was marked by expansion as measured by steady output growth for manufacturing as a whole (albeit at substantially lower levels in Northern Ireland than in Ireland). In Ireland this largely reflected rapid economic growth of output in the high-tech sectors, itself a consequence of inward investment and re-investment. Despite growth in gross expenditure on R&D over the 1990 s closely related to output growth, Ireland’s investment in R&D (at 0. 95 % of GNP) lags behind Slovenia, Norway, the UK, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, the US and Japan. Technology policy is examined in terms of direct government financial support for business sector investment in R&D. This is based on a database of all grant offers (Northern Ireland) and payments (Ireland) made by the <b>industrial</b> <b>development</b> <b>agencies</b> in Ireland and Northern Ireland over the 1991 to 2001 period which was developed for this paper. The paper emphasises issues concerning the concentration of R&D investment, change in the balance between pre-competitive and near market R&D and the move towards financial incentives for technology transfer of R&D...|$|R
