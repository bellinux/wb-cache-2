40|$|Anexperiment was {{conducted}} in theSIMONAResearch Simulator at Delft University of Technology to investigate the influence of sway, roll, and yaw motion cues on pilot performance, control, and motion perception during <b>decrab</b> maneuvers. In the experiment, six pilots were instructed to perform manual <b>decrab</b> maneuvers in heavy crosswind conditions with a Cessna Citation 500 model. The contributions of yaw, roll, and sway motion stimuli were varied such that their effects on objective measures and subjective ratings could be examined. The results of this experiment show that yaw motion had {{a positive influence on}} performance in terms of lateral touchdown distance from the runway centerline. Roll motion significantly decreased roll rate variations during <b>decrab.</b> High workload and the relatively low intensity of lateral motion cues led to the fact that pilots were unable to give consistent fidelity ratings. This result emphasizes the need for an objective and quantifiable method to determine motion fidelity for such maneuvers. Pilot models can possibly be used to further investigate the influence of different motion cues in these transient control tasks...|$|E
40|$|The three Dutch {{research}} institutes NLR, TNO and TU Delft are collaborating {{to perform}} a multi-simulator follow-up study aimed at investigating the influence of yaw and translational motion cues in helicopter- and general flight-simulation. In this study, new experimental results will be combined with pilot modeling. Two experiments will be performed; a yaw-control helicopter study and a piloted <b>decrab</b> study. Results will include comparison with previous studies, analysis of a pilot perception model and the generation multi-loop pilot control model from the measured data. This paper describes {{the background of the}} study, as well as the preparatory work for the helicopter experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a digital automatic control law for a small jet transport to perform a steep final approach in automatic landings is reported along with the {{development of}} a steady-state Kalman filter used to provide smooth estimates to the control law. The control law performs the functions of localizer and glides capture, localizer and glideslope track, <b>decrab,</b> and place. The control law uses the microwave landing system position data, and aircraft body-mounted accelerators, attitude and attitude rate information. The results obtained from a digital simulation of the aircraft dynamics, wind conditions, and sensor noises using the control law and filter developed are described...|$|E

Another advantage of methodology flexibility to develop variety of techniques for design of feedback control with arbitrary structures to obtain feedback controller: includes stochastic output feedback, multiconfiguration control, decentralized control, or frequency and classical control methods.

40|$|The study {{described}} here {{was intended to}} explore some ways of giving the pilot the information necessary to perform {{as well as an}} autopilot. A fixed-base flight simulator was built to study pilot/director/aircraft performance. Instrument rated pilots used the different director-displays in an approach down to touchdown, including a flare and <b>decrab</b> maneuver. Two well established areas of control theory are combined {{in the design of the}} cockpit display. Optimal control theory and the theory of manual control are used to find the feedback gains required to drive the display symbols. Conclusions based on the simulator are presented. The results show that the director display developed in the work provides more than adequate information for simulated landing in highly turbulent conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the design, development, and flight test {{results of a}} full-state feedback modern-controls-designed autoland system - the Digital Integrated Automatic Landing System (DIALS). The lateral and longitudinal control laws were designed by formulating a linear quadratic regulator with disturbances problem. Although the designs were independent of each other, in implementation cross-coupling of the lateral and longitudinal variables does occur. A brief discussion of the control modes - localizer capture, localizer track, <b>decrab,</b> glideslope capture, glideslope track, and flare - and the modifications made to the basic design during the simulation phase to achieve desired performance is given. Some of the efforts required to implement the system in the flight computers and some problems encountered in the ground hardware simulation checkout are discussed. Finally, flight test data is presented for this system which performed 10 'hands off' automatic landings. The flight test data includes {{the performance of the}} aircraft in mild, gust, and wind shear conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Digital Integrated Automatic Landing System (DIALS) is discussed. The DIALS is {{a modern}} control theory design {{performing}} all the maneuver modes associated with current autoland systems: localizer capture and track, glideslope capture and track, <b>decrab,</b> and flare. The DIALS is an integrated full-state feedback system which was designed using direct-digital methods. The DIALS uses standard aircraft sensors and the digital Microwave Landing System (MLS) signals as measurements. It consists of separately designed longitudinal and lateral channels although some cross-coupling variables are fed between channels for improved state estimates and trajectory commands. The DIALS was implemented within the 16 -bit fixed-point flight computers of the ATOPS research aircraft, a small twin jet commercial transport outfitted with a second research cockpit and a fly-by-wire system. The DIALS became the first modern control theory design to be successfully flight tested on a commercial-type aircraft. Flight tests were conducted in late 1981 using a wide coverage MLS on Runway 22 at Wallops Flight Center. All the modes were exercised including the capture and track of steep glidescopes up to 5 degrees...|$|E
40|$|Five {{flight tests}} of the Digital Automated Landing System (DIALS) were {{conducted}} on the Advanced Transport Operating System (ATOPS) Transportation Research Vehicle (TSRV) [...] a modified Boeing 737 Aircraft for advanced controls and displays research. These flight tests were conducted at NASA's Wallops Flight Center using the Microwave Landing System (MLS) installation on Runway 22. This report is primarily a collection of data plots of all performance variables recorded for the entire five flight tests. A description and source of the performance variables is included. Performance variables include inertial data, air data, automatic control commands, control servo positions, sensor data, DIALS guidance and control parameters, and Kalman filter data. This data illustrates low overshoot captures of the localizer for intercept angles of 20 deg, 30 deg, 40 deg, and 50 deg intercept angles, and low overshoot captures of the glideslope slope for 3 deg, 4. 5 deg, and 5 deg glideslopes. Flare maneuvers were successfully performed from the various glideslope angles and good <b>decrab</b> maneuvers were performed in crosswinds of 6 knots. In 18 to 20 knot crosswind conditions rudder limiting occurred which caused lateral drifting although heading alignment was achieved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this flight}} {{simulator}} study, eleven pilots rated their motion perception during {{a series of}} <b>decrab</b> maneuvers of a twin-engine passenger aircraft. Simulator yaw, sway, and roll motion were varied independently to examine their relative contribution to the pilotsÂ’ judgments. In one set of conditions, the washout algorithms were bypassed so as to reproduce unfiltered aircraft motion. This was compared with washout-filtered motion in another set of conditions. Moreover, the effect of visual cues was studied by testing the unfiltered motion cues, once with simulated outside view, and once without outside view. The results show that perceived alignment motion primarily depended on simulator sway and roll motion, and also visually induced motion. Simulator yaw was poorly recognized and was masked by simulator sway. Interestingly, unfiltered sway motion was perceived as too strong, even though the simulator workspace required downscaling to 70 % of the actual aircraft motion. Finally, the subjective data were used to validate our pilot perception model. Although the model did not yet account for the observed interaction between sway and yaw motion, the model output showed good correspondence with the experimental pilot magnitude ratings. The subjective data {{will be used to}} further optimize the model parameters to allow for quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of ground-based motion cues...|$|E

These flight tests were conducted at NASA's Wallops Flight Center using the microwave landing system (MLS) installation on runway 22. This report describes the flight software equations of the DIALS which was designed using modern control theory direct-digital design methods and employed a constant gain Kalman filter. Selected flight test performance data is presented for localizer (runway centerline) capture and track at various intercept angles, for glideslope capture and track of 3, 4. 5, and 5 degree glideslopes, for the <b>decrab</b> maneuver, and for the flare maneuver. Data is also presented to illustrate the system performance {{in the presence of}} cross, gust, and shear winds. The mean and standard deviation of the peak position errors for localizer capture were, respectively, 24 feet and 26 feet. For mild wind conditions, glideslope and localizer tracking position errors did not exceed, respectively, 5 and 20 feet. For gusty wind conditions (8 to 10 knots), these errors were, respectively, 10 and 30 feet. Ten hands off automatic lands were performed. The standard deviation of the touchdown position and velocity errors from the mean values were, respectively, 244 feet and 0. 7 feet/sec...|$|E
40|$|A set of {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) GRACE research flight simulation facility {{to determine the effects}} of sway, yaw and roll motion on perceived motion fidelity, motion perception, pilot workload and pilot compensation. Fourteen pilots were asked to perform a manual <b>decrab</b> maneuver when the aircraft was on final approach with a 30 knots crosswind. Platform yaw, sway and roll motions were varied independently to examine their relative contribution to the pilot's judgements on perceived motion cues and workload. To determine possible effects of workload on the pilotÂ’s opinion about motion fidelity and perception of motion, pilots were grouped in pairs. For each simulator run, one pilot was asked to fly the aircraft while the other pilot was asked to monitor the maneuver. Both pilots answered the same questionnaire after each run. The results show that perception of simulator motion was positively affected by platform sway for both pilots-flying and pilots-not-flying. Platform roll had only a main effect on the perceived motion of the pilots-not-flying. Platform yaw motion seemed to have a positive effect on motion perception only in the absence of platform sway. The pilot motion fidelity ratings show that platform sway improved the fidelity ratings for the pilots-not-flying only. Platform roll (in the absence of sway) also showed to have a positive effect on pilot fidelity ratings. On average, pilot fidelity ratings were higher when the pilot was controlling the aircraft. Handling qualities results show that pilots felt less compensation was required when platform sway was present. This was confirmed by the decrease in pilot pedal and column activity when platform sway was present. The results of the experiment as described in this paper will support our previous studies in the development of objective evaluation criteria for the optimisation of simulator motion cues...|$|E
40|$|Several crosswind-related {{incidents}} {{show that}} landing under heavy crosswind conditions {{can be challenging}} for pilots and may {{pose a threat to}} aviation or at least lead to higher pilot workload and/or irregularities in operations. For transport aircraft the common approach technique for crosswind landings is the so-called crabbed approach with wings level and a windward heading correction. This technique requires alignment of the aircraft with the runway prior to touchdown in order to keep lateral loads of the landing gear and tyres as low as possible and to maintain the controllability on ground after touchdown. The German Aerospace Center Institute of Flight Systems has used the idea of steerable main gears and developed a crosswind landing assistance system. During approach all gear struts are automatically aligned with the runway so that no <b>decrab</b> manoeuvre is required. On ground the assistance system uses each steerable landing gear, differential braking, and the aerodynamic control surfaces to control and stabilise the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft is automatically aligned with the runway centreline and the still existing crab angle is slowly reduced. A simulator study with pilots in the loop using a model of a typical medium range transport aircraft was conducted in order to evaluate the benefits of such a landing technique. The study revealed that not only the aircraft controllability could be improved by landing in crabbed motion under strong crosswind conditions, but that the side forces acting on the landing gear can be reduced significantly as well. It was also shown that the use of steerable main landing gears is able to enlarge the spectrum of autoland operations, which is relatively limited at present in terms of maximum allowable crosswinds. All together the system has shown to be able to improve flight safety, lower the risk of weatherrelated delays due to go-arounds or diversions, and it also reduces structural loads on the landing gear during touchdown and landing...|$|E
