Here, we show that inactivating mutations in human PEX 3 cause Zellweger syndrome, abrogate peroxisome membrane synthesis, and result in reduced abundance of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondria. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} PEX 3 may traffic through the ER en route to the peroxisome, that the COPI inhibitor, brefeldin A, leads to accumulation of PEX 3 in the ER, and that PEX 3 overexpression alters the morphology of the ER. However, we were unable to detect PEX 3 in the ER at early times after expression. Furthermore, we find that inhibition of COPI function by brefeldin A has no effect on trafficking of PEX 3 to peroxisomes and does not inhibit PEX 3 -mediated peroxisome biogenesis. We also find that inhibition of COPII-dependent membrane traffic by a dominant negative SAR 1 mutant fails to block PEX 3 transport to peroxisomes and PEX 3 -mediated peroxisome synthesis. Based on these results, we propose that PEX 3 targeting to peroxisomes and PEX 3 -mediated peroxisome membrane synthesis may occur independently of COPI- and COPII-dependent membrane traffic.

40|$|Abstract Background The Cajal body (CB) is {{a nuclear}} suborganelle {{involved}} in the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are vital for pre-mRNA splicing. Newly <b>imported</b> Sm-class snRNPs <b>traffic</b> through CBs, where the snRNA component of the snRNP is modified, and then target to other nuclear domains such as speckles and perichromatin fibrils. It is not known how nascent snRNPs localize to the CB and are released from this structure after modification. The marker protein for CBs, coilin, {{may play a role}} in snRNP biogenesis given that it can interact with snRNPs and SMN, the protein mutated in Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Loss of coilin function in mice leads to significant viability and fertility problems and altered CB formation. Results In this report, we identify a minor isoform of the mitochondrial Tim 50, Tim 50 a, as a coilin interacting protein. The Tim 50 a transcript can be detected in some cancer cell lines and normal brain tissue. The Tim 50 a protein differs only from Tim 50 in that it contains an additional 103 aa N-terminal to the translation start of Tim 50. Importantly, a putative nuclear localization signal is found within these 103 residues. In contrast to Tim 50, which localizes to the cytoplasm and mitochondria, Tim 50 a is strictly nuclear and is enriched in speckles with snRNPs. In addition to coilin, Tim 50 a interacts with snRNPs and SMN. Competition binding experiments demonstrate that coilin competes with Sm proteins of snRNPs and SMN for binding sites on Tim 50 a. Conclusion Tim 50 a {{may play a role in}} snRNP biogenesis given its cellular localization and protein interaction characteristics. We hypothesize that Tim 50 a takes part in the release of snRNPs and SMN from the CB. </p...|$|R

Reduce, reuse, and recycle would presumably be the priority in any island region, yet the USVI have historically viewed recycling plastic as infeasible due to high transportation costs and distance to economies of scale with processing facilities. As a petroleum byproduct, plastic is the 2 nd most valued commodity in the waste stream and makes up 14 % of the US Virgin Islands MSW. With the USVI facing landfill closure within the next five years, waste management is a true concern with expanding the recycling to include plastic proving to be a viable solution. After analyzing different scenarios and taking all of the unique characteristics of the USVI into consideration, I have proposed a business model for a closed loop plastic recycling operation in the US Virgin Islands in order to decrease transport costs and environmental impacts. A closed-loop process would prove to be a viable investment using locally sourced PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate, # 1) to produce high-quality plastic flake to substitute virgin plastic in manufacturing, such as in the bottling industry, and plastic strapping which is in high demand for the packaging and shipping industry. The reprocessing plant would be strategically located in the industrial sector of St. Croix with access to a highly <b>trafficked</b> <b>import,</b> export, and trans-shipment port.

40|$|HIV- 1 {{and other}} lentiviruses {{are able to}} infect non-dividing cells productively. Infection of certain non-proliferating cell populations is {{important}} for viral transmission, disease pathogenesis, and, potentially, the establishment of persistent viral reservoirs. Following cytoplasmic entry, a multi-component nucleoprotein complex is formed—the pre-integration complex (PIC). The ability of HIV- 1 to infect non-dividing cells efficiently and to transit across an intact nuclear envelope {{has been attributed to}} karyophilic signals within the HIV- 1 PIC that facilitate active transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). ^ The mechanism of nuclear <b>import</b> and intra-nuclear <b>trafficking</b> of the HIV- 1 PIC is still controversial. The primary goal of my thesis research is to clarify the pathway of PIC nuclear import. In the first results section (Chapter 2), the identification of a critical region within the IN protein is described. This valine-arginine di-peptide motif at codons 165 and 166 of IN is required for the productive infection of both dividing and non-dividing cells. Although this region of IN was incorrectly ascribed NLS function, investigation of the replicative properties of mutant viruses proved productive. Specifically, viruses with point mutations at these residues were blocked after the completion of reverse transcription and prior to integration. The mutant IN proteins, however, retain catalytic activity suggesting a defect in proper localization. This hypothesis is further supported by the altered sub-cellular localization of virion-delivered IN protein from mutant viruses. ^ In the second results section (Chapter 3), the role of a recently discovered potential karyophilic signal, the DNA flap, is investigated. We report that the DNA flap is not required for replication in dividing or non-dividing cells. Furthermore, we report that the viral cDNAs from DNA flap mutant and V 165 A viruses are still able to enter the nucleus of challenged cells. Our findings suggest a new and modified model of HIV- 1 PIC nuclear import. We hypothesize an uncharacterized post-nuclear entry trafficking step in the HIV- 1 life cycle. ...|$|R

These processes were studied using biophysical methods centered on Mossbauer spectroscopy supplemented by electron paramagnetic resonance, electronic absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. This integrated biophysical approach was applied to yeast cells, isolated yeast mitochondria, and mouse brains. We determined the concentration of Fe, {{and the proportion of}} that Fe present as iron-sulfur clusters, heme centers, mononuclear nonheme centers, and as Fe 3 + oxyhydroxide (phosphate) nanoparticles for each system. In yeast, the dependence of metabolic mode of growth and iron in the growth medium on this distribution was studied. Approximately three-quarters of the iron in fermenting cells was located in vacuoles, where it was present as high-spin mononuclear Fe 3 + species with rhombic symmetry. The remaining quarter was present in the mitochondria. In fermenting mitochondria 4 distinct species of iron were observed, including [Fe 4 S 4] 2 + clusters and low-spin Fe 2 + hemes arising from respiratory complexes, non-heme high spin (NHHS) Fe 2 + species, high spin nonheme Fe 3 + species, and nanoparticles. These distributions (in both the cells and mitochondria) change when the cells are grown on iron deficient medium but remained relatively unaltered as iron in the growth medium was increased. Respiring cells had less Fe associated with vacuoles, and more Fe present as HS Fe 2 +. Respiring mitochondria contain more [Fe 4 S 4] 2 + clusters and low-spin Fe 2 + hemes, more S = 1 / 2 [Fe 2 S 2] 1 + clusters, and less NHHS Fe 2 +, HS Fe 3 + species and Fe 3 + nanoparticles. These changes were rationalized by assuming that the NHHS Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + species, and the nanoparticles were in equilibrium within the matrix of the mitochondria, and that the Fe 2 + species served as feedstock for the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters and heme centers. The iron in the mouse brain consisted mostly of [Fe 4 S 4] 2 + clusters and Fe 2 + hemes from mitochondria respiratory complexes, and of ferritin, an Fe storage protein complex. NHHS Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + species were also observed. The ratio of stored Fe to mitochondrial Fe was sensitive to age. The brains of prenatal animals were dominated by ferritin. Following birth up to the first 4 weeks of life, there was an increase in mitochondrial Fe and a decline of ferritin Fe. Beyond 4 weeks up to 58 weeks, levels of ferritin increased and mitochondrial Fe remained constant. The brains of mice fed an Fe-deficient diet were also studied; most of the Fe in these brains was present as mitochondrial Fe, with little stored as ferritin. A model was developed to explain these changes...|$|R
