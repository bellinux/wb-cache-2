5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage under fire the militia <b>had</b> <b>so</b> badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War.

5|$|After the king's victory, {{one of his}} loyal adherents, Thomas Szécsényi was {{appointed}} voivode who suppressed a Saxon revolt in 1324. At that time, the autonomous Saxon province was divided into seats, each administered by a judge appointed by the king.

5|$|After {{three years}} as Inspector-General, {{and in order to}} gain staff experience, Davies was {{attached}} as an observer to a number of units in the United Kingdom in 1909–10. During this time, he also attended the Imperial Defence Conference and represented the New Zealand forces at the funeral of King Edward VII. At the end of the one-year attachment, he <b>had</b> <b>so</b> impressed the British Army that they offered him an appointment as commander of 6th Brigade in October 1910, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. As such, he became the first overseas officer to command a regular brigade, only eleven years after taking up a permanent military commission.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 a Congressional Act {{divided the}} Eastern District into the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Eastern District. The courts of the Eastern Division {{continued}} {{to be held at}} the U.S. Custom House and Post Office in St. Louis, while the courts of the Northern Division were moved to the U.S. Post Office at Hannibal, Missouri, where they met until 1960. These two courts, along with the four courts of the Western District, made six courts for the state, and at the time no other state <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many separate federal courts. The district has since been further divided into the Eastern, Northern, and Southeast divisions.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{was already}} {{known for his}} concern for the Irish people and for writing several {{political}} pamphlets.

It was also known by the Irish authorities that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the Tory government of Queen Anne, {{and that he would}} use his abilities to undermine the Whig government of Walpole.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{defenses}} were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital {{foothold in the}} steppe transitional zone. Despite the withdrawal from the steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused {{the collapse of the}} early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that <b>had</b> <b>so</b> impressed and given pause to the Mongols {{since the beginning of the}} dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after.|$|E

5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that the Court had usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped.

She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War.

The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, with 230 RIR losing another 240.|$|E
5|$|The bishop's {{violent death}} itself was nothing {{exceptional}} and {{could well have}} happened.

A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again.
