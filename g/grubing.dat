30|$|The soil-dwelling larvae {{of several}} Scarabaeidae species (white <b>grubs),</b> like the {{cockchafer}} (Melolontha melolontha) {{and the garden}} chafer (Phyllopertha horticola), are serious pests in European cultivated grassland, reducing grass yield and destroying the turf by root-feeding. Nevertheless, the factors responsible {{for the development of}} large <b>grub</b> populations and the associated damage risk are poorly understood. The objectives of the study were to survey <b>grub</b> densities in grassland sites with different damage histories and find correlations with environmental and management variables. Data on <b>grub</b> densities were collected at 10 farms in the eastern Austrian Alps in September and October 2011. At each farm, one recently damaged site (high risk) and one site at which <b>grub</b> damage had never been observed by the farmers (undamaged site[*]=[*]low risk; each site: 500  m 2) were sampled. All sites were dominated by P. horticola (99 % of 1, 422 collected individuals; maximum density 303 grubs/m 2), which indicates that <b>grub</b> damage there is mainly caused by that species. Recently damaged sites tended to higher <b>grub</b> densities than undamaged sites. However, 3 out of 10 undamaged sites harbored high <b>grub</b> populations as well. Humus content together with the depth of the A-horizon significantly explained 38 % of P. horticola <b>grub</b> density variance, with highest densities in deeper humus-rich soils. The risk of <b>grub</b> damage was positively connected to the humus content and negatively related to the cutting frequency. For the investigated mountainous grassland sites, these results suggest an important role of humus for the development of high <b>grub</b> densities and an effect of management intensity on <b>grub</b> damage.|$|R
30|$|Even {{though we}} {{considered}} various environmental and management parameters, the significant relationships with <b>grub</b> density were few and the correlations were weak. This suggests further unknown factors covering {{the relationship between}} <b>grub</b> density and the measured or recorded parameters, e.g. irregular fluctuations of <b>grub</b> populations due to predators, diseases or intraspecific competition (Milne 1984, Juen and Traugott 2007, Laznik et al. 2012). Humus content and cutting frequency might both affect <b>grub</b> density via their influence on soil temperature, a factor which is probably highly important for the soil-dwelling <b>grubs</b> (Laughlin 1964, 1957 a, Milne 1984). But soil temperature strongly depends from local weather, which might as well confound the relationship between actual <b>grub</b> densities and site characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Two {{groups of}} white <b>grubs</b> {{are found in}} Iowa croplands: the true white <b>grub,</b> which can cause {{significant}} stand loss in corn and sometimes soybean; and the annual white <b>grub,</b> which probably does not cause stand loss in either crop. True white <b>grubs</b> are the larvae of June beetles (the big brown beetles that fly around yard lights during May and June evenings). They feed on the roots of seedling plants, causing them to wilt and die. True white <b>grubs</b> have a 3 -year life cycle and can reduce plant populations during 2 of these 3 years. Predicting what corn or soybean fields might have problems from true white <b>grubs</b> is nearly impossible...|$|R

30|$|As {{for field}} trials, sites were chosen wherefrom farmers had {{reported}} serious crop damage by white <b>grubs</b> the previous season. Population levels of white <b>grubs</b> were assessed through soil samplings prior to planting and again during weeding 15  days after crop emergence and during earthing up of Irish potatoes. Natural white <b>grub</b> populations were between 1 and 4 <b>grubs</b> per square metre. The dominant white <b>grub</b> genera were Anomala and Hoplochelus species as per morphological and DNA comparisons. But identification to species level {{was not possible}} in most cases {{due to lack of}} comparative information in DNA databases and difficulties to morphologically discriminate larval instars (Nyamwasa et al., 2017).|$|R
50|$|In {{tropical}} or subtropical climates, {{they might}} breed year-round, {{but in other}} climates, a greenhouse {{may be needed to}} obtain eggs in the cooler periods. The <b>grubs</b> are quite hardy and can handle more acidic conditions and higher temperatures than redworms. Larvae can survive cold winters, particularly with large numbers of <b>grubs,</b> insulation, or compost heat (generated by the microorganisms in the <b>grub</b> bin or compost pile). Heat stimulates the <b>grubs</b> to crawl off, pupate, and hatch, {{and a great deal of}} light and heat seem to be required for breeding. Many small-scale <b>grub</b> farmers build their larval colonies from eggs deposited by wild soldier flies.|$|R

40|$|New Zealand’s endemic longhorned beetle (Prionoplus reticularis) larvae, huhu <b>grub,</b> are {{xylophagous}} {{and feed}} {{on a broad}} range of dead trees. Since insects are not believed {{to have the ability to}} fully degrade lignocellulose, it is likely that microbes present in the gut assist in degrading lignocellulose to release energy rich sugars. This process is considered the rate limiting step in the utilisation of woody material in biofuel production. To better understand the gut consortium present while feeding on the lignocellulose and cellulose components, huhu <b>grubs</b> were initially collected and reared on non-degraded pine blocks (lignocellulose) or cotton (cellulose). The gut fungal and bacterial community of huhu <b>grubs</b> was investigated using high-throughput sequencing and analysis techniques. Furthermore, the effects of a dietary switch on both fungal and bacterial communities was explored by switching huhu <b>grubs</b> initially reared on pine to cotton, and vice versa. Cellulose- and lignocellulose-reared huhu <b>grubs</b> were expected to host a wide range of bacteria and fungi in their gut, some of which produce lignocellulose degrading enzymes. Assessment of the gut fungal community composition confirmed that cellulose-reared huhu <b>grubs</b> were significantly distinct from lignocellulose-reared <b>grubs.</b> The fungal community of lignocellulose-fed huhu <b>grubs</b> was more functionally diverse, with several yeasts, soft-rot fungi and potential hemicellulose and cellulose degraders present. Whereas, the fungal community of cellulose-reared <b>grubs</b> was mostly abundant in yeasts and potential cellulose degraders. When cotton-reared <b>grubs</b> where switched to pine (lignocellulose), lignocellulose was observed to have a ‘bottleneck effect’ or selective pressure on the fungal gut community. The gut bacterial community of huhu <b>grubs</b> reared on cellulose or lignocellulose diets seemed to be unaffected by the selective pressure of the diet, and no significant change in the bacterial community was observed following dietary switch. Therefore it was concluded that the bacterial community while still important is playing a secondary role to the fungi. Finally, bioprospecting studies conducted using the frass (excretia) of these huhu <b>grubs</b> resulted in the isolation of a bacterium, Acinetobacter H 23, capable of producing an extracellular laccase. Overall, the increased understanding of structure and composition of the gut microbiome of huhu <b>grubs</b> reared on cellulose or lignocellulose diets, along with isolation of novel lignocellulolytic isolates could prove to be significant for the biofuel industry...|$|R
