5000|$|... 1927 : Laurent Grivel {{designs and}} sells the first rock drill and <b>expansion</b> <b>bolt.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The first routes {{put up on}} new cliffs {{almost always}} follow cracks, due to the ease of placing protection, or pieces of {{equipment}} which arrest a fall, while on lead. Slab climbs rarely have cracks or other features that can be protected. Therefore, slab climbs are usually discovered well after the cracks are all climbed, since easier routes to the summit exist. Slab climbs can be dangerous to lead climb using traditional protection, or removable gear that fits into rock features, since the scarcity of natural features where protection can be placed results in long sections where the climber is exposed to long falls - over 150 ft on some routes. As a result, {{it was not until}} the introduction of bolting routes that hard slab lines could be climbed. In 1927, Laurent Grivel designed the first rock drill and <b>expansion</b> <b>bolt,</b> which paved the way for protecting climbs such as slab. The next advancement for slab climbing did not come until 1980 when Boreal marketed the first [...] "sticky rubber" [...] shoe, allowing friction climbing to be more feasible. Before this, most climbing was done in boots or thick soled shoes, which prevents the climber from making the balance dependent moves required on slab walls. Slab climbing saw a dramatic increase in the number of new routes with the introduction of lightweight, electric drills in the 1980s, but slowed down as criticism of permanent bolting grew, and electric drills became illegal in many National Parks and Wilderness Areas. A new generation of climbers has begun to revive slab climbing, putting up some of the hardest routes in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanical Plastics Corp. is {{a company}} based in Norwalk, Connecticut that [...] "produces screw anchors and toggle bolts used in the {{construction}} industry." [...] These anchors, which range from light-duty to heavy-duty, are [...] "used to fasten objects to walls, ceilings, and floors made of concrete, brick, cement block, drywall, and fiberglass". Mechanical Plastics Corp. currently contains two main divisions, TOGGLER and Wej-It. According to The New York Times, Mechanical Plastics currently distributes its products to twenty-four countries internationally, and these products are then sold at retail stores such as Lowe's. TOGGLER anchor system, whose patents are owned by Mechanical Plastics Corp., {{is used in the}} area of home improvement, when driving [...] "a screw or nail directly into a framing member behind the wall surface" [...] is not possible and it is necessary to choose a fastener that is [...] "specifically designed for gripping in the hollow spaces between the studs and joists." [...] The Popular Mechanics journal, states that [...] "The basic Toggler is the screw anchor which can work in both solid-wall and hollow-wall applications. It consists of a polypropylene anchor and a small plastic setting key. All you do is drill a hole in your wall and slide the anchor in place. For solid walls, the anchor is just wedged into the hole, like a normal plastic anchor. If the wall is hollow, you simply slide the key setting pin into the anchor and push." [...] As such, these Toggle bolts are used to [...] "support items like mirrors, framed artwork, and towel racks." [...] Mechanical Plastics Corp. also manufactures the Wej-It <b>expansion</b> <b>bolt,</b> which [...] "is a one-piece all-steel anchor for attaching anything to concrete, brick, or stone." ...|$|E
50|$|Harding's {{climbing}} {{style was}} considered controversial {{because he was}} more willing to employ artificial aids which become a permanent part of the environment, especially <b>expansion</b> <b>bolts.</b> These {{take a long time}} to put in, but are not removable, and as they can be put anywhere, take some of the skill and the risk out of rock climbing. Some critics, such as historian Steve Roper, English Mountain magazine editor Ken Wilson, and southern Californians like Robbins and Yvon Chouinard, felt that Harding's flamboyant willingness to use <b>expansion</b> <b>bolts</b> took some of the adventure away from climbing.|$|R

40|$|Key words: {{isolated}} coal barrier pillar; reused roadway; {{loading and}} unloading; yielding counter-pulled cable; hydraulic <b>expansion</b> <b>bolt</b> Abstract: Reused roadway in double-U shaped layout with an isolated barrier pillar subjects to two adjacent panels mining and has large deformation. In {{order to keep}} the reused roadway stable in its service life, numerical simulation, theoretical analysis and field observation were applied to investigate the deformation rule and failure mechanism of surrounding rock during mining period. Research results show that low strength and high stress difference environment is a fundamental reason of shear failure, different loading and unloading path in both ribs of roadway is the primary reason of asymmetric failure, and performance of bolting support is critical for the roadway stability. Therefore, control techniques of reused roadway are put forward that 1) high-strength and yielding bolts support the roof and ribs to adjust to massive convergence of roadway; 2) yielding counter-pulled cables reinforce small-pillar rib to strengthen the stability of samll coal pillar; and 3) hydraulic expansion bolts support the floor. The results have been successfully applied to a field trial...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{study on the}} fatigue {{behaviour}} of expansion anchor (M 16, grade 8. 8) for overhead contact system in electrification railways, a set of safe, practical loading device is designed and a fatigue test campaign was carried out at structural laboratory of China Academy of Building Research on expansion anchor embedded in concrete block. The mobile frame of the loading device was designed well by finite-element simulation. According to some fatigue performance test of expansion anchor with different size and form, the device have been assessed experimentally its dependability. The results were found that no fatigue damage phenomenon occurred in all specimens after 2 × 106 cycles tensile fatigue test in this specific series. It shows that in the condition of medium level or slightly lower maximum stress limit and nominal stress range, <b>expansion</b> <b>bolt</b> has good fatigue resistance. The biggest relative displacement and the residual relative displacement after test (Δδ = δ 2 -δ 1) was also strongly lower than {{the symbol of the}} fatigue test failure index of this specific series (0. 5 mm) in the high cycle fatigue regime. The ultimate tension failures mode after fatigue tests in all tested samples take place in the concrete anchorage zone. The reduction range of the ultimate tensile strength properties of the anchorage system was not obvious, and the concrete was seen to be the weakest link of the system...|$|E
40|$|Soil Nailing is a {{technique}} for reinforcing soil in situ, increasingly utilised as an economical alternative to conventional earth reinforcing techniques. However, today the design {{is based on an}} assumed value of the pullout capacity of nails, which later is verified by pullout tests during the construction, which in turn limits the possibility of optimising the design. The objective of this study was therefore to get {{a better understanding of the}} pullout capacity and to suggest a method for more accurate prediction. The study comprised; laboratory tests (to study the influence of overburden pressure, relative density and method of installation) and full-scale field tests (to compare the pullout capacity among different soil nails and with results of site investigation methods). The results were then compared with design methods and results from FEM analysis. The results show that the pullout capacity in a cohesionless soil mainly depends on; the coefficient of roughness, surface area and normal stress. An increase in relative density, overburden pressure, and volume of displaced soil will result in an increase in pullout capacity. The coefficient of roughness and surface area could be estimated with quite good accuracy while the normal stress against the nail is more difficult to determine. The best prediction of the pullout capacity seems to be obtained from pullout tests on vertical nails. The greatest pullout capacity was, as expected obtained for grouted nails, but at the test carried out about 300 days after installation a driven <b>expansion</b> <b>bolt</b> and the angle bar gave an almost equals high capacity. A significantly lower pullout capacity was obtained for the ribbed bars, and for these nails no time dependency could be found. The analysis indicates that methods based on the theory of cavity expansion could be used to calculate the normal stress after local calibration...|$|E

25|$|Good {{practices}} in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate {{that there be}} good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the foundation using <b>expansion</b> <b>bolts</b> inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.|$|R
40|$|There {{are a lot}} {{of tasks}} in {{building}} construction and maintenance which demand either the carriage of heavy technological equipment along vertical and sloping surfaces and/or provision for force technological operations on such surfaces For example, surface cleaning or grinding by automatic equipment, the mounting of <b>expansion</b> <b>bolts</b> and anchors by drilling or by driving in. Additionally surface inspection by heavy measuring devices and the painting of big construction areas are difficult and expensive to perform manually. It is therefore expedient to apply climbing robots to automate these tractive power operations. The climbing robot was developed for such purposes. The design of the robot with increased load capacity and improved gripper system was carefully considered. The robot has a video camera for orientation and for the monitoring of processes. A sensor-based computer control system is used.

40|$|Abstract The bolt {{load loss}} {{behavior}} of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy bolted joints with a conventional SCM 435 steel bolt and an A 5056 aluminum bolt was investigated at elevated temperature. The A 5056 bolt {{could reduce the}} bolt load loss compared to the SCM 435 bolt due to smaller mismatch of thermal <b>expansion</b> between the <b>bolt</b> material and the plates. The mismatch of thermal <b>expansion</b> between <b>bolt</b> material and AZ 91 D plates was found to induce the compressive creep deformation in the AZ 91 D plates which performed as the main mechanism of bolt load loss. At higher tightening stress, the bolt load loss could be intensified by additional plastic deformation in bolt occurred during the test. Moreover, {{it is suggested that}} the plastic deformation could be reduced by decreasing the friction condition in the bolted joint...|$|R
2500|$|The Nose {{was first}} climbed in 1958 by Warren Harding, Wayne Merry and George Whitmore in 47 days using [...] "siege" [...] tactics: {{climbing}} in an expedition style using fixed ropes {{along the length}} of the route, linking established camps along the way. The fixed manila ropes allowed the climbers to ascend and descend from the ground up throughout the 18-month project, although they presented unique levels of danger as well, sometimes breaking due to the long exposure to cold temperatures. The climbing team relied heavily on aid climbing, using rope, pitons and <b>expansion</b> <b>bolts</b> to make it to the summit. The second ascent of The Nose was in 1960 by Royal Robbins, Joe Fitschen, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost, who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics. The first solo climb of The Nose was done by Tom Bauman in 1969. The first ascent of The Nose in one day was accomplished in 1975 by John Long, Jim Bridwell and Billy Westbay. Today, The Nose typically takes fit climbers 4–5 days of full climbing, and has a success rate of around 60%.|$|R
5000|$|The first men {{to climb}} to the summit of Cima Brenta were Douglas Freshfield and Francis Fox Tuckett. with Henri Devouassoud from Chamonix in August 1871. They {{approached}} the mountain from the west and ascended mainly over the snow of the vedrette. This itinerary would remain {{the only way for}} a number of years, until Albert DeFalkner and E.T.Compton found a new itinerary from the south in 1882. Carlo Garbari with companions traced in 1892 a new route over the northern edge towards the ledge on the east side that bears his name today and from there through a series of gullies to the summit. This route, and a variant traced in 1902 by Hanns Barth a.o. in 1902, are now considered the Via Normale. [...] In 1910, The Kiene brothers, {{made it to the top}} over the complete northwest ridge from Cima Massari over the jagged pinnacles that are now called Torri di Kiene. The majestic east face was not attempted until 1930, when Mario Agostini and A. Moser opened the Via Agostini-Moser (UIAA: IV, 650 m.). This route follows a winding trajectory through the northern part of the East Wall. Matteo Armani and Marcello Friedrichsen realized the via Diretta in 1936 (V, 500 m.). A year later Silvio Agostini died on Cima Brenta in an accident and Armani climbed and baptized Torre Caigo, a pinnacle on the south face of Cima Mandrone, in his honor. Other challenging trajectories were climbed by renown climbers in the decades following on all parts of the mountain. The first skiing descent down the NW couloir from the top was accomplished by Heini Holzer and Ander Tscholl in 1970. The first epic ascent of the hard north face through the hanging glacier was made by Giovanni Groaz, Lorenzo Groaz and Romano Segalla (August 1974). The imposing orange wall within the east face remained however the last big problem of the Brenta and unchallenged until 1964. By then, even the most repelling rock faces were conquered by means of artificial climbing. It took three men three days, 150 pitons, 18 <b>expansion</b> <b>bolts</b> and 15 other devices to force their way upward to the Garbari ridge (Via Verona: VI, A3, Ae, 650 m.) At the time, the 40-hour climb of Franco Baschera, Claudio Boscho and Milo Navasa was considered an enormous achievement. But the use of <b>expansion</b> <b>bolts</b> and other artificial means in general became subject of criticism. In the end it took until 2002 for this route to be free-climbed on sight by Rolando Larcher and Franco Cavallero in a mere eleven hours.|$|R

40|$|The {{basic type}} of rock mass {{reinforcement}} method for both preparatory and operational workings in underground metal ore mines, both in Poland {{and in different}} countries across the world, is the expansion shell or adhesive-bonded rock bolt. The article discusses results of static loading test of the <b>expansion</b> shell rock <b>bolts</b> equipped with originally developed deformable component. This component consists of two profiled rock bolt washers, two disk springs, and three guide bars. The disk spring and disk washer material differs in stiffness. The construction materials ensure that at first the springs under loading are partially compressed, and then the rock bolt washer is plastically deformed. The rock bolts tested were installed in blocks simulating a rock mass with rock compressive strength of 80 MPa. The rock bolt was loaded statically until its ultimate loading capacity was exceeded. The study presents the results obtained under laboratory conditions in the test rig allowing testing of the rock bolts at their natural size, as used in underground metal ore mines. The stress-strain/displacement characteristics of the <b>expansion</b> shell rock <b>bolt</b> with the deformable component were determined experimentally. The relationships between the geometric parameters and specific strains or displacements of the bolt rod were described, and the percentage contribution of those values in total displacements, resulting from the deformation of rock bolt support components (washer, thread) and the expansion shell head displacements, were estimated. The stiffness of the yielded and stiff bolts was empirically determined, including stiffness parameters of every individual part (deformable component, steel rod). There were two phases of displacement observed during the static tension of the rock bolt which differed in their intensity...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the New Wuchieh and Lishi Creek Transbasin Tunnel Project was to {{construct}} an additional tunnel system connecting the existing Wuchieh Dam and the new Lishi Dam to the Sun-Moon Lake Reservoir, parallel to the existing transbasin tunnel which was built more than 70 years ago.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} work was to investigate and develop modelling techniques capable of accurately and robustly analysing <b>expansion</b> anchor <b>bolts</b> in concrete under tensile loading. Of special interest was the influence of low edge distances on such devices. Since the 20 th century increased demands for flexibility, safety and cost have lead to significant development of new anchor products. Modern design methods for new products follow a scientific approach but still rely on substantial and expensive programs of experimental testing. Current design methods for structural designers using anchors are based on semi-empirical approaches derived from extensive experimental testing. It is proposed that much of this experimental work can be replaced with numerical modelling. A number of suitable finite element constitutive models are considered. Initially a Multisurface Plasticity Model and a Traditional Crack Model using a Multiple Fixed Crack (MFC) formulation are considered. Both are shown to give satisfactory results when used to analyse a common, plane-stress benchmark problem. However, although the Plasticity Model gave a better post peak response a 3 D implementation was not available within the chosen FE framework. Spurious stress accumulation was identified {{as the cause of}} the problems with the MFC Model and its various causes are investigated in detail. A Total Strain Based Rotating Crack Model was chosen as an alternative constitutive model and together with suitable modelling parameters was able to reduce these spurious stress accumulation effects to an acceptable level. 3 D modelling of a non-expanding, fully bonded anchor at various distances to the free edge accurately predicted the expected reduction in strength and compared well with reduction factors supplied by anchor manufacturers. The study was extended to include the effect of two free edges and results allowed the strength reduction to be calculated for any arbitrary position rather than for just the single edge approach given in the anchor design guides. Modelling of anchor expansion was tackled on two fronts. Firstly anchor-concrete interfacial behaviour was considered. A Coulomb Friction Model applied to zero thickness structural interface elements to simulate the pressure dependant frictional bond. The role of FE model geometry and material properties in producing a realistic interfacial stress profile was studied in detail. For the kinematics of the expansion modelling of the expander mechanism as a contact problem was found to be the most accurate approach. However, limitations of the modelling framework required that the contact analysis be performed separately and resulting contact stress profile be applied to the existing, noncontact problem. This approach, although somewhat inflexible, provided a useful insight into the important factors pertaining to both the geometric and constitutive models. Results showed realistic crack patterns and demonstrated the effect of varying expansion pressures on the structural response of the anchor bolt. The modelling approach used in this study was highly complex in terms of the multiple non-linear material models and the associated solution process. This resulted in problems with robustness and stability. As an alternative and inherently stable modelling framework a Sequentially Linear (SL) Model was developed. In its isotropic form it proved fast, accurate and reliable for plane-stress anchor problems. Orthotropic fracturing and 3 D analysis capabilities were introduced to the model and a number of rules for crack initiation and orientation were tested. Although limitations in the possible crack orientations produced significant mesh bias to the crack pattern, the model was able to capture the changes in anchor behaviour associated with reduced edge distance. The overall assessment is that that SL Model has great potential especially for highly nonlinear problems where stability and robustness are issues...|$|R
