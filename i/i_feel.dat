5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like I am playing a horn. I try to improvise. What comes out is what <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b>|$|E

5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>feel</b> very {{strongly}} {{that it will be}} impossible to find a solution to the political problems of Europe and remove the present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve the economic position... it is vital for the prestige and future wellbeing of the League that it should afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement.|$|E
5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths... People don't like to hear we've got only 18 percent of the electorate. They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban communities is not what it should be... But <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E

5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Not doing {{anything}} creative is nearly killing me.

5|$|The show's monologues are sourced {{largely from}} Beckerman's book. The Ephrons wove {{together}} {{a collection of}} stories adapted from the book with recollections of friends, including Rosie O'Donnell.

5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{that talking}} about it trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.

25|$|It {{appears to}} me that the {{developers}} have been completely indifferent to, or perhaps have even welcomed, this deterioration in the condition of the building, and have done virtually nothing to halt it. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> the developers have shown a complete disregard for the moral obligations which arose from their course of dealing with the corporation or the planning applications; but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> the corporation have also been extremely remiss to exercising whatever statutory powers were open to them to cope with the situation.|$|E
