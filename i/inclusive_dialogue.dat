50|$|He {{believes}} that the Afghan and US government {{were not able to}} define their relationship during more than a decade. Hamdam wrote in his opinion editorial, A Decade of Relations Without Definition, that the Afghan-U.S. relationship should not be only based on dying and killing for each other, but it should be based on social, economic and political interests as well. Numerous opportunities already exist to build that long-term and stable relationship. At the moment, some Afghans see the presence of the U.S. in Afghanistan as a world policing and a force against Al-Qaeda and Taliban. What if there are no more Taliban and war in Afghanistan? How will the U.S. and Afghan government justify their relations? Should this relationship remain merely a donor-recipient exchange, a relationship only to finance, train and advise Afghan National Security Forces? These questions are urgent. The two countries must, through <b>inclusive</b> <b>dialogue,</b> define their relationship and must reach for a vision beyond a militarized association.|$|E

This paper is an initial contextual desk study based on World Bank in-house interviews. The paper asserts that the four CDF principles (ownership, comprehensive analysis, accountability for development results and partnership) are indeed applicable for assistance to countries in or at risk of violent conflict. If the contribution towards peace and stability for meeting the Millennium Agenda goal of halving poverty by 2015 is to be met {{it is essential to}} mitigate the negative effects of violent conflict that deter economic development and poverty reduction efforts. The best preparation for responding quickly and effectively in post-conflict situations — while taking the CDF principles into account — is a timely presence on the ground, with operational resources to facilitate <b>inclusive</b> <b>dialogues</b> and effective partnerships.
