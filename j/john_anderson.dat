5|$|In 1920, Albert Michelson and Francis Pease {{mounted a}} 6-meter {{interferometer}} {{on the front}} of the 2.5-meter telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. Helped by <b>John</b> <b>Anderson,</b> the trio measured the angular diameter of Betelgeuse at 0.047", a figure which resulted in a diameter of 3.84×108km (2.58 AU) based on the parallax value of 0.018". However, limb darkening and measurement errors resulted in uncertainty about the accuracy of these measurements.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne was {{constructed}} by Vickers-Armstrongs at their Naval Construction Yard in Barrow-in-Furness, England. The ship was laid down as HMS Majestic on 15 April 1943, and was launched on 28 February 1945 by Lady Anderson, {{the wife of}} Sir <b>John</b> <b>Anderson,</b> the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. Following the end of World War II, the Admiralty ordered the suspension of many British shipbuilding projects, including the fitting out of Majestic and her five sister ships. Construction resumed in 1946, and major modifications to the design were incorporated.|$|E
5|$|The Abercromby baronets owned a {{significant}} amount of property in Ireland, as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from <b>John</b> <b>Anderson</b> in the early 19th century. By 1814 Forglen was used as the main family seat of the Abercromby family; in 1877 they also acquired Dunlugas House, which was sited {{on the other side of}} the River Deveron. Lady Jane Abercromby's son, Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, continued to enhance the grandeur of the estate policies by commissioning the building of a new mansion and several other buildings.|$|E

(Koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing the scratch-off lottery ticket.) That year, Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed National Popular Vote, a non-profit group to promote the legislation. The group has a transpartisan advisory committee including former US Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives <b>John</b> <b>Anderson,</b> John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is dateless for ex-boyfriend Floyd DeBarber's (Jason Sudeikis) wedding, {{and does}} not want to be alone. She revisits her old boyfriends—Drew Baird (Jon Hamm) and Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters)—but the visits do not go well. Later, at a party, Liz learns from Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), her office assistant, that she will be seated next to Wesley Snipes (Michael Sheen)—a man whom Liz despises—at Cerie's wedding. As a result of this, Liz invites Wesley as her date to Floyd's wedding. At the wedding, Wesley reveals that he has lost his job, and needs Liz to get him U.S. residency, and proposes {{marriage}} to her. After an unsuccessful conversation with Mike (<b>John</b> <b>Anderson),</b> a friend of Floyd's, Liz agrees to marry Wesley.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} was to broach the matter with the Canadians. The Lord President, Sir <b>John</b> <b>Anderson,</b> as the {{minister}} responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British High Commissioner to Canada, Malcolm MacDonald, who had been involved in Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding Eldorado's uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E

5|$|At {{the meeting}} with Roosevelt on October 9, 1941, Bush {{advocated}} cooperating with the United Kingdom, and he began corresponding with his British counterpart, Sir <b>John</b> <b>Anderson.</b> But by October 1942, Conant and Bush agreed that a joint project would pose security risks and be more complicated to manage. Roosevelt approved a Military Policy Committee recommendation stating that information given to the British {{should be limited to}} technologies that they were actively working on and should not extend to post-war developments. In July 1943, on a visit to London to learn about British progress on antisubmarine technology, Bush, Stimson and Bundy met with Anderson, Lord Cherwell and Winston Churchill at 10 Downing Street. At the meeting, Churchill forcefully pressed for a renewal of interchange, while Bush defended current policy. Only when he returned to Washington did he discover that Roosevelt had agreed with the British. The Quebec Agreement merged the two atomic bomb projects, creating the Combined Policy Committee with Stimson, Bush and Conant as United States representatives.|$|E
5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir <b>John</b> <b>Anderson</b> wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
5|$|Howe cabled Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} appraisal {{of the cost of}} the proposed laboratory. Sir <b>John</b> <b>Anderson</b> replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.|$|E

5|$|Oliphant {{took the}} Frisch–Peierls {{memorandum}} to Sir Henry Tizard, {{the chairman of}} the Tizard Committee, and the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. A new directorate known by the deliberately misleading name of Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort. Sir <b>John</b> <b>Anderson,</b> the Lord President of the Council, became the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.|$|E

5|$|In the {{off-season}} Breslin again re-signed with the Wolves. Chicago also brought in <b>John</b> <b>Anderson</b> {{to be the}} team's new head coach. Under Anderson, Breslin had posted a career high in assists with 26 and games played with 81. Chicago won the West division and finished with the second-best record in the league. In the postseason the Wolves stormed through the first three rounds, losing only four games, {{to advance to the}} 1998 Turner Cup Finals. In game 1 of the finals against the Detroit Vipers, Chicago blew a two-goal lead early in the third period. They regained the lead with just over eight minutes to play. In the final minutes of the game, Breslin added an insurance empty net goal giving the Wolves a 4–2 victory. It was Breslin's only goal of the playoffs. The series eventually went to a seventh and deciding game that the Wolves won 3–0 to capture the franchise's first Turner Cup. For the 1998–99 season Breslin's production dipped to 7 goals and 21 points. The Wolves advanced to the third round the playoffs, but Breslin played in only 4 of the team's 10 games. On the first day of training camp the following year, Breslin announced his retirement from professional hockey.|$|E
