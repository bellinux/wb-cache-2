But besides a picture of Adolf Hitler cut out from a newspaper, graffiti displaying a swastika on his door, a few books on World War II, as well as a documentary about David Koresh and the Waco siege, no evidence was found after his death that he was interested in any kind of politics. Also, a girl from Cuers spread the story that Eric had told her about his relationship with his half-sister Caroline, {{who was supposed to be}} his pregnant girlfriend.

2500|$|During {{his early}} life, Emerson seems {{to develop a}} {{hierarchy}} of races based on faculty to reason or rather, whether African slaves were distinguishably equal to white men based {{on their ability to}} reason. In a journal entry written in 1822, Emerson wrote about a personal observation: [...] "It can hardly be true that the difference lies in the attribute of reason. I saw ten, twenty, a hundred large lipped, lowbrowed black men in the streets who, except in the mere matter of language, did not exceed the sagacity of the elephant. Now is <b>it</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> these were created superior to this wise animal, and designed to control it? And in comparison with the highest orders of men, the Africans will stand so low as to make the difference which subsists between themselves & the sagacious beasts inconsiderable." ...|$|E

[...] She became an activist in matters concerning racial politics and civil rights in the USA, and visited Harlem. [...] In 1931 she published the pamphlet Black Man and White Ladyship, an attack on racist attitudes as exemplified by Cunard's mother, whom she quoted as saying [...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> my daughter knows a Negro?" [...] She also edited the massive Negro Anthology, collecting poetry, fiction, and nonfiction primarily by African-American writers, including Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. It also included writing by George Padmore and Cunard's own account of the Scottsboro Boys case. [...] Press attention to this project in May 1932, two years before it was published, led to Cunard's receiving anonymous threats and hate mail, some of which she published in the book, expressing regret that [...] " [...] are obscene, so this portion of American culture cannot be made public." ...|$|E
5000|$|Conjunction {{introduction}} (often abbreviated {{simply as}} conjunction and also called and introduction) {{is a valid}} rule of inference of propositional logic. The rule {{makes it possible to}} introduce a conjunction into a logical proof. It is the inference that if the proposition p is true, and proposition q is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions p and q is true. For example, if <b>it's</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> raining, and <b>it's</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> I'm inside, then <b>it's</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it's raining and I'm inside".

2500|$|One of {{the most}} famous and {{stimulating}} problems in graph theory is the four color problem: [...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors, {{in such a way that}} any two regions having a common border have different colors?" [...] This problem was first posed by Francis Guthrie in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of De Morgan addressed to Hamilton the same year. Many incorrect proofs have been proposed, including those by Cayley, Kempe, and others. The study and the generalization of this problem by Tait, Heawood, Ramsey and Hadwiger led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary genus. Tait's reformulation generated a new class of problems, the factorization problems, particularly studied by Petersen and Kőnig. The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by Turán in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory, extremal graph theory.|$|E
