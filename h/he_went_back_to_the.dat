5|$|At 09:00 on 21 October, US 3/187 RCT {{began to}} advance south {{to clear the}} Sukchon to Yongju road towards Pyongyang. The American paratroopers {{advanced}} on two fronts, with I Company moving along the railway line and K Company along the highway. At 13:00 I Company reached Opa-ri, where it encountered a strong North Korean force estimated as a battalion, equipped with 120mm mortars and 40mm guns. I Company was caught in an ambush. The North Koreans subsequently attacked the paratroopers and after a battle lasting two-and-a-half hours, they overran two American platoons. I Company was forced to withdraw west of the railway to Hill 281 having suffered 90 men missing. Despite their success, the North Koreans subsequently withdrew to their own defensive positions in the high ground around Opa-ri. Amid the fighting, an American medic attached to I Company, Private First Class Richard G. Wilson, was killed while attempting to reach a wounded {{man who had been}} left behind, and he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Wilson had repeatedly exposed himself to North Korean fire to render aid to the wounded, and later helped many to safety following the order to withdraw. On hearing that one of the Americans previously thought to be dead had been seen attempting to crawl to safety, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battlefield to search for him and had disappeared. Two days later a patrol found Wilson lying dead beside the man he had returned to rescue, having been shot while trying to shield him from further injury.|$|E

25|$|RCA Records {{dismissed}} DeWyze {{from his}} contract in 2011, {{due to the}} poor performance of his previous album, Live It Up. Undaunted by this setback, DeWyze set out to write music {{that would be more}} in line with his own vision, feeling that RCA had not understood him as an artist. Having previously released two independent albums, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> folk rock sound of those albums, while also incorporating elements of pop, rockabilly and bluegrass.

25|$|He first gained {{prominence}} in November 1953 when he tracked down the former Thomas C. Buntin and his wife. The bizarre case involved {{the son of}} a wealthy Nashville business owner who had disappeared in September 1931, followed six weeks later by the disappearance of his secretary. Seigenthaler was sent to Texas by The Tennessean after reports surfaced that Buntin (now known as Thomas D. Palmer) was living somewhere in the Lone Star state. After a series of dead-ends, Seigenthaler struck pay dirt in Orange, Texas, where he saw an elderly man step off a bus. Noting the man's distinctive left ear, Seigenthaler followed him home. After three further days of investigation, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home, where he confirmed the identities of Buntin/Palmer, his wife, the former Betty McCuddy, and their six children. Seigenthaler won a National Headliner Award for the story.|$|E

25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E
