40|$|The {{global market}} for {{exchange-traded}} funds (ETFs) has exhibited strong growth in recent years, reaching US$ 2. 3 trillion {{by the end}} of 2013. ETFs have clear advantages for investors, such as low-cost portfolio diversification and the liquidity of an exchange-traded product. However, recent disruptions in certain ETF pro-ducts have highlighted the need to better understand the vulnerabilities and risks associated with this market. ETFs are generally perceived by investors as having equity-like liquidity, but in times of stress, this liqui-dity may prove illusory for some funds. Synthetic ETFs also carry additional counterparty and collateral risk. If any of these risks materialized, it could trigger an <b>investor</b> <b>run,</b> which could negatively impact the underlying market as well as other similar funds. The synthetic ETF market in Canada has a high concentration of counterparty risk compared with other jurisdictions. However, given the small size of this market segment, it does not represent a signifi-cant vulnerability for the Canadian financial system. Nonetheless, rapid changes in the ETF market imply that authorities need to monitor developments closely...|$|E

40|$|After Lehman's {{collapse}} in 2008, <b>investors</b> <b>ran</b> from risky money market funds. In 27 funds, outflows overwhelmed cash inflows, thus forcing asset sales.

Over the subsequent quarter, however, the hard-hit funds reduced risk {{more than other}} funds. In contrast, money funds hit by idiosyncratic liquidity shocks before Lehman did not alter portfolio risk. The result suggests that moral hazard concerns with the Treasury Guarantee of investor claims did not increase risk taking. Funds that benefited most from the government bailout reduced risk.

The two forces amplify each other dynamically, resulting in the market collapse. We also find that the likelihood of auction failures and ARS reset rates depend significantly on both the rule {{and the level of}} maximum auction rates; that, as predicted by auction theories, there is also strong evidence for underpricing after dealers withdrew their liquidity supports; and that liquidity in the non-auction secondary market may encourage aggressive bidding that increases the reset rates...|$|R

40|$|What {{circumstances}} or policies leave sovereign borrowers at {{the mercy}} of self-fulfilling increases in interest rates? To answer this question, we study the dynamics of debt and interest rates in a model where default is driven by insolvency. Fiscal deficits and surpluses are subject to shocks but influenced by a fiscal policy rule. Whenever possible the government issues debt to meet its current obligations and defaults otherwise. We show that low and high interest rate equilibria may coexist. Higher interest rates, prompted by fears of default, lead to faster debt accumulation, validating default fears. We call such an equilibrium a slow moving crisis, in contrast to rollover crises where <b>investor</b> <b>runs</b> precipitate immediate default. We investigate how the existence of multiple equilibria is affected by the fiscal policy rule, the maturity of debt, and the level of debt...|$|R

40|$|Agency {{problems}} in firms are prevalent because effective corporate monitors are scarce. This paper presents {{a model that}} formalizes the scarcity of effective monitors and explores its implications for corporate monitoring mechanisms and ownership structures. We call the most effective monitors - wealthy investors with corporate governance ability – “restructuring specialists”. Their special monitoring ability is a scarce resource in the economy. These restructuring specialists are more effective monitors than coalitions of many small <b>investors</b> <b>run</b> by managers, which face their own agency problems that make them less effective at monitoring. The restructuring specialists {{have an incentive to}} acquire blocks for restructuring purposes only in those states {{of the world in which}} a restructuring increases firm value the most. This corresponds to a takeover. The restructuring specialists’ investment strategy is an important determinant of corporate ownership structures. Initially dispersed ownership can be optimal only if sufficient liquidity trading allows these special monitors to benefit from state-contingent block acquisitions. The extent of dispersed ownership also depends on the degree of monitoring superiority of the restructuring specialists and the capital available to them, as well as the likelihood that a restructuring may be needed. Firms with initially dispersed ownership and with a financial intermediary as a blockholder can coexist although they are otherwise identical. The model can explain several observations concerning ownership structures and monitoring mechanisms in different developed economies...|$|R
40|$|For {{the average}} {{investor}} {{trying to save}} for retirement or a child’s college fund, the world of investing has become increasingly complex. These retail investors must turn more frequently to financial intermediaries, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to get sound investment advice. Such intermediaries perform different duties for their clients, however. The investment adviser owes his client a fiduciary duty of care and therefore must provide financial advice {{that is in the}} client’s best interests, while the broker-dealer must merely provide advice that is suitable to the client’s interests—a lower standard than the fiduciary duty of care. And yet these divergent standards are not necessarily evident to the average investor. As a result, <b>investors</b> <b>run</b> the risk of being placed into suboptimal investments by broker-dealers. Two competing solutions to this issue have been proposed: a higher fiduciary standard for both broker-dealers and investment advisers and a less burdensome disclosure standard in which broker-dealers would inform their clients that they are not fiduciaries. This Note analyzes these potential reforms using a traditional economics analysis as well as new behavioral-economics research. It concludes that a fiduciary standard more effectively protects investors and that a disclosure standard would actually have the perverse effect of making investors more susceptible to behavioral biases that can impair their ability to invest properly...|$|R

The pre-event runs are about half the size of runs that follow announcements, which is about 1 % of total assets per month. In addition, <b>investors</b> who <b>run</b> before litigation announcements earn significantly higher risk- and peer-adjusted returns than those who run after because, as the return data on fund holdings show, the former avoid fire-sale costs. In funds holding illiquid assets or funds incurring large outflows, the cumulative differences in abnormal returns can be as high as 6 %. Hence, our analysis suggests that a pro-rata ownership design is not sufficient to prevent runs in mutual funds...|$|R
