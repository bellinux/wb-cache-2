2500|$|The {{human species}} {{developed}} {{a much larger}} brain than that of other primates—typically [...] in modern humans, over {{twice the size of}} that of a chimpanzee or gorilla.

The pattern of human postnatal brain growth differs from that of other apes (heterochrony), and allows for extended periods of social learning and language acquisition in juvenile humans. However, the differences between the structure of human brains and those of other apes may be even more significant than differences in size. The increase in volume over time has affected different areas within the brain unequally– the temporal lobes, which contain centers for language processing have increased disproportionately, as has the prefrontal cortex which has been related to complex decision making and moderating social behavior.

40|$|Background: We {{explored}} {{the expression of}} Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) in lung carcinomas and its association with clinico-pathological features and prognosis. FAS is a recently discovered molecule involved in the energy supply of normal cells. FAS is also overexpressed in neoplastic tissues because of their <b>increased</b> <b>necessity</b> for energy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and six patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma were followed-up for an average period of 5 years. FAS expression was detected immunohistochemically. Results: FAS staining was observed in 61 out of 106 cases (57. 54 %). Statistical analysis revealed that FAS had an overall low prognostic value (p= 0. 14), while FAS-negative expression in stage I patients showed a trend for better survival (p= 0. 10). PTNM stage (p 0. 0001) was the only significant prognostic marker for overall survival. Conclusion: FAS is a reliable marker of low-stage clinically aggressive lung carcinomas. The determination of FAS expression in lung carcinomas may stratify patients and determine therapeutic approaches for their care. Note...|$|E

30|$|During last years, {{considering}} the <b>increased</b> <b>necessity</b> of availability assurance of an efficient and coordinated supply chain, supplier selection is {{as a basic}} component. Because, {{one of the most}} important relationships between the supply chain members is the coordination between the focal company and the suppliers (Yousefi et al. 2016). Studies on supplier selection are mostly focused on decision-making methods (Ho et al. 2010). In the CLSC, the relationship between manufacturer and supplier is set in a closed-loop while in reverse logistic, new parts are provided from external suppliers. The point is that, compared to open-loop supply chains (OLSC), criteria related to production performance and parts’ features should be more important in CLSCs and reverse logistics. Because not only parts and supplier criteria should be considered, but also process criteria such as process ability and flexibility are essential. Furthermore, criteria related to environment and environmental protection is among reverse logistic and CLSC goals (Amin and Zhang 2012). Therefore, a close attention should be paid to process elements in supplier selection process of reverse logistic.|$|E
