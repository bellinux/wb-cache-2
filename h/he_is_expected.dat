5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can convert a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of eights, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E

5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E
5|$|In late 2009, Dover was {{selected}} as a Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian dressage team, with a contract that extended through the 2010 World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky. After the Games, {{it was announced that}} Dover and the Canadian team {{had not been able to}} agree on contract renewal terms, but in late 2010 it was announced that Dover would remain as the interim trainer for the first quarter of 2011. In March 2011, German equestrian Markus Gribbe was hired, and Dover's term as a Canadian coach came to an end. Dover is known for his coaching abilities, with some of the best dressage riders with top international titles to their credit coming from his stables.

25|$|Omertà is a code {{of silence}} and secrecy that forbids mafiosi from betraying their comrades to the authorities. The penalty for {{transgression}} is death, and relatives of the turncoat may also be murdered. Mafiosi generally do not associate with police (aside perhaps from corrupting individual officers as necessary). For instance, a mafioso will not call the police when he {{is a victim of}} a crime. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> {{to take care of the}} problem himself. To do otherwise would undermine his reputation as a capable protector of others (see below), and his enemies may see him as weak and vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Christian Timmann and Christian Meyer, {{medical doctors}} and {{scientists}} at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany, have used the most recent medical testing done on Tutankhamun's mummy by Dr. Hawass and have concluded that Tutankhamun did not die {{from a combination of}} bone disease and malaria, but instead had sickle-cell disease. Dr. Timmann and Dr. Meyer believed the sickle-cell disease turned fatal when Tutankhamun also contracted severe malaria that was rampant in Ancient Egypt during his era. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to have been homozygous recessive for the sickle cell gene, thus making him not immune to severe malaria, which would have been fatal.|$|E

25|$|Incumbent {{president}} Miloš Zeman {{is running}} for reelection. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to be supported by Freedom and Direct Democracy and Dawn - National Coalition.

ANO 2011 also planed to hold a presidential primary but decided to not. It was speculated that both parties may select Zeman as their candidate, but ČSSD leader Bohuslav Sobotka announced that his party probably would not support Zeman due to his actions during the Czech government crisis in May 2017. It was reported that ČSSD planned to nominate Lubomír Zaorálek who decided to not run.

500|$|The episode {{featured}} several appearances {{by several}} frequent guest stars, including Todd Buonopane as NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav, Cheyenne Jackson as TGS cast member Danny Baker, Chris Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman, and Sherri Shepherd as Angie Jordan {{the wife of}} Tracy Jordan. Buonopane, Jackson, Parnell, and Shepherd made their fifth, eighth, sixteenth, and sixth appearances on the show, respectively. In an interview with TV Guide in November 2010, co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that Shepherd's character [...] "will be getting her own Real Housewives-type reality show. Having the cameras around forces Tracy to act on better behavior." [...] This {{is evident in the}} following episode [...] "Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning". Tina Fey, the series creator, executive producer and lead actress on 30 Rock, told Entertainment Weekly, in regards to Angie's reality show, [...] "We're hoping to, maybe, if we can get away with it, do an entire episode that's just an episode of Queen of Jordan. Now I'm just superimposing my own TV viewing habits onto 30 Rock." [...] In the episode, Dr. Spaceman informs Tracy Jordan—played by Tracy Morgan—that he is dying, television columnist Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times wondered if this subplot was written as {{a way to deal with}} Tracy Morgan's recent kidney transplant as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to miss several episodes to recover from the procedure.|$|E

500|$|The 2008 NFL Draft {{was held}} on April 26 and April 27, 2008, at Radio City Music Hall. In the first round, the Steelers {{selected}} running back Rashard Mendenhall, from the University of Illinois, with the 23rd overall pick. He was the first running back selected {{in the first round}} by the franchise since 1989. The Steelers selected Limas Sweed, from the University of Texas, in the second round. Sweed was ranked by the Steelers {{as one of the top}} three receivers in the draft. The drafting of Sweed came after quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's suggestion of acquiring a tall wide receiver; Sweed is 6-feet 4-inches in height. In round three, the Steelers selected Bruce Davis, of UCLA. Davis primarily played defensive end at his alma mater, however, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to switch to linebacker at the pro level. The Steelers traded their fourth-round pick (123rd overall) to the New York Giants for the Giants' fourth and sixth-round selections, 130th and 194th overall, respectively. The Steelers selected offensive tackle Tony Hills with the 130th overall selection, in the fourth round. Like second-round pick Sweed, Hills came out of the University of Texas where he had been elected a captain of the football team during his senior season. With their fifth-round selection, the Steelers chose quarterback Dennis Dixon. Prior to an injury in 2007, Dixon was a Heisman Trophy candidate. The sixth round selection was the Steelers' second linebacker of the draft, Mike Humpal out of the University of Iowa. Also in the sixth round, the final selection of the team was safety Ryan Mundy, a Pittsburgh native. The Steelers did not pick in the seventh round, due to a 2007 trade with the Atlanta Falcons. Kevin Colbert, Director of Football Operations, said of the draft, [...] "we’re happy with the way things turned out." [...] Also stating that the first and second-round selections were players who the team expected to have already been chosen. Coach Mike Tomlin said that the Steelers tried to select skilled offensive [...] "weapons" [...] over a strong offensive line, which struggled the previous season. The following day, the Steelers signed twelve free-agent rookies. All draft picks agreed to terms by July 25, two days prior to the start of training camp.|$|E

2500|$|Criticism of Asquith's weak {{leadership}} continued. Lloyd George's mistress Frances Stevenson wrote (18 March) {{that he was}} [...] "finished … no fight left in him"; {{the press}} baron Lord Rothermere, who had supported him at Paisley, wrote on 1 April of his [...] "obvious incapacity for the position <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to fill". In fact Asquith spoke in the House of Commons far more frequently {{than he had ever}} previously done when not a minister. He also spoke frequently around the country, in June 1921 topping the Liberal Chief Whip's list of the most active speakers. The issue was the quality of his contributions. Asquith still maintained friendly relations with Lloyd George, although Margot made no secret of her enmity for him.|$|E
