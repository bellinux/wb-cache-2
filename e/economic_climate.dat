5|$|By 1855, the <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> {{had changed}} dramatically. Gold could be {{retrieved}} profitably from the goldfields only by medium to {{large groups of}} workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money could be made {{in a wide variety}} of conventional businesses.|$|E

In 1935 the Williams family settled in Garland, Alabama, where Lillie Williams opened a new boarding house. After a while they moved with his cousin Opal McNeil to Georgiana, Alabama where Lillie managed to find several side jobs to support her children, despite the bleak <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> of the Great Depression.

5|$|Lewisville's {{consistently}} warm {{climate and}} proximity to Lewisville Lake {{have made it}} a recreational hub of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The city's municipal government, led by a nonpartisan city council, focuses its recreational and cultural investments on facilities such as Toyota of Lewisville Park and the MCL Grand Theater. The area's transportation infrastructure has evolved around the I-35 Corridor along Interstate 35E. The diversity of its population and industry has created a stable <b>economic</b> <b>climate.</b> Lewisville Independent School District provides most of the area's public education programs.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana {{cultivated}} political {{relationships to}} facilitate the continued growth of Tiko in spite of an <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> non-conducive to free enterprise under the Socialist administration of Ratsiraka. Early support in the 1980s came from the Supreme Counselor of the Revolution Manandafy Rakotonirina, then-Minister of Finance Rakotovao Razakaboana, and another minister, Justin Rarivoson. By the mid-1980s, the profitability of his Tiko enterprise enabled Ravalomanana to purchase a costly villa formerly owned by French colonial governor Leon Reallon in the central Faravohitra neighborhood of Antananarivo.|$|E
5|$|The Mills Corporation {{has also}} been {{contracted}} to develop an underground transit center beneath Block 37 that will be jointly funded by the City of Chicago, the Chicago Transit Authority and The Mills Corporation. The planned project includes a new subway station, track connections and a common downtown airport check-in facility for train service to both O'Hare and Midway airports. Since the purchase in April 2007 the project has stalled. The CTA has {{pulled out of the}} project and the current <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> has stalled the project.

5|$|The current <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> in {{the country}} has {{affected}} many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of Nýi Landsbanki, the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki, around 300 employees will lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations.

5|$|Trautmann {{was born}} on 22 October 1923 in Walle, a middle class area in west Bremen, living with his father who worked in a {{fertiliser}} factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda, a housewife. He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship. The bleak <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block in the working class area of Gröpelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive <b>economic</b> <b>climate.</b> Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

Clark was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon vulgar Marxism. He wrote Marxist art histories of several impressionist and realist artists, including Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet. These books focused closely on the political and <b>economic</b> <b>climates</b> in which the art was created.|$|R
50|$|Economics {{has played}} {{a large role in}} {{literacy}} through history. For working class people, there has often been a choice between education and income, with income winning out. After all, depending on <b>economic</b> <b>climates</b> and social situations, “literacy was not always so central to jobs and earnings in the nineteenth century.” If only a basic understanding of reading or writing was necessary, further education was “not desirable; it would not benefit the workingman” and would only drain his income.|$|R

5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, the <b>economic</b> <b>climate</b> in {{the state}} had {{improved}} significantly. Seeing the resultant upsurge in Old Court support, {{two of the four}} New Court justices resigned. Desha offered the appointments to three different individuals, all of whom ignored or rejected them. John Telemachus Johnson finally accepted the appointment in April 1826, and the New Court met with only three justices during its 1826 term. In the August 1826 elections, the Old Court Party won majorities of 5644 in the House and 2216 in the Senate. Desha again encouraged the legislators to compromise to resolve the court impasse. The Old Court majorities in both houses, however, completely repudiated the New Court, passing a bill to restore the Old Court and overturn all legislation related to the New Court. Desha vetoed the bill, and scolded the legislators for passing a blatantly partisan bill as opposed to a compromise measure. The General Assembly overrode Desha's veto on January 1, 1827. In a conciliatory move, the Senate confirmed Desha's appointment of George M. Bibb, a New Court partisan, to a position on the re-empowered Old Court after John Boyle resigned to accept a federal judgeship in November 1826.|$|E

30|$|Researchers {{studying}} entrepreneurial {{traits and}} behaviours have generally assumed that characteristics associated with entrepreneurs {{are rooted in}} the “Western” or the North American culture and ascribed such traits universally to entrepreneurs (Hayton et al. 2002). Numerous international researchers have questioned the generalizability of most empirical evidence and prevailing theories of entrepreneurship - North American in character - to countries with distinctly different cultural, social, and <b>economic</b> <b>climates</b> (Thomas and Mueller 2000). Such arguments lead researchers to answer these questions through cross-cultural, cross-contextual research.|$|R
