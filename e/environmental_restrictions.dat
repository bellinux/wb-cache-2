25|$|There {{are plenty}} of causes {{that lead to the}} {{occurrence}} of this yet to be solved this global issue. Among them, globalisation is the main cause undeniably. Globalisation originally symbolises a worldwide trend that helps to balance the economy between developed and developing countries, however the unfair outsourcing attempts of manufacturing labour from rich to the poor countries have led to extreme poverty which is defined as living on less than US$1 a day. (Atal, 2015) Balko (2010) suggests that when the world markets are opened to free trade under globalisation, a phenomenon of “race to the bottom” happens. Sweatshop is an obvious example of such phenomenon. Without transnational guidelines and regulations, large corporations in developed countries are moving their manufacturing plants to the countries that are more vulnerable, such as with less <b>environmental</b> <b>restrictions</b> and lower labour standards. To meet the demands and compete for the patronage, factories in developing countries start to lower their labour regulations by providing minimum wages and ignoring workplace safety requirements. As a result, workers in developing countries face the hardship while the large corporations gain profit.|$|E

The methodology was first developed for the municipality of Maraba´, Para´ state, in the Brazilian Amazon.

The methodology was subsequently adapted for 13 municipalities of the Sustainable Forests District (SFD) of BR- 163, generating population distribution surfaces for 2000 and 2007. The evolution of the resident population over the SFD-BR 163 showed spatial patterns compatible with the occupation process described in the literature and verified by fieldwork. To be applied over other areas, the proposed methodology must be adapted with local parameters but in this way, population density surfaces can be useful as an additional data source to study population and environment relationships.

40|$|Whistles are key {{elements}} in the acoustic repertoire of bottlenose dolphins. In this species, the frequency contours of whistles are used as individual signatures. Assessing the long-lasting stability of such stereotyped signals, and the abundant production of non-stereotyped whistles in the wild, is relevant to a more complete understanding of their biological function. Additionally, studying the effects of group size and activity patterns on whistle emission rate may provide insights into {{the use of these}} calls. In this study, we document the decades-long occurrence of whistles with stereotyped frequency contours in a population of wild bottlenose dolphins, resident in the region of the Sado estuary, Portugal. Confirmed stereotypy throughout more than 20 years, and positive identification using the signature identification (SIGID) criteria, suggests that the identified stereotyped whistles are in fact signature whistles. The potential roles of non-stereotyped whistles, which represent 68 % of all whistles recorded, are still unclear and should be further investigated. Emission rates were significantly higher during food-related events. Finally, our data show a comparatively high overall whistle production for this population, and no positive correlation between group size and emission rates, suggesting social or <b>environmental</b> <b>restriction</b> mechanisms in vocal production.

The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} cambial phenology and its relation with leaf phenology and climatic seasonality in two tropical rainforest species belonging to the genus Parkia known for having a contrasted leaf phenology. From wood samples collected at 15 day intervals from April 2009 to February 2012 in five trees of both species, we quantified cambial activity by counting layers of cells in cambial zone, enlarging cells zone and wall thickening cells zone from wood prepared anatomical micro sections. In the same time, we observed leaf shedding behaviors in the crown of the studied trees. In both species, cambial activity was significantly reduced during leafless period. However, the cambial activity of P. velutina was not affected by seasonality while in P. nitida, we found a significant positive effect of the dry season on cambial activity. This diminution of activity associated to leaf shedding occurred annually during the dry season in P. nitida whereas the trees were not synchronous in time for P. velutina. On the contrary that is often admitted, the rest cambial period can be independent of <b>environmental</b> <b>restriction</b> such as dry season. Leaf phenology remains the best proxy to estimate cambial activity...|$|R

40|$|The thin {{adherent}} {{oxide layer}} formed {{on the metal}} surface keeps the surface of metal protective from corrosion i. e. known as passivation. This oxide layer may break due to different types of environmental effects leading to rapid corrosion. Hence the study on breakdown of passivity should permit one for the interpretation of process parameter and <b>environmental</b> <b>restriction</b> for long time of serviceable of the metal. The 304 stainless steel is having the higher percentage of chromium making it corrosion proof literally. In this thesis the study is on the passivity breakdown of 304 stainless steel in deaerated borate buffer solution {{as a function of}} pH and Cl ions. The pitting corrosion studies of 304 SS is carried out in borate buffer solution at varying pH(8. 3, 9. 3, 10. 3) in the presence of varying chloride ions (0. 1 M, 0. 5 M, 1 M). Corrosion studies were performed by potentiodynamic scans,microscopy techniques and point defect model. The study of the passivity and pitting can be evaluated through a point defect model. As increasing the pH of borate buffer solution, the breakdown potential increases i. e. the pitting tendency decreases whereas it got decreased with increasing chloride ion concentration. The value of breakdown potential was also found to increase with the potential scan rate. After obtaining the potentiodynamic curve pitting studies of the surface is done by optical microscope. The microstructure is shown in above figure at 1 M chloride ion and at varying pH. The probability distribution in breakdown potential is the confirmation with the analytical prediction of the breakdown potential distribution obtained from the point defect model...|$|R

Among jellyfish, cubozoans are infamous for their painful, sometimes deadly, stings {{and are a}} major public concern in tropical to subtropical areas; however, there is little information about the possible causes of their outbreaks. After a bloom of the cubomedusa Carybdea marsupialis (Carybdeidae) {{along the coast of}} Denia (SW Mediterranean, Spain) in 2008 with negative consequences for local tourism, the necessity to understand the ecological restrictions on medusae abundance was evident. Here we use different models (GAM and zero-inflated models) to understand the environmental and human related factors influencing the abundance and distribution of C. marsupialis along the coast of Denia. Selected variables differed among medusae size classes, showing different <b>environmental</b> <b>restriction</b> associated to the developmental stages of the species. Variables implicated with dispersion (e. g. wind and current) affected mostly small and medium size classes. Sea surface temperature, salinity and proxies of primary production (chl a, phosphates, nitrates) were related to the abundances of small and large size classes, highlighting the roles of springtime salinity changes and increased primary production that may promote and maintain high densities of this species. The increased primary (and secondary) production due to anthropogenic impact is implicated as the factor enabling high numbers of C. marsupialis to thrive. Recommendations for monitoring blooms of this species along the study area and applicable to Mediterranean Sea include focus effort in coastal waters where productivity have been enriched by anthropogenic activities.
