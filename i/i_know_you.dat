5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

500|$|A Man of the People was {{published}} in 1966. A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence, the novel follows a teacher named Odili Samalu {{from the village of}} Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat. Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe's friend John Pepper Clark declared: [...] "Chinua, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are a prophet. Everything in this book has happened except a military coup!" ...|$|E
500|$|After an {{appearance}} at the Reading Festival, Taking Back Sunday made a brief European tour. They toured the U.S. from September to November, supported by Fall Out Boy, Matchbook Romance and Funeral for a Friend. During the tour, the band filmed a video for [...] "This Photograph Is Proof (<b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>You</b> Know)" [...] with Blink-182's Tom DeLonge. Over a 48-hour period, they flew from Dallas to Los Angeles to Nashville, Tennessee to film the video. According to MTV, Taking Back Sunday posted on its website that DeLonge had [...] "a great visual concept and was a very enthusiastic, focused and attentive first-time director." [...] In November, the band began a tour with Atreyu and Funeral for a Friend. [...] "This Photograph Is Proof (<b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>You</b> Know)" [...] was released as a radio single on January 11, 2005. In April and May, the band went on a co-headlining tour with Jimmy Eat World. In May, a music video for [...] "Set Phasers to Stun" [...] featured the Hungarian dance group Troup de Pozolo de Zav. Victory Records was uncertain whether to make the video an internet-only release or send it to MTV, and on May 11 it was posted on Yahoo! Launch. On June 16, a behind-the-scenes video on {{the making of the}} [...] "Set Phasers to Stun" [...] video was posted online.|$|E

500|$|After {{telling her}} love {{interest}} to [...] "sit back and watch", Beyoncé sings the chorus, where she states {{the things she}} will do to show her appreciation to her love interest, [...] "Tonight I'm gonna dance for you / Tonight I'm gonna dance for you / Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body / Boy, I like it when you watch me / Tonight it's going down."

500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young.

500|$|Williams {{sings the}} lead vocals while Beyoncé and Rowland sing their {{respective}} solo verses {{and serve as}} background vocalists throughout the song. Eric Corpus from The Christian Post interpreted the song's lyrics as a praise of God's sovereignty and [...] "magnetism" [...] of Jesus' love. [...] "Say Yes" [...] opens with a message of faith as Williams sings the first lines, [...] "I'm not worried about a thing/'Cause <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are guiding me / Where you lead me / Lord I will go / I have not fear / 'Cause I know who's in control." [...] The chorus is constructed as a call and response with the trio repeatedly praising Jesus through the lines [...] "When Jesus say yes, nobody can say no!" [...] while being backed by a choir which repeats the verses.|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} Lovato singing [...] "I feel a {{separation}} coming on, Cos [...] <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> {{want to be}} moving on." [...] Lyrically, the song sees the protagonist reminisce about a winter romance, with lines such as, [...] "I remember us together / We promised that forever." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Maragret Wappler deemed it an [...] "ode to breakups" [...] and noted that the protagonist asks her willful boyfriend to remember [...] "the good times" [...] of their relationship. In the chorus, she sings [...] "Don't surrender, surrender, surrender", before asking him to remember their [...] "promise of forever". Lovato explained that the song is about [...] "a girl [...] has so much {{to say to the}} guy, and it feels like he's not listening, and she wants him to remember everything that they had".|$|E
500|$|... "Government Hooker" [...] {{begins as}} Gaga sings in an operatic fashion—backed by {{industrial}} synthesizers—and transcends into an electro-pop Gregorian chant. The song then progresses into the chorus: [...] "I {{can be good}} / I can be sex / I can be anything / I can be everything / I can be mom." [...] A male vocalist accompanies the singer's lyrics, [...] "Unless {{you want to be}} man / Unless you want to hold hands / Unless you want to be dad". After Gaga sings [...] "I'm gonna drink my tears and cry / 'cos <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> love me baby" [...] during the techno-inspired bridge, she alludes to the alleged affair between Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy with the lyrics [...] "Put your hands on me / John F. Kennedy / I'll make you squeal baby", singing in an impassive and monotonous manner.|$|E
500|$|On November 20, 2016, soon before {{abruptly}} {{ending a}} concert prematurely he said, [...] "Jay Z—call me, bruh. You still ain't called me. Jay-Z, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> got killers. Please don't send them at my head. Please call me. Talk {{to me like}} a man." [...] The following day, he was committed to the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually taken to the hospital involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities. While the episode was first described as one of [...] "temporary psychosis" [...] caused by dehydration and sleep deprivation, West's mental state was abnormal enough for his 21 cancelled concerts to be covered by his insurance policy; he was reportedly paranoid and depressed throughout the hospitalization, but remains formally undiagnosed. The Paris robbery of his wife may have triggered the paranoia. On November 30, West was released from the hospital.|$|E

500|$|According to Spence D. of IGN Music, Beyoncé's vocals on {{the song}} are layered, making them sound like [...] "a harem of Beyoncé's {{warbling}} for the affections of some sultan of swing." [...] According to James Poletti of Yahoo! Music, the female protagonist {{in the song}} sings about her [...] "potential {{to turn on the}} filth." [...] Lyrically, the song is a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, culminating in a desire for a one-night stand. This [...] "lustful sexual confidence" [...] is further demonstrated in the lyrics of the first verse: [...] "I'm feeling sexy / Wa hear you say my name, boy/ If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame / Feeling kind of N A S T Y / I might just take you home with me" [...] and the chorus lines: [...] " [...] Tonight I'll be your naughty girl / I'm callin' all my girls / We're gonna turn this party out / <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> want my body." [...] Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I'd love to love you, baby" [...] almost whispering as stated by Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic.|$|E
500|$|In a brief {{review for}} Entertainment Weekly, Sean Richardson wrote that Taking Back Sunday was [...] "best suited for {{multipart}} campfire sing-alongs" [...] and struck [...] "rock-radio gold" [...] with Where You Want to Be. Sam Sutherland of Exclaim! {{wrote that the}} group created [...] "an exact musical duplicate" [...] of Tell Your Friends. Although, [...] "unadventurous as it is, the melodies remain catchy and the riffs remain driving." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Laura Sinagra noted Mascherino and Rubano as assisting [...] "the will to power in Lazzara's Cure-like croon." [...] Sinagra called [...] "A Decade Under the Influence" [...] the nearest that the singer gets to the [...] "emotional tensions and ragged-rock edge" [...] of Tell Your Friends. Spin writer Andy Greenwald wrote that nearly every song on the album [...] "begins in the moment just before a fight or a tear-filled breakdown." [...] Citing [...] "New American Classic" [...] and [...] "This Photograph Is Proof (<b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>You</b> Know)," [...] Greenwald noted Adam Lazzara's use of [...] "anthemic choruses like 15-year-olds use emoticons: as sweeping shorthand placeholders for feelings too complicated to puzzle out and express." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone {{wrote that}} though the song {{may not be}} an obvious single, it remains one of the finest tracks on the record. Ben Cardew of Music Week called [...] "I Care" [...] an [...] "early highlight" [...] on 4, further praising its {{instrumentation}} {{and the fact that the}} song [...] "feels touched with sadness, largely thanks to a fantastic chorus". He also noted that [...] "I Care" [...] bears resemblance to some of The Neptunes' [...] "classy early tracks". Andy Gill of The Independent wrote that [...] "I Care" [...] makes good use of Surfer Blood's 2010 song [...] "Twin Peaks"' two-chord motif. Chad Grischow of IGN commented [...] "I Care" [...] is one of the songs on which the Beyoncé's vocals are superior to the lyrics, [...] "as the lame hook pleads, 'But I care / <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> don't care too much / But I still care'". NMEs Hamish MacBain showed depreciation the guitar solo, the lyrics and the [...] "off-kilter drums and moody synths" [...] on [...] "I Care". [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph viewed [...] "I Care" [...] as an old-fashioned power ballad.|$|E

500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} and third single, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute For Love" [...] is a downtempo ballad drawing {{influences}} from jungle, drum and bass and trip hop music. The title {{is inspired by}} J.G. Ballard's post-apocalyptic science fiction novel The Drowned World (1962). [...] "Swim", the second song, has a spiritual tone. She sings: [...] "Swim to the ocean floor/So that we can begin again/Wash away all our sins/Crash to the other shore". [...] "Ray of Light", the third track and album's second single, is an up-tempo electronic dance-pop song which contains strong techno tendencies and influences of trance music. A [...] "sonically progressive" [...] track, it also incorporates elements of rock music, with a prominent electric guitar riff. The melody also has several sound effects, including whistles and bleeps. [...] "Candy Perfume Girl" [...] has a grunge intro and continues to pair post-modern beeps and beats with old-fashioned electric guitar flare ups. In the next song, [...] "Skin", Madonna sings [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> from somewhere?" [...] in a yearning voice over the beats of an electronic orchestra. The sixth track, [...] "Nothing Really Matters", is an up-tempo dance track which contains influences of techno.|$|E
500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad that {{features}} elements of pop and soul music. Instrumentation {{is provided by}} a guitar, kick drums, an organ, percussion and a piano. It is also backed by doo-wop beats, finger snaps and cooing backup vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman's breaking point and Hilson [...] "voices the frustration" [...] {{of women who are}} being neglected and exploited by men. In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Every woman has a breaking point, y'all/ Hey, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> know, some women can be lied to, cheated on and beat on/ Somebody know, hey, every woman has a breaking point, y'all." [...] According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, Hilson vocally incorporates an [...] "improvisational gospel style. MTV Buzzworthy writer Chris Ryan compared Hilson's vocals with Mary J. Blige's, particularly in Blige's cover of [...] "I'm Going Down" [...] (1995). Halfway through [...] "Breaking Point", Hilson talks about [...] "the need for each woman to reclaim her life" [...] in a spoken-word interlude, during which she mimics Blige, according to Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe. Hilson phrases: [...] "Now ladies, we really should be mad at ourselves, cause see, some women just tolerate too damn much. Huh!" ...|$|E
