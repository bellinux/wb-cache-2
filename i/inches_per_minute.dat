5000|$|Gun drills [...] are {{straight}} fluted drills which allow cutting fluid (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill's hollow {{body to the}} cutting face. They are used for deep drilling—a depth-to-diameter ratio of 300:1 or more is possible. Gun barrels are the obvious example; hence the name. Other uses include moldmaking, diemaking, and the manufacture of combustion engine parts such as crankcase, cylinder head, and woodwind musical instruments, such as uilleann pipes, as gun drills can drill long straight holes in metal, wood, and some plastics. The coolant provides lubrication and cooling to the cutting edges and removes the swarf or chips from the hole. Modern gun drills use carbide tips to prolong life and reduce total cost when compared with metal tips. Speed of drilling depends on the material being drilled, rotational speed, and the drill diameter; a high speed drill can cut a hole in P20 steel at 30 <b>inches</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cutting speed (also called {{surface speed}} or simply speed) is the speed {{difference}} (relative velocity) between {{the cutting tool}} and {{the surface of the}} workpiece it is operating on. It is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece surface per unit of time, typically surface feet per minute (sfm) or meters per minute (m/min). Feed rate (also often styled as a solid compound, feedrate, or called simply feed) is the relative velocity at which the cutter is advanced along the workpiece; its vector is perpendicular to the vector of cutting speed. Feed rate units depend on the motion of the tool and workpiece; when the workpiece rotates (e.g., in turning and boring), the units are almost always distance per spindle revolution (inches per revolution or ipr or millimeters per revolution mm/rev). When the workpiece does not rotate (e.g., in milling), the units are typically distance per time (<b>inches</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> or ipm or millimeters per minute mm/min), although distance per revolution or per cutter tooth are also sometimes used.|$|E

40|$|Statement of problem. Clinicians {{have used}} {{disinfection}} materials to remove surface contaminants during cavity preparation. It has been postulated that disinfection materials may negatively affect shear bond strength of restorative materials.

To determine whether there is a difference in the bond strength between dentin and composite resin with a 3 -step disinfection technique compared to a conventional bonding technique without the additional disinfection protocol. Material and Methods. Sixty human molar teeth were sectioned parallel to the occlusal surface to expose mid-coronal dentin and mounted parallel to a bond shearing device on a universal testing machine (Instron) and randomly divided into 2 groups. In Group I (n= 30), specimens were treated with chlorhexidine, tubulicid red, and sodium hypochlorite before dentin bonding, following the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s instructions for All Bond 2. In Group II (n= 30), specimens were treated only with the bonding protocol of All Bond 2. To ensure a uniform bond surface area, core paste was syringed into a cylindrical mold (diameter 2. 38 mm, height 2. 00 mm) that was in contact with the dentin bonding surface of each specimen, and allowed to set under constant force. All specimens were subjected to fracture by shear loading in a universal testing machine (Instron) at a uniform crosshead speed of 0. 02 <b>inch</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and expressed as MPa.
