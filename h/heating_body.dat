5000|$|Balancing loop - A {{balancing}} loop {{is a type}} of a feedback loop, where {{a positive}} increase of variable A causes a decrease in variable B, which in turn causes a positive increase in variable A. The behavior of such a system leads to the system finding stable state over time. Consider the behavior of a thermometer. The thermometer is a very simple device in its core. If the measured temperature exceeds a certain preconfigured value, the heating is turned off. Otherwise the heating is turned on. The heating in turn influences the temperature, forcing the thermometer to reevaluate its behavior periodically. Since there is a delay in the system (it takes a while for the room to heat up after the heating has been turned on), the temperature in the room will oscillate around the preconfigured value. This happens because when the heating is turned on, it doesn’t have an immediate effect (the body emitting heat must warm up first), causing the temperature to fall below desired level. The same effect is in play when the temperature exceeds the desired value and the heating is turned off, since it takes a while for the <b>heating</b> <b>body</b> to cool down, causing further undesired temperature increases. This behavior could be potentially mitigated by setting two separate temperature thresholds, a lower one as a signal for the heating to activate and a higher one as a signal for the heating to deactivate.|$|E

The physical system considered is a 2 D cavity of square cross-section, containing a horizontal cylindrical source, the heat carrier fluid being air at Prandtl number Pr =. 7. The <b>heating</b> <b>body</b> is placed in central position; the resulting flow is investigated {{with respect to the}} variation of the Rayleigh number and the ratio between the source diameter and the cavity side length.

Main issues of the work are the rise of steady and transitional flows and the heat transfer performance of the system, as influenced by the different boundary conditions at the heat source wall.

40|$|Briefly described, {{the present}} {{invention}} {{is concerned with}} cooling <b>heated</b> <b>bodies</b> and/or <b>heated</b> fluid with synthetic jet actuators in either open or closed systems. A first preferred embodiment of a cooling system of {{the present invention comprises}} a synthetic jet actuator directed to impinge directly on a heat producing (or <b>heated)</b> <b>body.</b> The synthetic jet actuator generates a synthetic jet stream comprised of cool ambient fluid that impinges on the heated surface thereby cooling this surface. As an example, the heated surface/body could be a microchip array in a microcomputer. After coming into contact with the heated surface, the fluid moves along the surface and is finally rejected to the ambient where it mixes and cools down. The synthetic jet may be incorporated into a modular unit that may be clipped on to a circuit board or other heat producing element to provide added, `ad hoc` cooling. In another configuration, a synthetic jet actuator may be positioned, relative to the heated surface, to create a synthetic jet stream to flow along the heated surface. In this embodiment, the flow would be approximately tangential to a surface of a <b>heat</b> producing <b>body.</b> This embodiment may further comprise a cyclical flow of the fluid jet, along the <b>heated</b> <b>body</b> and about a heat sink surface.

40|$|Abstract. Through {{finite volume}} method, this study {{establishes}} a steady state flow and heat transfer {{model of a}} single phase flow flowing vertically upward in annular space. The model sets the inner cylinder of the annular space as a <b>heating</b> <b>body</b> with fixed heat generation rate. Flow and heat transfer boundary layers are set between the flow and the inner cylinder wall, {{in order to give}} more accurate description of momentum and heat coupling and transfer processes between the fluid and the solid near the wall. Compared with the constant physical property model, the variable physical property model, in which the fluid density, heat transfer coefficient, and viscosity change along with the temperature, has relatively lower heat transfer capacity and a little bit lower interface shear stress between the fluid and the solid heat transfer surfaces. Through the comparison between Re and Ri of the constant physical property model and the variable physical properties model, it can be concluded that the physical property changes of the fluid have gradually lower impact on flow and heat transfer processes along with the acceleration of the forced circulation of the fluid...|$|E

The new F 1 microfurnace aims at the following goals: fast crystal mounting; access to a large portion of reciprocal lattice; low absorption of direct beam; efficient in situ temperature measurement; fast power supply regulation; high temperature stability; controlled atmosphere. In the F 1, the crystal is directly glued to a thermocouple with refractory cement.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the procedure used {{to design a}} so-called virtual sensor (VS) that is able to estimate fluid flow rates (FRs) in {{the elements of a}} complex hydraulic closed network, only knowing the total FR imposed by the circulator pump and the open/closed state of the valves that section off each subnet. The VS is based on a mathematical model representing the relationship between FR and head loss (HL). An identification procedure is developed to estimate the numerical values of the parameters of the FR/HL relationship. Once the mathematical model is completely known, in terms of its topological representation and the numerical values of all the model parameters, a flow-solver algorithm is used to estimate the FR in each branch of the hydraulic circuit. The importance of such a mathematical device is evidenced by the necessity to compute the heating power, directly depending on the hydraulic FR, that each single <b>heating</b> <b>body</b> releases, in order to give a new solution going beyond the current technologies to many problems, such as, for example, the optimization of the central heat generator efficiency or the fair cost allocation in the management of old centralized heating plants.

40|$|International audienceThe {{history of}} the {{development}} of the process industry has been punctuated by a number of hazardous explosions, sometimes very severe. A few of them are still in the memory and certainly contributed to the birth of safety engineering. It has been known for more than one century than combustible dusts suspended in air are responsible for a part of those explosions but contrariwise to gas explosions, the available knowledge and practise seems still contain a significant part of empirism. The work summarised into this paper is an attempt to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the explosion mechanisms of dust clouds. Hopefully, such additional information may help to refine the safety analysis exercise in the future. A specific effort has been devoted to combustion processes in the flame and the results indicate similarities with premixed gaseous flames. Several fundamental questions are addressed such as the incidence of thermal radiation, turbulence, [...] This information is important to treat ignition aspects. For spark type of ignition, it is shown that an absolute minimum ignition energy should exist for some dust clouds with a similar meaning than for premixed gaseous flames. For hot surface ignition, the standard ignition temperature (Godbert-Greenwald) seems to be reasonably correlated to the size and critical ignition temperature of the <b>heating</b> <b>body.</b> The possible implications of this new information within the scope of industrial safety are addressed in conclusion...|$|E

Levitation heating of {{electrically}} conductive nonmagnetic bodies (as {{the first step}} of their levitation melting) represents a relatively complicated process characterized by mutual interaction of electromagnetic and temperature fields and possibly also by eventual movement of the <b>heated</b> <b>body.</b> Its mathematical model consists of a system of partial and ordinary (generally nonlinear) differential equations whose coefficients are temperature-dependent functions.

40|$|Summary: A {{detachable}} coil {{was assessed}} for magnetic field interactions, <b>heating</b> (<b>body</b> RF coil, SAR of 2. 0 -W/kg), and artifacts at 3 -Tesla. The coil showed no magnetic field interactions and heating was negligible (0. 3 °C). There-fore, this coil is safe {{for a patient}} undergoing MR imaging at 3 T or less. While artifacts may impair the ability to properly visualize anatomy in proximity to this implant, careful selection of imaging parameters can mitigate this problem. The use of detachable coils is a safe and effective alternative to surgical clipping of intracranial aneu-rysms (1 – 3). Accordingly, there has been increased use of these implants (1 – 3). MR imaging is frequently used to examine patients who have undergone coil embolization by using standard imaging techniques as well as MR angiography (MRA), perfusion-weighted imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging (4 – 6). Since these implants are made from metallic mate-rials, there are potential safety problems (e. g., mag-netic field interactions and heating) and related issues (e. g., artifacts) that must be considered (7 – 9). Impor-tantly, imaging systems with 3 T magnets are now being used on a routine basis and have a greater tendency to impact safety and artifact size for metallic implants as compared with lower-field-strength sys-tems (8, 9). In consideration of {{the increasing use of}} embolization coils and the likelihood that patients with these implants may require MR imaging exami-nations, this investigation determined magnetic field interactions, heating, and artifacts at 3 T for a detach-able coil used for treatment of cerebral aneurysms...|$|E
