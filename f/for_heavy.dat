5|$|By July7, 30shelters opened across five parishes, with {{at least}} 793people using their services. Some {{officials}} complained that residents refused to evacuate. However, as the storm impacted the island this number dramatically increased to 6,000people with shelters open in all parishes. Approximately J$25million (US$405,000) was made available for relief operations through the nation's Disaster Mitigation Programme. An additional J$20million (US$324,000) was allocated for clearing drains in preparation <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> rain.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Cn and atomic number 112. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive element, {{that can only be}} created in a laboratory. The most stable known isotope, copernicium-285, has a half-life of approximately 29seconds.

5|$|Four {{days prior}} to Vamei moving ashore, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) issued storm {{advisories}} for potentially affected areas.

5|$|Hassium {{was officially}} {{discovered}} in 1984 by a German research {{team led by}} Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Heavy</b> Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of lead-208 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 to produce 3atoms of the isotope hassium-265.|$|E
5|$|In Jamaica, a {{flash flood}} warning {{remained}} {{in effect for}} flood-prone regions for four days, ultimately discontinued on October3. Schools and several businesses, including the US Embassy in Kingston, closed on September2930 as the island braced <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> rains. Public transit was suspended islandwide {{on the evening of}} September29, and shipping interests were cautioned to secure their vessels. At the height of the storm, army and police officials patrolled the island in case of emergencies.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} {{advisory}} on the depression, the National Hurricane Center emphasized the threat <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall in Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, south Florida, and the Bahamas.

The depression was the first tropical cyclone threat to south Florida since Hurricane Andrew nine months prior, although officials noted the depression's winds were no cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{cleaning}} of diving cylinders {{may be required}} to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may be needed <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} routes was {{suitable}} <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> freight. Lighter cargoes were carried in York boats to Hudson Bay or in canoes {{on the border}} route. Both routes required navigation of large and hazardous lakes, shallow and rapid-strewn rivers, and swampy creeks and bogs, connected by numerous portages where both cargo and watercraft had to be carried on men's backs.|$|E

5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> riders.|$|E
5|$|Several design {{proposals}} were submitted, all calling <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers. However, financial limitations dictated that smaller, less expensive weaponry {{would be used}} instead. The final design therefore used the same 28cm(11in) double turret introduced {{for the last two}} s— hydraulic elevated Drh LC/1907 instead of electrical elevated Drh LC/1906. In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.|$|E
5|$|The Taiwan Central Weather Bureau warned for the {{potential}} <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> amounts of rainfall across the island. This resulted in officials to close schools and offices in Taipei. Additionally, the typhoon caused the cancellation or delay of several flights {{in and out of}} Taipei, though complete air service was restored by the day after Matsa's passage. The Taiwan Stock Exchange closed due to the threat of the typhoon.|$|E

5|$|Trial runs {{took place}} on the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway in summer 1973, after which it was {{transferred}} to Steamtown (Carnforth), from where it steamed on various tours.

5|$|Tropical Storm Julio was {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>heavy</b> rains to Zihuatanejo, where 100homes were damaged or destroyed. Across the city, numerous roofs were damaged and many trees fell. Many houses and streets were flooded as well. Meanwhile, in Acapulco, heavy rains triggered flash flooding that damaged another 100houses. Throughout Colima, many rivers overflowed its banks. Furthermore, 2,000 homes were flooded. Roughly 100families were evacuated to shelters in Michoacán.|$|E
