40|$|This paper {{introduces}} dynamic impact analysts as {{a cost-effective}} technique {{to enforce the}} error-propagation condition for detecting a fault. The intuition behind dynamic impact analysis is as follows. In a specific test-case, if an execution of a syntactic component has a strong impact on the pro-gram output and if the output is correct, then the value of that component-execution {{is not likely to}} be erroneous. To capture this intuition in a theoretical framework, the notion of impact is formally defined and the concept of zmpact strength is pro-posed as a quantitative measure of the impact. In order to provide an infrastructure supporting the computation of <b>impact</b> <b>strengths,</b> program <b>impact</b> graphs and execution impact graphs are introduced. An empirical study validating the computation of <b>impact</b> <b>strengths</b> is presented. It is shown that the <b>impact</b> <b>strengths</b> computed by dynamic impact analysis provide reasonable estimates for the error-sensitivity with respect to the output except when the impact is via one or more error-tolerant compo-nents of the program. Potential applications of dy-namic impact analysis in the area of mutation test-ing and dynamic program slicing are discussed...|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} general types of polypropylene: homopolymer, random copolymer, and block copolymer. The {{comonomer}} is typically used with ethylene. Ethylene-propylene rubber or EPDM added to polypropylene homopolymer increases its low temperature <b>impact</b> <b>strength.</b> Randomly polymerized ethylene monomer added to polypropylene homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the melting point {{and makes the}} polymer more transparent.|$|E
25|$|The {{melt flow}} rate (MFR) or melt flow index (MFI) {{is a measure of}} {{molecular}} weight of polypropylene. The measure helps to determine how easily the molten raw material will flow during processing. Polypropylene with higher MFR will fill the plastic mold more easily during the injection or blow-molding production process. As the melt flow increases, however, some physical properties, like <b>impact</b> <b>strength,</b> will decrease.|$|E
25|$|PMMA is an {{economical}} {{alternative to}} polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, flexural strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance {{are more important}} than <b>impact</b> <b>strength,</b> chemical resistance and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.|$|E

25|$|Various {{methods can}} used to prepare {{cross-linked}} polyethylene (PE-X) from thermoplastic polyethylene (PE-LD, PE-LLD or PE-HD). By crosslinking low-temperature <b>impact</b> <b>strength,</b> abrasion resistance and environmental stress cracking resistance {{can be increased}} significantly, whereas hardness and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without mechanical load up to 250°C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE. As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are cross-linked.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wood-plastic {{composites}} {{are being}} examined {{for a greater}} number of struc-tural-type applications that may be exposed to different environments, some of them ad-verse. This paper discusses the influence of moisture absorption on the mechanical proper-ties of wood flour–polypropylene composites. Composites filled with 20 % or 40 % wood flour (by weight) were placed in different environments, removed periodically, and tested for moisture content and mechanical properties. The composites filled with 20 % wood flour (20 %WF) absorbed moisture in all the environmental exposures, but no significant degradation of properties was observed. The 40 %WF composites absorbed more moisture than did the 20 %WF composites. The flexural properties of composites subjected to a wa-ter bath and to 90 % relative humidity were lower than the flexural properties of the other composites. Tensile properties and notched <b>impact</b> <b>strengths</b> decreased only for compos-ites placed in a water bath. Unnotched <b>impact</b> <b>strengths</b> did not change significantly with absorption of moisture...|$|R

2500|$|Metals can be {{heat treated}} {{to alter the}} {{properties}} of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness or resistance to corrosion.

The advantage of prills is that, in general, they can be produced more cheaply than granules and that the technique was firmly established in industrial practice long before a satisfactory urea granulation process was commercialized. [...] However, {{on account of the}} limited size of particles that can be produced with the desired degree of sphericity and their low crushing and <b>impact</b> <b>strength,</b> the performance of prills during bulk storage, handling and use is generally (with some exceptions) considered inferior to that of granules.|$|E

40|$|High-density {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) /turmeric spent (TS) composites {{were prepared}} by the extrusion of an HDPE resin with 5, 10, 15, or 20 wt % TS. HOPE granules and TS master-batch flakes were compounded on a corotating and intermeshing twin-screw extruder. The extrudate strands were cut into pellets and injection-molded to make test specimens. These specimens were tested for physicomechanical properties such as the tensile, flexural, and <b>impact</b> <b>strengths,</b> surface hardness, abrasion resistance, density, and water absorption and thermal characteristics such as the heat distortion temperature (HDT) and melt flow index (MEI).
