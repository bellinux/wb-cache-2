There was much anxiety, too, about Mr. Morville, of whose condition, Markham had been making a great mystery, and on her return, Mr. Ashford was very eager for her report.|$|E

60|$|Certainly Anne was {{the most}} {{improved}} in looks of all the three brides, who had arrived <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> The thin, scraggy Scotch girl, with the flabby, washed-out look alternating with angular rigidity was gone, but the softening and opening of her expression, the light that had come into her eyes, and had made them a lovely blue instead of pale gray; the rose-tint on her cheeks, the delicate rounded contour of her face, the improved carriage of her really fine figure, the traces of style in the braiding of her profuse flaxen hair, and the taste that was beginning to conquer in the dress, were all due to {{the thought that the}} Salamanca might soon be in harbour.

60|$|About George's pictures, {{perhaps you}} better wait till I hear from him, before sending them. I remain well as usual. The poor fellow I {{mentioned}} {{in one of}} my letters last week, with diarrhoea, that wanted me to ask God's blessing on him, was still living yesterday afternoon, but just living. He is only partially conscious, is all wasted away to nothing, and lies most of the time in half stupor, as they give him brandy copiously. Yesterday I was there by him a few minutes. He is very much averse to taking brandy, and there was some trouble in getting him to take it. He is almost totally deaf the last five or six days. There is no chance for him at all. Quite a particular friend of mine, Oscar Cunningham, an Ohio boy, had his leg amputated yesterday close up by the thigh. It was a pretty tough operation. He was badly wounded <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> to-day at Chancellorsville and has suffered a great deal; lately got erysipelas in his leg and foot. I forget whether I have mentioned him before or not. He was a very large, noble-looking young man when I first see him. The doctor thinks he will live and get up, but I consider [it] by no means so certain. He is very much prostrated. Well, dear mother, you must write and Jeff too--I do want to see you all very much. How does Mat get along, and how little Sis and all? I send my love to you and Jeff and all. We are having a very pleasant, coolish day here. I am going down to post office to leave this, and then up to my old friends the O'Connors to dinner, and then down to hospital. Well, good-bye, dear mother, for present.|$|E

60|$|And so, without passion, or prejudice, or bias of any kind, I sit in {{judgment}} upon your lecture project, {{and say it}} was up to your average, it was indeed above it, for it had possibilities in it, and even practical ones. While I was not sorry you abandoned it, I should not be sorry if you had stuck to it and given it a trial. But on the whole you did the wise thing to lay it aside, I think, because a lecture is a most easy thing to fail in; and at your time of life, and in your own town, such a failure would make a deep and cruel wound in your heart and in your pride. It was decidedly unwise in you to think for a moment of coming before a community who knew you, with such a course of lectures; because Keokuk is not unaware that you have been a Swedenborgian, a Presbyterian, a Congregationalist, and a Methodist (on probation), and that <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> you were an infidel. If Keokuk had gone to your lecture course, it would have gone to be amused, not instructed, for when a man is known to have no settled convictions of his own he can't convince other people. They would have gone to be amused {{and that would have been}} a deep humiliation to you. It could have been safe for you to appear only where you were unknown--then many of your hearers would think you were in earnest. And they would be right. You are in earnest while your convictions are new. But taking it by and large, you probably did best to discard that project altogether. But I leave you to judge of that, for you are the worst judge I know of.|$|E

[...] He was member of eartwhile Bombay Assembly from 1957 to 1960 and Gujarat Assembly from 1960-62 {{as a member of}} pre-Indira Congress party from Bhuj. In 1962 elections as candidate of Congress from Bhuj, he lost to independent candidate Gulabshankar Amritlal. After split of Congress in 1969 he became associated with Indian National Congress (Organisation) and was elected as a member of Gujarat Legislative Assembly for 1975-80 again from Bhuj. He was the speaker of Gujarat Assembly from June 1975 to March 1977 and then from April 1977 to June 1980. He worked actively during the earthquake and drought in Kutch during 1956. In 2009, he was awarded Gujarat Pratibha Award.His other major contribution was as a historian, he penned down history of Kutch in books - âShruti ane Smruti: Kutchâ and âKutch na antarangoâ both wonderful book on Kutchâs recent history. His major contribution to contemporary history of Gujarat was his book âSamayne sathvare Gujarat.â This is most probably the only book that narrates Gujaratâs political history between 1952-2009 in continuing chapters. Dholakiaâs this book was first published in 1991. Though, Dholakia was from Congress party, but he didnât rescue himself from writing something against Congress Chief Ministers of Gujarat while penning down contemporary history. After every few years he would add another chapters on recent political affairs. Thus the subsequent editions with added chapters were published in 1994, 2005 and finally in 2010.
