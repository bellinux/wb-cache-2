5000|$|As {{this story}} opens, a glum Stoner is {{introduced}} to Dr. James Nichols by Mike Stearns, {{and the two}} have come by {{to pick up a}} horse-drawn cart load of Stoner's [...] "patented West Virginia Wildwood Weed" [...] (which originated in a pilgrimage to Holland) that Stoner uses as an emergency cash crop grown in his ramshackle home-made greenhouse constructed from various <b>junk</b> <b>automobile</b> sections, windows thrown in the trash, and a lot of effort and ingenuity. At the same time, interjected into this conversation are barbs by the German boy driving the horse cart just identified as 'Klaus' such as [...] "Und Magdalena vould haf better prospects elsewhere, you haf no income, Stoner. Effen der Veed, you gifs to der Doc".|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Nucor {{was among}} the first steel {{companies}} in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from <b>junked</b> <b>automobiles).</b> The first thin slab production was started in 1989 in Crawfordsville, IN. Thin slab casting eliminated much of the equipment and labor required to produce sheet steel. In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Khan {{created a}} {{sculpture}} from <b>junk</b> and <b>automobile</b> spare parts depicting a racing horse with its jockey. The creation is made using spare parts of different vehicles like Mercedes Benz, Hero Honda, Passion Plus bike.|$|R
50|$|In Amarillo, Texas, Ant Farm half-buried {{a row of}} 10 {{used and}} <b>junk</b> Cadillac <b>automobiles</b> dating from 1949 to 1963, nose-first in the ground, at an angle {{corresponding}} {{to that of the}} Great Pyramid of Giza. The installation is set up to the west of Amarillo near Interstate I-40 on the famous former Route 66.|$|R
50|$|Cadillac Ranch is {{a public}} art {{installation}} and sculpture in Amarillo, Texas, USA. It was created in 1974 by Chip Lord, Hudson Marquez and Doug Michels, who {{were a part of}} the art group Ant Farm. It consists of what were (when originally installed during 1974) either older running used or <b>junk</b> Cadillac <b>automobiles,</b> representing a number of evolutions of the car line (most notably the birth and death of the defining feature of mid twentieth century Cadillacs: the tailfins) from 1949 to 1963, half-buried nose-first in the ground, at an angle corresponding to that of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt.|$|R
50|$|The yard is {{surrounded}} by old residential neighborhoods and some abandoned industrial facilities. To {{the north of the}} yard, beneath the tracks, runs Hertel Avenue. An abandoned portion of the north yard is now an <b>automobile</b> <b>junk</b> yard; Austin Street runs under the center of the yard. Most of the trackbed in the yard has been ripped up.|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{studies on}} four makes of Japanese automobiles, three 1981 and one 1982 model years, received from three manufacturers {{to determine if}} their materials composition would present problems to the current technology used to process <b>junk</b> <b>automobiles</b> for metal recovery. One of each make of automobile was hand-dismantled to determine the materials composition. In addition, two nearly identical automobiles of each make were shredded at a commercial operation where all metal products and rejects were collected for analysis to determine metal and nonmetal distribution. The average weight of the four automobiles to be dismantled, less batteries, tools, and fluids, was 1, 938. 3 lb. The weight was distributed as 1, 472. 9 lb. ferrous and 115. 6 lb nonferrous metals, 275. 2 lb combustibles, 72. 3 lb noncombustibles, and 2. 3 lb electrical components. The dismantled automobiles, less gas tanks, fluids, tools, wheels, tires, and batteries, which were all removed from the automobiles that were shredded, contained an average of 1, 389. 1 lb ferrous and 101. 6 lb nonferrous metals, 305. 7 lb nonmetals, and 2. 3 lb electrical components. In comparison, materials collected from the shredded automobiles averaged 1, 304 lb ferrous metals, 80 lb nonferrous metals, and 341 lb landfill materials. There were no materials used {{in the manufacture of}} the late model Japanese automobiles that should present handling or processing problems to the steelmaking or secondary metal recyclers...|$|R
50|$|Berkshire Mill Pond was {{the site}} of another tide mill at the {{confluence}} of the Pequonnock River and Island Brook. The milldam was constructed in 1786 just to the south of the Berkshire Avenue Bridge. The pond was largely filled in the 1940s and '50s {{for the construction of a}} shopping center, two drive-in movie theaters, and a collection of <b>automobile</b> <b>junk</b> yards. A small remnant remains.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{birdseye}} {{view of an}} <b>automobile</b> <b>junk</b> yard on South Main Street near Fifteenth Street, Los Angeles, ca. 1940. Hundreds of wrecked automobiles can be seen {{stacked in}} a rectangular lot that extends from the foreground at left to the background at right. Several large buildings advertising auto wrecking and salvage can be seen around the salvage yard. More cars {{can be seen on}} a street that runs along {{the far side of the}} junkyard, and many larger buildings are visible in the background...|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} with a sophisticated private property system, {{documents of title}} are commonly used for real estate, motor vehicles, and some types of intangible property. When such documents are used, they are often part of a registration system whereby ownership of such property can be verified. In some cases, a title can {{also serve as a}} permanent legal record of condemnation of property, such {{as in the case of}} an <b>automobile</b> <b>junk</b> or salvage title. In the case of real estate, the legal instrument used to transfer title is the deed. A famous rule is that a thief cannot convey good title, so title searches are routine (or highly recommended) for purchases of many types of expensive property (especially real estate). In several counties and municipalities in the US a standard title search (generally accompanied by title insurance) is required under the law as a part of ownership transfer.|$|R
30|$|Concentration of zinc in {{storm water}} runoff with various others heavy metals ranged as zinc 0.008 – 0.720  mg l− 1, copper 0.001 – 0.079  mg l− 1, {{manganese}} 0.001 – 0.516  mg l− 1 and lead 0.003 – 0.010  mg l− 1, respectively (Asaf et al. 2004;Vijayaraghavan et al. 2008). Walker et al. 1999 characterized the urban runoff as zinc (0.0007 – 22.0  mg l− 1), copper (0.00006 – 1.41  mg l− 1) and lead (0.00057 – 26.0  mg l− 1). Zinc contamination in natural environment {{has been found}} in 985 sites out of 1, 662 national sites of priority risk identified by USEPA (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 2005). Wastes containing zinc have been categorized as hazardous waste under the Basal convention and European Union (Agarwal et al. 2004). The secondary waste generated during the metallurgical operations, i.e., zinc ash, zinc dross, flux, flue dust from electric arc furnace, <b>automobile</b> <b>junks</b> and sludge, contains very high amount of zinc in the form of some sort of compound or derivatives.|$|R
