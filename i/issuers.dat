5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the <b>issuers</b> of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E
50|$|If a card <b>issuer</b> {{wants to}} update a card post {{issuance}} it can send commands to the card using <b>issuer</b> script processing. <b>Issuer</b> scripts are encrypted between {{the card and}} the <b>issuer,</b> so are meaningless to the terminal. <b>Issuer</b> script {{can be used to}} block cards, or change card parameters.|$|R

50|$|If the {{instrument}} is desirable, the underwriter and the securities <b>issuer</b> {{may choose to}} enter into an exclusivity agreement.

50|$|An AC {{resembles a}} PKC but {{contains}} no public key because an AC verifier {{is under the}} control of the AC <b>issuer,</b> and therefore, trusts the <b>issuer</b> directly by having the public key of the <b>issuer</b> preinstalled.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a repeated security issuance game with reputation concerns. Each period, an <b>issuer</b> {{can choose to}} securitize an asset and publicly report its quality. However, potential investors cannot directly observe {{the quality of the}} asset and a lemons problem ensues. The <b>issuer</b> can credibly signal the asset’s quality by retaining a portion of the asset. Incomplete information about <b>issuer</b> type induces reputation concerns which provide credibility to the <b>issuer’s</b> report of asset quality. A mixed strategy equilibrium obtains with the following 3 properties: (i) the <b>issuer</b> misreports asset quality {{at least part of the}} time, (ii) perceived asset quality is a U-shaped function of the <b>issuer’s</b> reputation, and (iii) the <b>issuer</b> retains less of the asset when she has a higher reputation. I also document empirical evidence that subordination levels for commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) depend on <b>issuer</b> reputation in a manner consistent with the model...|$|R

25|$|Many {{credit card}} {{customers}} receive rewards, such as frequent flyer points, gift certificates, or cash back {{as an incentive}} to use the card. Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, {{which may or may}} not include balance transfers, cash advances, or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow <b>issuers</b> to fund their rewards system. Some <b>issuers</b> discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the <b>issuers.</b> With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable portfolio. Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the breakage in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.|$|E
