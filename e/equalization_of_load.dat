40|$|Manuscripts {{submitted}} to the American Economic Review are handled by an Editor, several Coeditors, and a staff located in Pittsburgh, using an Internet-based manuscript management software system. Papers are submitted online, processed by the Pittsburgh office staff, and then distributed by the Editor {{to one of the}} Coeditors or to himself for refereeing and a publication decision. Papers are assigned on the basis of field of expertise of the Coeditor, combined with a variety of other considerations including <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> work <b>load</b> and conflict-of-interest rules. Once assigned, papers are handled by the designated Coeditor throughout the decision process, without review by the Editor. There are several conflict rules that affect assignment of manuscripts. Coeditors are generally not assigned manuscripts authored by an individual at his or her institution, by an individual with whom the Coeditor has been a recent coauthor, by an individual who has a close professional or personal relationship with the Coeditor, or by an individual who has served as a graduate student advisor or advisee of the Coeditor.

25|$|Interval {{and quality}} of {{exercise}} also affect hormonal response. Sessions of moderate to high intensity with multiple sets and short time intervals, during which energy is derived from glycolytic lactate metabolism, {{appear to be the}} greatest stimulus for steroid hormone response. Hormonal response in young men varies with the number of sets in the exercise session. However, when the number increased from 4 to 6, anabolic levels stabilized and cortisol continued to rise, suggesting that alterations in anaerobic volume could alter anabolic and catabolic hormonal balance. When sets are performed at maximum repetitions, interval has no influence at a certain intensity range, with no acute hormone response difference between protocols at 10 maximum reps with 2- and 5-minute intervals. There is a higher total testosterone response in hypertrophy protocols compared to those for strength and power, despite <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> total work <b>load</b> (defined as load x sets x repetitions). There is a 27% greater testosterone response using protocols with simultaneous use of all four limbs. Androgenic response was also noted in protocols using upper and lower limbs separately to a lesser degree.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{approach}} to design <b>of</b> the <b>equalization</b> procedure <b>of</b> bearing <b>loads</b> on running wheels <b>of</b> a <b>load</b> trolley. Methodological ambiguity in the trolley design issue resulting in complication of the designing process was identified. There was formed and solved the task concerning compensation of variation {{in the position of}} the common resultant of forces acting on the trolley from the point characterizing optimal load distribution between the wheels. This distribution was achieved by introducing a conventional mass and using appropriate dependencies and imposed limitations. Different options for arrangement of actual masses which form the conventional mass under the multi-purpose metal construction scheme were considered. An example on how to address the presented issue for the overhead crane load trolley was considered. The paper presents the findings of usefulness of various schemes of mass arrangement depending on a design situation. The need to apply the hinged frame method for determining bearing loads on the running wheels of the trolley based on the multi-purpose layout drawing was identified. ...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{activation}} {{is critical}} for the propagation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. It {{has been suggested that}} truly naive CD 4 + T cells are resistant to productive HIV- 1 infection because of their constitutive resting state. Memory and naive CD 4 + T-cell subsets from 11 HIV- 1 -infected individuals were isolated ex vivo by a combination of magnetic bead depletion and fluorescence-activated cell sorting techniques with stringent criteria of combined expression of CD 45 RA and CD 62 L to identify naive CD 4 + T-cell subsets. In all patients HIV- 1 provirus could be detected within naive CD 45 RA+/CD 62 L+ CD 4 + T cells; in addition, replication-competent HIV- 1 was isolated from these cells upon CD 4 + T-cell stimulation in tissue cultures. Memory CD 4 + T cells had a median of fourfold more replication-competent virus and a median of sixfold more provirus than naive CD 4 + T cells. Overall, there was a median of 16 -fold more integrated provirus identified in memory CD 4 + T cells than in naive CD 4 + T cells within a given patient. Interestingly, there was a trend toward <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> viral <b>loads</b> in memory and naive CD 4 + T-cell subsets in those patients who harbored CXCR 4 -using (syncytium-inducing) viruses. Within any given patient, there was no selective usage of a particular coreceptor by virus isolated from memory versus naive CD 4 + T cells. Our findings suggest that naive CD 4 + T cells may be a significant viral reservoir for HIV, particularly in those patients harboring CXCR 4 -using viruses...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a criterion to assess <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity {{that is consistent}} with theoretical views of equality of opportunity. We characterize inequality of opportunity as a situation where some groups in society enjoy an illegitimate advantage. In this context, <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity requires that the extent of the illegitimate advantage enjoyed by the privileged groups falls. Robustness requires that this judgement be supported by the broadest class of individual preferences. We formalize this criterion in a decision theoretic framework, and derive an empirical condition for <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity based on observed opportunity distributions. The criterion is used to assess the effectiveness of child care at equalizing opportunity among children, using quantile treatment effects estimates of a major child care reform in Norway...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, an {{indeterminate}} {{structure was}} developed with multiple competing objectives including the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> the <b>load</b> distribution among the supports while maximizing {{the stability of}} the structure. Two different coding algorithms named “Continuous Method” and “Discretized Method” were used to solve the optimal support locations using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). In continuous method, a continuous solution space was considered to find optimal support locations. The failure of this method to stick to the acceptable optimal solution led towards the development of the second method. The latter approach divided the solution space into rectangular grids, and GAs acted on the index number of the nodal points to converge to the optimality. The average value of the objective function in the discretized method was found to be 0. 147 which was almost onethird of that obtained by the continuous method. The comparison based on individual components of the objective function also proved that the proposed method outperformed the continuous method. The discretized method also showed faster convergence to the optima. Three circular discontinuities were added to the structure to make it more realistic and three different penalty functions named flat, linear and non-linear penalty were used to handle the constraints. The performance of the two methods was observed with the penalty functions while increasing the radius of the circles by 25 % and 50 % which showed no significant difference. Later, the discretized method was coded to eliminate the discontinuous area from the solution space which made the application of the penalty functions redundant. A paired t-test (α= 5 %) showed no statistical difference between these two methods. Finally, to make the proposed method compatible with irregular shaped discontinuous areas, “FEA Integrated Coded Discretized Method (FEAICDM) ” was developed. The manual elimination of the infeasible areas from the candidate surface was replaced by the nodal points of the mesh generated by Solid Works. A paired t-test (α= 5 %) showed no statistical difference between these two methods. Though FEAICDM was applied only to a class of problem, it can be concluded that FEAICDM is more robust and efficient than the continuous method for a class of constrained optimization problem...|$|R

60|$|For these reasons, <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> wealth without <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> power {{seems to}} me a rather small and {{unstable}} achievement. But <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> power is not a thing that can be achieved in a day. It requires a considerable level of moral, intellectual, and technical education. It requires a long period without extreme crises, in order that habits of tolerance and good nature may become common. It requires vigour {{on the part of those}} who are acquiring power, without a too desperate resistance on the part of those whose share is diminishing. This is only possible if those who are acquiring power are not very fierce, and do not terrify their opponents by threats of ruin and death. It cannot be done quickly, because quick methods require that very mechanism and subordination of the individual which we should struggle to prevent.|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} Huerta de Soto’s thesis about the “mistaken {{doctrine}} of common law”, {{which is based}} on the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> depositum irregulare and mutuum contracts.

The study shows that mutuum was even in Roman law an ancient contract that was not codified, and that Huerta de Soto’s interpretation of this contract in the Anglo-American legal system is based more on civil law, not on common law as he stated in his work. Finally, the problem of common law did not lie in the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> the mentioned contracts, but rather in the absence of depositum irregulare contracts applied to monetary questions...|$|R
