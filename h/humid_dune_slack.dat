40|$|The {{crab spider}} Xysticus sabulosus (HAHN, 1832) is a sit-and-wait predator, typical for sandy {{habitats}} in Europe and Flanders. In the Flemish coastal dunes, {{the species is}} very abundant in grey and blond dunes. lts abdominal and cephalothorical colour varies from almost completely white to dark brown. During autumn 2001, we investigated crypsis as a function ofthe occupied micro- and macrohabitat. Our results indicate that (1) Colouration differs between the populations. The species is darker in a grey dune completely covered with dried (brown) mosses and in a <b>humid</b> <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> covered with algae, than in populations from a sea inlet and from a blond dune. The colouration of a population from a grey dune with mosses, lichens and bare sand is intermediate. (2) Individual cephalothoracal colouration is, in contrast to abdominal colouration, related to microhabitat selection: individuals with darker cephalothoraxes occupy hunting sites with a higher coverage of mosses, while those with a pale one are found in microhabitats with a high amount of nude sand. The observed spider colour-environment covariation between populations is probably the result of natural selection or colour alteration during the juvenile development. Further research on these possible underlying mechanisms remains, however, necessary...|$|E
40|$|Flanders has {{the most}} urbanised {{coastline}} of Europe, north of the Pyrenees and the Alps. During the 20 th century seaside resorts grew to one another to finally form one urban agglomeration from the Dutch to the French border, only locally interrupted by some rather small not built up areas of dunes. However even the remaining and legally protected 'natural areas' often include buildings, roads or even dredging sludge dumps. In this situation of an extremely damaged and fragmented natural environment, management by mowing and grazing {{is not sufficient to}} restore it to a satisfactory level. Open space and physical conditions have to be restored in order to create chances for the redevelopment of natural habitats and wild species. In this paper an overview is given of the most important nature restoration works that have been or are currently being carried out by the Nature Division along the Flemish coast since the year 1995. These projects include: (1) the demolition of the buildings of the former children-home 'Georges Theunis' - to reactivate large scale sand drift (1995) and the removal of a soil dump - to recreate a wet dune slack (1997) in the Flemish Nature Reserve 'Ter Yde' at Oostduinkerke; (2) the digging off of soil dumps and the excavation of a former raceway - to restore decalcified fossil dunes (1997 - 2000) in the Flemish Nature Reserve 'D'Heye' at Bredene; (3) the complete demolition of the former military harbour and the digging off of the dredging spoil-dumps - to restore mud flats, salt marshes and sand dunes (1999 - 2003) in the Flemish Nature Reserve 'The Yzer-rivermouth' at Nieuwpoort; (4) the demolition of the former 'Swimming Pool' - to create a pond, a wet dune-slack and grey and white dunes (2004) in the Flemish Nature Reserve 'Zwin-dunes and polders' at Knokke; (5) the demolition of the former sewage treatment plant of Nieuwpoort - to restore calcareous marshland and <b>humid</b> <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> areas (2004 - 2005) in the fossil beach-plain of the regional nature domain 'Groenendijk'. The paper describes how these projects have been conceived, planned, prepared and finally executed and, if the necessary data are already available, it compares their results with their initial objectives concerning stimulating natural processes and increasing biodiversity. All the concerned sites are included in the proposed Special Area for Conservation 'Dunes including Yzer-rivermouth and Zwin' which has been proposed under the European Habitat-directive 92 / 43 /EEC. All the above mentioned projects aim at an active implementation of this directive. Although it is more economic to demolish constructions than to restore them, such large scale demolition- and ground-works are relatively expensive in proportion to the rather limited budgets which are available for nature conservation. EU financial contribution was obtained under the LIFE nature - projects 'Integral Coastal Conservation Initiative' (ICCI) and 'Fossil Estuary of the Yzer-Dunes Restoration Action' (FEYDRA). It has been of significant importance to facilitate the dismantlement of the military harbour and the demolition of the sewage treatment plant, both of which were situated at Nieuwpoort...|$|E

40|$|Cutandia maritima is a circum-Mediterranean {{species that}} inhabits sandy dunes {{along the coast}} line. It is fairly {{frequent}} on the western Adriatic coast but fairly rare and possibly even non-native in the east. In Croatia, it was discovered in 1990 in Crnika Bay {{on the island of}} Rab, which was considered until 2005 to be the only site on the eastern Adriatic coast from the Gulf of Trieste in the north to Corfu in the south. In 2009, the species was briefly reported for Velika plaža (Long Beach) in Ulcinj (Montenegro) but without details about the habitat type and synecology. The aim of this paper is thus to provide a deeper insight into the ecology and synecology of C. maritima in the eastern Adriatic part of the distribution area. On Velika plaža in Ulcinj, the species was found along the whole sea-inland gradient of sand dunes, in various types of vegetation: [1210] - annual vegetation of drift lines, [2110] - embryonic shifting dunes, [2120] - shifting dunes with Ammophila arenaria (white dunes), [2220] - dunes with Euphorbia terracina, [2130 *] - fixed coastal dunes with herbaceous vegetation (grey dunes), and also [2190] - <b>humid</b> <b>dune</b> <b>slacks...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Magilligan sand spit dune {{field is}} {{situated}} on the eastern mouth of Lough Foyle in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It is a large triangular-shaped site some 7 km by 4 km by 1. 5 km wide (about 800 hectares) and maintains areas, particularly in the eastern part, with slacks that regularly flood in winter. The size of the system acts as a buffer to external drivers due to the large volume of groundwater stored, the longer travel distances and lower hydraulic gradients. However, unlike many other coastal <b>dune</b> sites with <b>humid</b> <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> in the British Isles the sand is not wholly underlain by silt and clay, as raised beach sand and gravel deposits are {{in contact with the}} sand aquifer in some places. A preliminary water balance suggests {{that the majority of the}} discharge from the sand aquifer occurs via the underlying raised beach deposits and only a small amount discharges directly from the sand aquifer beneath the foredunes.

40|$|Coastal <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> {{wetlands}} {{exist at}} {{the interface between}} land and sea. They typically occur in the low-lying areas between dune ridges where the water table remains {{at or near the}} ground surface for {{some or all of the}} year. Like many wetland habitats, the hydro-ecological conditions provide a niche in which specially adapted species can exist. Notable <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> species with European protection include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the fen orchid (Liparis loeselii). Dune systems are amongst the most dynamic of all habitats and dune wetlands can appear or disappear in timescales comparable to human lifespans as coastal processes deposit or erode the substrates upon which they form. It is these dynamic processes that create areas of bare sand suitable for development of early successional stages of dune vegetation whilst elsewhere in the dune system natural succession drives a progression towards more mature vegetation. Over time, anthropogenic pressures including afforestation, abstraction and addition of nutrients have resulted in a decline in the quality and extent of dune habitat such that the majority of <b>humid</b> <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> across Europe are now in unfavourable condition. Management to address these pressures and improve dune habitats is underway in many countries however the complex mix of natural and anthropogenic processes that influence dune wetlands is at times difficult to disentangle making it hard to identify the most suitable management practices at particular sites. Up to now effective management of these habitats has not been supported by a coordinated presentation of the relevant research. The establishment of multidisciplinary groups such as the UK Sand Dune and Shingle Network has proved effective in bringing together the range of expertise necessary to affect change. This special issue is the result of the second meeting of the network’s Sand Dune Hydrology Group which was held in Swansea in September 2013 with the intention of supporting effective habitat management through sound science...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} stop the {{continuous}} decline of typical <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> communities along the Dutch coast, restoration projects {{have been carried out}} since 1952. Restoration measures consisted of re-introducing traditional management techniques in <b>dune</b> <b>slacks,</b> such as mowing, grazing and sod removal, or constructing artificial <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> to compensate for lost biodiversity elsewhere. An analysis of successful and unsuccessful projects showed that constructing new <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> was not very successful for maintaining new populations of endangered <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> species, since such projects were often carried out in areas where seed banks were depleted, while hydrological conditions and seed dispersal mechanisms were sub-optimal. The construction of sand dikes to prevent sea intrusion in large beach plains was, unintentionally, a temporary success for the establishment of many Red List species, although such measures often disrupted natural <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> formation. Successful sites were all characterised by a regular discharge of calcareous groundwater provided by local or regional hydrological systems, where not very long ago populations of typical <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> plants were present. Under such conditions, sod removal was a successful measure to create pioneer stages which were relatively stable, due to a very slow accumulation of organic matter in the topsoil. It is argued that new and more flexible coastal defence strategies can provide new opportunities for natural and relatively stable pioneer stages of <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> formation, suitable for the long term preservation of endangered <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> species. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results are}} {{presented}} from a mesocosm study {{of the effects of}} typical <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> plants on the soil solution nutrient contents. In <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> succession, early successional species often show radial oxygen loss (ROL) whereas their successor species do not show ROL. ROL has impact on abiotic soil parameters and therefore, affect the competitiveness of both species. Mesocosms with Littorella uniflora and Carex nigra, used as respectively a ROL and a non-ROL species, showed remarkable differences in soil solution parameters. Special attention was given to nitrogen, as it is the limiting resource in <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> succession. Mesocosms with L. uniflora showed a higher nitrate content in the soil than mesocosms with C. nigra and the control. Moreover, estimating the nitrogen balance, a significantly higher fraction of nitrogen was missing in L. uniflora (57 %) than in C. nigra (5 %). The enhanced nitrogen loss in mesocosms with L. uniflora could act as a positive-feedback mechanism for early successional stages that slows down the vegetation development in early stages of <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> succession towards the more-productive later stages.

A series of eleven <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> of 1 – 42 years old was studied in SW-Texel, the Netherlands, with the EU-habitat directive species Liparis loeselii {{present in all}} except the youngest and oldest. Analysis of aerial photographs revealed that new slacks are currently formed every 4 – 5 years. In each slack, topsoil and vegetation data were collected in 2010 and 2014 – 2015. During succession, vegetation changed from brackish pioneer stages to <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> with L. loeselii and Parnassia palustris and ultimately grassland species. Differences between <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> and sampling periods were mostly significant. Herb cover and soil C increased with slack age, and over the five year study period, while bare sand, bulk density and pH decreased. The annual pH-decrease was 0. 055 and 0. 075 for pH-H 2 O and pH-KCl respectively, and annual C-increase 0. 16 % and 35 g m- 2. Liparis loeselii was only present between pHH 2 O 5. 8 – 7. 5 and pHKCl 5. 6 – 7. 6, and only occurred at C-content below 4. 3 %. In lime-poor dunes, environmental conditions thus become unsuitable approximately 34 years {{after the start of}} succession. In the <b>dune</b> <b>slacks,</b> Liparis loeselii established within 6 years, showed peak values after 11 – 16 years, and declined until conditions became unsuitable. Rejuvenation may occur after large storms with fresh sand deposits. However, even with further succession, the present populations are not endangered and probably last until 2040. With new <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> every 5 years, L. loeselii occurs in approximately eight different <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> at the same time, ensuring viable populations also in the future.

40|$|<b>Dune</b> <b>slacks</b> are biodiverse {{seasonal}} wetlands which experience considerable fluctuation {{in water}} table depth. They are under threat from lowered water tables due {{to climate change}} and water abstraction and from eutrophication. The biological effects caused by the interactions of these pressures are poorly understood, particularly on soil processes. We used a mesocosm experiment and laboratory assays to study the impact of lowered water tables, groundwater nitrogen contamination, and their synergistic effects on soil microbial processes and greenhouse gas emissions. This study showed that just a 10 cm decrease in water table depth led {{to a reduction in}} denitrification and to a corresponding increase in soil nitrogen content. Meanwhile N 2 O emissions occurred for longer durations within <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> soils subject to higher concentrations of groundwater nitrogen contamination. The results from extracellular enzyme assays suggest that decomposition rates increase within drier soils shown by the increase in β-glucosidase activity, with further sensitivity to groundwater nitrogen contamination shown by the increase in phenol oxidase activity. <b>Dune</b> <b>slack</b> soils with a 10 cm lower water table had significantly lower methane emissions, nearly 5 times lower in the drier soils.

40|$|Environmental {{processes}} {{controlling the}} occurrence of basiphilous pioneer vegetation were identified in seven representative <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> on the Dutch Wadden Sea Islands. The variation in vegetation and relations with soil and groundwater composition were established first. Cluster analysis of the vegetation in the <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> resulted in six subtypes of basiphilous pioneer vegetation and three types representing older succession stages. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that moisture and pH are the main habitat factors in the dataset and that habitats of older succession stages, compared to basiphilous pioneer stages, are either acidified or eutrophicated. A principal component analysis of shallow groundwater samples from all <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> revealed the dominant influence of inundation with sea water in the total dataset. In the freshwater dataset Ca 2 + and HCO 3 concentrations predominated. Cl- and Ca 2 + concentrations of shallow groundwater were, therefore, considered key variables in describing the environmental processes determining suitable habitat conditions for basiphilous pioneer vegetation. To be able to distinguish between a conditioning role of tl-le hydrological regime (c. q. exfiltration of mineral rich groundwater) and a conditioning role of (former) geomorphological processes (c. q. the presence of CaCO 3 minerals), the soil CaCO 3 content was added as key environmental variable. In primary <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> on the islands of Schiermonnikoog and Texel, having comparable initial lime contents (0. 5 - 1 %), {{the life span of}} basiphilous pioneer vegetation was estimated to be 30 - 50 years without a mowing regime and 100 - 150 years under a mowing regime. In secondary <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> the life span of basiphilous pioneer vegetation varies considerably with differences in local circumstances, especially in strength of prevailing pH-buffering mechanisms.

One of the few remaining natural dune systems lift in the Manawatu is located south of the Rangitikei River mouth at Tangimoana, the "Tangimoana dump dunes", a proposed DoC reserve. The area contains excellent examples of temporary wetlands in <b>dune</b> <b>slacks,</b> with early successional vegetation well represented. This vegetation is being eliminated by larger wetland plants and is unable to colonize new habitat, as dune stabilization prevents its formation. The vegetation of the proposed reserve was sampled and vegetation patterns were related to environmental factors. Foredune, <b>dune</b> plain, <b>slack,</b> marram <b>dune,</b> shrub dune and grassland communities were identitied. A low species diversity was found, which included a high proportion of exotic species in the grassland, shrub and marram dune communities. The low number of communities and species richness {{may be related to the}} area's youth and the dune's dynamic nature. Water table fluctuation were monitored in two temporary wetlands, which contained the endangered sand spiked sedge, Eleocharis neozelandica, an early successional species. The water table fluctuation were directly related to rainfall and season. A high winter and spring water table in 1995 resulted in dramatic changes in the distributions of some <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> plants. Control and exclosure plots were used to assess the effects of rabbit browse on the <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> vegetation. These plots also provided valuable information of the vegetation change to water table heights. Species more suited to permanently wet location increased greatly, while species suited to more temporary wet areas moved higher in elevation, to around the winter high water line. Two endangered plants of the Manawatu dunelands, Eleocharis neozelandica and Pimelea "Turakina" were cultivated and then established at the Tangimoana dump dunes. Pimelea "Turakina" appears to be well adapted to the Manawatu dune lands and produced abundant seedlings at Tangimoana. Creation of deflation hollows for E. neozelandica habitat was undertaken. E. neozelandica was planted in the constructed hollows at three separate elevation, and survived winter submergence at the medium and high elevation sites, of at least seven months at the medium site, and appears to be a valuable and effective management tool for the conservation of <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> species.

Methods: The composition of the soil seed bank in two depth layers was determined using the seedling emergence method between March 2004 and April 2005. Long-term monitoring data on the floristic composition of the established vegetation were obtained from the national conservation agency, and additional monitoring was undertaken in 2003. Floristic composition, seed weights, seed longevity of component species and Ellenberg indicator values were used to compare the seed bank and established vegetation. Results: The soil seed bank was diverse and contained typical <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> species, species of early successional stages and species of conservation interest. A comparison between the composition of the seed bank and historical data on the composition of the established vegetation showed that the seed bank reflects earlier successional stages more closely than the current aboveground vegetation.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for {{the occurrence of}} alternative stable states in a wet calcareous <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> on the Frisian island of Texel, The Netherlands. An early pioneer stage (0. 5 kg m– 2 total standing crop) and a more productive later successional stage (2. 9 kg m– 2) occur side by side, with sharp boundaries between them. The pioneer vegetation has been recorded at the site for more than 62 yr. These features indicate the occurrence of a positive-feedback mechanism {{that has led to}} alternative stable states. Analyses of ground and surface water composition, and decalcification depths, indicated that hydrologically the study site can be characterized as a flow-through slack, with exfiltration of calcareous groundwater on one side and infiltration of surface water {{on the other side of}} the slack. These differences in hydrological conditions have led to distinct differences in environmental conditions within the <b>dune</b> <b>slack.</b> The occurrence of the two successional stages can, however, not be explained by differences in hydrological conditions since both stages occur side by side in the centre of the <b>dune</b> <b>slack.</b> It is, therefore, more likely that biotic interactions are the cause of the vegetation pattern. Three possible mechanisms for feedback processes are discussed: (1) enhanced nitrogen loss; (2) sulfide toxicity and (3) nutrient accumulation in internal cycle. ...|$|R
40|$|Restinga” {{habitats}} present many stressful {{conditions for}} plant establishment. Clusia criuva occurs in these habitats, including dune fields, {{and for this}} reason the Parque Municipal das Dunas da Lagoa da Conceição, Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State, Brazil, was chosen as the area of study. In habitats where resources are scarce and abiotic conditions are severe, it is common to find positive interactions between plants (facilitation). Some studies suggest that bromeliad species facilitate other plants in “restinga”. The present study evaluated the population structure of C. criuva in two different habitats, i. e. in an internal dune and in <b>dune</b> <b>slack,</b> both with herbaceous and sub-shrub vegetation. The study described the differences in populations and the relationship between the occurrences of C. criuva and bromeliad species. The populations showed an aggregated pattern and low density in the two areas. On the <b>dune</b> <b>slack,</b> the plants were younger, and seemed to have colonized the area recently. In the dune itself, we observed a positive relation between C. criuva and the bromeliad species Vriesea friburgensis Mez var. paludosa (L. B. Smith) L. B. Smith. This relationship was not observed in the <b>dune</b> <b>slack</b> where the abiotic conditions are less restrictive in relation to the availability of water and nutrients...|$|R
50|$|Boloria selene is {{widespread}} across upland and western Britain, {{but is not}} found in central, eastern England or Ireland. Its numbers are declining in England. It occurs in damp, grassy habitats, woodland clearings and moorland, but has also been found in <b>dune</b> <b>slacks</b> and coastal cliffs.|$|R
50|$|Liparis loeselii, {{common names}} fen orchid, yellow widelip orchid, or bog twayblade, is {{a species of}} orchid. It is native to Europe, {{northern}} Asia, the eastern United States and eastern Canada. It grows in fens, bogs and <b>dune</b> <b>slacks.</b> It is a yellow flowering plant with glossy yellow-green leaves.|$|R
