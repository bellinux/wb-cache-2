The tool employs an architecture template based on the pipelined cascade principle. The generated cores support run-time programmable length and transform type selection, enabling seamless integration into multiple mode and multiple standard terminals. A distinctive feature of the tool is its accuracy-driven configuration engine which automatically profiles the <b>internal</b> <b>arithmetic</b> and generates a core with minimum operands bit-width and thus minimum circuit complexity. The engine performs a closed-loop optimization over three different <b>internal</b> <b>arithmetic</b> models (fixed-point, block floating-point and convergent block floating-point) using the numerical accuracy budget given by the user as a reference point. The flexibility and re-usability of the proposed macrocell are illustrated through several case studies which encompass all current state-of-the-art OFDM communications standards (WLAN, WMAN, xDSL, DVB-T/H, DAB and UWB). Implementations results of the generated macrocells are presented for two deep sub-micron standard-cells libraries (65 and 90 nm) and commercially available FPGA devices. When compared with other tools for automatic FFT core generation, the proposed environment produces macrocells with lower circuit complexity expressed as gate count and RAM/ROM bits, while keeping the same system level performance in terms of throughput, transform size and numerical accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Residue {{number system}} is a non¬-weighted integer number system which uses the {{residues}} of division of ordinary numbers by some modules for representing that ordinary numbers. In this paper, the general three moduli set } 2 n- 1, 2 n+ 1, 2 pn+ 1 - 1 } based on CRT algorithm is proposed in which “p” is an even number greater than zero. The special case of this set for p= 2 which is } 2 n- 1, 2 n+ 1, 22 n+ 1 - 1 { is also described in this paper. Since the dynamic range of this set is odd, some difficult problems in RNS can be easily solved based on this set using parity checking. The proposed reverse converter is better in speed and hardware in comparison to reverse converters in similar dynamic range.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes novel architectures {{and design}} techniques targeting SoC {{building blocks for}} telecommunications and signal processing applications. Hardware implementation of Low-Density Parity-Check decoders is approached at both the algorithmic and the architecture level. Low-Density Parity-Check codes are a promising coding scheme for future communication standards due to their outstanding error correction performance. This work proposes a methodology for analyzing effects of finite precision arithmetic on error correction performance and hardware complexity. The methodology is throughout employed for co-designing the decoder. First, a low-complexity check node based on the P-output decoding principle is designed and characterized on a CMOS standard-cells library. Results demonstrate implementation loss below 0. 2 dB down to BER of 10 ^{- 8 } and a saving in complexity up to 59 % with respect to other works in recent literature. High-throughput and low-latency issues are addressed with modified single-phase decoding schedules. A new "memory-aware" schedule is proposed requiring down to 20 % of memory {{with respect to the}} traditional two-phase flooding decoding. Additionally, throughput is doubled and logic complexity reduced of 12 %. These advantages are traded-off with error correction performance, thus making the solution attractive only for long codes, as those adopted in the DVB-S 2 standard. The "layered decoding" principle is extended to those codes not specifically conceived for this technique. Proposed architectures exhibit complexity savings in the order of 40 % for both area and power consumption figures, while implementation loss is smaller than 0. 05 dB. Most modern communication standards employ Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing as part of their physical layer. The core of OFDM is the Fast Fourier Transform and its inverse in charge of symbols (de) modulation. Requirements on throughput and energy efficiency call for FFT hardware implementation, while ubiquity of FFT suggests the design of parametric, re-configurable and re-usable IP hardware macrocells. In this context, this thesis describes an FFT/IFFT core compiler particularly suited for implementation of OFDM communication systems. The tool employs an accuracy-driven configuration engine which automatically profiles the <b>internal</b> <b>arithmetic</b> and generates a core with minimum operands bit-width and thus minimum circuit complexity. The engine performs a closed-loop optimization over three different <b>internal</b> <b>arithmetic</b> models (fixed-point, block floating-point and convergent block floating-point) using the numerical accuracy budget given by the user as a reference point. The flexibility and re-usability of the proposed macrocell are illustrated through several case studies which encompass all current state-of-the-art OFDM communications standards (WLAN, WMAN, xDSL, DVB-T/H, DAB and UWB). Implementations results are presented for two deep sub-micron standard-cells libraries (65 and 90 nm) and commercially available FPGA devices. Compared with other FFT core compilers, the proposed environment produces macrocells with lower circuit complexity and same system level performance (throughput, transform size and numerical accuracy). The final part of this dissertation focuses on the Network-on-Chip design paradigm whose goal is building scalable communication infrastructures connecting hundreds of core. A low-complexity link architecture for mesochronous on-chip communication is discussed. The link enables skew constraint looseness in the clock tree synthesis, frequency speed-up, power consumption reduction and faster back-end turnarounds. The proposed architecture reaches a maximum clock frequency of 1 GHz on 65 nm low-leakage CMOS standard-cells library. In a complex test case with a full-blown NoC infrastructure, the link overhead is only 3 % of chip area and 0. 5 % of leakage power consumption. Finally, a new methodology, named metacoding, is proposed. Metacoding generates correct-by-construction technology independent RTL codebases for NoC building blocks. The RTL coding phase is abstracted and modeled with an Object Oriented framework, integrated within a commercial tool for IP packaging (Synopsys CoreTools suite). Compared with traditional coding styles based on pre-processor directives, metacoding produces 65 % smaller codebases and reduces the configurations to verify up to three orders of magnitude...|$|E

40|$|What Gödel {{referred}} to as “outer ” consistency is contrasted with the “inner” consistency of arithmetic from a constructivist point of view. In the set-theoretic setting of Peano arithmetic, the diagonal procedure leads {{out of the realm}} of natural numbers. It is shown that Hilbert’s programme of arithmetiza-tion points rather to an “internalisation ” of consistency. The programme was continued by Herbrand, Gödel and Tarski.

Through the use of modern digital signal processing techniques this estimate can be made in a simpler fashion using a conventional receiver. In this thesis a technique is developed for time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation using a frequency domain based correlation detector driven by an envelope detector. Time lag boundaries are defined on the output of the correlator. A fixed detection threshold is calculated to permit constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection. The performance of the correlation detector is plotted as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as a function of signal to noise ratio (SNR).

40|$|The ever {{shrinking}} {{size of the}} MOS transistors {{brings the}} promise of scalable Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures containing hundreds of processing elements with on-chip communication, all integrated into a single die. Such a computational fabric will provide high levels of performance in an energy efficient manner. To mitigate emerging wire-delay problem and to address the need for substantial interconnect bandwidth, packet switched routers are fast replacing shared buses and dedicated wires as the interconnect fabric of choice. With on-chip communication consuming {{a significant portion of}} the chip power and area budgets, there is a compelling need for compact, low power routers. While applications dictate the choice of the compute core, the advent of multimedia applications, such as 3 D graphics and signal processing, places stronger demands for self-contained, low-latency floating-point processors with increased throughput. Therefore, this work focuses on two key building blocks critical to the success of NoC design: high performance, area and energy efficient router and floating-point processor architectures. This thesis first presents a six-port four-lane 57 GB/s non-blocking router core based on wormhole switching. The router features double-pumped crossbar channels and destinationaware channel drivers that dynamically configure based on the current packet destination. This enables 45 % reduction in crossbar channel area, 23 % overall router area, up to 3. 8 X reduction in peak channel power, and 7. 2 % improvement in average channel power, with no performance penalty over a published design. In a 150 nm six-metal CMOS process, the 12. 2 mm 2 router contains 1. 9 million transistors and operates at 1 GHz at 1. 2 V. We next present a new pipelined single-precision floating-point multiply accumulator core (FPMAC) featuring a single-cycle accumulate loop using base 32 and <b>internal</b> carry-save <b>arithmetic,</b> with delayed addition techniques. Combined algorithmic, logic and circuit techniques enable multiply-accumulates at speeds exceeding 3 GHz, with single-cycle throughput. Unlike existing FPMAC architectures, the design eliminates scheduling restrictions between consecutive FPMAC instructions. The optimizations allow removal of the costly normalization step from the critical accumulate loop and conditionally powered down using dynamic sleep transistors on long accumulate operations, saving active and leakage power. In addition, an improved leading zero anticipator (LZA) and overflow detection logic applicable to carry-save format is presented. In a 90 nm seven-metal dual-VT CMOS process, the 2 mm 2 custom design contains 230 K transistors. The fully functional first silicon achieves 6. 2 GFLOPS of performance while dissipating 1. 2 W at 3. 1 GHz, 1. 3 V supply. It is clear that realization of successful NoC designs require well balanced decisions at all levels: architecture, logic, circuit and physical design. Our results from key building blocks demonstrate the feasibility of pushing the performance limits of compute cores and communication routers, while keeping active and leakage power, and area under control.

NoC architectures, with structured on-chip networks are emerging as a scalable and modular solution to global communications within large systems-on-chip. NoCs mitigate the emerging wire-delay problem and addresses the need for substantial interconnect bandwidth by replacing today’s shared buses with packet-switched router networks. With on-chip communication consuming {{a significant portion of}} the chip power and area budgets, there is a compelling need for compact, low power routers.

This work demonstrates that a computational fabric built using optimized building blocks can provide high levels of performance in an energy efficient manner. The thesis details an integrated 80 - Tile NoC architecture implemented in a 65 -nm process technology. The prototype is designed to deliver over 1. 0 TFLOPS of performance while dissipating less than 100 W.

We next describe a new pipelined single-precision floating-point multiply accumulator core (FPMAC) featuring a single-cycle accumulation loop using base 32 and <b>internal</b> carry-save <b>arithmetic,</b> with delayed addition techniques. A combination of algorithmic, logic and circuit techniques enable multiply-accumulate operations at speeds exceeding 3 GHz, with singlecycle throughput. This approach reduces the latency of dependent FPMAC instructions and enables a sustained multiply-add result (2 FLOPS) every cycle. The optimizations allow removal of the costly normalization step from the critical accumulation loop and conditionally powered down using dynamic sleep transistors on long accumulate operations, saving active and leakage power. In a 90 -nm seven-metal dual-VT CMOS process, the 2 mm 2 custom design contains 230 -K transistors. Silicon achieves 6. 2 -GFLOPS of performance while dissipating 1. 2 W at 3. 1 GHz, 1. 3 V supply. We finally present the industry's first single-chip programmable teraFLOPS processor. The NoC architecture contains 80 tiles arranged as an 8 × 10 2 D array of floating-point cores and packet-switched routers, both designed to operate at 4 GHz. Each tile has two pipelined singleprecision FPMAC units which feature a single-cycle accumulation loop for high throughput. The five-port router combines 100 GB/s of raw bandwidth with low fall-through latency under 1 ns. The on-chip 2 D mesh network provides a bisection bandwidth of 2 Tera-bits/s. The 15 -FO 4 design employs mesochronous clocking, fine-grained clock gating, dynamic sleep transistors, and body-bias techniques. In a 65 -nm eight-metal CMOS process, the 275 mm 2 custom design contains 100 -M transistors. The fully functional first silicon achieves over 1. 0 TFLOPS of performance on a range of benchmarks while dissipating 97 W at 4. 27 GHz and 1. 07 -V supply.
