25|$|Quinolinic acid is a {{byproduct}} of the <b>kynurenine</b> <b>pathway,</b> {{which is responsible for}} catabolism of tryptophan in mammals. This pathway is important for its production of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and produces several neuroactive intermediates including quinolinic acid, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA). Quinolinic acid's neuroactive and excitatory properties are a result of NMDA receptor agonism in the brain. It also acts as a neurotoxin, gliotoxin, proinflammatory mediator, and pro-oxidant molecule.|$|E

With regard to epileptic disorders, imaging of neurotransmitter systems not only assists {{in the identification of}} epileptic foci for surgical treatment, but also provides insights into the basic mechanisms of human epilepsy. Recent investigative interest in epilepsy has focused on PET imaging of tryptophan metabolism, via the serotonin and <b>kynurenine</b> <b>pathways,</b> as well as on imaging of serotonin receptors.

25|$|When {{inflammation}} occurs, quinolinic acid {{is produced}} in excessive levels through the <b>kynurenine</b> <b>pathway.</b> This leads to over excitation of the NMDA receptor, which results in an influx of Ca2+ into the neuron. High levels of Ca2+ in the neuron trigger an activation of destructive enzymatic pathways including protein kinases, phospholipases, NO synthase, and proteases. These enzymes will degenerate crucial proteins in the cell and increase NO levels, leading to an apoptotic response by the cell, which results in cell death.|$|E
2500|$|Kynurenic acid thus {{acts as a}} neuroprotectant, by {{reducing}} the dangerous over-activation of the NMDA receptors. Manipulation of the <b>kynurenine</b> <b>pathway</b> away from quinolinic acid and toward kynurenic acid is therefore a major therapeutic focus. Nicotinylalanine {{has been shown to}} be an inhibitor of kynurenine hydroxylase, which results in a decreased production of quinolinic acid, thus favoring kynurenic acid production. This change in balance has the potential to reduce hyperexcitability, and thus excitotoxic damage produced from elevated levels of quinolinic acid.|$|E

40|$|Emergent {{seizures}} {{are common}} in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), although the mechanisms mediating this are unknown. It is proposed that stress induced interleukin- 18 (IL- 18), via interferon-gamma (IFNy) and independently, increases indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) and subsequent quinolinic acid (QA) in microglia. QA increases seizures and concurrently contributes to neuronal loss via excitotoxicity. The ApoE 4 allele interacts with IL- 18 polymorphisms to {{increase the risk of}} AD, and seems likely to potentiate the emergence of seizures. Concurrent changes in IDO and the <b>kynurenine</b> <b>pathways</b> at the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) have implications for treatment, including in the efficacy of different anti-hypertensives.

40|$|A {{significant}} problem affecting gene therapy approaches aiming at achieving long-term transgene expression is the immune response against the protein {{product of the}} therapeutic gene, which can reduce or eliminate the therapeutic effect. The problem is further exacerbated when therapy involves targeting an immunogenic tissue and/or one with a pre-existing inflammatory phenotype, such as dystrophic muscles. In this proof-of-principle study, we co-expressed a model antigen, bacterial β-galactosidase, with an immunosuppressive factor, indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase 1 (IDO 1), in muscles of the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This treatment prevented loss of expression of the transgene concomitant with significantly elevated expression of T-regulatory (Treg) markers in the IDO 1 -expressing muscles. Moreover, co-expression of IDO 1 resulted in reduced serum levels of anti-β-gal antibodies.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} {{demonstrates the}} immunosuppressive <b>kynurenine</b> <b>pathway’s</b> (KP) {{role in the}} pathophysiology of human gliomas. To study the KP in vivo, we used the noninvasive molecular imaging tracer α-[11 C]-methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT). The AMT-positron emission tomography (PET) has shown high uptake in high-grade gliomas and predicted survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). We generated patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from dissociated cells, or tumor fragments, from 5 patients with GBM. Mice bearing subcutaneous tumors were imaged with AMT-PET, and tumors were analyzed to detect the KP enzymes indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) 1, IDO 2, tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase, kynureninase, and kynurenine 3 -monooxygenase. Overall, PET imaging showed robust tumoral AMT uptake in PDX mice with prolonged tracer accumulation over 60 minutes, consistent with AMT trapping seen in humans. Immunostained tumor tissues demonstrated positive detection of multiple KP enzymes. Furthermore, intracranial implantation of GBM cells was performed with imaging at both 9 and 14 days postimplant, with a marked increase in AMT uptake at 14 days and a corresponding high level of tissue immunostaining for KP enzymes. These results indicate that our PDX mouse models recapitulate human GBM, including aberrant tryptophan metabolism, and offer an in vivo system for development of targeted therapeutics for patients with GBM...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c]pyridazin- 5 -one {{derivatives}} as inhibitors of MAO-B revealed {{that it was}} possible to increase the MAO-B inhibitory potency of 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c]pyridazin- 5 -ones by substituting the central heterocycle in the 3 -position or C- 8 with lipophilic groups which occupy the substrate cavity or the entrance of the binding site, respectively. Here, four new 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c]pyridazin- 5 -one derivatives containing lipophilic groups at both positions were synthesized and their inhibitory potency against human monoamine oxidase A and B were evaluated. Selectivity of these compounds against IDO and TDO, two enzymes sharing substrate similarity with MAO and involved in the serotonergic and <b>kynurenine</b> <b>pathways</b> was also studied. All compounds showed higher activity and selectivity against MAO-B, the most effective one being 3 -methyl- 8 -meta-chlorobenzyloxy- 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c]pyridazin- 5 - one (9 a) which was shown to be a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 0. 11 μM. Replacing the methyl group in the 3 -position with a meta-CF 3 -phenyl group (7 a, 7 b and 7 c) abolished the inhibitory potency against MAO-B. Indeed, the substitution of the 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c] pyridazin- 5 -one core in the 3 -position dramatically influences the MAO-inhibiting properties of these compounds. Molecular docking studies of 9 a within MAO-B suggest that the 5 H-indeno[1, 2 -c]pyridazin- 5 -one scaffold is well stabilized into the substrate cavity with the meta-chlorobenzyloxy side chain extending towards a rather hydrophobic pocket at the entrance cavity. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Background: Circulating {{concentrations}} of biomarkers {{that are related}} to Vitamin status vary by factors such as diet, fortification, and supplement use. Published biomarker concentrations have also been influenced by the variation across laboratories, which complicates a comparison of results from different studies. Objective: We robustly and comprehensively assessed differences in biomarkers {{that are related to}} Vitamin status across geographic regions. Design: The trial was a cross-sectional study in which we investigated 38 biomarkers that are related to Vitamin status and one-carbon and tryptophan metabolism in serum and plasma from 5314 healthy control subjects representing 20 cohorts recruited from the United States, Nordic countries, Asia, and Australia, participating in the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium. All samples were analyzed in a centralized laboratory. Results: Circulating {{concentrations of}} riboflavin, pyridoxal 5 ≤-phosphate, folate, Vitamin B- 12, all-trans retinol, 25 -hydroxyVitamin D, and a-tocopherol as well as combined Vitamin scores that were based on these nutrients showed that the general B-Vitamin concentration was highest in the United States and that the B Vitamins and lipid soluble Vitamins were low in Asians. Conversely, circulating concentrations of metabolites that are inversely related to B Vitamins involved in the one-carbon and <b>kynurenine</b> <b>pathways</b> were high in Asians. The high B-Vitamin concentration in the United States appears to be driven mainly by multiVitamin-supplement users. Conclusions: The observed differences likely reflect the variation in intake of Vitamins and, in particular, the widespread multiVitamin-supplement use in the United States. The results provide valuable information about the differences in biomarkerconcentrations in populations across continents. Am J Clin Nutr 2017; 105 : 1314 - 26...|$|R
