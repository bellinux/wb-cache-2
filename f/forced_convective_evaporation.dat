40|$|Two main mechanisms, {{nucleate}} boiling and convective boiling, are widely accepted for in-tube flow boiling. Since the active nuclei on the heated wall are dominant for {{nucleate boiling}} and flow pattern governs the convective boiling, the {{heat transfer coefficient}} is strongly influenced by the wall heat flux, mass flux and vapor quality, respectively. In practical industrial applications, for example, the evaporators in refrigeration, <b>forced</b> <b>convective</b> <b>evaporation</b> is the dominant process and high heat transfer efficiency can be obtained under smaller temperature difference between wall and liquid. Therefore, it is of importance to develop a correlation of convective boiling heat transfer with a good accuracy. In this paper, {{a new kind of}} micro-finned helically coiled tube was developed and the flow boiling heat transfer characteristics were experimentally studied with R 134 a. Based on the analysis of the mechanisms of flow boiling, heat transfer correlations of the specific micro-finned helically coiled tubes are obtained...|$|E
40|$|A {{model has}} been derived to predict the {{frictional}} pressure gradient along a heated channel. It focuses mainly on flow boiling at high-pressure conditions (10 MPa). Based on a force-momentum balance, the overall pressure gradient {{is divided into three}} components: friction, acceleration and gravity. This model analyzes the frictional pressure drop for all heat-transfer modes encountered inside a heated channel: single-phase heat transfer, subcooled boiling, saturated (bulk) boiling, <b>forced</b> <b>convective</b> <b>evaporation</b> and film boiling. The heating effect is introduced through a change in flow structure in two-phase flow (i. e., the phase distribution), particularly the significant differences in entrained liquid fraction between adiabatic and boiling two-phase flow (two separate correlations have been derived in this study). One of the major components in this model is the relation between shear stress and velocity gradient. Based primarily on the theory in single-phase flow, this relation is extended to two-phase flow boiling through the assumption of a homogeneous mixture having the characteristics of a single-phase flow. In the forced-convective evaporation region (mainly wispy-annular flow), a four-layer structure is introduced to analyze the liquid film and two-phase core. A number of assumptions and modifications to the expressions for single-phase flow are introduced to account for the presence of two phases. Empirical corrections, however, are used for the effects of surface roughness and viscosity difference between near-wall fluid and bulk fluid on two-phase frictional pressure drop. Experimental data for validating the present model were obtained in a vertical tubular test section, installed in a high-pressure steam-water facility at the Chalk River Laboratories of AECL Research. A strong effect of surface heating on frictional pressure drop was observed. With increasing heat flux, the frictional pressure drop decreases in single-phase flow, increases in nucleate boiling, and decreases in <b>forced</b> <b>convective</b> <b>evaporation.</b> The effect of heat flux in the film-boiling region (post-dryout conditions) appears to be small. However, the frictional pressure gradient is much smaller in the film-boiling region than in the pre-CHF region for the same flow conditions (i. e., pressure, mass flux and quality). For most flow conditions, a maximum in two-phase frictional pressure drop is encountered at a quality lower than the value corresponding to the occurrence of dryout. In addition to heating, other effects on frictional pressure drop (such as pressure, mass flux, etc.) have also been examined. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Stabilization of {{cellular}} {{material in the}} presence of glass-forming sugars at ambient temperatures is a viable approach that has many potential advantages over current cryogenic strategies. Experimental evidence indicates the possibility to preserve biomolecules in glassy matrices of low-molecular mobility using ‘‘glass-forming’’ sugars like trehalose at ambient temperatures. However, when cells are desiccated in trehalose solution using passive drying techniques, a glassy skin is formed at the liquid/vapor interface of the sample. This glassy skin prevents desiccation of the sample beyond a certain level of dryness and induces non-uniformities in the ﬁnal water content. Cells trapped underneath this glassy skin may degrade due to a relatively high molecular mobility in the sample. This undesirable result underscores the need for development of a uniform, fast drying technique. In the present study, we report a new technique based on the principles of ‘‘spin drying’’ that can effectively address these problems. <b>Forced</b> <b>convective</b> <b>evaporation</b> of water along with the loss of solution due to centrifugal force leads to rapid vitriﬁcation of a thin layer of trehalose containing medium that remains on top of cells attached to the spinning glass substrate. The glassy layer produced has a consistent thickness and a small ‘‘surfacearea-to-volume’’ ratio that minimizes any non-homogeneity. Thus, the chance of entrapping cells in a high-mobility environment decreases substantially. We compared numerical predictions to experimental observations of the drying time of 0. 2 – 0. 6 M trehalose solutions at a variety of spinning speeds ranging from 1000 to 4000 rpm. The model developed here predicts the formation of sugar ﬁlms with thicknesses of 200 – 1000 nm, which was in good agreement with experimental results. Preliminary data suggest that after spin drying cells to about 0. 159 ± 0. 09 gH 2 O/gdw (n = 11, ±SE), more than 95 % of cells were able to preserve their membrane...|$|E

40|$|Crosslinked microstructured polymer {{films have}} {{received}} much attention {{due to their}} potential applications. Currently, these polymer films can be fabricated through a range of processes and lithographic techniques. However, they often require multiple fabrication steps and expensive instruments. In this thesis, we report the structure formation of films obtained via a simple, low cost one-step synthesis/fabrication process, by in situ photocrosslinking of precursors during the evaporation of solvents. Under controlled dry N 2 flow, the <b>forced</b> <b>convective</b> <b>evaporation</b> resulted in highly hierarchical film morphology, featuring a skin layer atop of a layer of microspheres. This unique morphology {{is determined by the}} interplay between fast solvent evaporation and reaction induced phase separation between the reactive precursor and the remaining solvent. For the first time, the skin layer formed during the evaporation was directly observed after the complete evaporation of the solvent. The thickness of the skin layer is dependent on the processing parameters including the N 2 flow rate, UV intensity and precursor concentrations. Under the free convection or by means of adding non-solvent, the skin layer formation could be suppressed. A model is presented that can qualitatively describe the skin layer formation and its dependence on the processing parameters, providing a mechanistic understanding of the photocrosslinking-induced phase separation under evaporative environments. We further used N-isopropylacrylamide/carbon disulfide (CS 2) as a model system to study the evolution of the composition and morphology within the solution drop. Within seconds of the process, fast evaporation of solvent dominated, which resulted in the formation of a concentration gradient that led to a skin layer later. Subsequently the evaporation rate slowed down and excessive solvent activity due to the reaction resulted in the phase separation that not only interrupted the further growth of the capping skin layer but also generated a particulate layer underneath. Using the same fabrication process but in the presence of moisturized N 2 flow, we successfully produced honeycomb like porous structures in the crosslinked polymer films. This is based on the 2 ̆ 2 breath figure 2 ̆ 2 formation during the in situ crosslinking of reactive monomer solutions. A range of precursor solutions, including tert-butyl acrylate/tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) in chloroform, methyl methacrylate/TEGDMA in CS 2 and Norland optical adhesive 65 (NOA 65) in CS 2 was crosslinked upon UV radiation under a moist and nitrogen saturated chamber and micro-size pores with reasonably uniformity were obtained in these crosslinked polymer films, illustrating the generality of this approach. The size, shape, uniformity and ordering of the pores show significant dependences on the casting conditions. In contrast, the pore morphology remains similar despite varying precursor compositions, suggesting that the pore-fixing process is still dominated by the solvent evaporation similar to that of conventional breath figure process, and is less dependent on the crosslinking process. We further observed the pores at the peripheral regions appeared more uniform in size and showed higher degree of ordering, due to the interplay between the solvent evaporation and crosslinking reaction. Detailed characterizations of the chemical and physical properties, including the glass transition temperature, thermal stability, and surface wettability of the porous films were carried out...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} define a <b>convective</b> <b>evaporation</b> model able to {{reproduce}} the evaporation rates according to the atmospheric conditions, drying tests have been performed on cylindrical samples of a compacted silt in a closed chamber where the relative humidity of the air is controlled by means of saturated saline solutions. Calibrating such models using experimental results from small sample sizes can indeed be an interesting alternative to simplify the experimental procedures and to reduce the test duration {{in comparison with the}} standard in-situ tests (e. g. lysimeter). However the influence {{of the size of the}} samples on the kinetics of evaporation has to be investigated. Samples with different diameters and heights are therefore tested. The results show that the observed mechanisms of drying are similar to those at the scale of the geostructure if the dimensions of the sample are higher than a critical height and a critical diameter. We show then that the experimental critical height is consistent with the concept of critical length proposed by Lehman et al. (2008), who expresses analytically when the hydraulic connection between the sample surface and the drying front is upset.

40|$|The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model, version 3. 6 (CCM 3) {{simulation}} of tropical intraseasonal variability in zonal winds and precipitation {{can be improved}} by implementing the microphysics of cloud with relaxed Arakawa–Schubert (McRAS) convection scheme of Sud and Walker. The default CCM 3 convection scheme of Zhang and McFarlane produces intraseasonal variability in both zonal winds and precipitation that is much lower than is observed. The convection scheme of Hack produces high tropical intraseasonal zonal wind variability but no coherent convective variability at intraseasonal timescales and low wavenumbers. The McRAS convection scheme produces realistic variability in tropical intraseasonal zonal winds and improved intraseasonal variability in tropical precipitation, although the variability in precip-itation is somewhat less than is observed. Intraseasonal variability in CCM 3 with the McRAS scheme is highly sensitive to the parameterization of <b>convective</b> precipitation <b>evaporation</b> in unsaturated environmental air and unsaturated downdrafts.
