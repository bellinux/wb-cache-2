40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD) {{is a very}} early form of prenatal diagnosis (PND) by which gene-tic diagnosis is performed on a single embryonic blas-tomer obtained by <b>embryonic</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Hence the genet-ic status of the embryo can be defined prior to embryo transfer; thus termination of pregnancy would not hap-pen. The objective of the present paper was to estab-lish preimplantation diagnosis for spinal muscular atro-phy (SMA), a prevalent monogenic disorder in Iran, and to find the efficacy and sensitivity of the developed protocol. The fluorescent duplex single cell PCR tech-nique for detection of SMN gene exon 7 deletion was developed first on single lymphocyte and then on a single blastomer. The protocol was duplexed {{with one of the}} three linked polymorphic markers namely, D 5 S 112, D 5 S 435 and D 5 S 679. The PCR products of SMN exon 7 were restricted with DraI restriction endonuclease. Linkage analyses through polymorphic markers were also used for diagnosis. The amplifica-tion rates for SMN exon 7 deletion on a single lympho-cytes and single blastomers were 96 and 88 % respec-tively, using the aforementioned methods. The mean amplification rates of 3 polymorphic markers were 94 % on single lymphocytes and 84 % on single blastomers, respectively. Mean allele drop out (ADO) for the 3 markers on single lymphocytes was 4 %. In conclusion the developed duplex single cell fluorescent PCR seems to be an accurate and feasible method at single cell level and could be easily applied in clinical preim-plantation {{genetic diagnosis}}...|$|E
40|$|In {{plastic surgery}} free {{neurovascular}} flap is used with reconstructive purposes. In {{spite of the}} great number of improvements, aesthetic and functional results of free flap are not always successful, mostly because fibrosis and fatty change take place after some years. Spontaneous reinnervation lets the muscle preserve {{a certain degree of}} trophism. In this study, six biopsies were taken from six different free flaps. Biopsies were studied histologically and immunohistochemically to determine degree of muscle trophism, and <b>embryonic</b> myosin. <b>Biopsies</b> were analyzed morfometrically and the relative muscle, fibrous and fatty tissue content determined. In some instances activation of satellite cells was evident, confirming that even several years after the vascular free flap transfer the muscle still attempted to regenerate.

30|$|Recently, {{transcervical}} embryoscopy {{has been}} revived {{in the evaluation}} of missed abortions before 12  weeks, in particular in recurrent miscarriages or fertility treatment programs [49]. In the latter, failing pregnancies might be biochemically identified very early in their course and as such could be assessed electively. In that case, endoscopic equipment is introduced through the cervix, and the procedure may be completed with evacuation of the products of conception. For this, larger equipment is often used, consisting of 0 ° or 30 ° hysteroscope, housed within a double flow sheath allowing for exchange of irrigation fluid (at body temperature and a pressure 40 – 120  mmHg) [50, 51] and insertion of instruments (Bettocchi 3.6  mm 5 Ch operating sheath with 30 ° scope of 2  mm diameter, Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany). The operator first localizes the gestational sac and surgically opens the chorionic membrane. At that time, the embryo can already be seen through the amnion. Further opening of the amniotic membrane with micro-scissors allows {{a closer look at the}} different fetal elements and from different sides. Also, the yolk sac and umbilical cord are inspected. Normal or anomalous evolution is usually described and dated in function of the crown-rump length as measured on ultrasound or described in the Carnegie stages [52]. After that, direct sampling of chorionic villi is possible, as well as directed <b>embryonic</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Prior to 7  weeks, the embryo can usually be removed in toto. One can use ultrasound guidance, which in our experience facilitates localization of the gestational sac and the structures inside. In summary, next to external or phenotypic description, embryoscopy allows the prelevation of pure embryonic material, without maternal contamination, for further genetic testing. The procedure can be part of the formal evacuation of the products of conception and would lengthen that procedure only by 10  min. Also, the procedure-related complications are similar, i.e., bleeding, infection, and perforation.|$|R
40|$|Objective An {{essential}} role for embryonic MyHC in foetal {{development has been}} found from its associ-ation with distal arthrogryposis syndromes, a heterogeneous group of disorders character-ised by congenital contractions. The latter probably result from severe myopathy during foetal development. Lack of <b>embryonic</b> muscle <b>biopsy</b> material and suitable animal models has hindered study of the pathomechanisms linking mutations inMYH 3 to prenatal myopathy. Methods and Results We determined the pathomechanisms of developmental myopathy caused by recurrent p. Thr 178 IleMYH 3 heterozygosity, using patient-derived skeletal muscle cells in culture as an experimental disease model to emulate early embryonic development. These cultured cells were processed for discrimination and quantitative analysis of mutant and wild-typeMYH 3 alleles and MyHC transcripts, real-time RT-qPCR, sequence analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblot, and proteomic assessments. Involvement of the ubiquitin protea-some system was investigated in patients with p. Thr 178 Ile mutations inMYH 3 andMYH 2. We found equal overall expression of mutant and wild-type MyHCmRNAs and proteins. Compared to the controls, however, expression of embryonic MyHC transcripts and pro-teins was reduced whereas expression of myosin-specific E 3 ubiquitin ligase (MuRF 1) was increased. We also found delayed myofibrillogenesis and atrophic myotubes but structured sarcomeres...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{xenogeneic}} transplantation {{approach was}} used to determine whether it is embryonic or maternal tissue that produces the material that gives rise to the mucin-like glycoprotein of the equine <b>embryonic</b> capsule. Endometrial <b>biopsy</b> samples and conceptuses from six mares at days 13 – 15 after ovulation were prepared as 1 mm 3 grafts of endometrium, trophoblast and capsule for transplantation, alone or in combination, into various sites in 88 immunodeficient (severe combined immunodeficient or RAG 2 /c double mutant) mice. The overall recovery rate of grafts was over 50 %, reaching 100 % with experience and use of the renal subcapsular space exclusively.

40|$|Errors in the {{execution}} of meiosis can result in the generation of aneuploid gametes, which are associated with birth defects and infertility. According to published results; in 3 % of chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the chromosomal abnormalities are being mosaics and do not mandatory affect the fetus (Astner et al., 1998) in human beings. So far, {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation and its leading to conditions. Therefore, we wanted to find out the distribution of aneuploidy (and translocation) in early embryogenesis in mouse trophoblast (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) cells. Our main interest is, if aneuploidy are rather provable in the TE side and cause abortions, or in ICM side that results with defected babies or development in the early embryogenesis. In total, 241 female mice were sacrificed and 5 types of strains were examined in our experimental setting, which were B 6 D 2 F 1, C 3 H/HEN, C 57 BL/ 6, BALB/c and CBA/CaHT(14; 15) 6 Ca/J. The experimental group based on CBA/CaHT(14; 15) 6 Ca/J mouse strain, which has a balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 14 and 15. Although there are no single chromosome 14 and 15, except the translocation chromosome, these mice were totally healthy and had breeding capacity. Due to the homozygosity, it is possible to observe the segregation of chromosomes. Trophectoderm (TE) <b>biopsy,</b> <b>embryonic</b> stem culture (ESC) and immunosurgery (IMS) protocols were evaluated for isolating individual ICM and TE cells. IMS and TE biopsy did not lead to our aim, because of their technical difficulties and false negative, positive results. Therefore, ESC technique was applied on 519 embryos and 462 (89 %) embryos were developed healthy in culture. Specific FISH probe was developed for CBA/CaHT(14; 15) 6 Ca/J translocated mice with four differently labelled BACs. We have demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneous fluorescence immunophenotyping and FISH to check the segregation of translocation and aneuploidy for the first time by isolating ICM and TE cells. FICTION (fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase 168 cytogenetics as a tool for investigation of neoplasms) technique was successfully applied in 510 ICM and 510 TE cells of 73 mice embryos. Thus, we were able to visualize the antigen expression of Oct 4 as ICM marker or Cdx as TE marker together with the multicolour FISH probe. Eighty % TE cells gave positive signals with Cdx labelling and 99 % ICM cells gave positive signals with Oct 4 labelling. The results from FICTION reveal that, all the cells (ICM+TE) of heterozygote translocated embryos carried the T(14; 15) 6 Ca reciprocal translocation in a regular way. In heterozygote ICM cells we observed high numbers of aneuploidy than in heterozygote TE cells. Aneuploidies were observed by nondisjunction and unbalanced predivision. The level of mosaicism in the trophectoderm is lower than that seen in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. This finding would pioneer the further investigations of cell repair or elimination. These results confirm those of Verlinsky et al. (2001). This, however, raises discussions about possible repair mechanisms once more. In investigating the marker chromosome in more detail, we could identify the break point in 14 qE 3 on a limited extension of 200 kb. Comparisons with available gene bank data reveal that up to now within this area no genes were annotated. In 15 qA 1 we could reduce the extension of breakpoint region on about 27 kb in the proteolytic enzyme gene ADAMTS 12 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) playing a crucial rule in progression of vascularising as well as in cancer progression in human beings. With our results, this mouse strain lacking of ADAMTS 12, will provide an essential tool to understand better the relevance of this enzyme in tumourassociated processes, asthma, arthritis, organogenesis, angiogenesis and reproduction. Fehler in der Ausführung der Meiose können zur Herstellung aneuploider Gameten führen, die mit Geburtsdeffekten und Infertilität assoziieren. Laut veröffentlichter Ergebnisse, liegen in 3 % der Proben von Chorionzotten Biopsien (CVS) chromosomale Abnormalitäten als Mosaik vor und beeinflussen nicht den menschlichen Fetus. Es ist bekannt, dass Fehler in der Chromosomenverteilung der Meiose zu Fehlbildungen und Infertilität führen, obwohl nur wenig über die molekularen Mechanismen der Chromosomensegregation und ihrer steuernden Bedingungen bekannt ist. Daher untersuchten wir die Verteilung von Aneuploidien (und Translokationen) in der frühen Mäuse-Embriogenese in Trophoblasten (TE) und der inneren Zellmasse (ICM). Unser Hauptinteresse galt der Frage, ob Aneuploidien eher im TE nachweisbar sind und Aborte verursachen oder eher in der ICM vorkommen und zu Fehlbildungen der Embryos führen. Insgesamt wurden 241 weibliche Mäuse der fünf unterschiedlichen Stämme B 6 D 2 F 1, C 3 H/HEN, C 57 BL/ 6, BALB/c and CBA/CaHT(14; 15) 6 Ca/J für diese Untersuchung verwandt. Die experimentelle Gruppe basiert auf dem CBA/CaHT(14; 15) 6 Ca/J Maus-Stamm, welcher eine homozygote, balancierte Translokation der Chromosomen 14 und 15 trägt. Die Mäuse sind völlig gesund und vermehren sich. Ihre Zellen tragen balancierte, reziproke Translokationschromosomen, die die Beobachtung ihrer Segregation ermöglichen. Biopsie Trophectoderm (TE), embryonische Stammzellkultur (ESC) und Immunosurgery (IMS) Protokolle wurden bezüglich ihrer Fähigkeit individuelle ICM und TE Zellen zu isolieren beurteilt. IMS und TE Biopsie führten wegen ihrer technischen Schwierigkeiten und falsch negativer, sowie falsch positiver Ergebnisse nicht zu unserem Ziel. Deshalb wurde die ESC-Technik bei 519 Embryos angewandt und 462 (89 %) der Embryos entwickelten sich gesund in Kultur...|$|R
