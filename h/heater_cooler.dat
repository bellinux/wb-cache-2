40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to modify the Energy Transfer Diagram (ETD) to be able to {{graphically}} determine retrofit options and the amount of heat transferred. The ETD is a graphical methodology to represent a process and/or Heat Exchanger Network (HEN). For HENs, the ETD contains valuable information about where in the network exist heat surpluses and deficits, after considering a global (or contribution) minimum approach temperature. The important advancement in this work is the identification of which segments of the ETD represent heat surplus/deficit within a heat exchanger and then to show this on the ETD. Further clarity is drawn from the labelling of what segments relate to which process stream. Behind the ETD is the well-known surplus/deficit cascade for each <b>heater,</b> <b>cooler,</b> and exchanger, which is also analysed and presented to reinforce the graphical approach. A simple four-stream problem with an existing HEN that falls 1, 950 kW short of Pinch targets is used to demonstrate the methodological step forward.

40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{presents}} {{design considerations}} {{to be taken}} in designing of a low temperature differential double-acting Stirling engine for solar application. The target power source will be a thermosiphon solar water heater with integrated storage system, which will supply a constant source temperature of 70 8 C. Hence, the system design is based on a temperature difference of 50 8 C, assuming that the sink is kept at 20 8 C. During the preliminary design stage, the critical parameters of the engine design are determined according to the Schmidt analysis, while the third order analysis was used during the design optimisation stage in order to establish a complete analytical model for the engine. The heat exchangers are designed to be of high effectiveness and low pressure-drop, and are made from a 0. 015 m tube, while the porosity of the steel wool of 0. 722 is used for the regenerator matrix. Upon optimisation, the optimal engine speed is 120 rpm with the swept volume of 2. 3 l, and thus the critical engine parameters are found to be the bore diameter of 0. 20 m.

Rules were established which ensure that the temperatures and pressures remain within the required limits, the laminate is fully compacted and fully cured, the void content is minimum, and the residual (curing) stresses are low. The inputs to the expert system are the measured instantaneous autoclave temperature and pressure, the composite midpoint and surface temperatures, composite thickness, and ionic conductivity. These inputs are examined by preestablished rules and, {{on the basis of}} decisions dictated by the rules, the autoclave <b>heater,</b> <b>cooler</b> and pressure controllers are adjusted to the appropriate settings.

40|$|The {{performance}} of Stirling engines meets {{the demands of}} the efficient use of energy and environmental security and therefore they are the subject of much current interest. Hence, the development and investigation of Stirling engine have come to the attention of many scientific institutes and commercial companies. The Stirling engine is both practically and theoretically a significant device, its practical virtue is simple, reliable and safe which was recognized for a full century following its invention by Robert Stirling in 1816. The engine operates on a closed thermodynamic cycle, which is reversible. Today Stirling cycle-based systems are in commercial use as a heat pump, cryogenic refrigeration and air liquefaction. As a prime mover, Stirling cycles remain the subject of research and development efforts. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide fundamental information and present a detailed review of the past efforts taken for the development of the Stirling cycle engine and techniques used for engine analysis. A number of attempts have been made by researches to build and improve the {{performance of}} Stirling engines. It is seen that for successful operation of engine system with good efficiency a careful design of heat exchangers, proper selection of drive mechanism and engine configuration is essential. The study indicates that a Stirling cycle engine working with relatively low temperature with air of helium as working fluid is potentially attractive engines of the future, especially solar-powered low-temperature differential Stirling engines with vertical, double acting, and gamma configuration.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} written {{to give an}} {{overview}} of the most important types of calculation methods for the analysis of y-type Stirling engines found in the last 60 years. Simple methods like the ideal process calculation and the 0 th order analysis found by Beale and West are given to describe the process steps and to get a first reference value of performance and efficiency. Higher order calculations like the Schmidt analysis (1 st order) and 2 nd order methods for the ideal adiabatic and quasi steady flow models are described in detail and optimised for the y-type Stirling engine. With a generated quasi steady computer program code parameter variation is used to obtain an impression of the dependency of performance and efficiency on varying geometry data and boundary conditions. In addition to these models the heat exchanger sections <b>heater,</b> <b>cooler</b> and regenerator are analysed in depth with the CFD program ANSYS CFX. To compare the results of the theoretical analysis to measured ones three experimental engines are used. Different process values are determined on a biomass fired CHP Stirling system and on a solar Dish / Stirling system. On a Stirling engine test bench some of the parameter variations of the quasi steady program are repeated in experiments for comparison. These engines are modified in ways to make them run properly and to improve durability. The behaviour of the y-type Stirling engine is analysed in detail both in experiments and theoretically: this is felt to be unique. With the modified quasi steady flow model a method is found that is able to predict the process performance with a higher accuracy than it can be done with any other calculation method. This method can easily be modified to fit any other type of Stirling engine...|$|E
