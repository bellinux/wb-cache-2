40|$|The {{literature}} surrounding individual {{trade policy}} preference has traditionally relied on economic self-interest as {{the impetus for}} opinion formation. However, every survey-based study has observed a significant and baffling gender bias, with women being consistently more likely to oppose international trade than their male counterparts. One explanation for this phenomenon focuses on the specialized, <b>economic</b> <b>training</b> required to understand the complex subject of international trade. This study uses a unique sample of undergraduate students from Ball State University, stratified by academic department. The survey instrument is aimed at comparing departments that emphasize <b>economic</b> <b>training</b> with {{those that do not}} and how this effects the individuals trade policy preferences. The results show that controlling for <b>economic</b> <b>training</b> eliminates the significance of gender in predicting trade policy preference. Department of SociologyThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

Most of us appreciate the intrinsic benefits of the arts - their beauty and vision; how they inspire, soothe, provoke, and connect us.

40|$|Modern {{antitrust}} litigation sometimes involves complex expert {{economic and}} econometric analysis. While this {{boom in the}} demand for economic analysis and expert testimony has clearly improved the welfare of economists—and schools offering basic <b>economic</b> <b>training</b> to judges—little {{is known about the}} empirical effects of economic complexity or judges' <b>economic</b> <b>training</b> on decision-making in antitrust litigation. We use a unique data set on antitrust litigation in district courts during 1996 — 2006 to examine whether economic complexity impacts decisions in antitrust cases, and thereby provide a novel test of the frequently asserted hypothesis that antitrust analysis has become too complex for generalist judges. We also examine the impact of one institutional response to economic complexity - basic <b>economic</b> <b>training</b> by judges. We find that decisions involving the evaluation of complex economic evidence are significantly more likely to be appealed, and decisions of judges trained in basic economics are significantly less likely to be appealed than are decisions by their untrained counterparts. Our results are robust to a variety of controls, including the type of case, circuit, and the political party of the judge. Our tentative conclusion, based on a revealed preference argument that views a party’s appeal decision as an indication that the district court got the economics wrong, is that there is support for the hypothesis that some antitrust cases are too complicated for generalist judges. antitrust, Daubert, complexity, <b>economic</b> <b>training,</b> expert witness...|$|R
