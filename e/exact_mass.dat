5|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to reconstruct the <b>exact</b> <b>mass</b> of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45g, but one should keep in mind that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the Holy Roman Empire was reformed by Charlemagne, but in the Byzantine Empire it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to Scandinavia, the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.|$|E

To speed determination of the correct composition for precursor ions and most product ions and neutral losses, a three-part software suite was developed. Starting with text files of m/z ratios and their ion abundances from mass spectra acquired at low, moderate, and high collision energies, the ion extraction program (IEP) compiled lists for the most abundant monoisotopic ions of their <b>exact</b> <b>masses</b> and the RIAs of the + 1 and + 2 isotopic peaks when abundance thresholds were met; precursor ions; and higher-mass, precursor-related species.
