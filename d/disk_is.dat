5|$|The debris disk around Beta Pictoris is seen edge-on by {{observers}} on Earth, and is orientated in a northeast-southwest direction.

5|$|The protoplanetary <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> an {{accretion}} disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to a billion years.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, imaging of {{the system}} with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys {{revealed}} {{the presence of a}} secondary dust disk inclined at an angle of about 5° to the main disk and extending at least 130 AU from the star. The secondary <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> asymmetrical: the southwest extension is more curved and less inclined than the northeast. The imaging was not good enough to distinguish between the main and secondary disks within 80 AU of Beta Pictoris, however the northeast extension of the dust <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> predicted to intersect with the main disk at about 30 AU from the star. The secondary disk may be produced by a massive planet in an inclined orbit removing matter from the primary disk and causing it to move in an orbit aligned with the planet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is {{believed}} to be a supermassive black hole at its center. This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, population I stars. The <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|Some theory {{requires}} {{selecting a}} fixed {{point on the}} sphere, calling the pair (sphere, point) a pointed sphere. For some spaces the choice matters, but for a sphere all points are equivalent so the choice {{is a matter of}} convenience. The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which is on the equator of all the spheres, works well for geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> another obvious choice.|$|E

25|$|For {{more than}} two decades, the floppy <b>disk</b> <b>was</b> the primary {{external}} writable storage device used. Most computing environments before the 1990s were non-networked, and floppy <b>disks</b> <b>were</b> the primary means of transferring data between computers, a method known informally as sneakernet. Unlike hard <b>disks,</b> floppy <b>disks</b> <b>are</b> handled and seen; even a novice user can identify a floppy disk. Because of these factors, {{a picture of a}} 3½-inch floppy disk has become an interface metaphor for saving data.

5|$|The protoplanetary <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as an accretion disk, because while the young T Tauri-like protostar is still contracting, gaseous material may still be falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk's inner edge. In an accretion disk, there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> likely to be long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E

5|$|In a real vector space, a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for {{each pair of}} its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|Of all the {{measured}} parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity {{is the most}} uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity is inconsistent {{with the presence of}} the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3AU. If the eccentricity was actually this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 2 billion years, star {{formation}} throughout Andromeda's <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to have}} decreased {{to the point of}} near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.|$|E

40|$|Thermoelastic {{simulation}} of functionally graded (FG) brake disk using finite element (FE) ANSYS software is performed. The material properties of {{two types of}} FG brake <b>disks</b> <b>are</b> assumed to vary in radial and thickness direction according to a power law distribution. The brake <b>disks</b> <b>are</b> in contact with one hollow pure pad disk. Dry contact friction is considered as the heat source. The proper thicknesses of pad <b>disks</b> <b>are</b> found to have full-contact status. The behavior of thermoelastic results for thickness and radial FG brake <b>disks</b> <b>are</b> compared.

On the other hand, the variations of radial displacements for different grading indices n are not the same. The behaviors of other results are quite the same. It can be concluded that the variation direction of material properties in FG brake disk can affect the results.

5|$|Recent {{photometric}} and spectroscopic {{observations from}} 2005 to 2007 {{indicate that a}} new disk has formed around the equatorthus constituting a double disk phenomenon with disks at different angles. The inclination angle of the new <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> estimated at 60° whereas the previous disk was inclined at around 30°. Such a misaligned double-disk structure has never been observed before among Be stars. Thus, Pleione provides {{a rare opportunity to}} investigate the forming process of a new disk and the consequent interaction between the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true {{rotational velocity}}: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's axis of rotation to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimate}} dissipation of protoplanetary disks is {{triggered by}} a number of different mechanisms. The inner part of the <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> either accreted by the star or ejected by the bipolar jets, whereas the outer part can evaporate under the star's powerful UV radiation during the T Tauri stage or by nearby stars. The gas in the central part can either be accreted or ejected by the growing planets, while the small dust particles are ejected by the radiation pressure of the central star. What is finally left is either a planetary system, a remnant disk of dust without planets, or nothing, if planetesimals failed to form.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly.

Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's <b>disk</b> <b>is</b> completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse).

Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets {{through a process of}} gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies.|$|E
