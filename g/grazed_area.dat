40|$|AbstractThe {{establishment}} of <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> in humid tropical environments {{is one of}} the causes of amphibian population decline. This work evaluates the consequences of the {{establishment of}} <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> on amphibian communities in an area of the Sierra Madre Oriental using analyses of alpha and beta diversity. Sampling was conducted at 28 locations, 7 in tropical evergreen forest (TEF), 7 in mountain cloud forest (MCF), 7 in tropical <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> (TGA), and 7 in cloud forest <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> (CFGA) using the method of direct sampling. Amphibian diversity is reduced when the <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> are established in tropical environments (TGA, 8 species; 7. 1 effective species and TEF, 10 species; 7. 7 effective species); in contrast, the CFGA has a greater diversity (11 species; 9. 3 effective species) compared with MCF (8 species; 3. 9 effective species).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} overgrazing on the foraging behavior of livestock on a Mongolian steppe, by quantifying some behaviors of cattle, sheep and goats foraging in a lightly and a heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> in summer and winter. All animal species showed higher walking velocity and tended to show higher step/bite ratio when they foraged in the heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> than in the lightly <b>grazed</b> <b>area.</b> The effect of overgrazing on the step/bite ratio was greater in sheep and goats than in cattle, and {{the effect on the}} walking velocity was stronger in winter than in summer. The results indicate that heavy grazing altered the foraging behavior of animals imposing higher foraging costs, which varied among the animal species and between the seasons. The declined quantity of preferred species in the heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> required high searching efforts and decreased the bite rate, for selecting acceptable plants and better feeding sites. The stronger effects on sheep and goats than on cattle and in winter than in summer may reflect different foraging behavior potentials among the animals and different food availabilities between the seasons. We suggest that the ongoing {{increase in the number of}} goats in Mongolia is problematic not only from the viewpoint of grassland deterioration but also from feeding cost of whole livestock animals...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine how savanna grass sward modifications caused by heavy grazing pressure influenced the abundance and guild structure of grasshoppers. Heavily grazed communal land was compared with a lightly <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> and a mowed airstrip, in adjacent protected land, in the Mpumalanga lowveld, South Africa. Plant species composition, height, aerial cover and greenness of grass in the herbaceous stratum were measured in representative sites. Total grasshopper abundance and relative abundance of grasshopper species were also assessed in each site. Grasshoppers were assigned to feeding and habitat functional groups for comparison among the three areas. The heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>area,</b> characterised by short vegetation and low aerial cover, high greenness of grass, and high frequency of forbs, was inhabited by grasshopper species associated with bare ground or short and/or sparse grass, that were non-graminivorous or soft grass feeders. The lightly <b>grazed</b> <b>area,</b> characterised by tall vegetation and high aerial cover, low greenness of grass, and low frequency of forbs, was inhabited by grasshopper species associated with long and/or thick grass, that were mixed feeders or tough grass feeders.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the diet composition of semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in late summer in different kinds of grazing conditions in northernmost Finland. The composition of diet by reindeer was determined {{on the grounds of}} microhistological analysis of feces samples collected in early August in different seasonal <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> (winter or summer/year-round <b>grazing</b> <b>areas)</b> in three reindeer management districts. Although the proportion of different plant groups varied between the studied districts, the quantified group of ground lichens (which also contained small amounts of mushrooms) was the most abundant, varying from 33. 0 to 46. 4 % in the analyzed samples. In general, there were significant differences in the proportions of lichen between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> The proportion of lichen in samples increased significantly when the amount of lichen pasture around a sample site increased. The proportion of dwarf shrubs and leaves in samples varied from 24. 9 to 37. 9 % and differed significantly between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> In the same way, the proportion of graminoids varied between 20. 9 and 36. 2 % and differed significantly between districts and also between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> Higher amounts of graminoids in feces were observed in summer/year-round <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> than in winter <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> Finally, the proportion of bryophytes varied between 2. 9 and 6. 5 % and was significantly different between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> An increase in old and mature coniferous forest around a sample site significantly increased the amounts of bryophytes in samples. The results indicate that reindeer adapt their summer diet composition according to the availability of food plants. The results also show that when reindeer are allowed to select their summer ranges freely, reindeer tend to use lichen pastures intensively also during summer, which causes a considerable reduction in lichens due to grazing and trampling. Therefore, a proper seasonal pasture rotation system to protect lichen pastures from grazing and trampling, from early spring to late autumn, {{is an essential part of}} sustainable pasture use in reindeer herding...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} {{dependency}} of soil properties, sensitive to grazing systems, is important from an ecosystem protection point of view. In the current study, geostatistical methods and fractal concepts {{have been used}} in order to characterize the impact of long-term grazing exclusion on the spatial variability of some soil chemical parameters including organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorous, and available potassium in both ungrazed and grazed sites located in Sabzkuh region, Chaharmahal Bakhtiari Province. The spatial pattern of different variables was studied using variogram. The results indicate that spatial variability of soil parameters depends upon grazing history. The variogram of organic matter in grazed areas shows a linear behavior without reaching the sill variance while organic matter in the ungrazed area established a strong spatial structure. Moreover, available phosphorous in the <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> had pure nugget variation. Variograms of total nitrogen and available potassium in both grazed and ungrazed areas showed spatial structure approximated by spherical model. However, the range of variograms in exclusion sites was twice that of the <b>grazed</b> <b>area.</b> The results of applying the fractal theory show that soil properties have fractional behavior since increasing the scale of study reveals more details. Moreover, calculated fractal dimension values from variograms of different variables were close to 2. 0 although this index was usually greater in the <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> than in the exclusion sites.

The high and middle intertidal zones of the northeastern portion ("barren") of the limestone bench on the windward side of Enewetak Island, Enewetak Atoll, Marshall Islands, have a significantly higher number of herbivorous fishes grazing at high tide than the same intertidal zones of the reef flat 300 m to the southwest ("algae-covered"). This portion of the reef flat in the barren, heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> has a significantly lower coverage by erect, macroscopic algae and a lower algal biomass than the same portion of the reef flat in the algae-covered area. The removal of part of the limestone substratum by the grazing fishes as they feed and the reduced coverage by erect, macroscopic algae result in a lower topographic relief in the barren area than found in the algaecovered area. The heavily <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> has a significantly lower number of mobile epifaunal invertebrate species and individuals per square meter than the lightly <b>grazed</b> <b>area.</b> Differences in infauna (sipunculans, polychaete worms, and tanaid crustaceans) are not so clear. When portions of the barren area were excluded from fish grazing activity for three months, the substratum under the exclosures had 100 %coverage by an algal mat; the density of mobile invertebrate epifauna was {{an order of magnitude}} higher than in quadrats outside the exclosures. Although the high and middle intertidal community is subjected to apparently severe physical stresses (desiccation, insolation, wave shock, ultraviolet radiation, and osmotic stress from evaporation in the tide pools and rainfall), it appears to be principally structured by the grazing activities of herbivorous fishes. The high level of grazing in the barren area results in coverage by filamentous blue-green algae and a diatom-bacterial film, which may be a nutritionally more important food source to the fishes than the coralline algae in the algae-covered area...|$|E

30|$|In the {{traditional}} farming {{system of the}} Himalayan Hindu-Kush region of Northern Pakistan, different types of fodder trees and shrubs are found at different elevations and sites and are used differently by various landowning and landless social segments.

This paper demonstrates that indigenous tree and shrub species have a high potential in sustaining a pastoral system in need of alternatives to shrinking <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> The decline in pasture availability is due to afforestation programmes, communal hillside privatization, crop extension and conservation programmes that evict herders from their former <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> and trekking routes. The limited fodder availability along the trekking routes in particular triggered early arrival and longer stay at both upland and lowland <b>grazing</b> <b>areas,</b> leading to their overgrazing.|$|R

Chesler Park shows a successional trend after 10 years toward the vegetational condition of Virginia Park.

40|$|Changes in {{land use}} in {{semiarid}} savannas to intensive cattle ranching {{have been widely}} equated with changes in vegetation communities, notably bush encroachment.

Studies show that no significant differences exist between profile patterns of soil water availability, or hydraulic conductivity and field capacity, between bush dominant compared to grass-dominant sites. Vegetation changes are determined predominantly by interactions of grazing levels, fire occurrence and natural rainfall variability. Pastoral management strategies should therefore account for the interactions between these variables to prevent convergence of bush dominant areas.
