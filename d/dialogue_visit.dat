In an open letter concerning the value of service, Rachel Naomi Remen reminds us all to reevaluate our personal positions {{with respect to the}} dichotomy that inevitably exists between the notions of service and help. In effect, service can only be performed in [...] "a relationship between equals" [...] while help is based on a relationship of inequality, especially since it assumes that one side of the relationship is [...] "stronger" [...] than the other. CCIDD therefore does not wish for its students to [...] "help" [...] the local Mexican population; let the tourists do that, it wants its students to [...] "serve" [...] the people. This service can either be direct or indirect. Direct service involves projects like painting schools, composting trash, and building houses. Indirect service includes initiating cross-cultural <b>dialogues,</b> <b>visiting</b> local archaeological sites, and reflecting upon the daily experiences that one undergoes.|$|R

Method Observations, document studies, informal <b>dialogues</b> and study <b>visits</b> are part of the ethnographic method which helped me understand and gather information about the South African context. Semi-structured open-ended interviews were used to gain deeper insight in the girls’ situation, their opinions and views. Results To most of the girls, having a career was important. Having a career means you succeeded in life. Hence, the girls approached the term career from different angles. The white girls felt they had to carry out what is expected of them, while as I quite often saw the black girl as more proud and happy about the situation, being in the ”school with opportunities”. These girls experienced different kinds of life. The black girls travelled miles back and forth to go to the school, being laughed about by some people in the townships {{as well as in the}} schools. Some of the white girls had been home schooled by their mothers and were not used to suchnoise.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} place of {{children}} through the lenses of generational and gender relationships in Awra Amba community, Northern Ethiopia. It discusses what children’s life from gender and generational perspective look like in Awra Amba community. The study {{is based on the}} following research questions. What are the social values and roles of children in the community? What does gender relationship among children and between children and adults look like in Awra Amba community? What is “special” about children of Awra Amba Community? To document {{the place of}} children through answering these questions, the study employs qualitative research methods such as in-depth interview, focus group discussion observation, informal <b>dialogue</b> and home <b>visit.</b> These qualitative methods were used as the issue to be explored needed a complex and detailed understanding. In other words, the research project was qualitative in its nature because the researcher needed an intricate and thorough understanding of the issue. Children whose age ranges from 12 - 15 years and their parents (both mothers and fathers) whose age ranges from 32 - 40 and 48 - 72 respectively including the founder and the leader of the community, Zumra Nuru, were included in the study as participants (research subjects). The study is informed by social constructivism through viewing children’s place and childhood among the Awura Amba community from discursive construction, structural construction, generational construction and children as social actors perspectives. The study observes children’s place among the community from three angles: gender equality, social order and intergenerational relationships. It argues that children are active participants in activation and perpetuation of gender equity, social order and egalitarian intergenerational relationships. Such perspectives of children indicate that children are well aware of the collective values among the community and are exercising them as part of their everyday lives. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} how {{conducting}} school visits can be configured {{as an opportunity}} to support inclusive school and development of children with brain damage and developmental problems. The rehabilitation process in childhood objectives to increase {{the quality of life of}} children, taking into account their peers and social spaces that take part. In school-age children, school appears as an important social context and can be related to quality of life. The defense for an inclusive school becomes central to the work of the interdisciplinary team of rehabilitation centers and teaching staff of the schools. In this study, it is understood that the school visits can be constituted as a significant tool in the field of ecological rehabilitation, within the context of individuals. The theoretical bases related to this paper are found in studies of Urie Bronfenbrenner, Mark Ylvisaker & Thimoty Fenney and Lucia Braga. This study aims to characterize the performance of school visits to the monitoring of children with brain injury inserted into a stimulation group at the Hospital Sarah Rehabilitation, unit of São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil. From this proposal will be discussed the configuration of school visits {{as an opportunity to}} support inclusive education process of children with brain injury, considering the legislation on education in Brazil.

It has as results the prospect that the interdisciplinary team was formed as a support network, favoring school adaptation strategies through participation in the curriculum adaptation process, proposing strategies for environmental management behavior, diagnostic guidance, guidelines for motor and neuropsychological stimulation of children, consolidating its position as a relevant service in the inclusive process in schools...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{aim of this}} Minor Field {{study is}} to {{investigate}} how South African teachers approach the impacts of HIV and AIDS in their daily professional work. I also want to highlight the complexity in teaching about a subject surrounded by social and cultural factors causing negative stigma and discrimination. Central questions in the study are: - How do teachers teach about HIV and AIDS, sexuality and relationships? - What problems and difficulties do they experience? - Which are {{their views on the}} cause of HIV and AIDS and related problems? - What do they think {{needs to be done to}} improve the current sitation, in school as well as in their surrounding society? Method To carry out this study I have used a triangulation of qualitative methods. Observations, document studies, informal <b>dialogues</b> and study <b>visits</b> are part of the ethnographic method which helped me understand and gather information about the South African context. Six semi-structured open-ended interviews were used to gain deeper insight in the teachers' situation, their opinions and views. Results The findings on the South African context concentrate mainly on poverty, social and cultural aspects concerning sex, gender relations, stigmatization and ignorance. The interview results show that teachers use a variety of methods to approach HIV and AIDS in their teaching. They experience difficulties in many aspects and see immorality and carelessness as major causes of the epidemic's spread. Ideas on what needs to be done to change the situation varies from new approaches in education and a new mentality to firm management from the government, a change in legislation and education in a broader sense to reach adults and people with low education as well. The general approach is to teach according to what there is, the reality, accepting the circumstances. HIV and AIDS is one out of many difficult problems that the South African teachers need to handle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Community {{capacities}} and resources must be harnessed to complement supply side initiatives addressing high maternal and neonatal mortality rates in Uganda. This paper reflects on gains, challenges and lessons learnt from working with communities to improve maternal and newborn health in rural Uganda. Methods A participatory action research project was supported from 2012 to 2015 in three eastern districts. This project involved working with households, saving groups, sub county and district leaders, transporters and village health teams in diagnosing causes of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, developing action plans {{to address these}} issues, taking action and learning from action in a cyclical manner. This paper draws from project experience and documentation, as well as thematic analysis of 20 interviews with community and district stakeholders and 12 focus group discussions with women who had recently delivered and men whose wives had recently delivered. Results Women and men reported increased awareness about birth preparedness, improved newborn care practices and more male involvement in maternal and newborn health. However, additional direct communication strategies were required to reach more men beyond the minority who attended community <b>dialogues</b> and home <b>visits.</b> Saving groups and other saving modalities were strengthened, with money saved used to meet transport costs, purchase other items needed for birth and other routine household needs. However saving groups required significant support to improve income generation, management and trust among members. Linkages between savings groups and transport providers improved women’s access to health facilities at reduced cost. Although village health teams were a key resource for providing information, their efforts were constrained by low levels of education, inadequate financial compensation and transportation challenges. Ensuring that the village health teams and savings groups functioned required regular supervision, review meetings and payment for supervisors to visit. Conclusions This participatory program, which focused on building the capacity of community stakeholders, was able to improve local awareness of maternal and newborn health practices and instigate local action to improve access to healthcare. Collaborative problem solving among diverse stakeholders, continuous support and a participatory approach that allowed flexibility were essential project characteristics that enabled overcoming of challenges faced...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore School health nursing through school nurses’ {{descriptions}} of schoolchildren’s health and to analyse factors influencing the recording of school-children’s health in the School Health Record (SHR). An additional aim is to evaluate fam-ily nursing interventions {{as a tool for}} the school nurses in the School Health Service (SHS). Methods: The thesis comprises four papers. A combination of qualitative and quantita-tive methods was used through individual interviews with a strategic sample of school nurses (n= 12) (PI), a national survey to a representative sample of school nurses (n= 129) (PII, III) and the implementation of family nursing models developed in Canada with girls in their early ad-olescence with recurrent health complaints and their families (n= 4) in co-operation with their school nurses (n= 2) (PIV). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used as pre and post test. Evaluation interviews were conducted with the families and the nurses separate-ly. Qualitative content analyses were used to analyze the interview text with the school nurs-es and the families. Manifest content analysis was used to analyze the free text answers of the survey and the evaluation interview with the school nurses. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to describe demographic data in all four papers. The SDQ was hand-scored statistically. Findings: The findings showed that nurses judged the schoolchildren’s mental health as dete-riorated, especially in socially disadvantaged areas and more generally among girls expressed as psychosomatic symptoms. Individual factors related to lifestyle affected the schoolchildren’s physical health, and the mental health was, to a large extent, affected by the school environ-ment and family relations. The latter seemed {{to be the most important}} factor affecting school-children’s mental health. The basis for the school nurses judgement of the physical health was health check-ups and the health <b>dialogues.</b> Spontaneous <b>visits</b> were more commonly used to judge the mental health. Recording schoolchildren’s mental health was a challenge for school nurses. Difficulties were related to ethical considerations, tradition, lack of time and the im-proper structure of the SHR. Fears of marking the schoolchild for life related to the schoolchild itself, the parents or to other authorities/successive caregivers were brought up as hinders for recording mental and social health. Family sessions may be useful within the profession when handling recurrent health complaints among adolescence girls. The girls and their families ex-perienced relief, they felt confirmed and that their feelings and reactions were normal in that situation. The families became aware of their own strengths and possibilities and this was sup-ported by the SDQ which showed an increased well-being. The school nurses valued this way of working and meant that the sessions seemed to start a changing process within the families. Conclusions: The results indicate that school nurses have a deep knowledge about schoolchil-dren’s health which is not used to its full potential in a public health perspective. However, the experienced difficulties recording schoolchildren’s mental health seem obvious, which would de-mand developing the SHR for the needs of today. Family sessions in SHS with the school nurse as a collaborator with the family seemed useful and may be transferable to other health problems expressed by the schoolchildren. Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory and other models for health determinants are used to illustrate the school nurse as a mediator working on the bridge over different health streams with schoolchildren’s health on an individual and a population level...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{visual perception}} {{and the use}} of a camera as a research tool to observe amateur experts and technicians who have a vernacular knowledge related to the natural world, or to pedagogical institutions. In this case the research took place at the Department of Physiology and Anatomy and Genetics (DPAG) and Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at Oxford University through a Wellcome Trust Fellowship. Experimenting with the moment of drawing, creating rules and structures to explore the balance between instinct and intellect, I have developed a technique of blind drawing from movies to capture the time, light and formal qualities of a movie. Working within DPAG generated questions about perception, and how the ‘physiology and anatomy’ of a film might be defined and captured in drawing and through the film. Focussing initially on movies connected to audio-visual perception, primarily Werner Herzog’s documentary Land of Silence and Darkness about a deaf and blind woman communicating through touch the work extended to live drawings and filming in the labs. As a parallel method of observing and recording through drawing, I also negotiated permission to shoot a 16 mm film in the highly protected environment of the Anatomy Lab. Demonstration 50. 15 follows the repetitive daily activities of the mortuary technician as he embalms and prepares bodies for medical students. The work reveals his quiet dignity and diligence within an environment more often recognised for scientific breakthroughs or ethical controversies. Further <b>dialogue</b> and lab <b>visits</b> with a perceptual neuroscientist, geneticists, anatomists and technicians at DPAG and a wider community of artists, art historians and writers at Oxford University, including an expert on Diderots’ Letter on the Blind for the Use of Those who can See extended my exploration. The challenges and experiences of working alongside scientists made us all question the validity of our research our understanding of the context and language through which art and science are assessed. Much of this research was shared in Land of Silence and Darkness - four days of talk and action connecting movies, blindness, drawing, perception, and neuroscience in venues across Oxford. The resulting Blind Movies is a book of “blind movie and live carbon drawings’ 2006 - 2009 with an essay by film writer Silke Panse. The book and film have shown widely in UK and abroad and are distributed through LUX. Wellcome Trust /Arts Council Of Englan...|$|R
