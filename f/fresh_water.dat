40|$|Background: Given the {{globally}} poor {{protection of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> for their intrinsic ecological values, assessments {{are needed to}} determine how well <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> and supported fish species are incidentally protected within existing terrestrial protected-area networks, and to identify their vulnerability to human-induced disturbances. To date, gaps in data have severely constrained any attempt to explore the representation of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> in tropical regions. Methodology and Results: We determined the distribution of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> and fish diversity in the Wet Tropics of Queensland, Australia. We then used distribution data of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters,</b> fish species, human-induced disturbances, and the terrestrial protected-area network to assess the effectiveness of terrestrial protected areas for <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> and fish species. We also identified human-induced disturbances likely to influence the effectiveness of freshwater protection and evaluated the vulnerability of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> to these disturbances within and outside protected areas.

40|$|Eutrophication of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> through {{anthropogenic}} enrichment by phosphorus is {{a global}} problem. The role of phosphorus enrichment {{in the formation of}} blooms of toxic blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria) in <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> is well established and of considerable concern in terms of human and animal health, loss of water resources and amenities, threats to fish stocks, and aesthetic considerations. Cultural eutrophication also poses threats to the ecosystem balance in <b>fresh</b> <b>waters,</b> with implications for wildlife.

5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> is {{the result}} of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E

5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. <b>Fresh</b> <b>water</b> flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E
5|$|Mangrove trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.|$|E

5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} force in the Everglades, shaping the land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida.
