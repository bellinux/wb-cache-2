60|$|There is, however, an ulterior effect, which, in a {{rich and}} prosperous country, {{requires}} {{to be taken into}} account. It may operate in two different ways: (1.) The curtailment of profit, and the consequent increased difficulty in making a fortune or obtaining a subsistence by the <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> may act as a stimulus to inventions, and to the use of them when made. If improvements in production are much accelerated, and if these improvements cheapen, directly or indirectly, any of the things habitually consumed by the laborer, profits may rise, and rise sufficiently to make up for all that is taken from them by the tax. In that case the tax will have been realized without loss to any one, the produce of the country being increased by an equal, or what would in that case be a far greater, amount. The tax, however, must even in this case be considered as paid from profits, because the receivers of profits are those who would be benefited if it were taken off.|$|E

The results of this clarification are then used to prove that, independently of Smith’s own words but in consistency with his theory, the notions of ‘quantity’ and ‘productivity’ of productive labour have a ‘vertical’ as well as an ‘horizontal’ dimension so that they fit both the input-output scheme and the Austrian framework of time-consuming methods of production. ...|$|R

A trade may also, from the nature of the case, be confined to so few hands, that profits may admit of being kept up by a combination among the dealers. It is well known that even among so numerous a body as the London booksellers, this sort of combination long continued to exist. I have already mentioned the case of the gas and water companies.|$|R

However, we need to remember that income inequality {{is the result of a}} multitude of factors — among them, globalization, technological change, the efficient <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and changing institutions.

40|$|Students {{of history}} may see {{mirrored}} in the charts and tables {{of interest rates}} over long periods {{the rise and fall}} of nations and civilizations, the exertions and the tragedies of war, and the enjoyments and the abuses of peace. They may be able to trace in these fluctuations the progress of knowledge and of technology, the successes or failures of political forms, the long, hard, and never-ending struggle of democracy with the rule of the elite, the difference between law imposed and law accepted. 1 This paper establishes a nexus between the established fields of constitutional political economy and macroeconomic capital theory. Constitutional political economy explores how legal and institutional structures emerge over time. The evolution of property rights has always been a central focus of this line of inquiry. Time preference is one of the most basic economic concepts. Theories of interest, term structure, and opportunity cost, are all dependent on time preference, which is also the basis for capital budgeting in modern finance. This paper establishes how and why the emergence of property rights supported a reduction of time preference, allowing for <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in time-consuming means of production. This paper also argues that institutional imperatives inevitably lead to the systematic degradation of property rights, and a consequent increase in time preference...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Unemployment is a {{systemic}} element {{of economic development}} which need not and “normally” does not give rise to full employment of labour regardless of the flexibility in labour markets. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents the common arguments and policy proposals to unemployment put forward by mainstream and Keynesian economics and it continues by exploring the dynamics of economic development {{and its effects on}} employment. Findings – The normal utilization of the capital stock is not necessarily associated with any specific level of employment. As a result, even high levels of unemployment may be consistent with the normal (full) <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> and the degree of flexibility in the labour market cannot affect the above result in any significant way. Practical implications – The dynamics of capital accumulation continually tend to reproduce a stream of displaced workers. Moreover, the liberalization of the labour market in the effort to increase labour flexibility have contributed to the polarization of income distribution and increased the poverty rate. Originality/value – The acknowledgment that the normal functioning of capitalism is consistent with a rising unemployment rate may provide policy makers with a solid analytical ground upon which more realistic and viable employment policies can be proposed in the effort on the one hand to reduce unemployment {{and on the other hand}} to alleviate its adverse effects on the unemployed and on social cohesion.

60|$|It is far {{otherwise}} with gross profit, which, though (as will presently be seen) it {{does not}} vary much from employment to employment, varies very greatly from individual to individual, and can scarcely be in any two cases the same. It depends on the knowledge, talents, economy, and energy of the capitalist himself, or of the agents whom he employs; on the accidents of personal connection; and even on chance. Hardly any two dealers in the same trade, even if their commodities are equally good and equally cheap, carry on their business at the same expense, or turn over their capital in the same time. That equal capitals give equal profits, as a general maxim of trade, would be as false as that equal age or size gives equal bodily strength, or that equal reading or experience gives equal knowledge. The effect depends as much upon twenty other things as upon the single cause specified. On an average (whatever may be the occasional fluctuations) the various <b>employments</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> are on such a footing as to hold out, not equal profits, but equal expectations of profit, to persons of average abilities and advantages. By equal, I mean after making compensation for any inferiority in the agreeableness or safety <b>of</b> an <b>employment.</b> If the case were not so; if there were, evidently, and to common experience, more favorable chances of pecuniary success in one business than in others, more persons would engage their capital in the business. If, on the contrary, a business is not considered thriving; if the chances of profit in it {{are thought to be}} inferior to those in other employments; capital gradually leaves it, or at least new capital is not attracted to it; and by this change in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> between the less profitable and the more profitable <b>employments,</b> a sort <b>of</b> balance is restored.|$|R
