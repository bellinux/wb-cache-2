In Israel, minimum summer temperatures increased {{by an average of}} 0. 26 8 C per decade {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. Bergmann’s rule predicts that, in warm-blooded animals, races from warm regions are smaller than races from cold regions. Numerous studies have reported general correla-tions between body mass in fossil animals and independently established palaeoclimatic changes from various parts of the world in accordance with this rule. Using museum specimens, I tested the prediction that the body mass and tarsus length of ¢ve resident passerine species in Israel declined between 1950 and 1999. The body mass of four species (the <b>graceful</b> <b>warbler</b> Prinia gracilis, the house sparrow Passer domesticus, the yellow-vented bulbul Pycnonotus xanthopygos and the Sardinian warbler Sylvia melanocephala, but not of the crested lark Galerida cristata) declined signi¢cantly during this period. Tarsus length also declined signi¢cantly during this period for two species (the <b>graceful</b> <b>warbler</b> and the house sparrow). Body condition (body mass-to-tarsus length ratio) decreased in the Sardinian warbler, the yellow-vented bulbul and the crested lark. It is suggested that the above declines in body mass and tarsus length are due to global warming and also in accordance with Bergmann’s rule. The above explanation does not exclude the possibility that other factors, such as a decrease in food availability, contributed to the decline in body mass. These declines may have serious implications for community structure and competition among bird species and may a¡ect the survival of small passerines...|$|E
60|$|Mark that slender, <b>graceful,</b> yellow <b>warbler,</b> {{running along}} the high oak boughs like a perturbed spirit, seeking restlessly, anxiously, {{something}} which he seems never to find; and uttering {{every now and then}} a long anxious cry, four or five times repeated, which would be a squeal, were it not so sweet. Suddenly he flits away, and flutters round the pendant tips of the beech-sprays like a great yellow butterfly, picking the insects from the leaves; then flits back to a bare bough, and sings, with heaving breast and quivering wings, a short, shrill, feeble, tremulous song; and then returns to his old sadness, wandering and complaining all day long.|$|R
