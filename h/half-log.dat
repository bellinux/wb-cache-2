A two-story gallery, sheltered by a shed roof, extended to the east. The outside logs from which it is built were squared off to 18 in. The interior walls are built from dimensionally smaller logs, and the floors were made of <b>half-logs</b> secured into joists and sills by tenons.

On May 15 an advance unit went over the pass to take Aosta, after which hospitals were set up at Martigny and Aosta. At Martigny the army assembled and received rations for three days. All the equipment - carriages, artillery, arms and ammunition - was disassembled and divided into packs of 60-70 pounds for the men to carry. The cannons were to be dragged up over the snow in hollowed-out pine <b>half-logs</b> by mules, and then when the mules died or were exhausted, by 100 soldiers and hired men each. Napoleon offered liberal monetary rewards to soldiers and laborers who could perform difficult portages in a timely fashion.|$|R

50|$|The lodges, roads, common {{facilities}} and landscaping were a rustic {{interpretation of the}} Storybook Style popular in America between World War I and World War II. With whimsy and creative playfulness, the Valhalla Highlands interpretation was picturesque and nostalgic. These qualities were evident in the buttressed field stone and <b>half-log</b> walls, swooping multi-color asphalt shingle roofs with peaks, asymmetrical roof pitches, prominent field stone chimneys, cantilevered entry canopies, free-standing peeled log arches at the entrances, window awnings, <b>half-log</b> flower boxes, small-paned steel and wood windows, field stone paths and steps, boulder borders, rock gardens with elf figurines and knotty pine interiors. The ensemble blurred the line of fantasy and reality with an inherent sense of humor. The playful, fairy-tale aesthetic of Valhalla Highlands matched the community’s theme of a Nordic paradise.|$|E
50|$|All guest {{accommodation}} at the Grand Canyon Lodge was {{and remains}} in small detached cabins, arranged in duplex or quadplex plans. Cabins fell into two categories: Regular and Deluxe. The regular cabins, sometimes called economy cabins, were built as true log cabins with gabled roofs, each of two rooms divided by a log {{wall with a}} door. Located to the northwest of the lodge, 91 of these were built. 46 were altered with a bathroom extension of simulated log construction with a toilet for each side, {{while most of the}} remainder had single shared bathrooms built inside. Each cabin has an unroofed stone porch at either end. The deluxe cabins, located to the northeast of the lodge, are frame structures sheathed with <b>half-logs.</b> 18 are duplexes (another two burned when the lodge burned and were never replaced) and five are quadplexes. Floor plans and porch arrangements vary. All deluxe cabins share prominent porches of heavy log construction, many of which are {{on the edge of the}} canyon and have their own views. Deluxe cabins included stone chimneys. The regular cabins are still in use, divided into cabins that retain the original layout, and renovated cabins that combine both rooms into one larger cabin.|$|R

5000|$|The first 11 {{buildings}} listed are {{of similar}} architectural style to the Old Faithful Inn and retain their architectural and historical integrity. The following 11 buildings: have historical significance as support buildings {{and they are}} compatible with the historic scene. The cabins have historical significance and do reflect the type of cabin construction in Yellowstone National Park. While the cabins in the Old Faithful Lodge still retainsome architectural integrity, the cabins behind the Snow Lodge have been altered considerably and have lost their architectural integrity.* Building #2337 - Old Faithful Lodge. Construction began in 1923 with several additions made through 1927. The irregular plan building is of frame construction with stone masonry walls, wood-shingled exterior siding, and half log decorative elements. The lodge is approximately 28 feet long with a 52 x 45 ft extension, a 36 x 96 ft extension, and a 51 x 122 ft extension plus another 100 x 136 ft wing along the east side. The windows are casement and double hung. Stepped stone masonry columns and large log poles support the porte-cochère and other covered porches. Stepped stone masonry pilasters are used at some corners. The 19-room building has a wood-shingled, gable roof with a monitored roof over the recreation hall. Exposed log rafter ends and log brackets are used.* Building #2306 - Powerhouse and Laundry. Built in 1929 by the Yellowstone Park Company, the one-story, two-room L-shaped frame structure with wood-shingle exterior siding on concrete foundation has a wood-shingled gable roof with louvered type windows. The building has exposed log rafter ends. It is approximately 121 x 79 ft with the L extension being approximately 61 x 36 ft. This building {{is scheduled to be}} reduced in size if laundry facilities are park centralized.* Building #2310 - Caretaker's Quarters. Built in the late 1920s, the -story building has four rooms. The approximately 24 x 18 ft rectangular frame structure on concrete foundation has wood-shingle exterior siding and a wood-shingled gable roof with a transverse hip at one elevation. The windows are both double hung and casement. The building has exposed log rafter ends. The building is now the winter keeper's residence.* Building #2311 - Laundry Manager's Residence. Built in 1926, the approximately 16 x 24 ft rectangular plan frame one-story structure has two rooms. The building has wood-shingle exterior siding and a wood-shingled gable roof with a transverse gable roof and casement window. The roof has exposed log rafter ends and large ridge poles which are compatible to the Old Faithful Inn.* Building #2302 - Lower Service Station. This building was built by the Hamilton Store Company at an unknown date. It is a modified T-plan structure, approximately 80 x 24 ft, with a 22 x 40 ft extension. The exterior walls are horizontal siding with vertical half-timbers. The roof is wood-shingled and extends over the gas pumps. Hamilton stores, Inc., and the National Park Service each have joint ownership of the building.* Building #2303 - Lower Hamilton Store. Built as Klamer Store in 1894 and sold to Charles Hamilton in 1914. Hamilton expanded the store over the years. The modified U-plan is two-story with 13 rooms plus baths. The building is approximately 152 x 30 ft, with the two extensions being approximately 21 x 83 ft and 39 x 83 ft. The frame constructed building has novelty siding and a wood-shingled gabled roof with several transverse gables. Burled branches and logs are used as brackets and decorative elements on the north and east elevations. An unusual element is the use of the burled wood in spelling out HAMILTON STORES which hangs over the entrance to the salesroom. The interior is typical store design of the time, but the second floor contains a small sitting room called [...] "The Million Dollar Room," [...] papered with canceled checks whose total is $1,000,000. This fact is reportedly recorded in Ripley's Believe It or Not. Hamilton Stores, Inc., and the National Park Service have joint ownership of the building.* Building #2780 - Photo Shop. Built in 1927 by Haynes, Inc., the T-plan structure, approximately 44 x 36 ft with the leg being 61 x 27 ft. The two-story, 25-room store is of frame construction with <b>half-log</b> and shiplap siding. A porch extends across the front of the building. The wood-shingled gabled roof has exposed log rafter ends. The store reflects the concession architecture in Yellowstone National Park during the 1920s and 1930s. The building was moved to its present location in 1971.* Building #2326 - Upper Hamilton Store. Built in 1929 by Hamilton Stores, Inc., as a store and employee dormitory. The two-story, 33-room structure is approximately 45 x 118 ft, and in a U-shaped configuration. The windows are both casement and double hung sash. The walls are constructed of concrete laid to resemble hewn logs. The building is placed on a masonry stone foundation with stepped stone masonry pilasters and stepped stone masonry columns that support the two covered entrance porches. The eaves of the wood-shingled gabled roof are wood-shingled with exposed log rafter ends; log rafter purlins are used in the roof structure of the two covered entrance porches. The tips of the log rafter ends and the purlins are tapered and whittled to resemble beaver gnawnings. The building was originally part of the Old Faithful Auto Camp. Hamilton Stores, Inc., and the National Park Service each have joint ownership of the building.* Building #2327 - Upper Gas Station. Built in 1929 by Hamilton Stores, Inc., the Latin Cross plan structure has two rooms with three of the wings canopied over the gas pumps. The walls are of concrete construction laid to resemble hewn logs. Stepped stone masonry pilasters are used at the corners, similar stone columns support the canopies. The gabled roof has wood shingles and exposed log rafter ends. The structure has casement windows. Hamilton Stores, Inc., and the National Park Service each have joint ownership of the building.* Building #2305 - Old Faithful Inn. The Old Faithful Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, July 23, 1973. Herein specifically, the nomination will be expanded to include the following interior spaces: the dining room, the lobby, Rooms 10, 127, 154, and 229. The rustic log quality of the exterior is carried throughout the interior. The lobby, a 64-foot-square space rising 85 feet to the ridgeline, is encircled with tiers of balconies used as lounges for the guests. The use of exposed logs for the ceilings, walls, the purlins and rafters are further accented by the use of vertical log supports of the second and third floor balconies and for the small open room near the ceiling called the [...] "Crow's Nest." [...] In earlier days, the [...] "Crow's Nest" [...] was used by musicians as a place to assemble and entertain the guests far below. The lobby is further enhanced by the lighting effect produced by the many glass dormer windows placed in the steep gabled roof. An immense 16-foot-square native stone fireplace with hearths on each of its four sides dominates one corner of the lobby. Tons of local stone were used {{in the construction of the}} fireplace. The fireplace towers to the ceiling. Suspended from the ceilings in the lobby and dining room are copper light fixtures designed by the Inn's architect, Robert Reamer. Imitation candlesticks, also designed by Reamer, are mounted on the log columns and form sconces on the log walls. The original log-walled dining room is open to the roof with the log ceiling supported by log scissor trusses. A massive rock fireplace, modified after the 1959 earthquake, centers on the south wall. In 1921, the south wall ground level windows were removed to install doorways for a new dining room addition. In 1927, a multisided addition was made to the east wall of the original dining room. The original wall was removed and replaced with three support columns and panels. Interesting and significant elements of the room and the 1921 dining room addition are the arabesque on the fir panels, the spare columns, and the frieze. The etched designs are of flora and fauna and are the only rustic touches in the room. The room was converted to [...] "The Bear Pit" [...] a more formal cocktail lounge in 1962. Room No. 10, off the west corridor on the first floor, is one of the original rooms with modified bathroom intact. The log walled room, approximately 12 x 14 ft, has original built-in light fixtures and call buttons. The ceiling has the original end-to-end shingle covering. The adjoining bathroom has the original high tank oak toilet, clawfoot bathtub, and red marble lavatory. Linoleum covers the original fir flooring. The bathroom is approximately 10 x 12 ft. Other typical hotel rooms with rustic qualities are No. 127 and No. 154, on the second floor, and No. 229, on the third floor. The walls and ceilings are rough-sawn pine. Room No. 127 has an adjoining bath with tongue and groove walls and original high tank toilet, clawfoot bathtub and white marble lavatory. Room No. 154 has wooden casement windows and a seating nook on the north window. Room No. 229 is similar to Room No. 154, but larger size. Part of the room is the opening provided by the dormer window. All of the rooms have non-historic lavatories added in the 1930s-1940s. The stairway in the west wing should be cited, the <b>half-log</b> stair and tread and gnarled railings, Original furnishings in the Old Faithful Inn are significant components of the building and the collection is a good representation from the Arts and Crafts Movement. In the public spaces are two or three styles of loose cushioned settees, arm chairs, rockers, and wing back chairs, octagonal base tables with leather tops and brass studded trim, and writing desks and chairs. These pieces of Mission Furniture probably came from a manufacturer in upstate New York. The dining room is still furnished with the natural hickory side chairs of rustic style from the Old Hickory Furniture Company. The Bear Pit has leather topped tables with brass studs. Some bedrooms have iron bedsteads with a brass printed finish, dresser with drop front drawers and wash stand stained green with copper tops.* Building #2312 - Girl's Dormitory. Built in 1925, the L-plan building, approximately 170 x 63 ft, has two stories and 80 rooms. It is of frame construction with exterior wood-shingle siding and wood-shingled mansard roof. The building is similar in design to the 1913 addition to the Old Faithful Inn.* Building #2307 - Shop. Built in late 1920s, the one-room L-shaped frame structure on concrete foundation is approximately 28 x 51 ft and has wood-shingle exterior siding, and wood-shingled gable roof.* Building #2309 - Shed.

Built in late 1920s, the rectangular 16 x 55 ft two-room, frame structure has wood-shingle exterior siding and wood-shingled gable roof.* Building #2314 - U-Plan Dormitory. Built in 1913, the modified U-plan is approximately 200 x 71 ft. The building is of frame construction with half-timber and shingle exterior siding. The one-story building has 8 rooms. The wood-shingled gable roof has exposed log rafter ends.* Building #2315 - Engineers Dormitory. Built in 1913, the rectangular plan, approximately 30 x 17 ft, frame structure has one-story and four rooms. The structure has exterior wood-shingle siding, exposed log rafter ends and a wood-shingled roof with a transverse gable along its length.* Building #2316 - Employee's Dormitory. Built in 1926, the rectangular plan, approximately 25 x 49 ft, frame construction is one-story with 8 rooms. The building has wood-shingle exterior siding and a wood-shingled gable roof with exposed rafter ends. The building reflects the design and construction of the Old Faithful Inn. The dormitory was built by the Yellowstone Park Company as a service building for the Inn. It is now used as a recreation facility for employees.* Building #2338 - Linen Room. Built c. 1930, the two-story frame constructed building is an L-plan, approximately 60 x 30 ft with the extension being 30 x 16 ft. The exterior has exposed log studs and shiplap siding; the gabled roof is wood shingled. The building is east of the Old Faithful Lodge's north wing. The upper floor is used as a dorm and the lower floor is used as a linen storage for the cabins in the lodge area.* Building #2339 - Power Plant and Boiler House. The frame constructed L-plan buildings, approximately 57 x 52 ft with a 33 x 28 ft extension. The building has a half-timbered and wood-shingled exterior and a wood-shingled gable roof. The building is on a concrete foundation. The two buildings shown on the site plan (just north of building #2338) are 4-plex facilities built ca. 1930.* Building #2343 - Dormitory (Cinderella Dorm). Built in 1940, the rectangular plan building is approximately 112 x 38 ft. The exterior is half-timbered and plywood. The two-story structure, on concrete foundation, has a wood-shingle gabled roof. The building is east of the lodge.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The role of v-ATPases {{in cancer}} biology is being {{increasingly}} recognized. Yeast {{studies indicate that}} the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib may interact with the v-ATPase genes and alter the course of cancer progression. Data from humans in this regard are lacking. Methods We constructed 55 lymphoblastoid cell lines from pedigreed, cancer-free human subjects and treated them with IC 20 concentration of imatinib mesylate. Using these cell lines, we (i) estimated the heritability and differential expression of 19 genes encoding several subunits of the v-ATPase protein in response to imatinib treatment; (ii) estimated the genetic similarity among these genes; and (iii) conducted a high-density scan to find cis-regulating genetic variation associated with differential expression of these genes. Results We found that the imatinib response of the genes encoding v-ATPase subunits is significantly heritable and can be clustered to identify novel drug targets in imatinib therapy. Further, five of these genes were significantly cis-regulated and together represented nearly <b>half-log</b> fold change in response to imatinib (p = 0. 0107) that was homogenous (p = 0. 2598). Conclusions Our results proffer support to the growing view that personalized regimens using proton pump inhibitors or v-ATPase inhibitors may improve outcomes of imatinib therapy in various cancers. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —The {{addition}} of habitat enhancement structures to aquatic systems {{is a common}} prac-tice by fisheries managers hoping to increase production, spawning success, and angler catch rates of important sport fishes. However, quantitative evaluations of these efforts are few and typically {{do not include the}} extent to which natural habitat mediates the effects of habitat enhancement structures. We evaluated the effects of two types of habitat enhancement structure on four fish groups in four reservoirs of the Au Sable River, Michigan. Using a combination of sampling methods, we compared several response variables (including relative abundance, nesting, and angler catch rates) between areas with and without structures, as well as before and after structure placement, across a gradient of natural habitat conditions. The effects of <b>half-log</b> habitat enhance-ment structures were significant in some cases, but no significant effects were detected for AquaCrib structures. Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu responded to half-logs with significantly greater relative abundance, nest density, and nest success than in areas without half-logs. Other fish groups displayed few significant differences in the response variables between areas with and without structures or before and after structure placement. Habitat effects varied across reservoirs and fish groups but generally influenced the response variables more than the presence of habitat enhance...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{develop a}} DNA based plate {{hybridisation}} assay {{for the detection}} of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products amplified from Aspergillus fumigatus DNA; and to determine the sensitivity of this technique and compare it with Southern blotting. METHODS: A <b>half-log</b> dilution series of DNA extracted from A fumigatus was amplified with specific primers, one of which was 5 ' end labelled with biotin. PCR products were subsequently detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting, and binding of the products to a streptavidin coated microtitre well, followed by non-radioactive colorimetric detection. Amplification was carried out 10 times for each DNA dilution and a plot of initial DNA concentration against signal intensity was made. RESULTS: A DNA concentration of 1. 5 pg could be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting with a non-radioactively labelled aspergillus specific probe; 1. 5 pg was detectable by streptavidin binding of the PCR products to a microtitre plate. The signal from the microtitre plate detection was proportional to the amount of DNA in the PCR reaction on a log-log scale between 100 and 1 pg of DNA. CONCLUSIONS: A DNA based plate hybridisation assay {{for the detection of}} A fumigatus PCR products is as sensitive as Southern blotting. However, results are obtained in three hours rather than the three days required for agarose gel electrophoresis, blotting, hybridisation, and detection...|$|E

The addi-tion of 0. 025 % carrageenan to intrapleural 0. 075 % Evans blue injections increased the effusive response. The amount of effusion varied from assay to assay; in 162 control groups (six rats/group) the estimated population mean volume of pleural fluid ± 5. E. at six hours was 7. 5 ± 0. 07 ml. The reduction in the volume of pleural fluid elicited by the nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs was dose related in contrast to the lack of consistent dose dependency when the dye alone was the pleural irritant. Relative potencies of the test compounds were determined in 2 by 3 assays with <b>half-log</b> dose increments, and the results were analyzed by factorial analyses. Their activities relative to phenylbutazone were: indomethacin, 26. 9; flufenamic acid, 2. 1; gold sodium thiomalate, 1. 1; indoxole, 1. 0; and acetylsalicylic acid, 03. With the exception of gold sodium thiomalate (i. m.), all compounds were administered p. o. Chloroquine phosphate and d-penicillamine failed to influence the effusive response. The re-suits show that Evans blue-carrageenan-induced {{pleural effusion}} may be used to determine the relative potency of gold- and phenylbutazone-type antirheumatic compounds. The pleural response to various agents has been utilized for studying vascular permeabilit...|$|E
40|$|Diethylcarbamazine {{was given}} as eye drops in varying {{concentrations}} in a <b>half-log</b> dilution series from 1. 0 to 0. 0001 % {{to patients with}} ocular onchocerciasis. Migration of microfilariae into the cornea, followed by their straightening and disintegration, was observed with delivery rates as low as 0. 1 microgram/hour. Dose-related adverse inflammatory reactions, including the development of globular limbal infiltrates with itching and redness, were seen with delivery rates as low as 0. 6 microgram/hour, but substantial inflammatory reactions, including severe vasculitis, were seen only with delivery rates of or above 1. 0 microgram/hour. This suggests {{that it should be}} possible to achieve beneficial clearing of the microfilarial load, without adverse reactions, by continuous non-pulsed delivery of the drug. Technology exists for such delivery, either directly into the eye or systemically by a transdermal system that could give 3 to 7 days' treatment from each application. The observations reported suggest that after preliminary clearing of the microfilarial load by carefully controlled delivery of DEC it may be possible to maintain therapy by less strictly controlled delivery in DEC-medicated salt, or to use treatment with suramin, without incurring substantial adverse reactions, such as a deterioration in vision in cases in which the optic nerve is already compromised. Continuous non-pulsed DEC delivery systems could have a place in the management of onchocercal sclerosing keratitis. The unique opportunities for using the ocular model to define the requirements for beneficial non-damaging therapy with DEC should be explored in further field trials...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesRapid {{influenza}} {{diagnostic tests}} (RIDTs) used widely in clinical practice are simple {{to use and}} provide results within 15 minutes; however, reported performance is variable, which causes concern when novel or variant viruses emerge. This study's goal {{was to assess the}} analytical reactivity of 13 RIDTs with recently circulating seasonal and H 3 N 2 v influenza viruses, using three different viral measures. DesignVirus stocks were characterized by infectious dose (ID 50) and nucleoprotein (NP) concentration, diluted at <b>half-log</b> dilutions, and tested with each RIDT and real-time RT-PCR. ResultsStrong correlation was observed between NP concentration and RIDT reactivity; however, only weak correlation was seen with ID 50 or Ct values. Only four RIDTs detected viral NP at the lowest dilution for all influenza A viruses (IAV). Influenza A viruses not detected by more than one RIDT had lower NP levels. Of the 13 RIDTs, 9 had no significant differences in reactivity across IAV when compared to NP levels. ConclusionsPrevious reports of RIDT performance typically compare reactivity based on ID 50 titers, which in this study correlated only weakly with proportional amounts of viral NP in prepared virus samples. In the context of the strong correlation of RIDT reactivity with NP concentration, H 3 N 2 v was found to be as reactive as seasonal circulating IAV. While these findings may not reflect clinical performance of these RIDTs, measuring NP concentration can be useful in the future to assess comparable reactivity of available RIDTs, or to assess reactivity with newly evolving or emerging viruses.

Nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) assays were developed for diagnostic applications and for blood donor screening on high-throughput NAT systems. We distributed blinded panels to compare the analytical performance of blood screening relative to diagnostic NAT assays. A 25 -member, coded panel (11 <b>half-log</b> dilutions of a 2013 French Polynesia ZIKV isolate and 2015 Brazilian donor plasma implicated in transfusion transmission, and 3 negative controls) was sent to 11 laboratories that performed 17 assays with 2 to 12 replicates per panel member. Results were analyzed for the percentage reactivity at each dilution and by probit analysis to estimate the 50 % and 95 % limits of detection (LOD 50 and LOD 95, respectively). Donor-screening NAT assays that process approximately 500 µL of plasma into amplification reactions were comparable in sensitivity (LOD 50 and LOD 95, 2. 5 and 15 - 18 copies/mL) and were approximately 10 -fold to 100 -fold more sensitive than research laboratory-developed and diagnostic reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests that process from 10 to 30 µL of plasma per amplification. Increasing sample input volume assayed with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays increased the LODs by 10 -fold to 30 -fold. Blood donor-screening ZIKV NAT assays demonstrate similar excellent sensitivities to assays currently used for screening for transfusion-transmitted viruses and are substantially more sensitive than most other laboratory-developed and diagnostic ZIKV reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays. Enhancing sensitivities of laboratory-developed and diagnostic assays may be achievable by increasing sample input...|$|E
40|$|Spatial scale affects our {{interpretation}} {{of the degree to}} which land uses in watersheds and their spatial arrangement influence stream habitat and biological integrity. This in turn determines how managers and policy makers approach restoration of degraded streams or protection of existing ones. The first objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the index of biotic integrity (IBI) and forest cover and other habitat variables in the Eastern Corn Belt Plain (ECBP) ecoregion as influenced by spatial scale. The second objective was to determine the cost and the cost effectiveness of recovering IBI scores through habitat restoration. The strongest relationship between IBI scores and forest within watersheds in the ECBP was in the 30 m adjacent to stream segments and 600 m upstream. Habitat variables derived with spatial data provided a stronger prediction of IBI than habitat variables evaluated qualitatively in stream reaches. Forested riparian area and length and steepness of slopes were the two most important predictors of IBI. The ability to predict IBI with habitat variables decreased as the spatial extent of models increased, irrespective of whether watershed or reach habitat variables were used. The cost effectiveness of riparian buffers as a restoration tool decreased with increasing spatial extent and decreasing stream order. As an alternative, in-stream-habitat restoration using <b>half-log</b> structures was less cost effective than riparian buffers at all spatial extents. The cost per 1 percent increase in IBI score weighted by proportion of stream orders was U. S. 360. 10 for a 30 -year recovery in the upper Wabash River watershed. The total cost for 100 percent buffer application in the watershed was U. S. 253, 898, 769. 24, with 96...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{clinical}} failures {{associated with}} levofloxacin treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae infections and growing evidence of frequent mutations in the isolate population {{have led to}} increased concerns regarding fluoroquinolone resistance. Our objective was to characterize the efficacies of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against various genotypes of S. pneumoniae after simulated bronchopulmonary exposures. An in vitro model was used to simulate a levofloxacin concentration of 500 mg and a moxifloxacin concentration of 400 mg, which were previously determined to be the concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid of older adults receiving once-daily dosing. The effects of the drugs were tested against six S. pneumoniae containing various mutations. Bacterial density and resistance were quantitatively assessed over 48 h. The S. pneumoniae isolate with no mutation displayed a 4 -log reduction in CFU after treatment with both agents and did not develop resistance. Isolates containing the parC or parE mutation or both mutations regrew and developed resistance when they were exposed to levofloxacin, despite an unbound area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) :MIC ratio of ∼ 100. When the isolate containing the parC and gyrA mutations was exposed to levofloxacin, there was a <b>half-log</b> {{reduction in the number}} of CFU compared to that for the control, but the isolate subsequently regrew. Likewise, levofloxacin did not kill the isolate containing the parC, gyrA, and parE mutations. Moxifloxacin sustained the killing of all bacterial isolates tested without the development of resistance. Levofloxacin did not sustain bacterial killing and did not prevent the emergence of further resistance in mutants with the parC or parE mutation or both mutations, even though an unbound AUC:MIC ratio for exposure well above the breakpoint of 30 to 40 established in the literature for S. pneumoniae was maintained. Moxifloxacin was effective against all isolates tested, despite the presence of isolates with two- and three-step mutations, for which the MICs were increased...|$|E
40|$|The multi-pI banding pattern, {{observed}} by Hamilton (1), goes unnoticed by (SDS-PAGE) (10 %), {{and thus is}} often unsuspected. The cause of the phenomenon could stem from post-translational changes such as amidation or deamidation of glutamate or glutamine residues (2, 3). Glycosylation can also result in a charge shift ofthe protein band ofselected non-IgG heavy-chain Ig myeloma proteins (4). Treatment of Mab IgG with neuraminidase failed to decrease gamma heavy chains to a single spot in two dimensional gels (4, 5). In any event, these shifts in the IgOs p 1 signify posttranslational modifications which ap pear consistent within a given hybridoma cell line. An exception, of course, is class switching, which is fairly uncommon (6). Fragments of Mabs {{have been shown to}} give earlier and superior lesion-to-background ratios in tumor models when compared with intact Mabs, and to improve image quality in human radioimmunodetection (RID) (7 - 10). For these reasons, much work in radioimmunodiagnosis now focuses around Mab fragments. While Fab and Fab' fragments offer an advantage for RID, they are not without problems, one of which is a <b>half-log</b> decease in affinity over bivalent species and an increased probability that a randomly applied radiolabel will involve the one remain ing variable region. The end result of the above could be reduced tumor targeting. Since the possibility exists that some of the p 1 bands described by Hamilton et al., repre sent none or less immunoreactive materials, we have at tempted to investigate each band separately in regard to its immunoreactivity and in vivo distribution and tumor targeting. Our interest was selection of the most appropri ate band for RID. The following represents the results of our efforts...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) types 16 and 18 cause invasive {{cervical cancer}} and most invasive anal cancers (IACs). Overall, IAC rates are highest among {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), especially MSM with HIV infection. Testosterone is prescribed for men showing hypogonadism and HIV-related wasting. While there are direct and indirect physiological effects of testosterone in males, its role in anal HPV 16 / 18 infections in men is unknown. METHODS: Free testosterone (FT) was measured in serum from 340 Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) participants who were tested for anal HPV 16 / 18 -DNA approximately 36 months later. The effect of log 10 -transformed current FT level on anal HPV 16 / 18 prevalence was modeled using Poisson regression with robust error variance. Multivariate models controlled for other HPV types, cumulative years of exogenous testosterone use, race, age, lifetime number of receptive anal intercourse partnerships, body mass index, tobacco smoking, HIV-infection and CD 4 + T-cell counts among HIV-infected, and blood draw timing. RESULTS: Participants were, on average, 60 (+ 5. 4) years of age, White (86 %), and HIV-uninfected (56 %); Twenty-four percent tested positive for anal HPV 16 and/or 18 -DNA (HPV 16 prevalence= 17. 1 %, HPV 18 = 9. 1 %). In adjusted analysis, each <b>half-log</b> 10 increase of FT was associated with a 1. 9 -fold (95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 11, 3. 24) higher HPV 16 / 18 prevalence. Additionally, other Group 1 high-risk HPVs were associated with a 1. 56 -fold (1. 03, 2. 37) higher HPV 16 / 18 prevalence. Traditional risk factors for HPV 16 / 18 infection (age, tobacco smoking; lifetime number of sexual partners, including the number of receptive anal intercourse partnerships within 24 months preceding HPV testing) were poorly correlated with one another and not statistically significantly associated with higher prevalence of HPV 16 / 18 infection in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Higher free testosterone was associated with increased HPV 16 / 18 prevalence measured approximately three years later, independent of sexual behavior and other potential confounders. The mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear and warrant further study...|$|E

This is {{the first}} report of the {{isolation}} and characterization of a fish virus from the Philippines. The virus was isolated using snakehead spleen cells (SHS) from severely lesioned epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) -affected snakehead Ophicephalus striatus from Laguna de Bay, in January 1991. The virus induced cytopathic effects (CPE) in SHS cells yielding a titer of 3. 02 x 106 TCID 50 ml- 1 at 25 Â°C within 2 to 3 d. Other susceptible cell lines included bluegill fry (BF- 2), catfish spleen (CFS) and channel catfish ovary (CCO) cells. Replication in chinook salmon embryo cells (CHSE- 214) was minimal while Epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells (EPC) and rainbow trout gonad cells (RTG 2) were refractory. Temperatures of 15 to 25 Â°C were optimum for virus replication but the virus did not replicate at 37 Â°C. The virus can be stored at - 10 and 8 Â°C for 30 and 10 d, respectively, without significant loss of infectivity. Viral replication was logarithmic with a 2 h lag phase; viral assembly in the host cells occurred in 4 h and release of virus occurred 8 h after viral infection. A 1 -log difference in TCID 50 titer between the cell-free virus and the total virus was noted. Freezing and thawing the virus caused a <b>half-log</b> drop in titer. Viral exposure to chloroform or heating to 56 Â°C for 30 min inactivated the virus. Exposure to pH 3 medium for 30 min resulted in a more than 100 fold loss of viral infectivity. The 5 -iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) did not affect virus replication, indicating a RNA genome. Neutralization tests using the Philippine virus, the ulcerative disease rhabdovirus (UDRV) and the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) polyvalent antisera showed slight cross-reaction between the Philippine virus antiserum and UDRV but established no serological relationship with SHRV and IHN virus. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of SHS cells infected with the virus showed virus particles with typical bullet morphology and an estimated size of 65 x 175 nm. The Philippine virus was therefore a rhabdovirus, but the present study did not establish {{its role in the}} epizootiology of EUS...|$|E

The model presented here is the rabbit coronary ligation model in which myocardial infarction was produced ligation model in which myocardial infarction was produced in male New Zeeland white myocardial infarction was produced in male New Zeeland white rabbits (2. 6 kg- 3. 0 Kg) by ligation of the marginal branch of the left descending coronary artery. The development of chronic heart failure was allowed to proceed over eight weeks. Animals were killed by overdose with pentobarbitone sodium (IV injection). Arteries and veins were carefully removed with as little connective tissue as possible and placed in cold physiological salt solution (PSS). The arterial and venous rings were mounted in 10 ml isolated organ baths, bathed in Kerbs maintained at 37 °c with 95 % O 2 plus 5 % CO 2. The rings were then placed under different resting tensions. After initial application of tension, tissues were left to equilibrate for a 60 min period. Then all tissues were exposed to cumulative concentration of NA (1 nM- 300 µM). Following complete washout, the preparations were left for 45 minutes to re-equilibrate. Then all preparations were contracted with KCl (Krebs solution, sodium free and high KCl, 125 mM) and allowed to contract for 5 - 10 min. Following complete washout with normal Krebs an additional 30 minutes equilibration period was allowed. Then cumulative concentration-response curves (CCRS) to NA obtained by increasing the concentration-response curves (CCRC) to NA obtained by increasing the concentration of the agonist in <b>half-log</b> increments. In contraction responses to NA aorta, ear artery and ear vein were the most sensitive preparations (pD 2 values: 9. 96, 7. 04 and 7. 8 respectively). Renal artery and aorta had relatively very large maximum responses to NA among the arteries (6. 7 and 4. 3 g respectively) and saphenous vein had greated maximum responses to NA among the arteries (6. 7 and 4. 3 g respectively) and saphenous vein had greatest maximum response among the veins (2. 9 g). The results led to two major conclusions with respect to the model. First, vasoconstrictions to noradrenaline were unaltered. Second, contractions to KCl (125 mM) were preserved in large vessels (arteries and veins) in coronary ligated rabbits after 8 weeks compared with a normal control population...|$|E
