50|$|Since its introduction, the M44 {{design was}} updated {{several times to}} solve {{problems}} such as caking in the cyanide capsules or malfunctioning ejectors. One effort in 1977-79 resulted in a completely new, slightly larger cyanide ejector called the M50. However, a field evaluation in 1982 showed that the older Poteet-designed M44 actually performed better, and the M50 was phased out. In 1984, the M44 <b>ejector</b> <b>body</b> and capsule holder were redesigned as it became necessary to replace the dies {{that had been used}} since 1967 to cast those metal parts. That model is still produced today, with some minor adjustments.|$|E
40|$|Ozone {{treatment}} is an oxidative process used in {{wastewater treatment plant}} to demolish complex organic molecule. In the case of textile industry is required to adequately remove residual color, demolishing the chromophoric bonds or groups in the dye molecules. A useful method for adding the ozone gas into water and maximize ozone-water mixing to increase mass transfer, {{is the use of}} Venturi ejectors. Forcing water through Venturi body, it creates a differential pressure between the fluid inlet and outlet, which in turn creates a vacuum inside the <b>ejector</b> <b>body.</b> In this part, it is possible introduce ozone.

5000|$|Rear-eject dump {{vehicles}} were first {{introduced in the}} 1980's by LeRoy Hagenbuch, P.E. of Philippi-Hagenbuch, Inc. for a refuse hauling application in New York City. They were designed to work on Volvo BM truck chassis. While the functionality of the <b>ejector</b> <b>bodies</b> worked well, they were prone to maintenance issues and not replicated until the 1990s. The next documented <b>ejector</b> <b>bodies</b> were developed by DDT, a UK truck manufacturer. [...] A variation using steel chains instead of a hydraulic ram was introduced by Bell, but did not become popular.|$|R
40|$|The {{final stage}} of the {{accretion}} of Uranus and Neptune is numerically investigated. The four Jovian planets are considered with Jupiter and Saturn assumed to have reached their present sizes, whereas Uranus and Neptune are taken with initial masses 0. 2 of their present ones. Allowance is made for the orbital variation of the Jovian planets due to the exchange of angular momentum with interacting bodies ("planetesimals"). Two possible effects that {{may have contributed to}} the accretion of Uranus and Neptune are incorporated in our model: (1) an enlarged cross section for accretion of incoming planetesimals due to the presence of extended gaseous envelopes and/or circumplanetary swarms of bodies; and (2) intermediate protoplanets in mid-range orbits between the Jovian planets. Significant radial displacements are found for Uranus and Neptune during their accretion and scattering of planetesimals. The orbital angular momentum budgets of Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn turn out to be positive; i. e., they on average gain orbital angular momentum in their interactions with planetesimals and hence they are displaced outwardly. Instead, Jupiter as the main <b>ejector</b> of <b>bodies</b> loses orbital angular momentum so it moves sunward. The gravitational stirring of planetesimals caused by the introduction of intermediate protoplanets has the effect that additional solid matter is injected into the accretion zones of Uranus and Neptune. For moderate enlargements of the radius of the accretion cross section (2 - 4 times), the accretion time scale of Uranus and Neptune are found to be of a few 108 years and the initial amount of solid material required to form them of a few times their present masses. Given the crucial role played by the size of the accretion cross section, questions as to when Uranus and Neptune acquired their gaseous envelopes, when the envelopes collapsed onto the solid cores, and bow massive they were are essential in defining the efficiency and time scale of accretion of the two outer Jovian planets. 1...|$|R
