5|$|In Eurasia, some {{authorities}} {{distinguish between}} cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris. In Europe, various subspecies {{have been named}} based on characteristics such as the <b>hairiness</b> of the leaves, {{the extent to which}} the stems are angled or rounded, and the size and shape of the terminal umbel.|$|E
5|$|There's {{got to be}} {{a series}} of {{advantages}} all the way in the feather. If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem... It's perfectly possible feathers began as fluffy extensions of reptilian scales to act as insulators... The earliest feathers might have been a different approach to <b>hairiness</b> among reptiles keeping warm.|$|E
5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, <b>hairiness,</b> bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E
5|$|In all {{subspecies}} but the type, {{the lower}} stamens are also hairy. In subsp. crassifolium, the <b>hairiness</b> is less dense and often {{absent from the}} upper part of the anthers, while lower leaves are hardly decurrent and have longer petioles. In subsp. giganteum, the hairs are densely white tomentose, and lower leaves strongly decurrent. Subsp. crassifolium also differs from the type in having slightly larger flowers, which measure 15–30mm wide, whereas in the type they are 12–20mm in diameter. Both subsp. giganteum and subsp. crassifolium were originally described as species. Due to its morphological variation, V.thapsus has had a great many subspecies described. A recent revision led its author to maintain V.giganteum but sink V.crassifolium into synonymy.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased <b>hairiness</b> or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith, based on specimens collected in Nor Yungas Province, Bolivia, {{on the road to}} La Paz to Coroico. They published a short description in Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication, followed by a more detailed description in English later that year. According to Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán, the species Psilocybe acutissima (described by Roger Heim in 1958), and Psilocybe isauri (described by Singer in 1959) are synonyms, as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the type material of all three. Singer considered P.isauri a species distinct from P.yungensis because of differences in the <b>hairiness</b> of the stem surface. Smith named the variety P.yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) papilla. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P.acutissima was a papillate cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.|$|E

25|$|The genus Actinidia {{contains}} around 60 species. Though most kiwifruit {{are easily}} recognized as kiwifruit (due to basic shape) their fruit is quite variable. The {{skin of the}} fruit varies in size, shape, <b>hairiness,</b> and color. The flesh varies in color, juiciness, texture, and taste. Some fruits are unpalatable while others taste considerably better than {{the majority of the}} commercial varieties.|$|E
25|$|As {{attitudes towards}} {{alternative}} sexualities have broadened, and as gay styles {{have become increasingly}} mainstream, {{there has been a}} loosening of the boundaries between male and female styles. Through which Rusty Barrett refers to as indexical disjuncture, it is possible that an index is disconnected from the social meaning it used to be linked to. In the 1980s, Bear style emerged in response to the dominant ideologies in the gay community that marginalized heavyset men. Bear culture emphasizes size and <b>hairiness</b> while still embracing qualities and endeavors associated with women, which is, however, counter-cultural with respect to both heteronormativity as well as the dominant gay aesthetic. After all, the boundaries of gender expression are loosened.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia daurica is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant {{belonging to the}} peony family. It has slender carrot-shaped roots, leaves mostly consisting of nine leaflets, with one flower per stem. The flower is subtended by none to two leafy bracts, and has two or three sepals, five to eight petals, and many stamens. The subspecies vary in the colour of the petals (white, light yellow, pink, red), {{the size and shape}} of the leaflets, and the <b>hairiness</b> of the leaflets and the carpels. Paeonia daurica can be found from the Balkans to Iran, and the Crimea to Lebanon, with the centre of its distribution in the Caucasus. It is also cultivated as an ornamental.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia daurica {{was first}} {{described}} by Henry Charles Andrews {{in the seventh}} volume of his Botanist's Repository published in 1807. A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P.wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P.wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P.corallina and P.corallina var. triternata, and P.wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P.triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P.corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P.wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow {{was the first to}} think that a difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P.wittmanniana to P.corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new form, f. macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P.corallina, P.mlokosewitschii, P.macrophylla, P.wittmanniana, and introduced P.wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P.triternata and P.corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P.corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P.wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P.mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the <b>hairiness</b> of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P.corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P.mlokosewitschii, P.wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P.tomentosa and the new P.abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P.mlokosewitschii - as part of the series Obovatae having orbicular, ovate or rarely pointed leaflets - and P.triternata, P.caucasica, P.wittmanniana, P.macrophylla, P.tomentosa and P.abchasica - all having rather wide, pointed leaflets – assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P.daurica, P.mlokosewitschii and P.wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P.kavachensis (= P.caucasica), P.mlokosewitschii (including P.tomentosa) and P.wittmanniana (including P.abchasica). P.wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P.steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia-Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P.abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P.ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis.|$|E

P.daurica subsp. mlokosewitschii usually has inverted egg-shaped leaves with a rounded ends that very suddenly develop into small but sharp tips, with its undersides mostly sparsely or rather densely covered soft hairs, but sometimes hairless. P.daurica subsp. wittmanniana has leaflets that vary in <b>hairiness.</b> Its flowers have one to three hairless or sparsely felty carpels and yellow petals that may have a pink spot at the base. P.daurica subsp. macrophylla has larger leaflets and consistently hairless carpels. P.daurica subsp. tomentosa can be distinguished by leaflets with a mostly dense covering of felty hairs on the lower surface and on the carpels. In P.daurica subsp. velebitensis, the lower leaves consist of three sets of three leaflets each, which are inverted egg-shaped or sometimes longish oval, with a rounded tip that may end in a point, and are covered in felty hair on the underside, while the two of three ovaries are felty as well.|$|E

[...] Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn. [...] The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. [...] More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. [...] A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, [...] corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. [...] Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|E
