The grant, announced Dec. 1, 2008 for World AIDS Day, was awarded through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), an initiative started by the Bush administration in 2003 to combat global HIV and AIDS. Cross was one of 19 nonprofit groups to receive funding after a rigorous winnowing process in which 800 <b>different</b> <b>applicants</b> were reviewed. The three-year project will reach an estimated 5,000 orphans and vulnerable children, providing them with the care and medical services, and about 92,000 youths and their families will receive AIDS awareness and destigmatization messages through Cross’ efforts. [...] The program will target destitute people in Haiti’s Grand Anse region, the central plateau, the southern coast and Port-au-Prince.|$|E

Our results clarify that the employment decline during the early 1990 s {{can be explained by the}} concurrent DI expansion only under the extreme assumption that the marginal beneficiaries would have worked at rates comparable to non-applicants were they not receiving benefits. In addition, when we extend the analysis past the period of rapid expansion of the DI program into the late 1990 s and early 2000 s, we find that employment rates for men with work limitations continued to decline, despite a slowdown in the growth rate of DI. This alone suggests important other factors at work.|$|R

This research was aimed at understanding the cause {{of some of these}} differences. Survey questionnaires were sent to personnel {{managers in}} Norway (N = 195) and Quebec (N = 172). The personnel managers were asked to rate: (1) aspects related to their firms' organizational characteristics (business environment, strategy, and structure), and (2) the importance of different personality traits for applicants to managerial and professional positions. Consistent with earlier research (Rynes & Gerhart, 1990) the results indicate that preferences for <b>different</b> <b>applicant</b> attributes represent shared perceptions due to common organizational membership. These preferences are to some degree related to company strategy, organizational structure and national culture. In general, it was found that personnel managers currently seek candidates who can adapt to change and generate new ideas.

With a prospering economy, there are many alternatives to joining the military, and all services are having difficulty recruiting young people. United States Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) sponsored our research in simulating the workings of an Army recruiting station {{in an effort to}} help understand more about the recruiting process. Specifically, USAREC wanted a management tool {{to examine the effects of}} changing a variety of controllable factors on the way an individual recruiting station performs. We focused this study on the effect of recruiting station commander leadership on recruiting productivity, and the differences in processing times and success rates for <b>different</b> types of <b>applicants</b> (potential recruits). This study added capability to a previous simulation model developed at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) (Cordeiro and Friend 1998). Cordeiro & Friend’s model depicted an Army recruiting station with three types of recruiters, and a single (average) recruiter type. For the current work, we needed to gather pertinent data on the effects of leadership and on the differences between <b>different</b> <b>applicant</b> types. In addition, we needed to incorporate the new data into the simulation model.

40|$|In this thesis, we utilize {{probabilistic}} reasoning and simulation methods {{to determine the}} optimal selection rule for the secretary problem with switch costs, in which a known number of applicants appear sequentially in a random order, and {{the objective is to}} maximize the sum of the qualities of all hired secretaries over all time. It is assumed that the quality of each applicant is uniformly distributed and any hired secretary can be replaced by a better qualified one at a constant switch cost. A dynamic program is formulated and the optimal selection rule for the single secretary case is solved. An approximate solution is given for the multiple secretary case, in which we are allowed to have more than one secretary at a time. An experiment was designed to simulate the interview process, in which respondents were sequentially faced with random numbers that represent the qualities of <b>different</b> <b>applicants.</b> Finally, the experimental results are compared against the optimal selection strategy. by Jiachuan Ding.

40|$|The world wine trade {{generated}} around 30 billion Euros in 2015. The wine consumer appreciates attributes such as tradition, {{quality and}} distinctiveness, characteristics {{that are associated}} with the terroir. In this segment, trademarks and geographical indications (GI) are relevant distinctive signs for the consumers' choice. Issues involving the protection of these signs have become increasingly stronger in the same proportion of the trade growth. Wine GIs hold a long tradition in the international scenario, particularly the European. In Brazil, the trademarks have a broader protection history, and the GIs were only acknowledged with the 1996 Industrial Property Law. Nevertheless, Brazil stands out as an emergent market for wines. The databank of the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI-Brazil) shows that 30 % of all applications for GI protection are for wines and spirits. Such figures indicate the growing importance of the GI for the segment. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the applications for trademarks and GIs for wines and spirits, based on the INPI databank. For such, some foreign GIs have been chosen, for their historic and commercial importance, as well as one national GI, the first acknowledged in the segment. Among the results, several applications for trademarks from <b>different</b> <b>applicants</b> containing the searched terms have been found. From these results, it is believed that the coexistence and overlap of trademarks and GIs indicate the need for a review of the national legislation...|$|E
40|$|The active-controlled {{trial with}} a non-inferiority design has gained {{popularity}} in recent years. However, non-inferiority trials present some methodological challenges, especially {{in determining the}} non-inferiority margin. Regulatory guidelines provide some general statements on how a non-inferiority trial should be conducted. Moreover, in a scientific advice procedure, regulators give companies the opportunity to discuss critical trial issues {{prior to the start}} of the trial. The aim of this study was to identify potential issues that may benefit from more explicit guidance by regulators. To achieve this, we collected and analyzed questions about non-inferiority trials posed by applicants for scientific advice in Europe in 2008 and 2009, as well as the responses given by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In our analysis we included 156 final letters of advice from 2008 and 2009, addressed to 94 <b>different</b> <b>applicants</b> (manufacturers). Our analysis yielded two major findings: (1) applicants frequently asked questions ‘whether ’ and ‘how ’ to conduct a non-inferiority trial, 26 % and 74 %, respectively, and (2) the EMA regulators seem mainly concerned about the choice of the non-inferiority margin in non-inferiority trials (36 % of total regulatory answers). In 40 % of the answers, the EMA recommended using a stricter margin, and in 10 % of the answers regarding non-inferiority margins, the EMA questioned the justification of the proposed non-inferiority margin. We conclude that there are still difficulties in selecting the appropriate methodology for non-inferiority trials...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{to develop}} this research paper is concerned with a system which helps diagnose the severity of diabetes. The disease named diabetes mellitus makes the body unable to handle sugar so it causes thirst, frequency of urination, tiredness and many other symptoms. The diabetes mellitus describes a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. It {{can be caused by}} number of factors like pancreatic dysfunction, obesity, hereditary, stress, drugs, alcohol etc. It includes long term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs. The effects of diabetes mellitus include long term damage and failure of various organs. Diabetes mellitus may present with characteristic symptoms such as thirst, polyuria, blurring of vision, and weight loss. This Paper is implemented on soft computing technique, namely Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) to find out {{the presence or absence of}} diabetes mellitus based on the input of sign/symptoms recorded at three fuzzy levels developed by the domain experts. The large amount of data and information that needs to be handled and integrated requires specific methodologies and tools.

40|$|Applicants to {{universities}} present profiles of {{performance in a}} variety of relevant content areas as evidence for selection. Even though profiles of <b>different</b> <b>applicants</b> may involve different content areas, the applicants may be competing for places to the same university and even to the same program of study. In that case, and if there are more eligible applicants than there are places, universities must reconcile these different profiles in order to make comparisons among them. When there is a small number of applicants, then these comparisons may be camed out qualitatively; when the number of applicants runs into the order of thousands and there is a short time in which to make the offers, some quantitative analysis is required. This quantitative analysis usually involves aggregating the components of each profile in order to form a single score from which comparisons among applicants can be made readily. Legitimate concerns can be raised regarding forming simple aggregates from diverse components of profiles, but despite these concerns, the practical problem of making relatively rapid decisions means that these concerns are generally not addressed. The premise of this article is that profiles will be more or less consistent among the components and that although some profiles may not be, a great number of others may be, summarized adequately by a single score. It is shown that by applying the principles of latent trait test theory at the level of tests, it is possible to rank order a set of profiles in terms of the adequacy with which they are summarized by a single score, and that as a result, only a subset of the original profiles may require a qualitative analysis. The application of the procedure is illustrated with a random sample of 577 profiles from a population of 12, 314, which were presented for selection in{{to universities}} in Western Australia in 1986...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the motivations and influences on applicants applying {{to medical school}} and the alternative tertiary courses chosen by unsuccessful applicants. Background: Medicine is an increasingly popular career choice, {{with a large number}} of applicants for each medical school place. It requires specific skills, and the medical school selection processes attempt to identify applicants with the required skills. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey of 2, 150 applicants to the University of Adelaide Medical School course in 2007 was conducted, with an overall response rate of 51 % (1097 / 2150). Descriptive analysis was undertaken on applicant motivations for applying to medical school, influences on their application and alternative tertiary courses chosen by unsuccessful applicants. Logistic regression was used to determine which factors were associated with <b>different</b> <b>applicant</b> stages. Results: The most common motivations for applying to medical school were a desire to help others, an affinity for science and enjoying interacting with others. Compared with the unsuccessful group, successful applicants to medical school {{were significantly more likely to}} be motivated to study medicine by their enjoyment of science (OR, 4. 30) and interacting with people (OR, 5. 84). In contrast to the unsuccessful group, the successful group were more likely to have their application influenced by their local general practitioner (GP) (OR, 3. 65), perceived academic ability (OR, 2. 65) and the prospect of financial security (OR, 2. 62). Of the applicants who were unsuccessful in their application, 65 % (636 / 980) were accepted into an alternative tertiary course. Of these, 58 % (369 / 636) were accepted into a course in a health-related field, the most common health-related course being medical sciences (108 / 369). Conclusions: This study offers findings on the motivations and influences on applying to medical school for one cohort. While a large number of students may not be successful in their application, many maintain their interest in a career in health-related fields, indicating the sincerity of their motivations. This is important in terms of future workforce planning. C. M. Laurence, I. T. Zajac, D. A. Turnbull, K. E. Sumner & J. Flemin...|$|R

Ecological compensation actions are often criticised for having low levels of compliance: meaning that they are achieved only partially or not at all, while development activity proceeds with much greater certainty. Our research investigated compliance with 245 conditions relating to ecological compensation across 81 case studies across New Zealand under the Resource Management Act 1991.
