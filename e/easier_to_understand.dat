25|$|In a sense, {{improvements}} in FIR equalization using FFTs or partial FFTs leads mathematically closer to OFDM, but the OFDM technique is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and implement, and the sub-channels can be independently adapted {{in other ways}} than varying equalization coefficients, such as switching between different QAM constellation patterns and error-correction schemes to match individual sub-channel noise and interference characteristics.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{versions}} of this paradox that are closer to real-life situations and may be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> for non-logicians. For example, the barber paradox supposes a barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves. When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge.|$|E
25|$|The {{scheduling}} of {{the competition}} earlier during the domestic season was also designed to allow limited overs cricket to be played in two blocks - one for the One Day Cup {{and one for the}} T20 Blast. The aim of the England and Wales Cricket Board was to enable county players to develop white-ball skills more effectively, to allow preparation for England matches and to make the cricket schedule <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|E

25|$|A graph drawing {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the graph itself (the abstract, non-visual structure) as there are several ways to structure the graph drawing. All that matters is which vertices are connected to which others by how many edges and not the exact layout. In practice, it is often difficult to decide if two drawings represent the same graph. Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> than others.|$|E
25|$|Once in {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium, a system's properties are, by definition, unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium {{are much}} simpler and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> than are systems {{which are not}} in equilibrium. Often, when analysing a dynamic thermodynamic process, the simplifying assumption is made that each intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium, producing thermodynamic processes which develop so slowly as to allow each intermediate step to be an equilibrium state and {{are said to be}} reversible processes.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 {{revision}} of the phase descriptions, the WHO has retained {{the use of a}} six-phase approach for easy incorporation of new recommendations and approaches into existing national preparedness and response plans. The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> more precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1–3 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4–6 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.|$|E

25|$|Alterations to {{the laws}} of rugby union were trialled by {{students}} of Stellenbosch University in South Africa in 2006, and were adopted in competitions in Scotland and Australia since 2007, though {{only a few of the}} rules were universally adopted. The law variations are an attempt to make rugby union <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> by referees, fans and players, but the laws were controversial and far from being endorsed by all members of these groups. After a number of trials around half of the proposed changes were permanently added {{to the laws}} of the sport.|$|E
25|$|Piero della Francesca {{elaborated}} on Della Pittura in his De Prospectiva Pingendi in the 1470s. Alberti {{had limited}} himself to {{figures on the}} ground plane and giving an overall basis for perspective. Della Francesca fleshed it out, explicitly covering solids in any area of the picture plane. Della Francesca also started the now common practice of using illustrated figures to explain the mathematical concepts, making his treatise <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> than Alberti's. Della Francesca {{was also the first}} to accurately draw the Platonic solids as they would appear in perspective.|$|E
25|$|Émilie du Châtelet {{also made}} a {{translation}} of Newton's Principia into French. Unlike LeSeur and Jacquier's edition, hers was a complete translation of Newton's three books and their prefaces. She also included a Commentary section where she fused the three books into a much clearer and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> summary. She included an analytical section where she applied the new mathematics of calculus to Newton's most controversial theories. Previously, geometry was the standard mathematics used to analyse theories. Du Châtelet's translation is the only complete one to {{have been done in}} French and hers remains the standard French translation to this day.|$|E

25|$|Cost Management: As in {{any other}} fields of engineering, an {{application}} with good structural software quality costs less to maintain and is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and change in response to pressing business needs. Industry data demonstrate that poor application structural quality in core business applications (such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) or large transaction processing systems in financial services) results in cost and schedule overruns and creates waste {{in the form of}} rework (up to 45% of development time in some organizations). Moreover, poor structural quality is strongly correlated with high-impact business disruptions due to corrupted data, application outages, security breaches, and performance problems.|$|E
25|$|Nothing was fixed: A deity {{could be}} {{identified}} both as a honji and a suijaku {{in different parts of}} the same shrine, and different identifications could be believed to be true at the same time and place. The religious situation during the Middle Ages was, therefore, confused and confusing. Historians have tried to concentrate on the reformers of that age with a clear way philosophy and little interest in kami questions because they are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> The theory was ultimately beneficial to the kami, which went from being considered unilluminated outsiders to actual forms assumed by important deities. The ultimate expression of this shift is Ryōbu Shintō, in which Buddhist deities and kami are indivisible and equivalent like the two sides of a coin.|$|E
25|$|The Gini {{coefficient}} summarizes {{income inequality}} {{in a single}} number {{and is one of}} the most commonly used measures of income inequality. It uses a scale from 0 to 1 – the higher the number the more inequality. Zero represents perfect equality (everyone having exactly the same income), and 1 represents perfect inequality (one person having all income). (Index scores are commonly multiplied by 100 to make them <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.)</b> Gini index ratings can be used to compare inequality within (by race, gender, employment) and between countries, before and after taxes. Different sources will often give different gini values for the same country or population measured. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau's official Gini coefficient for the United States was 47.6 in 2013, up from 45.4 in 1993, the earliest year for comparable data. By contrast, the OECD's Gini coefficient for income inequality in the United States is 37 in 2012 (including wages and other cash transfers), which is still the highest in the developed world, with the lowest being Denmark (24.3), Norway (25.6), and Sweden (25.9).|$|E

25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side {{you can see the}} meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package just has to contain 1 software package. On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|E
25|$|As it was {{the first}} game on a new console, the {{development}} team was largely made up of people new to the series, including designers Akira Ohtani and Yuki Sakamoto. The capacity of the Wii U meant that more experimentation with graphics could be done. During the making of the game, the team watched a lot of scary online videos, along with studying lighting and the appearance of being wet. Alongside making a game for dedicated series players, they also added adjustments for new players, partly due to the multimedia developments that were underway. Among these changes were adding helpful gameplay features and creating more conversation cutscenes to make the story <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> The pace of gameplay was also made similar to an action game as opposed to previous entries. In addition, the flashback cutscenes were made to look grainy and low-quality compared to the present-day cutscenes. While they had initially been visually similar to rest of the game, part of the series' appeal was the fear evoked by unseen objects, so they added distortions. The shift onto more powerful hardware also enabled the team to incorporate more graphic scenes, which contributed to it receiving a higher CERO rating than previous titles. A mechanic being tested in the game was the necessity to keep dry, initially inspired by the sweating mechanic from Dead or Alive 5. While this was toned down, dampness being tied to the character's well being remained in the game as both a story and gameplay concept. This aspect was suggested by Ohtani.|$|E
500|$|The Naga Hex {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with the}} most prevalent dislike being its surface. Sean Buckley of Engadget disliked the Naga Hex because of its plastic surface and how {{the arrangement of the}} buttons on the side resulted in them feeling cramped. Brian Westover of PC Magazine said the hexagonal layout of the buttons made them <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and use, but felt the placement of them was sub-par. Westover said that after using the mouse for long periods of time, the surface becomes [...] "slick". The redesigned League of Legends version of the Hex was praised by Westover.|$|E
