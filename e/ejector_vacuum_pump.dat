40|$|With {{manufacturing}} facilities placing {{increased emphasis on}} operating costs and environmental protection, replacement of inefficient or wasteful process methods is being considered. In the past, the accepted method for drawing or maintaining a vacuum on condensers, process reactors, or equipment and processes requiring subatmospheric conditions, has been to utilize steam ejectors. Due to the inherent operating inefficiency and wastefulness of the steam ejector, coupled with the rapidly increasing cost of fuel to produce steam, it has become apparent that considerable savings in operating costs and reduction in thermal or water pollution {{can be achieved by}} replacing steam <b>ejectors</b> with mechanical <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps.</b> The liquid ring (sometimes called 'liquid piston') type of mechanical <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> is usually selected due to its ability to handle liquid carryover and condensibles in the suction stream.

40|$|Traditional {{technologies}} used {{to generate}} vacuum for steelmaking are steam <b>ejectors,</b> liquid ring <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> and systems combined of them. The steam ejector system has a capacity to generate a medium vacuum 101 kPa (1 atm) a 0, 1 Pa (0, 01 mbar), the liquid ring pumps only reach 3 kPa (30 mbar) and dried pump cover the range of 101 kPa (1 atm) até 67 Pa (0, 67 mbar), band required for use in secondary metallurgy and is the limit of this technology. In this work was realized {{a case study in}} the industrial sector that uses the vacuum generation through steam ejectors superheated at 250 ° C and 1, 2 MPa (12 kgf/cm 2). The vacuum is needed for removal of undesirable gases in the composition of the steel as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur which causes weakness in the crystalline structure. Currently there have been technological innovations for vacuum generation in applications in VD (vacuum degassing), vacuums until to 67 Pa (0, 67 mbar) and VOD (decarburization) for vacuums of 8 - 20 kPa (80 - 200 mbar).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a project funded by Regione Toscana aimed at {{reducing}} the power absorption of auxiliary devices in vehicles are presented. In particular the design, testing and application of a magnetorheological clutch (MR) is proposed, aimed at disengaging the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> which draws in air from the power-brake booster chamber, {{in order to reduce the}} device power absorption. Several clutch preliminary studies done to choose the clutch geometry and the magnetic field supply are illustrated. The final choice consisted in an MR clutch with permanent magnet, which satisfied size, torque and fail-safe specifications. The clutch characteristics, in terms of torque versus slip, were obtained experimentally for three different clutch prototypes on an ad-hoc developed test bench. As result of a preliminary simulation, a comparison between the power absorption of a current production <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> an innovative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> and both <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> coupled with the MR clutch is presented.

50|$|A vacuum is {{initially}} created by connecting a closed container to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> After achieving a vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> {{can be left}} running.

This is because the inner surfaces of the container release absorbed gases {{for a long time after}} the vacuum is established. The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced. Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher <b>vacuum</b> than the <b>pump</b> could achieve alone.
