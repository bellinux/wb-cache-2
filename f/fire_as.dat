5|$|Although the Advisory Board {{recommendations}} {{focused on}} wildlife and habitat management, they also touched upon the recreation of primitive, uncontrolled conditions. Revisiting fire ecology {{and the importance}} of fire, which had long been suppressed in national parks and other federal lands, the report recommended the use of prescribed <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> a cheap and natural tool for shaping the park environment.|$|E
5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine.|$|E
5|$|Following the game, some {{actions by}} Orange Bowl Committee {{officials}} came under <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> the Miami Herald revealed the nonprofit committee had {{spent millions of}} dollars on junket trips for college football administrators. The U.S. federal Internal Revenue Service subsequently began investigating the allegations. In its annual transition to new leadership, the Orange Bowl committee picked Goldman Sachs vice president Jeffrey T. Roberts to serve as its president for the 2012 game.|$|E

5|$|Ivan {{begins to}} recount {{the story of}} the Denial of Peter, in which Jesus foretells to Saint Peter that he will thrice deny Him before the next crowing of the cock. Peter follows Jesus upon His arrest and joins some workers in the yard {{standing}} around a <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> He is questioned. Thrice the workers suspiciously ask Peter if he knows Jesus and thrice he denies his acquaintance. A cock crows and Peter, realizing what he has done, weeps.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April 1945, when Soviet {{troops were}} within {{a block or}} two of the Reich Chancellery, Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule. Their bodies were carried outside to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol. The corpses were set on <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> the Red Army {{shelling}} continued. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.|$|E
5|$|The 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion {{lost some}} men to German <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> they descended and, {{once on the}} ground, had to fight {{their way to the}} {{battalion}} rendezvous.

By 12:00, they had taken all of their objectives, capturing over 100 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split {{could only have}} a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> possible, which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent to the engine room. This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5|$|The attacks at Maldegem and Ursel {{began at}} 08:30. Both I and II./JG 1 became {{involved}} in intense dogfights. III./JG 1 had lost only one aircraft over the target (and not to enemy fire). I./JG lost a further Fw 190 to friendly anti-aircraft <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> it {{made its way to}} Ursel. III./JG 1 lost at least two further Fw 190s to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Casualties could have been heavier, had the British anti-aircraft defences of Maldegem airfield not been removed in December.|$|E
5|$|The day was hot, 87°F (31°C) by one account, and humid, and the Confederates {{suffered}} {{under the}} hot sun and from the Union counter-battery <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of Seminary Ridge or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} seasons adapted one novel each.

5|$|The {{operation}} {{called for}} the Marine regiments to advance on the Somme-Py in a night attack. After successfully making this advance, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion's companies laid down a heavy suppressing <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> both the 4th Marine Brigade and French 4th Army stormed Mont Blanc. The companies stayed in place until relieved on 10 October 1918. The battalion was then reconstituted and moved to Camp Marchand. During its time at Marchand, command of the battalion passed to Major Matthew H. Kingman.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{warships}} of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and {{the primary}} means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile <b>fire,</b> <b>as</b> well {{as the use of}} inflammable materials such as Greek fire. Despite the fearsome reputation of the latter, it was only effective under certain circumstances, and not the decisive anti-ship weapon that the ram had been in the hands of experienced crews.|$|E

5|$|According to Dawlatshah, Abdollah-ibn-Tahir, an Arabicized Persian, and {{governor}} of Khorasan for the Abbasid caliphs, banned publication in Persian {{and by his}} order all the Zoroastrians were forced to bring their religious books to be thrown in the <b>fire.</b> <b>As</b> a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple and replacing it with a mosque.|$|E
5|$|According to {{box office}} {{analysis}} sites, the film set American records for highest gross {{in a given}} number of days for each of its first 12 days of release except for the seventh and eighth, where the record is narrowly held by Spider-Man 2. On its fifth day, it became the highest-grossing film of 2005, surpassing Hitch ($177.6million). The film earned $158.5million in its first four-day period, surpassing the previous four-day record held by The Matrix Reloaded ($134.3million), and joining Spider-Man, The Matrix Reloaded and Harry Potter and the Goblet of <b>Fire</b> <b>as</b> one the only films to make $100million in three days. In eight days, it reached the $200million mark (a record tied with Spider-Man 2) and by its 17th day, the film had passed $300million (surpassing the record of 18 days of Shrek 2). It was eventually the third-fastest film (after Shrek 2 and Spider-Man) to reach $350 million.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open <b>fire.</b> <b>As</b> the numbers in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E

5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she had missed Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had {{returned}} to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking {{in and out of the}} hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under <b>fire</b> <b>as</b> they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy <b>fire,</b> <b>as</b> it had been ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E
