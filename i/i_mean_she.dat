5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
500|$|While filming The Deceivers in Rajasthan, India, in 1987, Brosnan's wife Harris became seriously ill. She {{was later}} {{diagnosed}} with ovarian cancer and died on 28 December 1991 at age 43. Brosnan struggled {{to cope with}} her cancer and death. [...] "When your partner gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines {{and the way you}} view life, all this changes. Because you're dealing with death. You're dealing with the possibility of death and dying. And it was that way through the chemotherapy, through the first-look operation, the second look, the third look, the fourth look, the fifth look. Cassie was very positive about life. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss, and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children." [...] Harris had always wanted Brosnan {{to play the role of}} James Bond, and in 1995, four years after her death, Brosnan was given the role in GoldenEye.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{performed}} [...] "Disturbia" [...] on {{her three}} major tours: Good Girl Gone Bad (2007—09), Last Girl on Earth (2010—11) and the Loud Tour (2011). The song was added on the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour set list during the Australasian {{leg of the}} tour. It was the opening song, performed only after the intro on the tour. Rihanna also performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] on her second major concert tour, Last Girl on Earth Tour. The song was performed as the sixth track, after [...] "Fire Bomb". Rihanna performed a slower ballad remix tempo of the song, surrounded by three big four-legged insect monsters as she crawled {{on the floor to}} escape while singing it. About the performance Lisa Wilton from Calgary Sun commented that: [...] "Rihanna's goth side came out – and by 'goth side' <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>she</b> sang alongside dancers dressed as freaky, giant spiders – during the darker dancefloor anthem, 'Disturbia'." [...] On her Loud Tour, Rihanna performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] as second track, only after the opening song [...] "Only Girl (In the World)". Rihanna performed the song in a brightly colored sequined bikini, while partially been dragging on a moveable floor. Rob Williams from Winnipeg Free Press stated: [...] "Rihanna dropped her blue coat to reveal a jewel- encrusted bikini for 'Disturbia'. It was the first of numerous costume changes that showed off her fashion sense and plenty of skin." [...] Rihanna performed [...] "Disturbia" [...] at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the second song on the set list.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{that was}} so! I've prayed to God {{it might be}} so, Willie. I've prayed that he'd take pity on her--him, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she's</b> with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>she's</b> guilty? Oh dear no, not yet, I hope. <b>I</b> only <b>mean</b> that Osmond's very {{tiresome}} {{and that}} Lord Warburton, as I hear, {{is a great}} deal at the house. I'm afraid you're scandalised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{certainly}} immense. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>she's</b> {{the real}} thing. I believe the pale pink petals are folded {{up there for}} some wondrous efflorescence in time; to open, that is, to some great golden sun. I'M unfortunately but a small farthing candle. What chance in such a field for a poor little painter-man?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Although Riegel said {{it would}} be [...] "very painful" [...] to watch someone else portray Bianca, and that she would not want to watch, she later tweeted, [...] " [...] gets a new Bianca and she's super pretty! And, of course, by that <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>she</b> looks like me. I wish her the very best of luck, of course, and will be cheering her on {{along with the rest of}} the [...] fans." [...] Lind {{regarded}} this as a compliment, and was appreciative of the support.|$|E
2500|$|Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on [...] "(And She Said) Take Me Now", a {{song from}} his debut solo album Justified which was {{initially}} planned to be released as a single, commenting [...] "I wrote the chorus from a girl's perspective, and I just thought we should get a female on the part. Her name was the first that popped up in my head just because I love her voice. It sounds like feathers. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> sounds like an angel." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Monroe biographer, Sarah Churchwell, Monroe was [...] "persuaded to {{capitalize}} on her newfound celebrity by beginning an autobiography. It {{was born out of}} a collaboration with journalist and screenwriter Ben Hecht, hired as a ghostwriter..." [...] Churchwell adds that the truths in her story were highly selective. [...] "Hecht reported to his editor during the interviews that he was sometimes sure Marilyn was fabricating. He explained, 'When I say lying, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>she</b> isn’t telling the truth. I don’t think so much that she is trying to deceive me as that she is a fantasizer.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She wasn't {{the kind}} of a girl who flirts. By jinks! You should see her look right through the boys that used to try to walk home with her after prayer meeting. They never tried it a second time. She's a wonder that way. One strange thing about her, she never acts like other girls. You know what <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>She's</b> different. She's going to be a singer, and travel around giving concerts--she told me so once." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eighty-seven years old. She can't travel. She has terrible {{osteoporosis}} so she can't fly, but, you know, she {{has been}} the rock of our family and she is sharp as a tack. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she's</b> just - she follows everything, {{but she has a}} very subdued, sort of Midwestern attitude about these things. So when I got nominated, she called and said, [...] "That's nice, Barry, that's nice".|$|R
6000|$|He {{hesitated a}} moment and then added: [...] "Would you--would you mind telling your sister--of course <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> when <b>she</b> is stronger--that I came to inquire after her?" ...|$|R
2500|$|His {{philosophy}} initially appeared moderate, {{but became}} increasingly conservative {{during the early}} stages of his presidential campaign in 2008. In a July 2005 appearance on Hannity & Colmes, Giuliani stated that having justices appointed with similar views on abortion to his own was [...] "not the critical factor." [...] He further stated that [...] "what's important [...] [...] [...] is to have a very intelligent, very honest, very good lawyer on the court. And [...] fits that category, in the same way Justice Ginsburg fit that category. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> was – she maybe came at it from a very different political background, very qualified lawyer, very smart person. Lots of Republicans supported her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{worked with}} Ryan Tedder, {{producer}} of her second single [...] "Bleeding Love", on the album's lead single [...] "Happy", written by Lewis, Tedder and Evan Bogart, and [...] "You Don't Care". Tedder commented, [...] "I pushed [...] vocally {{more on this}} song than any song she's ever done. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> did some stuff on [...] "Happy" [...] that's awesome, but this other song she takes it to another level." [...] The song [...] "Lost Then Found" [...] was also co-written by Tedder and Lewis along with Dan Muckala, Jess Cates and Lindy Robbins, and features Tedder's band OneRepublic. Another Tedder song, [...] "Shadows", was written with AJ McLean for the Backstreet Boys. After it {{failed to make the}} Backstreet Boys' album, Cowell wanted it for Lewis but then decided it better suited Westlife.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2007, she {{hosted the}} MTV Movie Awards. During her opening act, she {{commented on the}} {{upcoming}} jail sentence of Paris Hilton, {{who was in the}} audience, saying: [...] "In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like penises. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things." [...] In September 2007, she appeared at the MTV Video Music Awards. Following the comeback performance of Britney Spears, Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: [...] "Wow, she is amazing. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> is 25 years old, and she has already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not talk}} to me, Jonathan, like that," [...] she said. [...] "When I call her cross-grained <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>she</b> is running counter to her own happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, that's what <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>She's</b> got it right," [...] he exclaimed, after Katharine had restated his case, {{and made}} it more precise. The debate was left almost solely to Katharine and Ralph. They looked into each other's eyes fixedly, like wrestlers {{trying to see what}} {{movement}} is coming next, and while Ralph spoke, Katharine bit her lower lip, and was always ready with her next point as soon as he had done. They were very well matched, and held the opposite views.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also told}} about the {{recording}} of [...] "1 Night": [...] "I wanted to send Charli something that was poppier for me. But more of a left turn for her. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she's</b> a pop star and I'm not. You could say I make pop music, but there's something else going on there was well—it's not just brazen pop. But I thought it'd be fun to meet her halfway". [...] "Second 2 None" [...] was recorded in few takes, with Crossan adding Christine and the Queens' harmonies after production.|$|R
2500|$|... 20/20 {{also asked}} Black Swan editor Andy Weisblum for {{his take on}} the math. He responded that [...] "there are about 35 shots that are full body shots in the movie. Of those 35 shots, 12 are Natalie, {{and then the rest}} are Sarah. But over the overall film, Natalie did a lot more than that. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> did most of the other shots. It was {{sometimes}} hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close." [...] Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: [...] "He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." [...] Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: [...] "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her. And she was really focused on her character every day. I definitely think she deserves all the credit that she got with the Oscar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. But, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> {{knows you}} write to me, {{and she knows}} you write about Socialism and Literature and--things we have in common--things she hasn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say 'generously' because <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>she</b> hasn't, in any way, {{counted the}} cost. She'll have it to count, in a manner, now," [...] his hostess continued. [...] "But that doesn't matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> Frank. <b>She</b> is as sweet a girl as ever lived, {{and a perfect}} lady. But with a governess, unless you mean to marry her, you should be more careful than with another girl, because you may do her such a world of mischief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh?" [...] said Mr. Piper, in amaze, {{as he read}} slowly: [...] "’No—need—send—money—Uncle—Joseph—has—come—back.—Berry,’ What does it <b>mean?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>she</b> mad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{enjoy the}} {{satisfaction}} of knowing that she's about the handsomest girl out. As for me, I'd sooner have the widow. I beg your pardon, Mr. Greystock." [...] Frank merely bowed. [...] "Simply, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> because <b>she</b> rides about two stone lighter. It'll cost you something to mount Lady Tewett." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't quite {{describe}} what <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>She</b> {{seemed to make}} so much of me;--just as she might have done if I'd been some grand young lady down from London, or any, any;--you know what I mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} been a chuckle-headed king that, then," [...] grinned Dirk to himself. [...] "The mare's nose is as big as a buck-basket. But how can she be a princess, man,--prince, <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>she</b> has a foal running by her here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fitzpiers {{concluded}} {{from this}} that Winterborne {{had not seen}} him looking over the hedge. [...] "It might have been," [...] he said. [...] "She is quite a gentlewoman--the one <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>She</b> cannot be a permanent resident in Hintock or I should have seen her before. Nor does she look like one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> it. <b>She</b> is finished." [...] He {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} pityingly. [...] "A dozen haoles--I beg your pardon, white men--have lost their hearts to her {{at one time or}} another. And I'm not counting in the ruck. The dozen I refer to were haoles of position and prominence." ...|$|R

2500|$|During {{the festive}} season of December 2005 and January 2006, Cole joined the Tour de Force series of concerts in Iraq and [...] "across the Middle East" [...] for Australian Defence Force [...] "personnel serving in Operation Catalyst". Also {{performing}} at the concerts were Little Pattie (patron of Forces Advisory Council on Entertainment, which organised the tour's entertainers), Angry Anderson, Bessie Bardot, Hayley Jenson, and comedian Lehmo. They were {{backed by the}} Royal Australian Navy Band. Anderson later recalled [...] " [...] struck me from the beginning, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>she's</b> a born entertainer, and I thought, this chick is as funny as hell. The songs that she was singing, original tunes, and just funny and witty".|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] murmured Cecilia, [...] "that we don't know {{anything}} about her past." [...] And, seeing from the movement of his eyebrows that she was touching on what had evidently been a doubt with him, she went on with great courage: [...] "Where are her friends and relations? <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> may have had a--adventures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{woman whom}} I {{am happy to}} be able to {{recommend}} to you will not stand anything of that kind," [...] answered Mr. Cranley. [...] "She is quiet, but extremely firm, and has been accustomed to deal with a very desperate character. At one time, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> was engaged as the attendant of a person of treacherous and ungovernable disposition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Festing, {{who thought}} Helen {{did not know}} Charnock's {{dissipated}} habits, [...] "I imagine she'll keep him there, and that's something. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>she</b> won't let him sink below her level; Sadie's shrewd and determined. Then marriage is a problem to men like Bob farming the plains. Girls of the type they {{have been used to}} and would naturally choose couldn't stand the hardships." ...|$|E
6000|$|Croft {{had risen}} {{as if he}} were about to follow Mrs Null, or, at least, to see where she had gone. But Aunt Patsy stopped him. [...] "Jus' you stay h'yar one little minute," [...] she said, hurriedly. [...] "I got one word to say to you, sah." [...] And she stood up before him as erect as she could, fixing her great {{spectacles}} directly upon him. [...] "You look out, sah, fur ole miss," [...] she said, in a voice, naturally shrill, but now heavily handicapped by age and emotion, [...] "ole Miss Keswick, <b>I</b> <b>means.</b> <b>She</b> boun' to do you harm, sah.

6000|$|... "No, by no means. Her mother {{now would}} be the last to favour me. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> herself. If <b>she</b> loves me, as I hope and believe--nay, am sure--" ...|$|R
