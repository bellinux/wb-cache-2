6000|$|The {{marriage}} fell in evil days. In 1823, {{the bubble}} of the Golden Aunt's inheritance had burst. She died holding {{the hand of}} the nephew she had so wantonly deceived; at the last she drew him down and seemed to bless him, surely with some remorseful feeling; for when the will was opened, there was not found so much as the mention of his name. He was deeply in debt; in debt even to the estate of his deceiver, so that he had to sell a piece of land to clear himself. 'My dear boy,' he said to Charles, 'there will be nothing left for you. I am a ruined man.' And here follows for me the strangest part of this story. From the death of the treacherous aunt, Charles Jenkin, senior, had still some nine years to live; it was perhaps too late for him to turn to saving, and perhaps his affairs were past restoration. But his family at least had all this while to prepare; they were still young men, and knew what they had to look for at their father's death; and yet when that happened in September, 1831, the heir was still apathetically waiting. Poor John, the days of his whips and spurs, and Yeomanry dinners, were quite over; and with that incredible softness of the Jenkin nature, he settled down for the rest of a long life, into something not far removed above a peasant. The mill farm at Stowting had been saved out of the wreck; and here he built himself a house on the Mexican model, and made the two ends meet with rustic thrift, gathering dung with his own hands upon the road and not at all abashed at his employment. In dress, voice, and manner, he fell into mere country plainness; lived without the least care for appearances, the least regret for the past or discontentment with the present; and when he came to die, died with Stoic cheerfulness, announcing that he had had a comfortable time and was yet well pleased to go. One would think there was little active virtue to be inherited from such a race; and yet in this same voluntary peasant, the special gift of Fleeming Jenkin was already half developed. The old man to the end was perpetually inventing; his strange, ill-spelled, unpunctuated correspondence is full (when he does not drop into cookery receipts) of pumps, road engines, steam-diggers, steam-ploughs, and steam-threshing machines; and I have it on Fleeming's word that what he did was full of ingenuity - only, as if by some cross destiny, useless. These disappointments he not only took with imperturbable good humour, but rejoiced with a particular relish over his nephew's success in the same field. [...] 'I glory in the professor,' he wrote to his brother; and to Fleeming himself, with a touch of simple drollery, 'I was much pleased with your lecture, but why did you hit me so hard with Conisure's' (connoisseur's, QUASI amateur's) 'engineering? Oh, what presumption! - either of you or MYself!' A quaint, pathetic figure, this of uncle John, with his <b>dung</b> <b>cart</b> and his inventions; and the romantic fancy of his Mexican house; and his craze about the Lost Tribes which seemed to the worthy man the key of all perplexities; and his quiet conscience, looking back on a life not altogether vain, for he was a good son to his father while his father lived, and when evil days approached, he had proved himself a cheerful Stoic.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{an account}} of a visit by J and H Oldershaw to the island in 1826 and their reminiscences of Lord Seymour. They {{described}} him as an eccentric character and an old retired bachelor, who by accounts had not left the island for 20 or 30 years. They said that his normal attire of blue jacket and trousers, together with hobnailed boots, made him {{look more like a}} labourer, for which he was frequently mistaken. He would often work in hedges and ditches with his men and would even go into town in his <b>dung</b> <b>cart.</b> He would also play jokes on his visitors by pretending to be a labourer, whilst showing them around the estate. He was even known to accept money from them, which he would give to his servants, saying [...] "Here you are. I have got you something today!".|$|E
40|$|The West End of London was a {{long-lived}} élite residential district. One feature {{which helped}} to establish its privileged character was {{the protection of}} certain key boundaries with barriers impermeable to non-residential traffic. Public dislike of restrictions on movement hardened {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} into the lobbying of Parliament and the establishment of pressure groups. In the case of gates and bars across private streets, the most effective opposition came from local authorities and a number of prominent vestrymen. The paper shows change accelerated with the installation of the London County Council. Acts of Parliament in 1890 and 1893 sealed the fate of many street obstructions and significantly changed the balance of public and private space in London. Notice is hereby given that there is no public thoroughfare through this estate. That no cattle are allowed to be driven through this estate, to or from the New Cattle Market, Islington. That no tramps, vagrants, organ grinders, bands of musicians, or disreputable characters are permitted on the estate. That no railway vans, coal waggons, beer trucks or <b>carts,</b> furniture vans, <b>dung</b> <b>carts,</b> or other heavy traffic, are allowed to pass through the gates of this estate, unless they have to deliver or take up goods on the estate. That no hackney coaches are allowed on the estate, except going to or returning from the residence of any inhabitant, either to take up or set down.

5000|$|She asked unsuccessfully for the body, {{first at}} the side of the Sandwich, then from the {{commanding}} officer of the whole Nore fleet, Vice-Admiral Skeffington Ludwidge. She located the walled and secret graveyard where the Navy had buried her husband, recruited four other women to help her, dug up the coffin, got it over the wall, bribed a <b>dung</b> <b>cart</b> driver to bear it out of the military area, and had it taken to the Hoop and Horseshoe public house in London. Its presence in London led to long queues of people lining up to pay respects or satisfy their curiosity. The Duke of Portland, fearing a public funeral, had the body stolen, but word leaked out and crowds blocked the streets near the workhouse to which it had been taken. At this point, the Home Office succeeded in having the [...] "ex-president" [...] secretly buried at St. Mary Matfelon's church. Anne Parker, however, discovered the location, went to the church and succeeded in having the official Christian ritual for the dead performed.|$|E
