5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include <b>drip</b> <b>irrigation,</b> the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{technology}} of <b>drip</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{was invented in}} Israel by Simcha Blass and his son Yeshayahu. Instead of releasing water through tiny holes, blocked easily by tiny particles, water was released through larger and longer passageways by using velocity to slow water inside a plastic emitter. The first experimental system of this type was established in 1959 when Blass partnered with Kibbutz Hatzerim to create an irrigation company called Netafim. Together they developed and patented the first practical surface <b>drip</b> <b>irrigation</b> emitter. This method was very successful and had spread to Australia, North America and South America by the late 1960s.|$|E

The total amounts of water applied by the <b>drip</b> and porous-tube <b>irrigation</b> were both 6327777672740 f that by the furrow irrigation. There was no large difference in leaf area index (LAI) among the three irrigation methods with 7. 3 〜 7. 6 in the maximum LAIs, though the furrow irrigation plot showed smaller LAIs during the growing season. Every irrigation plot showed high yields, around 70 t ha^, with no significance among the irrigation methods. The furrow irrigation had 4. 5 g kg^ in total dry weight per total irrigated water (WUE) during the growing season.

5000|$|Under{{irrigation}} or irrigation giving {{only just}} enough {{water for the}} plant (e.g. in <b>drip</b> line <b>irrigation)</b> gives poor soil salinity control which leads to increased soil salinity with consequent buildup of toxic salts on soil surface in areas with high evaporation. This requires either leaching to remove these salts and a method of drainage to carry the salts away. When using drip lines, the leaching is best done regularly at certain intervals (with only a slight excess of water), so that the salt is flushed back under the plant's roots.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Drought {{stress is}} one of the main {{problems}} in agricultural productions in arid and semiarid regions such as Iran. Lack of water influences on most of plant physiological processes such as photosynthes, cellular development and uptake and transmission of nutrients in plants. Some approaches such as selection of resistance cultivars to drought stress, and selection of <b>dripped</b> <b>irrigation</b> have been applied in order to increase the irrigation efficiency. In recent years, biological approaches such as mycorrhizal symbiosis have been used to alleviate the detrimental effects of drought stress. Mycorrhizal symbioses increase the absorption of nutrients, especially phosphorus, and reduce the adverse effects of environmental stresses. It can also improve the host plant growth and yield. The percentage of mycorrhizal dependency of host plants depends on different environmental factors (such as light intensity, temperature, soil conditions), as well as morphological and physiological characteristics of plants. 1 n 2010, a greenhouse pot experiment was conducted at University of Agriculture and Natural Resources Ramin. The effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on root morphology of three leek genotypes and uptake of phosphorous, calcium and potassium in shoot and root were studied. Materials and Methods: The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design consisting of a 3 × 3 × 2 factorial combination.

40|$|The {{research}} {{objectives were}} to develop block emitter having S, Y, and Phi types suitable for high pressure condition in <b>drip</b> <b>irrigations</b> {{system and to}} test and compare the discharge {{for each type of}} emitter in the laboratory. Stages in this research were as follows: 1) designing block type of emitter; 2) developing of block structure media; 3) developing structure block; 4) installing and testing the emitter in the laboratory; and 5) Analyzing data. Results of laboratory test showed that the average discharge for each emitter Phi, S, and Y were 0. 2; 0. 08; and 0. 1 ml/sec, respectively. The highest discharge was found on the Phi structure, while the discharge for S and Y structures were similar. The variability of discharge due to structure design in each emitter had different effect in reducing of pressure. Technical evaluations showed that type of Y structure was simpler to develop than the two other structures. Phi style was the most difficult one to be developed. The main reason was related to the complexity in making structure pattern in the block of emitter. Recommendation for applying emitter was strongly influenced by crop and soil type. Crop which needs high water and planted in the high porosity soil may use emitter with small discharge for long time application. On the other hand, the soil with heavy soil texture may use the high discharge emitter for short time application...|$|R

25|$|Historically, flood {{irrigation}} {{was the most}} common method used, whereby large amounts of water are allowed to run across flat vineyard lands. While this method may have been an unwittingly preventive measure against the advance of phylloxera, it does not provide much control for the vineyard manager to limit yields and increase potential quality in the wine grapes. Subsequently, a method of furrow irrigation was developed whereby water is funneled into furrow channels that the vines are planted in. While providing a little more control, this method was still more suited to producing high yields. In the late 1990s, <b>drip</b> <b>irrigation</b> started to become more popular. Though expensive to install, this method provides for the maximum level of control by the vineyard manager to facilitate yield control and increase potential quality in the grape by leveraging water stress on the vine.|$|E

25|$|The Andes {{also provide}} a ready source of {{irrigation}} which was historically done in flood plain style. Chilean vineyard owners would dig canals throughout their vineyards and then flood the entire surface area with water allowing some to seep {{into the ground and}} the run off to be funnel away through the canals. This encouraged excessive irrigation and high yields which had a negative effect on quality. During the wine renaissance of the 1980s & 1990s more vineyards converted to <b>drip</b> <b>irrigation</b> system which allowed greater control and helped reduce yields. The soil composition of Chile's vineyards varies from the clay dominated landscapes of Colchagua, which is thus heavily planted with the clay-loving Merlot, to the mixture of loam, limestone and sand found in other regions.

25|$|In {{addition}} to providing water for plant growth and development, irrigation systems {{can also be used}} for alternative purposes. One of the most common is the dual application of fertilizer with water in a process known as fertigation. Commonly used in <b>drip</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems, this method allows similarly regulate control over how precisely how much fertilizer and nutrients that each vine receives. Another alternative use for sprinkler irrigation systems can occur during the threat of winter or spring time frost. When temperature drop below 32°F (0°C), the vine is at risk of developing frost damage that could not only ruin the upcoming years harvest but also kill the vine. One preventive measure against frost damage is to use the sprinkler irrigation system to coat the vines with a protective layer of water that freezes into ice. This layer of ice serves as insulation keeping the internal temperature of the vine from dropping below the freezing mark.|$|E
