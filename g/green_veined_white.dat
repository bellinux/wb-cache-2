The same style characterizes the domes of the prayer hall. The mihrab is made of <b>veined</b> <b>white</b> marble, red porphyry and green diorite.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculptured}} bronze door at {{the base}} of the monument, now kept locked, was originally open to visitors. Currently, the interior is open one day annually at Openhousenewyork. The interior is entirely revetted with the same <b>veined</b> <b>white</b> marble used on the exterior. The interior is in two stages, with six niches in the lower stage, corresponding to the exterior basement, and an upper stage of tall Corinthian pilasters flanking plain panels; above is a ribbed interior dome with a central lantern. The mosaic on the floor is a star centered on a bronze relief medallion of the US arms, with crossed oak and laurel sprays.|$|R

6000|$|... § XXXIV. On these russet or crimson {{backgrounds}} {{the entire}} {{space of the}} series of windows was relieved, for the most part, as a subdued white field of alabaster; and on this delicate and <b>veined</b> <b>white</b> were set the circular disks of purple and green. The arms of the family were of course blazoned in their own proper colors, but I think generally on a pure azure ground; the blue color is still left behind the shields in the Casa Priuli {{and one or two}} more of the palaces which are unrestored, and the blue ground was used also to relieve the sculptures of religious subject. Finally, all the mouldings, capitals, cornices, cusps, and traceries, were either entirely gilded or profusely touched with gold.|$|R
5000|$|... "Allium diabolense" [...] grows from a reddish-brown bulb {{just over}} a {{centimeter}} long. It produces a stem up to 20 centimeters tall and one leaf which is longer than the stem. The inflorescence contains up to 50 dark <b>veined</b> pink-tinted <b>white</b> flowers. Anthers and pollen are yellow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} is a head {{of several}} flowers blooming in a cup of <b>green</b> and purple <b>veined,</b> translucent bracts. The purple flowers are just over a centimeter long.|$|R
50|$|Inside, two {{connected}} lobbies {{parallel the}} main facades. An original glazed aluminum vestibule {{on the main}} entrance, and a small marble lobby on the secondary, {{give way to a}} terrazzo floor, dark green marble base and <b>veined</b> <b>white</b> marble dado. The plaster walls are divided into four recessed bays flanked by marble pilasters, rising to a ceiling cornice with classical detailing. While the furniture in the lobbies is newer, most of the teller windows and the iron grillework above them, and some of the post office boxes, are original.At either end of the lobby is a mural by Waldo Peirce, both with regional themes. The eastern one depicts Rip Van Winkle and the west one is called Legends of the Hudson. Peirce did very few public commissions, and only two other U.S. post offices (in Westbrook, Maine and Peabody, Massachusetts) have murals by him.|$|R
50|$|Some members Pieris are {{threatened}} by the rapid spread of some plants in the Brassicaceae such as the way the highly-invasive (in North America) garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata, kills the larvae of Pieris oleracea (the mustard white) and Pieris virginiensis (the Virginia white). Given the large differences between the chemicals that garlic mustard creates, versus those of mustards native to North America, {{it is likely that}} it is also is lethal to other members of Pieris that are native to North America. It is listed as a suitable food plant for the Eurasian <b>Veined</b> <b>white</b> (Pieris napi). Having not evolved with garlic mustard, the aforementioned American butterflies lay eggs on it, confusing it with their host plants due to a similar odor. Just because butterflies are members of Pieris does not mean they are all capable of feeding on the same members of Brassicaceae that other members of Pieris can feed on.|$|R
50|$|An insect {{survey found}} {{a wide variety}} of unusual insects, {{including}} rare solitary wasps. The site has a notable variety of grasshoppers and crickets. The most notable find was a rare species of chafer beetle last seen in Britain in the 1950s in Cheshire. Lesser stag beetles are common and volunteers are encouraging the Great stag beetle by building loggeries. Site volunteers leave logs in place to provide habitats for insects and fungi. A fine insect house has been built to provide winter homes for insects such as Ladybirds, Lacewings & Butterflies. There are also Bee nesting boxes. Butterflies include Peacock, Comma, Meadow brown, Small heath, Small skipper, Essex skipper, <b>Green</b> <b>veined,</b> Large and Small white, Small copper, Brimstone, Holly blue, Common blue, Speckled wood and Gatekeeper. Amongst moths Narrow-bordered Beehawk moth and Burnet moth have been recorded. An unwelcome recent arrival has been the Harlequin ladybird, which is a threat to native ladybird species. A spectacular new arrival {{in recent years has been}} the Wasp spider. Yellow meadow ants make distinctive mounds in the meadow.|$|R
50|$|The {{lobby is}} divided into two areas: a postal lobby in the {{original}} portion of the building and a public lobby {{that is part of the}} 1934 addition. In the postal lobby, verde (green) marble pilasters (attached columns) with scrolled Ionic capitals decorate the walls. The floors are terrazzo with brass dividers and verde marble borders. The same marble is used for the wainscot. Heavily <b>veined</b> <b>white</b> marble veneer covers the upper portions of the walls. The ornate ceiling is executed in plaster and features beams that divide the ceiling into distinct panels. Each panel is outlined with a dentil course and egg-and-dart decorative molding. A decorative band called a guilloche with floral patterns also defines each panel. The centers each have a plaster medallion outlined with an acanthus leaf design. Cylindrical brass light fixtures descend from the centers of the panels. Original octagonal postal tables that sit upon verde marble bases remain in the lobby. Decorative finishes and details in the public lobby are similar to those in the postal lobby and provide continuity to the interior. However, ceiling panels in the public lobby are less ornate.|$|R
5000|$|Begonia sutherlandii, {{known as}} the Sutherland begonia and as iwozya in Kimalila, Tanzania, is a {{tuberous}} flowering perennial plant in the family Begoniaceae, growing to 0.5 m with fleshy pink stems from 10 to 80 cm long. Leaves are commonly dark <b>green</b> and <b>veined</b> with red and covered with short hairs on the underside. They are asymmetrical in shape and the margin is toothed. Flowers, produced in pendent panicles throughout summer, are 20 - 26 mm in diameter, and are usually orange or orange-red with yellow anthers.|$|R
50|$|Gaspéite {{presence}} in the geologic environment {{may be used as}} an ore mining indicator of nickel rich minerals nearby. Gaspéite stones are used for carving ornamental objects and animal figurines, and are also cut and polished into attractive apple <b>green</b> color (often <b>veined)</b> cabochons for jewelry use.|$|R
50|$|The giant pepper vine is a {{vigorous}} and rapid-growing climbing plant with stems which become woody {{and covered in}} rough, grey bark. At its greatest development, the woody vine stem can be 40 cm thick at the base, and may reach 30-40 metres in length. Of a great age, length and weight. Curtains of leaves may be seen suspended from large rainforest trees. Its thin juvenile leaves measure 8 by 8 cm and are ovate. Also ovate, the mature, or sun, leaves are thicker and larger, and are deep <b>green</b> and <b>veined,</b> and measure 12 cm by 8 cm.|$|R
2500|$|The {{evergreen}} {{leaves are}} alternately arranged and pinnately lobed. The leaflets are bright <b>green,</b> elliptic-ovular, pinnately <b>veined,</b> {{and less than}} [...] in length. The branches droop from a single, central trunk as the tree matures, and are often pruned in agriculture to optimize tree density and ease of fruit harvest. At night, the leaflets close up.|$|R
60|$|Room {{was made}} for the two ladies, by the men who knew Miss Mohun, to push forward, so as to have a clearer view of the broken wall and roof of the stable, and the great ruddy blue and <b>white</b> <b>veined</b> mass of {{limestone}} rock, turf, and bush adhering to {{what had been the}} top.|$|R
50|$|It has greyish green leaves(that are {{slightly}} glaucous), which {{grow up to}} between 35-70 cm long (18-24inches), and 5-10mm wide. There are up 6 leaves per stem, they are linear, flat and very clearly <b>veined</b> with a <b>white</b> margin along the edges. They emerge in early winter and reach their full length after two months.|$|R
50|$|Carex leptalea is {{a species}} of sedge known by the common names bristly-stalked sedge and flaccid sedge. It is native to much of North America {{including}} most of Canada, the Dominican Republic, and the United States. It only grows in wetlands. This sedge produces dense clusters of thin stems up to 70 centimeters tall from a network of branching rhizomes. The thin, deep green leaves are soft, hairless, and sometimes drooping. The inflorescence is up to 16 millimeters long but only 2 to 3 millimeters wide, and is yellow-green in color. There {{are only a few}} perigynia on each spikelet, and they are <b>green</b> and <b>veined.</b>|$|R
60|$|With {{these two}} kinds of brick, the builder {{employed}} five or six kinds of marble: pure <b>white,</b> and <b>white</b> <b>veined</b> with purple; a brecciated marble of white and black; a brecciated marble of white and deep green; another, deep red, or nearly {{of the color of}} Egyptian porphyry; and a grey and black marble, in fine layers.|$|R
5000|$|Dorycnium hirsutum is a low-growing plant {{reaching}} {{on average}} 20 - 50 cm of height. This woody sub-shrub is erect, green, hairy and branched. The silver leaves are sessile, alternate and quite fuzzy. Flowers are <b>white</b> <b>veined</b> pinkish-red, in terminal umbels composed of four {{up to ten}} flowers. The flowering period extends from May through July. Fruits are cylindrical reddish brown seed pods.|$|R
50|$|The Heptanomis is {{remarkable}} for its quarries {{of stone and}} its rock-grottoes. Besides the Alabastrites, we find {{to the north of}} Antinoë the grottoes of Beni Hasan, the Speos Artemidos of the Greeks. Nine miles lower down are the grottoes of Kom el-Ahmar, and in the Arabian desert, on the east, quarries of the beautiful <b>veined</b> and <b>white</b> alabaster, which the Egyptians employed in their sarcophagi, and in the more delicate portions of their architecture. From the quarries of Tourah and Massarah, in the hills of Gebel-el-Mokattam, east of Memphis, they obtained the limestone used in casing the pyramids. The roads from these quarries may still be traced across the intervening plain.|$|R
2500|$|The album {{expanded}} on L.D. 50, with a {{wider range}} of riffs, tempos, moods and vocals. Because of this experimentation, Entertainment Weekly called this album more [...] "user-friendly" [...] than its predecessor {{and it was one of}} 2002's most acclaimed heavy-metal albums. The music video for the single [...] "Not Falling" [...] demonstrated the Mudvayne's change in appearance from L. D. 50, with the musicians transformed into <b>veined</b> creatures with <b>white,</b> egg-colored bug eyes.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{surfaces of}} the 21-story building at 75 Federal consists of low relief figurative and floral bands on street level floors. The exterior also features bronze panel sculptures depicting finance, architecture and sculpture, agriculture, power and transportation. The interior features an art deco inspired lobby features black and buff terrazzo floors inset with marble, dark <b>green</b> and richly <b>veined</b> red marble walls and piers and ornate bronze decorations.
