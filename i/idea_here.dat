25|$|The {{presence}} of ground permafrost {{is important to}} the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal Science ("Disappearing Arctic Lakes", June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to drain away into the ground.|$|E
25|$|Granger Morgan et al. (2009) {{suggested}} {{two related}} decision-making management strategies {{that might be}} particularly appealing when faced with high uncertainty. The first were resilient strategies. This seeks to identify a range of possible future circumstances, and then choose approaches that work reasonably well across all the range. The second were adaptive strategies. The <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is to choose strategies that can be improved as more is learned as the future progresses. Granger Morgan et al. (2009) contrasted these two approaches with the cost–benefit approach, which seeks to find an optimal strategy.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{temporal}} probabilistic models such as {{the hidden}} Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model {{the correlations between the}} activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data. The core <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have tended}} to {{emphasize}} {{different aspects of the}} process. Some have focused on renewal; Walter Jackson Bate points to the theme of each stanza including [...] "its contrary" [...] <b>idea,</b> <b>here</b> death implying, though only indirectly, the renewal of life. Also, noted by both Bate and Jennifer Wagner, the structure of the verse reinforces the sense of something to come; the placing of the couplet before the end of each stanza creates a feeling of suspension, highlighting the theme of continuation.|$|E
500|$|The {{essential}} <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is intuitive {{and probably}} qualifies as folk wisdom. [...] It was articulated by Kurt Vonnegut in his 1961 short story Harrison Bergeron. In Vonnegut’s futuristic dystopia, the Handicapper General uses {{a variety of}} handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. [...] A spectator at a ballet comments: [...] "it {{was easy to see}} that she was the strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men." [...] Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to [...] "waste" [...] more of some resource by trading it off for a bigger tail. This resonates with Thorstein Veblen's idea that conspicuous consumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth.|$|E

Also, Matthew Asher, from CANOE too, enjoyed the PPV but said the ultimate success of this Bound for Glory rests on the future storylines this event sets up.|$|E
500|$|After reading God of War #1, Joe Juba of Game Informer said [...] "If {{you have}} a choice between reading this comic and doing {{something}} else, you should do something else...like play God of War III again." [...] He said that the story adds nothing of value and it is rough. Despite being written by Marv Wolfman, he said the story does not satisfy fans of the video game series: [...] "I didn't think the story made much sense, and it doesn't contribute to the overall lore of the universe; it just seems to be setting Kratos up for another fetch-quest." [...] He also felt that the writing was exceptionally low in quality. Comic Vine said, [...] "The <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> screams comic books," [...] however, the [...] "results were a mixed offering." [...] The reviewer stated that the idea of Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a [...] "perfect comic book incentive," [...] however, things started to disintegrate when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear. A four out of five star review from Binary Messiah praised the comic series, saying that it could be made into a full game: [...] "That's one freaking awesome story. That right there is a premise to a whole new God of War game." [...] They said that it [...] "does a good job showing the hot headedness of Kratos and his selfishness." [...] Saying that the comics do the video game series justice, for fans of God of War, this should be in their comic collection.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{close-up}} shots of several items, including a soft-drink glass, {{a bottle of}} milk, marshmallows, and pages from a briefcase, falling onto the ground. A QR code, which was said to produce the word [...] "LOVE" [...] when scanned, can be seen printed on the glass and bottle, {{and on the ground}} during the scene of the marshmallows falling. In their analysis of the video, Popjustice commented that the falling objects convey an environment of excitement, saying: [...] "the general <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is that something exciting is happening and someone is so excited by the exciting thing that they have dropped their drink." [...] Several couples are shown removing their clothes, stripping down to their underwear, and proceeding to kiss and caress each other. Minogue then rises up from the inside of a [...] "mountain of writhing bodies" [...] and a flock of doves flies around them. Her attire consists of a black bra, similar to the one Madonna wore in the 1990 music video of [...] "Vogue", wore underneath a [...] "shredded" [...] white top coupled with white go-go boots and knee-pads. She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible {{standing in the middle of}} a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During of the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word [...] "higher". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons. The video ends with Minogue realising a dove in the air.|$|E

2500|$|There exists {{still another}} way to {{approach}} the fundamental theorem of algebra, due to J. M. Almira and A. Romero: by Riemannian geometric arguments.

2500|$|One more {{contrast}} to Gestalt psychological emphasis in neural binding {{was brought up}} by L. Chen. Chen asserts that the local-global idea of Gestalt does not suffice in explaining neural processing. Instead, Chen uses the idea that perception depends on [...] "topological invariants that describe the geometrical potentiality of the entire stimulus configuration".

2500|$|Karl Popper {{argues that}} a {{preference}} for simple theories need not appeal to practical or aesthetic considerations.

The <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is that a simple theory applies to more cases than a more complex one, and is thus more easily falsifiable.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to absolute oneness, al-Kindi also described God as the Creator. This means that He acts {{as both a}} final and efficient cause. Unlike later Muslim Neo-Platonic philosophers (who asserted that the universe existed {{as a result of}} God's existence [...] "overflowing", which is a passive act), al-Kindi conceived of God as an active agent. In fact, of God as the agent, because all other intermediary agencies are contingent upon Him. The key <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is that God [...] "acts" [...] through created intermediaries, which in turn [...] "act" [...] on one another – through a chain of cause and effect – to produce the desired result. In reality, these intermediary agents do not [...] "act" [...] at all, they are merely a conduit for God's own action.

2500|$|The {{restricted}} {{borders of}} the modern Greek state at its inception in 1830 disappointed the inhabitants of northern Greece (Epirus and Macedonia). Addressing these concerns in 1844, the Greek Prime Minister Kolettis addressed the constitutional assembly in Athens that [...] "the kingdom of Greece is not Greece; {{it is only a}} part, the smallest and poorest, of Greece. The Greek is not only he who inhabits the kingdom, but also he who lives in Ioannina, or Thessaloniki, or Serres, or Odrin" [...] He mentions cities and islands that were under Ottoman possession as composing the Great Idea (Greek: Μεγάλη Ιδέα, Megáli Idéa) which meant the reconstruction of the classical Greek world or the revival of the Byzantine Empire. The important <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is that for Greece, Macedonia was a region with large Greek populations expecting annexation to the new Greek state.

2500|$|The first, [...] "to repeat", seems {{connected}} with the punning phrase [...] "two rendered he" [...] and with the couplet's [...] "repetition."

These meanings join the tangled double entendres in [...] "Enter [...] Quietuses two [...] render thee" [...] to suggest such readings of line 12 as [...] "You're suffering melt-down over this couplet" [...] and [...] "Nature's two 'Quietuses' intrude here to depict you". Because an [...] "Audit" [...] was originally a [...] "hearing," [...] one ironic <b>idea</b> <b>here</b> is that something silent (like the missing couplet) can be [...] "heard" [...] and [...] "must be answered--or can be [...] "Anne's word."
