Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory.

The {{movie is}} about a man named Eddie (Lynch), who is hounded by social services and branded a paedophile after an innocent bathtime game with his children is taken out of context. About two years later and shortly before entering teenagehood, Thompson successfully auditioned to feature in the BBC children's comedy programme Stupid!. Out of around 400 hopeful youngsters, {{he was one of}} only a few to be selected to appear in the show.

500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E

Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A chronic {{condition}} {{does not}} just affect the individual diagnosed, {{but also their}} families. The process of adaptation, following the onset of symptoms, can be complex requiring flexibility from the family. This may be especially pertinent with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) which is characterised by unpredictable flare-ups and an uncertain disease trajectory. Families negotiating JIA may be at an increased vulnerability of distress {{as a result of}} additional demands placed upon their resources. This may have implications for health services. It is therefore important to understand family experiences of living with a chronic condition in order to support families throughout the adaptation process. To date, the majority of studies have investigated individual family members’ reports in order to assess family functioning, but these investigations have neglected to study the family as a unit. Method: This study utilised a multiple-perspective case study design in order to explore family experiences of JIA. Two families were recruited from a paediatric rheumatology service in Leeds. Family group interviews were conducted and five of the seven participating family members completed follow-up individual interviews, which used a semi-structured interviewing format. Interviews were transcribed and an interpretative phenomenological approach was used to analyse each case study. A synthesis of the results was also conducted. Results: Four master themes were identified from the first family interviews. These were: negotiating power, not letting go: managing transitions, when the invisible becomes visible and just <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Four master themes were also identified from the second family: a positive outlook, being ‘normal’, power and empowerment and medications: friend or foe. Analysis also focused upon how both families negotiated their understandings of JIA. Five themes were identified following a synthesis of the case study data. These were: Just <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and maintaining a sense of normality, battling, fighting and the negotiation of power, transitioning, JIA as a hidden condition and negotiating understandings. Discussion: The themes relating most significantly to the research aims: just <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and maintaining a sense of normality, battling, fighting and the negotiation of power and negotiating understandings, from the synthesised data were discussed {{within the context of the}} existing chronic health conditions and family communication literature. The study’s methodological strengths and limitations were also presented following the discussion of the themes. Clinical implications relating to families experiencing JIA and services providing care to these families was discussed throughout the discussion chapter, and finally, recommendations for further research were outlined...|$|R

[...] However, he felt the game did feature [...] "some genuinely disconcerting moments, an interesting story of demonic misadventure, some fairly ghastly sights and sounds, and some genuinely standout frights." [...] He further wrote [...] "Certainly it's been well designed in places." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Suffering has some scary moments, {{but for the most}} part they punctuate a fairly regular, albeit twisted, action game, rather than driving it [...] It's a shame, because The Suffering could have been great.

He's a very quick worker and once it's there he doesn't see why you can't record it. He let us <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> really. It was a good band". He was credited with production assistance, guitar, and backing vocals on this album, which became Morrison's best selling album at that time. He also contributed lead guitar and vocals to the promotional Wavelength tour which followed. The tour started in Santa Clara, California on 30 September 1978 and ended on 1 March 1979 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. By the end of the tour he had appeared in Morrison's lineup sixty two times.|$|E

This trend of using new technologies was continued with the use of MIDI synchronisation, aided by an Apple Macintosh computer.|$|R

2500|$|Leno faced heated {{criticism}} and increasing negative publicity for his perceived {{role in the}} timeslot conflict, with some critics predicting that his reputation—along with those of Jeff Zucker and NBC as a whole—had been permanently damaged by the incident. Critics pointed to the 2004 Tonight Show clip, wherein Leno claimed he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident. Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt {{was among the first}} celebrities to openly voice disappointment with Leno, saying, [...] "Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks;' it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation... willfully has shut the switch off." [...] Rosie O'Donnell has been among O'Brien's most vocal and vehement supporters, calling Leno a [...] "bully" [...] and his recent actions [...] "classless and kind of career-defining". Howard Stern was also a harsh critic of Leno before and following the timeslot change announcement; Stern appeared on Late Night in 2006, and told O'Brien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up Tonight to anyone. The 67th Golden Globe Awards, which aired on NBC during the heat of O'Brien's settlement negotiations on January 17, featured numerous jokes on the controversy by Tina Fey, Tom Hanks, and show host Ricky Gervais: [...] "Let's <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> before NBC replaces me with Jay Leno." ...|$|E
