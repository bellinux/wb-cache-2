So far the majority of genome wide studies have used {{a small number of}} cell lines giving a very restrictive representation of tissue specific gene transcripts. Because of the density and coverage of the HapMap SNP data and DNA availability from the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) for HapMap individuals, the majority of regulatory studies have been conducted in LCL cells (see for <b>example</b> (<b>Ge</b> et al. 2009; Stranger et al. 2005, 2007).

Treated variants of lettuce seeds showed a statistically significant increase in germination energy (GE) on the first day (GE 1, both water levels), but a significant decrease on the second day (columns GE 2, 15 ml). Higher doses of Agrisorb slowed lettuce seed germination (GE 2, 30 [*]ml, dose 5 [*]g) significantly, similarly see GE 2 (15 [*]ml, doses 1, 3, 5 g).

The main advantage is that the Indian innovation eco-system is endowed with huge reservoir of talented and highly skilled human resources together with market potential in ICT knowledge hubs in Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi National Capital Region, Pune and Hyderabad. Foreign firms were increasingly shifting their R&D and Global Development Centers in these regions. Now many foreign firms were moving to capture these markets and also to exploit the huge talent and knowledge pool.

30|$|Germanium (Ge) is {{considered}} to be a substitute for Si for future complementary metal-insulator-semiconductor devices because of its higher carrier mobility than silicon (Si) [1]. Although wet-chemical treatments are essential for the fabrication of Ge-based devices, they have not been well established yet. The primary reason for this is the chemical reactivity of Ge and its oxide (GeO 2) with various solutions. For <b>example,</b> <b>Ge</b> oxide (GeO 2) is permeable and soluble in water, unlike the more familiar silicon oxide (SiO 2). Ge surfaces are also not resistant to various chemical solutions. For example, a piranha solution (a mixture of H 2 SO 4 and H 2 O 2) is commonly used in removing metallic and organic contaminants on the Si surface. However, we cannot use it for Ge because it damages Ge surfaces very easily. Although in several earlier works, the etching property of Ge surfaces has been investigated [2, 3], the unique chemical nature of Ge prevents researchers from developing surface treatment procedures for Ge using solutions.|$|R
50|$|PSS {{has been}} used to create value for {{customer}} beyond selling products as functions. Typically, there are four approaches for PSS design. 1. Function-based PSS: add new functions to increase product value in the competing market. For example, GM added OnStar in 1992 to product emergency services for customers. It integrated GPS with vehicle sensory system for telematics-based on-demand services. 2. Value-added PSS: companies added new features to increase value of a product to expand its value to customers and users. Some earlier work on teleservice system has been done during the 1990s. For example, Otis Elevator added Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM) system to its fleet system to monitor their elevators to reduce failures. GE Healthcare (formerly GE Medical Systems) developed InSite to remotely monitor its medical equipment to reduce service costs and increase users benefits. 3. Evidence-based Service: companies use big data analytics to provide the actual saving and further develop a service contract for customer to pay for part of the saving. For <b>example,</b> <b>GE</b> Aviation Power By The Hour On-Wind Support system to reduce the fuel of aircraft engine and reduce maintenance costs through a Long-Term Service Contract (LTSC).|$|R

30|$|In MANETs, {{it is very}} {{important}} that DCA schemes be self-initialized and the system authority exists only at the beginning of the network startup. So, a number of schemes have been proposed that support this property, for <b>example,</b> <b>Ge</b> and Lam [14] present a self-initialized DCA or SDCA that combine the advantages of the DCA and certificate chain schemes. They claim that this scheme addresses the scalability of certificate chain and has low cost, high availability, and security. In this scheme, the participating nodes initialize CA with the self-initializing protocol (SIP). With this protocol, the fundamental parameters of the DCA, such as the total number of DCA members, threshold value, and list of DCA members, will be negotiated and agreed among a certain number of nodes. With these parameters, the DCA is then constructed collaboratively by the involving nodes and without a trusted dealer. Another scheme for self-initialized DCA in ad hoc network is introduced by Kang et al. [15]. Their scheme uses proxy and threshold signatures. In this scheme, chair nodes that can distribute partial proxy keys for proxy nodes are authenticated by the system authority. In addition, proxy nodes that can issue certificates for other nodes are authenticated and initialized by the system authority or the chair nodes.|$|R

Through data rich applications with easy to use interfaces, these technologies bring personalized geospatial information directly to the non-specialist. When coupled with open geospatial data standards, such as Web Map Services (WMS), Web Features Services (WFS), and GeoRSS, the resulting web-based technologies {{have the potential to}} assimilate heterogeneous data from distributed sources rapidly enough to support time-critical activities such as crisis response. Although the ability to view and interact with data in these environments is important, this functionality alone is not sufficient for the demands of crisis response activity. For <b>example,</b> <b>GE’s</b> standard version currently lacks geoanalysis capabilities such as geographic buffering and topology functions. In this paper, we present development of the “Google Earth Dashboard ” (GED), a web-based interface powered by open geospatial standards and designed for supplementing and enhancing the geospatial capabilities of GE. The GED allows users to create custom maps through WMS layer addition to GE and perform traditional GIS analysis functions. Utility of the GED is presented in a use-case scenario where GIS operations implemented to work with GE are applied to support crisis management activities. The GED represents an important first step towards combining the ubiquity of GE and geospatial standards into an easy-to-use, data rich, geo-analytically powerful environment that can support crisis management activity...|$|R

30|$|Most {{existing}} industrial {{tools that}} are placed inside pipelines for ultrasonic inspection adopt acoustic beams propagating at normal incidence, which {{is suitable for}} inspecting the flaws caused by changes in the pipe wall thickness. However, these methods are insensitive to cracks, particularly small cracks. In light of this shortcoming, numerous ultrasonic inspection tools {{have been developed for}} improving inspection performance. For <b>example,</b> <b>GE</b> has developed a tool, called UltraScan Duo, with an ultrasonic phased array transducer for inspecting defects in pipe walls, including cracks and defects caused by changes of thickness [7]. The UltraScan Duo can detect cracks that are at least 1  mm deep and 25  mm long [8, 9]. However, the UltraScan Duo requires a CPU to control its phased-beam forming accurately to obtain the best beam characteristics, which complicates matters. A pipeline inspection tool from the German company ROSEN uses an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT); this tool is named RoCD EMAT-C. It is specialized for pipeline crack and anticorrosive coating inspection; it can detect cracks that are at least 1  mm deep and 40  mm long [9 – 12]. However, its sensitivity level is lower than those of other ultrasonic inspection methods. Another ultrasonic pipeline crack inspection tool, called EVO Series UC 1.0, developed by the German NDT Global Company, can detect cracks that are at least 1  mm deep and 40  mm long [13 – 15]. However, the transducers on the EVO Series UC 1.0 are mounted on a pigging tool and operate at a circumferential angle of incidence, which is limited to the detection of transversely oriented cracks.|$|R
