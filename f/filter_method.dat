2500|$|There is {{only one}} <b>filter</b> <b>method</b> in the current PNG {{specification}} (denoted method 0), and thus in practice the only choice is which filter type to apply to each line. [...] For this method, the filter predicts the value of each pixel based on the values of previous neighboring pixels, and subtracts the predicted color of the pixel from the actual value, as in DPCM. An image line filtered {{in this way is}} often more compressible than the raw image line would be, especially if it is similar to the line above, since the differences from prediction will generally be clustered around 0, rather than spread over all possible image values. This is particularly important in relating separate rows, since DEFLATE has no understanding that an image is a 2D entity, and instead just sees the image data as a stream of bytes.|$|E
