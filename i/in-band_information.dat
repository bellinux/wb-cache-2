For a NRZ system to be synchronized using <b>in-band</b> <b>information,</b> there must not be long sequences of identical symbols, such as ones or zeroes.

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive radios {{are being}} {{proposed}} for recovering unused spectrum holes {{in time and}} space. Unfortunately the metric of detection-sensitivity while being useful for algorithm designers is not indicative of a system’s ability to recover spectrum holes (especially spectrum holes in space). In this paper we extend the safety and performance metrics of Fear of Harmful Interference (FHI) and Probability of Finding a Hole (PF H) from single primary on a single tower to multiple primaries on multiple towers. We show how a simple multiband algorithm which dynamically computes the detection threshold based on sensed power in multiple bands can recover significantly more area than a singleband detector which makes decisions based on <b>in-band</b> <b>information.</b> Effectively Multiband detection acts {{as a proxy for}} increasing the number of users.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{wireless}} data collection, a common application class in wireless sensor networks, this paper presents a novel, non-intrusive algorithm for the precise reconstruction of the packet path, the per-hop arrival order and the per-hop arrival times of individual packets from partial <b>in-band</b> <b>information</b> at runtime. Information is reconstructed outside the network immediately after a packet is received at the sink. After establishing the correctness of our proposed algorithm, we evaluate its performance in testbed experiments using CTP and Dozer, two well-known data collection protocols. Foremost interested in obtaining {{a better understanding of}} the performance of long-term real-world deployments, Multi-hop Network Tomography (MNT) is applied to in total more than 140 million packets that have been obtained from three multi-year WSN deployments of the PermaSense project. The capabilities of the performance analysis of deployed systems using the proposed algorithm and methodology are demonstrated in a case study...|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} {{channel coding}} scheme for Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) speech transmission over mobile radio channels is proposed. Although {{it was developed}} for the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), the basic concept of variable channel coding can be adopted to other digital radio systems. The new AMR concept allows almost wire-line speech quality even for poor channel conditions by dynamically splitting the gross bit rate between source (speech) and channel coding according to the channel quality. In this study we show some new aspects relating to AMR and show the advantage of recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) codes for mobile speech transmission. With some modification they improve not only the bit error rate but also the frame erasure rate. It is derived that RSC codes can be decoded with a "standard" non-systematic Viterbi decoder and a simple transformation. A new powerful approach is employed {{for the detection of}} the currently used mode (<b>in-band</b> signaled <b>information)</b> where the mode bits are integrated in a long block and codes gain with their length...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{nature of}} human {{mobility}} demands that mobile devices become agile to diverse operating environments. Coping with such diversity requires the device to assess its environment, and trigger appropriate responses to each of them. While existing communication subsystems rely on in-band wireless signals for context-assessment and response, we explore a lateral approach of using out-of-band sensor information. We propose a relatively novel framework that synthesizes <b>in-band</b> and out-of-band <b>information,</b> facilitating more informed communication decisions. We believe that further research in this direction could enable {{a new kind of}} device agility, deficient in today’s communication systems. Since such a framework is located at the boundaries of mobile sensing and wireless communication, we call it sensor assisted wireless communication. I...|$|R
40|$|We present two all-optical packet {{switching}} techniques that utilize all-optical signal processing {{to implement the}} label processor and the label rewriter. The two techniques are based on two different paradigms. One is based on wavelength routing switching [1] {{and the other one}} on space routing switching [2]. Both techniques employ scalable and asynchronous label processor and label rewriter capable to process optical in-band labeling addresses. We demonstrate a 1 × 4 all-optical packet switch based on both techniques. We report for both technique experimental results showing the routing operation of the 160 Gb/s packets based on the processed <b>in-band</b> address <b>information,</b> and all-optical label erasing and new label insertion operation. Based on the experimental results, we discuss and compare both techniques in term of devices and bit-rate scalability, latency, power consumption, power penalty performance and cascadability as key parameters for the realization of an all-optical {{packet switching}} node. 1. RESULTS Figure 1 illustrates the input packet format. The input packets consist of a 160 Gb/s payload, with a pulse duration of 1. 6 ps making the 20 dB bandwidth of the payload to be 5 nm. The packet address information is encoded by in-band labels. With this we mean that the wavelengths of the labels are chosen within the bandwidt...|$|R
40|$|For packet-switched metro networks, {{one of the}} key {{functional}} blocks is the transmission, extraction {{and update}} of <b>in-band</b> packet control <b>information,</b> which is commonly known as packet label swapping. The use of phase modulation to carry the control information can facilitate easy swapping process. By combining phase modulated label with intensity modulated optical packets in non-overlapping manners, we demonstrated that optical packet label swapping using differential phase-shift keyed labels could be achieved without any sacrifices in packet signal quality. In packet-switched optical networks, packets are routed using IP-based distributed routing algorithms. Inconsistencies in routing information among routing nodes may result in routing loop formation in the network and may cause severe impact on the network performance. We proposed a novel packet routing loop mitigation scheme based on the principle of packet 'time-to-live' value countdown. This scheme enables loop mitigation to be performed asynchronously in optical domain, causing little packet processing delay. Two implementations were proposed. One was based on differential optical phase shift keying and the other was based on self-phase modulation in semiconductor optical amplifier. The continuous increase in Internet-bound data traffic in recent years has placed higher requirement on network bandwidth and flexibility. In view of this, packet-switched metro networks and broadband passive optical access networks have emerged as the promising network solutions in the near future. The focus of this thesis is on the improvement of functionality and reliability as well as the reduction of system complexity in optical metro area and access networks with the use of optical phase modulation techniques. In access network, constant-intensity optical phase modulation formats were studied for their applications in wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical networks with centralized light source. Using them as downstream modulation formats, the downstream optical carrier can be utilized to carry upstream intensity-modulated data. It can greatly simplify upstream transmission and facilitate network management. Experimental and numerical analyses shows promising upstream re-modulation performance with a simple optical network unit (ONU) configuration. Hung Wai. Adviser: Lian-Kuan Chen.
