5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet {{prototype}} for a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10. It featured a number of innovative concepts including a cockpit mounted {{on top of the}} engine, <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> propeller, and wing-mounted autocannon that could be adjusted on the ground to fire level or depressed 23° to allow the aircraft to strafe ground targets while remaining in level flight. However it was slower than the Il-10, and its M-47 engine was problematic in flight tests in 1948–49. It was not placed into production. The test pilots called the aircraft the Gorbach (Hunchback).|$|E

5|$|The hominid Australopithecus afarensis {{represents}} an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors. A number of traits of the A. afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism, {{to the extent}} that some researchers have suggested that bipedality evolved long before A. afarensis. In overall anatomy, the pelvis is far more human-like than ape-like. The iliac blades are short and wide, the sacrum is wide and positioned <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> hip joint, and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for the knee extensors, implying an upright posture.|$|E
5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot see such a lovely thing every day, to which he replies: Indeed! indeed! clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha.

5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres {{paid attention to the}} Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. <b>Directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, on the {{northern}} flank, the 10th Division was much more successful. Instead of waiting for orders from General Żeligowski, the commanding officer of the 10th Division, Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée, started a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew. The 28th and 29th Kaniów Rifles Infantry Regiments managed to reach the village of Mokre, on a small hill overlooking Radzymin and the Białystok-Warsaw road, <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Russian lines. The Russians tried to push the Poles back from that position, but ultimately failed. Their assault on the village of Wiktorów also ended in failure. Soon the Polish positions in Mokre were secured, and further reinforced with {{the remainder of the}} 1st Battalion, 28th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|During the snatch {{phase of}} the event, Hale was given three {{attempts}} to lift as much weight as she could in snatches. She successfully lifted 74kilograms on her first attempt and 78 kilograms on her second, but failed to lift 82kilograms on her third and final try. The second and {{last part of the}} event included lifting weights using the clean and jerk method. Hale successfully lifted 95kilograms in this manner on her first attempt, but failed to lift 100kilograms on her second and third tries. Her combined score was 173kilograms. This placed the Solomon Islander at twelfth place of the twelve athletes in the event, <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Philippines' eleventh-place finalist Hidilyn Diaz (192kilograms), who in turn ranked behind Poland's tenth-place finalist Marieta Gotfryd (200kilograms).

5|$|North Korean troops {{promptly}} set up {{a roadblock}} <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> 19th Infantry's line in its main route of supply along the road {{near the village of}} Tuman, just south of Yusong on Taejon's western outskirts. The roadblock quickly became a serious problem for U.S. forces trying to move ammunition and wounded to and from the Kum River line. Around 13:00 on July 16, the 19th Infantry Regimental commander contacted Dean, who ordered him to break the roadblock. However, North Korean troops had {{set up a}}t least six machine-gun nests above the road at Tuman, and repeated attacks against it were unable to drive the North Korean troops away.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} {{on the night}} of 8 April, Group 5, with Blücher in the lead, passed the outer ring of Norwegian coastal batteries. Lützow {{followed}} <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> flagship, with Emden astern. Heavy fog and neutrality requirements, which required the Norwegians to fire warning shots, permitted the Germans to avoid damage. The Norwegians, including those manning the guns at the Oscarsborg Fortress were on alert, however. Steaming into the Oslofjord at a speed of , the Germans came into range of the Norwegian guns; the 28cm, 15cm and 57mm guns opened fire on the invaders. During the ensuing Battle of Drøbak Sound, Blücher was hit by many shells and two torpedoes. She quickly capsized and sank with the loss of approximately 1,000 sailors and soldiers. Lützow was hit three times by 15cm shells from Oscarsborg's Kopås battery, causing significant damage.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles first {{played a}} full show with Best on 17 August 1960 at the Indra club in Hamburg, {{and the group}} slept in the Bambi Kino cinema in a small, dirty room with bunk beds, a cold and noisy former {{storeroom}} <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> screen. Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as a depressing place filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best {{had been the only}} group member to study O-Level German at school, he could talk with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed due to complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.|$|E
5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E

5|$|Brigadier General Hafez, {{commanding}} the 16th Infantry Division, planned {{to contain the}} Israeli attack from the south by having the 18th Mechanized Brigade occupy defenses north of the Chinese Farm, <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> 16th Infantry Brigade, but without its organic tank battalion, which was designated {{as part of the}} division's reserve. The 1st Armored Brigade moved southward to occupy positions between Lateral Road and the canal on the right flank of the 18th Brigade. Upon the brigade's arrival, it engaged Israeli armor from Reshef's brigade in al-Galaa'; Egyptian armor destroyed around 15 tanks and several half-tracks. At around 1:00 PM, sorties of Egyptian Su-7s destroyed many Israeli tanks in ground-attack missions over al-Galaa' village. The 1st Brigade countered a flanking attempt on its left at 2:00 PM by a tank battalion, thwarting the attack and destroying ten tanks. During its engagements on October 16, the 21st Division managed to destroy over 50 Israeli tanks and APCs, while subjected to frequent Israeli air strikes and artillery barrages. The 1st Brigade accounted for most of the kills, while suffering fewer losses.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Saint Anselm {{became one}} of the {{institutions}} selected by the War Department for training of Army Aviation cadets. Thousands of young men were sent to the college to receive training and education before entering World War II. Cadets trained on large open fields which were located <b>directly</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> present-day Coffee Shop. The U.S. government paid the college for training the cadets, and after the war, the college acquired two prefabricated government buildings which have been transformed into the modern-day coffee shop and bookstore. During World War II, several members of the monastic community served as Army chaplains; their names are inscribed on a monument in front of Alumni Hall dedicated to all graduates who have served in the armed forces. Also inscribed on the monument is the Latin and English versions of the Benedictine community's song. For more information see Saint Anselm Abbey Community Song.|$|E
