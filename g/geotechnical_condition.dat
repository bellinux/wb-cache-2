40|$|Underground coal {{gasification}} (UCG) {{is believed to}} be one of the cleaner coal exploiting technologies for energy generation. In this study UCG is assessed as a technology for unlocking coal seams that are too deeply buried underground for extraction and those which are enclosed by complex geological settings making it impossible to extract using conventional mining methods. The assessment of the UCG technique was based on a desktop study from previous UCG trials globally. The objective of this study was mainly focused on considering factors which could be useful in the selection of potential UCG sites in South Africa. It was noted that the coal geology, coal properties, geological and <b>geotechnical</b> <b>condition</b> are crucial parameters to consider when selecting a UCG site. Three boreholes from the Highveld coalfield were used for the subsurface evaluation by means of geophysical wireline logging. Five coal samples from these borehole cores were studied using different characterisation techniques to understand the nature of coal and determine the coal properties suitable for UCG. The information acquired by wireline logging gave an insight into the geological and <b>geotechnical</b> <b>condition</b> of the area, and the properties of coal determined show some degree of suitability for UCG process in terms of their physical and chemical composition...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{has been}} used in cave mining for orebody rock mass pre-conditioning, following its successful application in the oil and gas industries. Cave mining hydraulic fracturing aims at creating a blocky orebody rock mass that should have more than two joint sets so that the orebody can cave under gravity with acceptable fragmentation sizes. The orientations of the current cave mining hydraulic fractures (HFs) are dictated by and are perpendicular to the minimum in-situ stress orientation. In some geotechnical conditions, these orientation-uncontrollable HFs have limited pre-conditioning efficiency because they do not necessarily introduce an additional joint set into the orebody rock mass. In this thesis, the concept of prescribed hydraulic fracturing is proposed to create prescribed hydraulic fractures (PHFs) that are not necessarily perpendicular to the minimum in-situ stress orientation in cave mining with the potential to introduce additional joint sets as desired. The creation of PHFs takes advantage of the stress shadow effect to modify the local stress state in the orebody rock mass and implements directional hydraulic fracturing practice to control the PHF initiation direction. The feasibility of prescribed hydraulic fracturing and the effects of various factors on the PHF trajectory are studied by numerical modelling. The ability of the numerical code used in this thesis, the realistic failure process analysis (RFPA) 3 D – flow version, is validated by re-producing the experimental results in previous studies. The validation shows the HF trajectory simulated by RFPA is realistic. The correlation between factors involved in prescribed hydraulic fracturing is studied by dimensional analysis. The established dimensionless relation between these factors is validated by numerical simulations and is used to evaluate the applicability of prescribed hydraulic fracturing in field conditions. The evaluation shows creating PHFs is practical if the operation parameters are properly designed according to the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>condition</b> of the given mine site. Two hydraulic fracturing matrices are developed. The matrices provide guidance on how to select the proper hydraulic fracturing strategy in a given <b>geotechnical</b> <b>condition</b> and reflect which factors or factors combinations impact the HF performance in each scenario. The application of the results of this thesis in the cave mining industry should lead to improved understanding of hydraulic fracturing strategies for pre-conditioning the orebody rock mass and increased confidence in the use of hydraulic fracturing as an efficient pre-conditioning method. Even though the new hydraulic fracturing strategy is developed based on orebody rock mass pre-conditioning in cave miming, it can also be applied to the coal mining industry for inducing hard roof caving...|$|E

The stability of a landfill relies on the shear strength of its elements and their settlement behaviour. Most of the landfill is made up of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), so the overall stability of the landfill slopes is governed by the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the MSW.

40|$|The {{application}} of reliability analysis in civil engineering {{is still an}} emerging technology, more so in geotechnical engineering {{and even more so}} in application to river dikes. However, much experience remains to be gained, recently, especially in European countries (the Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom 8 ̆ 5) {{as well as in the}} United States of America. This paper focuses, only, on the general framework of reliability analysis in geotechnical engineering design and an example for river dike reliability analysis is illustrated. Reliability analysis is related to some other terminology such as: risk assessment, probabilistic design 8 ̆ 5 etc but they all deal with analyzing the relevant uncertain parameters. Theoretically, the limit state function is defined as: Z = R-S; where: Z is the limit state function; R: strength; S: load. Both R and S combine many uncertainties, for instance, the inherent and epistemic uncertainty. The determination of the probability of function Z< 0 with random variables (uncertainty) is the goal of reliability analysis. In the light of reliability analysis, a river dike ring is examined as a series system with many dike sections which have similar characters (geometry, <b>geotechnical</b> <b>condition,</b> protection area 8 ̆ 5 etc). Considering each dike reach, there are several failure mechanisms such as instability, under seepage, erosion 8 ̆ 5 etc, so all of them contribute to the dike breach probability with different levels. Practically, an example for a Red river dike section analysis is shown with some reliability methods (FOSM, level 3, fault tree 8 ̆ 5 etc) and the joint probability function for dike segments is formulated.

40|$|The planet Earth has {{hundreds}} of impact events, with some occurrences causing {{both in terms}} of human casualty as well as economic losses. Such attitudes of earth pushed the frontiers to develop innovative monitoring strategies for the earth system. To make that real, although, will require coherent and real-time data by observing the earth behavior contiguously. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) appears to be the best suitable infrastructure to sense environmental parameters of our interests. In this event of earth observation, another important issue is the monitoring system with high level of precision. There are different types of sensors to measure the behavioral aspects of earth. The sensors integrated with WSN, provide an accurate and contiguous data for analysis and interpretation. This paper briefly addresses earth observation and areas of critical importance to people and society.

40|$|Guided wave (GW) {{has been}} used for many years in {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT). There are various ways to generate the guided wave, including impact or impulse either manually or using devices. Although the method of impact or impulse is considered to be simple and practical in guided wave generation, it produces waves with broadband frequencies, which often make analysis much more difficult. The frequency bandwidth produced by manual impacts is usually at the low end, and is therefore justified when dealing with one dimensional wave propagation assumption in low strain integrity testing of cylindrical structures. Under such assumption if the velocity is known accurately, NDTs can produce reasonably good results for the condition assessment of the structure. However, for guided wave propagation in timber pole-like structures, it is rather complicated as timber is an orthotropic material and wave propagation in an orthotropic medium exhibits different characteristics from that in isotropic medium. It is possible to obtain solutions for guided wave propagation in orthotropic media for cylindrical structures, even though the orthotropic material greatly complicates GW propagation. In this paper, timber has been considered as a transversely isotropic (i. e. simplified orthotropic) material and a comparative study of GW propagation in a timber pole is conducted considering isotropic and transversely isotropic modelling. Phase velocity, group velocity and attenuation are the main parameters for this comparative study. Moreover, tractionfree situation and embedded <b>geotechnical</b> <b>condition</b> are also taken into consideration to evaluate the effect of boundary. Displacement profile, wave propagation pattern and power flow at particular frequency are utilized to determine different displacement components of longitudinal and flexural waves along and across the timber pole. Effect of temperature and moisture content (in terms of modulus of elasticity) in timber pole is also compared to show the variation in phase velocity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Tunneling {{construction}} {{operations are}} considered dynamic and complex processes. The success of tunneling construction projects {{is affected by}} essential factors. Various methods have been developed in the past, such as simulation models that facilitate and improve the tunneling construction processes and consequently mitigate potential time and cost overruns. Proper selection of excavation method {{is among the most}} important factors in tunneling project success. Current practices in selecting the best possible technique for excavation are based on the highest productivity rate as well as the availability of resources. Many of these techniques neglect the interdependencies and concurrency of influencing factors in selecting the best possible excavation method. In this research, a new method for selecting the most efficient excavation method for tunnels is developed. The method considers a series of significant factors in tunneling construction - namely length, cross-sectional area, geotechnical characteristics depth of the tunnel, and level of water table - and a variety of excavation methods, such as different types of TBMs, Road-header, and drilling and blasting. The factors used in the developed method were constructed based on knowledge extracted from literature and gained from interviews with experts and an online survey. The survey gathered data on the relative importance of the set of selection factors for different soil and project conditions. The collected information was used as input to a developed MCA model (AHP, TOPSIS) that ranked the methods based on their respective suitability for the project at hand to select the most appropriate equipment. The developed method is applied to real case studies to demonstrate its use and highlight its essential features. Also a sensitivity analysis was carried out on each of the case studies, to identify and analyze the most sensitive tunneling variables affecting equipment selection. Based on sensitivity analysis <b>geotechnical</b> <b>condition</b> is the most sensitive factors among all effective variables in both case studies. In the Montreal-Laval Metro Extension, the selected method was Road Header, and in the Spadina Subway project EPB Mixed Shield was selected as the most favorable method of excavation.

In {{the first part of}} the thesis we described the course of geomechanical tunnel design, which includes a matrix method. We particularly highlighted the advantages of the matrix method over the previous system, which was used in Slovenia until 2007. In the second part of the thesis, we used a hypothetical 500 -meter-long section of a tunnel to show the application of the matrix system. To see the advantages of the method, we used two payment models. The first payment model strictly followed the matrix method, while the other model divided the time-dependent costs into the cost of the excavation. Cost estimate for the tunnel section was made for three different case events (A, B and C). In the case A the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>conditions</b> matched our predictions, whereas in cases B and C occurred some variations.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the design of}} longwall shields, focusing on those geotechnical aspects that are critical to either their success or failure during longwall extraction. The driver for {{the paper is the}} recognition that in many instances, longwall shields are assessed and designed along similar lines to that of roadway ground support systems, namely according to typical or normal <b>geotechnical</b> <b>conditions.</b> However the paper will contend that for longwall shields, this is inappropriate as unlike roadway ground support systems, longwall shields cannot be supplemented with additional or secondary support in localised areas of adverse <b>geotechnical</b> <b>conditions.</b> In other words, the longwall shield needs to be designed according to what are judged to be worst case or adverse <b>geotechnical</b> <b>conditions,</b> the outcome being that a well-designed shield will be significantly over-rated for the majority of its working life. However it will be argued that the additional capital cost of such shield design can be readily justified as a prudent risk-based outcome that is essential to minimising future business risks due to strata instability on the longwall face. Shield geometry is discussed including such relevant factors as leg angle, inclination of the top caving shield, canopy ratio, operating height range and tip to face distance, these all being well established longwall shield design considerations and most importantly, areas whereby inadequate design can render a longwall shield highly ineffective. The issue of tip to face distance is considered in detail, in particular the extent by which it is an important geotechnical design consideration. The critical importance of maximising set to yield ratio within practical operating limits is discussed. Overall the aim of the paper is to provide industry with a set of suggested guidelines for future use when designing longwall shields and hopefully to initiate discussion on a subject that unlike roadway ground support design is not well covered in its entirety in the published technical literature...|$|R
