[...] Sam Lansky of Time praised the track stating, [...] "Its the furious chant of that anthemic chorus, all breathless urgency, and the left-of-center production that help Swift perform the niftiest sleight of hand: Even with lyrics that include some of her most headline-grabbing autobiographical admissions to date, {{the most interesting thing}} here isnt who its about, but rather, how different it sounds".

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its release, Searching for the Young Soul Rebels has been widely acclaimed by critics. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett remarked that on the album, Rowland [...] "takes a role that Morrissey would have in 1985 and Jarvis Cocker in 1995 – the unexpected but perfect voice to capture a time and moment in the U.K – the return of 'soul' to English rock music {{at the dawn of}} Thatcherism." [...] Daryl Eslea of BBC Music wrote that [...] "Young Soul Rebels – fierce, raging and passionate – remains one of the greatest debut albums of all time". In a retrospective review following the album's 2010 re-issue, Graeme Thomson of Uncut concluded that [...] "ultimately, the myth-making around Kevin Rowland tends to obscure the fact that he's been responsible for some truly soul-scorching music", and that [...] "at 30 years of age, Young Soul Rebels continues to burn." [...] Tom Ewing, writing in Pitchfork, called it Dexys Midnight Runners' most coherent and consistent record, as did Drowned in Sounds Neil Ashman, who added that [...] "it's <b>damned</b> <b>near</b> perfect."

500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this <b>damn</b> <b>near</b> Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E

[...] Yahoo! Music's Soren Baker commented that [...] "Dre and Big Boi again reinvent themselves, this time as Parliament-inspired musicians who specialize on male-female relationships, boasting, and out-there lyrics." [...] Baker concluded in his review, [...] "With another nearly flawless album, OutKast arguably solidifies their {{reputation as one of}} the best hip-hop groups of all time." [...] The Los Angeles Times opined that [...] "the record's most interesting moments are gorgeous Prince-style soul." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "OutKast's music savors the viscous propulsion of funk, with raps and tunes that never ignore the body and its instinctive desires ... Yet OutKast -- taking cues from a band it obviously reveres, Parliament-Funkadelic -- never forgets that bodies are attached to minds." [...] URB called the album [...] "a complex tome that enmeshes contemporary hip-hop values with a timeless Southern soul, while pushing the envelope <b>damn</b> <b>near</b> off the table."

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method for {{learning}} discriminative category-level features and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on large-scale ac-tion recognition in video. The key observation is that one-vs-rest clas-sifiers, which are ubiquitously employed for this task, face challenges in separating very similar categories (such as running vs. jogging). Our proposed method automatically identifies such pairs of categories using a criterion of mutual pairwise proximity in the (kernelized) feature space, using a category-level similarity matrix where each entry corresponds to the one-vs-one SVM margin for pairs of categories. We then exploit the observation that while splitting such “Siamese Twin ” categories may be difficult, separating them from the remaining categories in a two-vs-rest framework is not. This enables us to augment one-vs-rest classifiers with a judicious selection of “two-vs-rest ” classifier outputs, formed from such discriminative and mutually <b>nearest</b> (<b>DaMN)</b> pairs. By combining one-vs-rest and two-vs-rest features in a principled probabilistic manner, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the UCF 101 and HMDB 51 datasets. More importantly, the same DaMN features, when treated as a mid-level representation also outperform existing methods in knowledge transfer experiments, both cross-dataset from UCF 101 to HMDB 51 and to new categories with limited training data (one-shot and few-shot learning). Finally, we study the generality of the proposed approach by applying DaMN to other classification tasks; our experiments show that DaMN outperforms related approaches in direct comparisons, not only on video action recognition but also on their original image dataset tasks. ...|$|R
