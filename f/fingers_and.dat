5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E
5|$|A film {{based on}} the book Operation Cicero by Moyzisch was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in 1952. It was titled 5 <b>Fingers</b> <b>and</b> directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Bazna, renamed Ulysses Diello, was played by James Mason.|$|E

25|$|To use chopsticks, {{the lower}} chopstick is stationary, and rests {{at the base}} of the thumb, and between the ring <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> middle <b>finger.</b> The second chopstick is held like a pencil, using the tips of the thumb, index <b>finger,</b> <b>and</b> middle <b>finger,</b> <b>and</b> it is moved while eating, to pull food into the grasp of the chopsticks. Chopsticks, when not in use, are placed either to the right or below one's plate in a Chinese table setting.|$|R
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{performed}} with the middle or annular (ring) <b>finger,</b> <b>and</b> can be performed either simultaneously with a down-stroke performed by another finger (e.g. simultaneous down-stroke with index <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> golpe with annular finger), or independently in order to accent off beats.|$|R
5|$|Soft tissue {{injuries}} {{are one of}} the most common types of injuries found within aikido, as well as joint strain and stubbed <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> toes. Several deaths from head-and-neck injuries, caused by aggressive shihōnage in a senpai/kōhai hazing context, have been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} injury {{occurred}} in 1985, when John Hauser, {{a graduate student}} and captain in the United States Air Force, lost four <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> vision in one eye. The bomb, like others of Kaczynski's, was handcrafted and made with wooden parts.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E

5|$|During his {{association}} with the Duo-Art company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 piano rolls {{of his own and}} others' music using a wooden robot designed to play a concert grand piano via an array of precision mechanical <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> feet; replayings of many of these rolls have subsequently been recorded on to compact disc. This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Grieg's Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|More {{primitive}} relatives such as Noasaurus and Ceratosaurus had longer, mobile {{arms with}} <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> claws. Paleobiologist Alexander O. Vargas have suggested {{a major reason}} for the evolution towards vestigial forelimbs in the group was because of a genetic defect; the loss of function in HOXA11 and HOXD11, two genes which regulate the forelimbs' development.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (epistaxis), which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the <b>fingers,</b> <b>and</b> on {{the skin of the}} face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E

5|$|The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is {{well known}} as one of the first {{transitional}} fossils to be found, and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed <b>fingers,</b> <b>and</b> a long, lizard-like tail, as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
5|$|According to Angela Davis, neutron {{activation}} analysis that was administered after the shootout showed no gunpowder residue on Shakur's <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime lab and the FBI crime labs in Washington, D.C. did not find her fingerprints on any weapon at the scene. According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200yards (183m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, {{more than an hour}} later.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{considerable}} variation to this general pattern, except for the little <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> volar surface of the index finger. For example, in some individuals, the ulnar nerve supplies the entire ring <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> the ulnar side of the middle finger, whilst, in others, the median nerve supplies the entire ring finger.|$|R
5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> toes. In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam. The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} in The Sleeping Dragon, George Stobbart is running a bail bonds office in New York with his partner Virgil. George meets Anna Maria, a girl with an old {{manuscript}} who wants his help to decode it. A group of mobsters after the manuscript ransack Anna Maria's hotel room, as well as George's bail bonds office, and steal the manuscript. George discovers that the mobsters are led by Fingers Martino, who runs an old meat packing factory. George sneaks into the factory and overhears a conversation between <b>Fingers</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Spallacci, who has obtained the manuscript. George manages to covertly take back the manuscript, which he examines with Anna Maria. George figures out that the fortified city on it must be Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> feet.|$|E

5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, {{or may be}} preserved by traditional methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was fully}} bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus were {{less than half the}} length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.|$|E
