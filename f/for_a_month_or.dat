500|$|Before {{reporting}} {{to spring training}} for the Blues in early 1910 at Excelsior Springs, Missouri, Stengel was approached by his neighbor, Kid Nichols, a former star pitcher, who advised him {{to listen to his}} manager and to the older players, and if he was minded to reject their advice, at least think it over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> so first.

500|$|When {{it takes}} off, the Atlantic puffin patters {{across the surface}} of the water while vigorously {{flapping}} its wings, before launching itself into the air. The size of the wing is a compromise between its uses above and below water and its surface area is small relative to the bird's weight. To maintain flight, the wings need to beat very rapidly at a rate of several times each second. The bird's flight is direct and low over the surface of the water and it can travel at [...] per hour. Landing is awkward; it either crashes into a wave crest or, in calmer water, does a belly flop. While at sea, the Atlantic puffin has its annual moult. Land birds mostly lose their primaries one pair at a time to enable them still to be able to fly, but the puffin sheds all its primaries at one time and dispenses with flight entirely <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> two. The moult usually takes place between January and March but young birds may lose their feathers a little later in the year.|$|E

500|$|U2 hired Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno {{to produce}} the album, based on the duo's prior work with the band on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree. Lanois was {{principal}} producer, with Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis as engineer. Eno took on an assisting role, working with the group in the studio for {{a week at a}} time to review their songs before leaving <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> two. Eno said his role was [...] "to come in and erase anything that sounded too much like U2". By distancing himself from the work, he believed he provided the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them. As he explained, [...] "I would deliberately not listen to the stuff in between visits, so I could go in cold". Since U2 wanted the record to be harder-hitting and live-sounding, Lanois [...] "push the performance aspect very hard, often to the point of recklessness". The Lanois–Eno team used lateral thinking and a philosophical approach—popularised by Eno's Oblique Strategies—that contrasted with the direct and retro style of Rattle and Hum producer Jimmy Iovine.|$|E
500|$|The {{asymmetrical}} {{structure of}} the game mostly received praise from critics. Vince Ingenito, from IGN, thought that the system was smart and has successfully delivered a unique multiplayer experience for players. He added {{that the system is}} tactically deep, and that the [...] "evolution" [...] mechanic saved it from being gimmicky. This was contradicted by Steven Strom of Ars Technica, who stated that the game overall was just a [...] "great gimmick and little else: something we'll play <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>or</b> two, and not much longer"., [...] Evan Lahti, from PC Gamer, also commended the structure, and considered it the most compressed multiplayer experience since 2014's Titanfall. He added that such structure is something that the genre needs. Anthony LaBella, from Game Revolution, praised the asymmetrical idea. He added that the distant gameplay elements between Monsters and Hunters had successfully introduced Evolve to a broad audience. However, he noted that such a structure may become repetitive and boring for players after months of playthrough. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd also appreciated the structure, which he thought made every battle feel [...] "vicious and intense". However, Jeff Marchiafava, from Game Informer, thought that the structure felt limited, and that Evolve, even with all the modes, had failed to offer enough variety and challenges to players. Nic Rowan, from Destructoid, thought that Evolve had presented some of the best moments he had had in a multiplayer game, but he felt that these moments are too far between.|$|E
500|$|For a brief period, McDonald and Melton {{performed}} {{together as}} a duo at college campuses in the Northwest on behalf of Students for a Democratic Society before returning as regulars at the Jabberwock cafe. The two were joined by local jug band musicians, including Melton's roommates, bass player Bruce Barthol and guitarist Paul Armstrong, and bluegrass guitarist David Bennett Cohen, with whom Melton played in another jug band. The addition of drummer John Francis-Gunning rounded out the six-piece ensemble. It was during their residency at the Jabberwock that Country Joe and the Fish learned to play as a group and expand their repertoire. Within months, based on McDonald and Melton's interest in the live performances of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the recordings on Bob Dylan's album, Highway 61 Revisited, and {{their use of the}} mind-altering drug LSD, the group began equipping themselves with electric instruments and delving more into psychedelia. As a result, Cohen was moved over to the organ. Cohen's experience with keyboards was limited to having played piano at a semiprofessional capacity at the Jabberwock, but, nonetheless, he quickly adapted to the qualities of the instrument. Melton describes the change of the group: [...] "Once we hit into the electric medium and into the rock medium, we were pandering to the public taste. We became extraordinarily popular. The little folk club where we used to play once every two weeks, we played every single night <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>or</b> something like that, and filled it.

2500|$|After {{dominance}} {{has been}} established, the rams begin to select their ewes. Although Marco Polo sheep rams {{are known to}} herd females, during the rut males pair off with females to reproduce. Males will approach a flock of females and smell the urine of possible mates. When smelling the ewe's urine, the males display the Flehmen response to test if the ewe is in estrus. Shackleton calls this phenomenon [...] "lip-curl" [...] and describes it as [...] "raising {{the head with the}} mouth open and upper lip curled back."
