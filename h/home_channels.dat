5000|$|Typically on LTR systems, each {{of these}} {{controllers}} periodically sends out a data burst (approximately every 10 seconds on LTR Standard systems) so that the subscriber units know {{that the system is}} there. The idle data burst can be turned off if desired by the system operator. Some systems will broadcast idle data bursts only on channels used as <b>home</b> <b>channels</b> and not on those used for [...] "overflow" [...] conversations. To a listener, the idle data burst will sound like a short blip of static like someone keyed up and unkeyed a radio within about 1/2 second. This data burst is not sent at the same time by all the channels but happen randomly throughout all the system channels.|$|E
40|$|Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) enables {{partitioning}} {{the enormous}} bandwidth of photonic networks into multiple smaller, more manageable, multiple access channels. These channels operate at a data rate which matches the electronic interface speed, viz. Gbps. Media access protocols for an optically interconnected star-coupled WDM network with no control channel are introduced and compared. The channels are preallocated to nodes where each node has a home channel that it uses for all data reception. If {{the number of}} nodes exceeds the number of channels, <b>home</b> <b>channels</b> are shared among nodes. This approach does not require both tunable transmitters and tunable receivers reducing system complexity and is not limited {{by the number of}} channels available. A generalized random access protocol and an interleaved time division multiplexed protocol are compared. Both protocols require a fast tunable transmitter and a slow (or fixed) tunable receiver per node. Each node has a set of queues of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the limited}} {{resources}} and the dynamic spectrum distribution in the cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSN), a half-duplex Multichannel broadcast protocol for CRSN is presented based on the <b>home</b> <b>channel.</b> This protocol maintains the networks topology only through the <b>home</b> <b>channel,</b> {{so there is no}} need for the public channel to transmit the control information and no need for the synchronization. After network initialization, node broadcasts data via <b>home</b> <b>channel</b> in half-duplex transmission way. The simulation results show that, compared with complete broadcast, the proposed protocol effectively reduces broadcast delay and overhead...|$|R
