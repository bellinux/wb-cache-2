5|$|From 1911 to 1921, the north–south {{section of}} modern NY251 near Scottsville {{was part of}} Route15, an {{unsigned}} legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature. The first portion {{of what is now}} NY251 to receive a posted designation was the segment east of NY64 in Mendon, which was part of the signed NY15 from 1924 to 1930. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY251 was assigned to an alignment extending <b>from</b> <b>Gates</b> to Victor via Scottsville, utilizing modern NY386 north of Scottsville and its current alignment east of the village. NY251 was truncated to begin at NY383 in Scottsville on July 1, 1977, at which time the former routing of NY251 between Scottsville and Gates became part of an extended NY386.|$|E

25|$|The Union Elevated Railroad, leased to the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad, {{opened an}} {{elevated}} line above Broadway <b>from</b> <b>Gates</b> Avenue northwest to Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg on June 25, 1888. This was {{a branch of}} the existing Lexington Avenue Elevated, which then ended at Van Siclen Avenue; Broadway trains ran between Driggs and Van Siclen Avenues. A popular free transfer was available at Gates Avenue to Lexington Avenue trains towards Downtown Brooklyn. The Broadway Elevated was extended to Broadway Ferry on July 14, 1888.|$|E
25|$|San Antonio International Airport has two {{terminals}} with {{an overall}} 24 jet bridge gates. The original one-level terminal (formerly Terminal 2) opened in 1953 with ground-loading holding areas and was expanded twice, once in 1959 with new east and west wings, and again in 1968 with an eight-gate satellite concourse, which was built to handle visitors to HemisFair '68. Terminal 2 closed on November 9, 2010 as the new Terminal B opened, and Terminal 2 began to be demolished in March 2011, with completion in January 2012. A second terminal (formerly Terminal 1, now Terminal A) opened in 1984 with a 16-gate concourse. The U.S. Customs Federal Inspection Station (FIS) is located in Terminal A and is accessible <b>from</b> <b>Gates</b> A6-A9.

Another branch operated by the Union Elevated, the Broadway Elevated <b>from</b> <b>Gates</b> Avenue northwest to Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, opened on June 25, 1888. This was extended to Broadway Ferry on July 14, 1888. The Myrtle Avenue Elevated was extended north over Adams Street to Sands Street at the Brooklyn Bridge on September 1, 1888, and the Union Elevated began running between Sands Street and Van Siclen Avenue. The Union Elevated opened the Hudson Avenue Elevated, a branch of the Brooklyn Elevated from the intersection of Hudson and Park Avenues south to the Long Island Rail Road's Flatbush Avenue terminal, on November 5, 1888, and began operating between Fulton Ferry and Flatbush Avenue.|$|E

An extension of the freeway north to U.S. Route104 (US104; now NY104) was opened to traffic in the early 1970s. NY47 was eliminated in 1980, giving way to NY390 from I-490 to NY104. NY390 was extended to its current length in the early 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Gates tapped Kościuszko {{to survey}} the country between the {{opposing}} armies, choose the most defensible position, and fortify it. Finding just such a position near Saratoga, overlooking the Hudson at Bemis Heights, Kościuszko laid out a strong array of defenses, nearly impregnable from any direction. His judgment and meticulous attention to detail frustrated the British attacks during the Battle of Saratoga, and Gates accepted the surrender of Burgoyne's force there on October 16, 1777. The dwindling British army had been dealt a sound defeat, turning the tide to an American advantage. [...] Kościuszko's work at Saratoga received great praise <b>from</b> <b>Gates,</b> who later told his friend Dr. Benjamin Rush: [...] "he great tacticians of the campaign were hills and forests, which a young Polish engineer was skillful enough to select for my encampment." ...|$|E
500|$|When General Burgoyne made a {{reconnaissance}} {{in force}} of the American left on October 7, this {{began a series of}} actions that precipitated the Battle of Bemis Heights. [...] According to conventional histories, Gates, now in command of the American left, ordered troops out to meet them. [...] At a critical point in the battle, Arnold, who may have been drinking, left his tent, mounted a horse, and rode off to the battlefield. [...] This chronology is based on reports of the action, most of which were recorded many years later, after Arnold's treason. [...] A letter, brought to light in 2015 and written by an adjutant at Arnold's headquarters, tells a different story, indicating that Arnold requested and received permission <b>from</b> <b>Gates</b> to lead men out into the field.|$|E
500|$|By 2009, the {{congregation}} {{had decided to}} erect a new synagogue on land it had purchased <b>from</b> <b>Gates</b> of Prayer, part of the lot on which the Gates of Prayer synagogue stood. For the 2009 High Holy Days, Topolosky planned to launch a capital campaign to raise $1 million towards {{the construction of the}} building. The new building at 4004 West Esplanade Avenue was completed and occupied in August 2012. The old building, which still stood vacant, had been purchased by a surgeon for use as medical offices. All that was saved from it and brought to the new building were a bimah (originally from the building on Carondelet Street), a ner tamid, two menorahs, a hanukiah, and [...] "a stained-glass window and a wooden plaque honoring pioneer donor families from Carondelet Street".

500|$|After a fire {{destroyed}} the Southern Wire Company, Gates gambled {{on the idea}} that William Edenborn had not heard the news and approached him for a merger with the idea that Southern Wire would manufacture in Edenborn's now idle barbed wire plant. The new company was known as St. Louis Wire Mill Company. They continued to buy other wire companies and had strong sales. [...] Washburn-Moen went back into court, this time in Des Moines, Iowa, where a federal judge ruled that the machinery created by Baker was an infringement of Washburn-Moen's patents. By this time, Gates had created a syndicate of barbed wire manufacturers who did not produce their wares using Washburn-Moen's methods; the ruling in favor of Washburn-Moen only applied to areas in the jurisdiction of the U. S. Federal Court in Des Moines. [...] Washburn-Moen continued to falter; Isaac Ellwood sent word asking for a meeting with Gates. Ellwood and another key figure with Washburn-Moen, John Lambert, now accepted offers <b>from</b> <b>Gates.</b> The barbed wire legal issues ended with Washburn-Moen selling their patent rights to Gates and his syndicate of wire manufacturers.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993, the CAA instituted the {{requirement}} that all international airports in New Zealand must keep airside departing and arriving passengers separate. Auckland Airport was granted an exemption to this rule, allowing the airside mingling of arriving and departing passengers to continue, {{on the basis that}} all international flights operating into Auckland originated from airports with adequate security screening. Following the September 11 attacks and further regulation by the ICAO, the CAA required the airport to physically separate arriving and departing passengers by 2006.
