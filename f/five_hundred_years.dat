5|$|The {{constitution}} of the Roman Republic was a set of unwritten norms and customs, which together with various written laws, guided the manner by which the Roman Republic was governed.

5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the California condor was widespread across North America; condor bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, {{at the end of}} the last glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna that led to a subsequent reduction in range and population. <b>Five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> ago, the California condor roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E

5|$|In Lightning Returns, {{after being}} {{released}} from his imprisonment, Snow meets up with Noel and Hope before coming upon the city of Yusnaan and becomes its protector and patron. Over the next <b>five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years,</b> he becomes jaded and depressed, brooding on Serah's death and being weighed down by guilt at his inability to stop the world decaying. When Lightning meets up with him, his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane. When they next meet, Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos {{at the center of}} Yusnaan's palace, transform into a Cie'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure. He performs this act and Lightning does battle him, but she manages to reverse the transformation and convince him to keep hoping and help guide Serah to the new world.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} {{in an economic}} revival that had begun {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some <b>five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E
5|$|Within the Lifestream, Tifa helps Cloud {{reconstruct}} his memories. Cloud {{was never}} accepted into SOLDIER, instead becoming a low-ranking infantryman. The SOLDIER in his memories was his friend Zack. At Nibelheim, Cloud was injured, but fatally wounded Sephiroth, who only survived due to Jenova. Cloud and Zack were then taken for experiments by Hojo, with Zack escaping {{four years later}} with a catatonic Cloud. The two were eventually cornered by Shinra soldiers, and Zack was killed; the combined trauma of his experience, the experiments and Zack's death triggered an identity crisis, with Cloud constructing a false persona around Zack's stories and his own fantasies. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud recovers and together with Tifa reunites with the party. It is revealed that Aerith's prayer to the Planet was successful: the Planet had attempted to summon Holy to prevent Meteor's impact, but Sephiroth blocked Holy. After killing Hojo {{when he tries to}} aid Sephiroth, who is revealed to be Hojo's biological son, the party descends into the Planet's core and defeats both Jenova and Sephiroth. The party escapes and Holy is summoned, attempting to block Meteor as it descends on Midgar. As Meteor is too close, Holy cannot block it, but the Lifestream rises from the planet and aids Holy in destroying Meteor. <b>Five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.|$|E

50|$|The most creditable {{hypothesis}} for {{the roots}} {{to its name}} lies in the domination of the Crown of Aragon (1282 - 1516) {{and then in the}} <b>five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>year</b> history of Spanish Sicily (1516 - 1713), flowing together with the Kingdom of Naples {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Crown of Spain.

5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers Lightning being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse <b>five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E
