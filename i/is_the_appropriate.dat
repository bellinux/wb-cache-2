5|$|Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{created the}} visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites {{what he thinks}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before {{returning}} her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been {{through the use of}} an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E

25|$|A second {{important}} concern <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> {{source of}} the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human eggs, {{which can only be}} obtained from women. The most common {{source of the}}se eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.|$|E

25|$|An {{account of}} profits <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> remedy when, for example, a senior {{employee}} has {{taken advantage of}} his fiduciary position by conducting his own company {{on the side and}} has run up quite a lot of profits over a period of time, profits which he wouldn't have been able to make otherwise. The fiduciary in breach may however receive an allowance for effort and ingenuity expended in making the profit.|$|E
25|$|Economists also {{debate the}} {{definition}} of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> measure. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting {{the use of the}} lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members.|$|E
25|$|For example, for a current-{{feedback}} amplifier, current {{from the}} output is sampled for feedback and combined with current at the input. Therefore, the feedback ideally {{is performed using}} an (output) current-controlled current source (CCCS), and its imperfect realization using a two-port network also must incorporate a CCCS, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> choice for feedback network is a g-parameter two-port. Here the two-port method used in most textbooks is presented, using the circuit treated in the article on asymptotic gain model.|$|E

25|$|At {{a hearing}} on June 22, 2012 before U.S. District Court Judge James C. Cacheris, El Khalifi pleaded guilty to one count of {{attempted}} use of {{a weapon of mass}} destruction (specifically, a destructive device consisting of an improvised explosive device) against U.S. property, namely, the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. As part of the plea agreement, the United States and El Khalifi agree that a sentence within a range of 25 years to 30 years’ incarceration <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> disposition of this case. El Khalifi was sentenced to 30 years in prison on September 14, 2012.|$|E
25|$|It is our policy-and we have {{increasingly}} {{the means and}} the detailed plans {{to carry out this}} policy-to ensure that the Soviet leadership knows that if they chose some intermediate level of aggression, we could, by selective, large (but still less than maximum) nuclear attacks, exact an unacceptably high price in the things the Soviet leaders appear to value most--political and military control, military force both nuclear and conventional, and the industrial capability to sustain a war. In our planning we have not ignored the problem of ending the war, nor would we ignore it {{in the event of a}} war. And, of course, we have, and we will keep, a survivable and enduring capability to attack the full range of targets, including the Soviet economic base, if that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> response to a Soviet strike.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E
