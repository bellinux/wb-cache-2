While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
30|$|Live VM {{migration}} across high latency {{low bandwidth}} WAN within “reasonable” time {{is nearly impossible}} due to the large size of the VM image. So, migration of virtual disk file at run time within acceptable time over WAN is a critical challenge. Bose et al. [95] proposed a combined VM replication and scheduling architecture called CloudSpider. The VM image is replicated across different cloud sides is chosen a VM image replica based on dynamically changing cost parameter and treated as a primary copy. Further, the incremental changes in VM replica is propagated towards remaining replicas for synchronization. Authors proposed de-duplication techniques to compensate (by exploring commonalities) the additional storage cost due to additional storage requirements for replica storage. They mainly focus on the VM image replica placement when disparate VM images carried varying degrees of commonality and latency requirements. Modify open-source cloud simulator called CloudSim and incorporating modules on storage de-duplication, storage blocks, and file allocation table. Implementation shows {{that the success of}} CloudSpider to minimize storage requirements is <b>highly</b> <b>dependents</b> <b>on</b> the working of replica placement algorithm and it can judiciously place the VM image replicas at different sites that minimize the storage requirement.|$|R

30|$|The {{rule based}} {{technique}} {{is the only}} approach which is widely used in the commercial auto-scaling systems [9 – 11]. The popularity {{of this approach is}} due to its simplicity and intuitive nature. The rule based approaches typically have six parameters: an upper threshold (thrU), a lower threshold (thrL), durU and durL that define how long the condition must be met to trigger a scaling action, and inL and inU which indicate the cool down periods after the scale out and scale in actions [4]. The performance of the rule based technique <b>highly</b> <b>dependents</b> <b>on</b> these parameters. Therefore, finding the appropriate values for these parameters is a tricky task. A common problem in the rule based auto-scaling, which occurs due to an inappropriate threshold value, is the oscillations in the number of the leased VMs. In fact, the durU and the durL parameters are introduced to decrease the number of the scaling actions and reduce the VM oscillations. Some researchers have proposed alternative techniques to address the VM oscillation problem. For instance, the work in [12] uses a set of four thresholds and two durations. Moreover, some research works (such as [13]) have adopted a combination of the rules and a voting system to generate the scaling actions.|$|R
