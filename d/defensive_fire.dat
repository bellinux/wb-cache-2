5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} 14 Devastators from VT-6 {{from the}} carrier , led by Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's aircraft tried to sandwich Kaga, but the CAP, reinforced by an additional eight Zeros launched by Akagi at 09:33 and 09:40, shot down all but {{four of the}} Devastators, and Kaga dodged the torpedoes. <b>Defensive</b> <b>fire</b> from the Devastators shot down one of Akagis Zeros.|$|E
5|$|Geißhardt, who {{was flying}} Fw 190 A-4 (Werknummer 7051—factory number) in Priller's Schwarm, was {{severely}} wounded in combat with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-17 Flying Fortress of the 306th Bomb Group on 5 April 1943. He {{had been hit}} by the <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> from the bombers. He was bleeding profusely from an abdominal wound but managed to make a smooth landing on the airfield at Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium. He succumbed to his injuries early the next morning on 6 April 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Canadians {{subsequently}} occupied Hill 677 {{and began}} digging-in, deploying their six Vickers medium machine-guns in sections to add depth, and using <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> tasks {{to cover the}} gaps in their positions. Meanwhile, the Australians occupied Hill 504, with D Company holding the summit itself, A Company the spur-line which ran down to the north-west, and B Company the small hill by the river, while C Company was in reserve on the rear spur. In response to US IX Corps requirements Burke directed Ferguson to site his headquarters in the low ground of the valley {{in the vicinity of}} the hamlet of Chuktun-ni, so as to control the withdrawing South Koreans. However, this would limit Ferguson's situational awareness and his ability to control the battle, while also leaving them exposed to infiltration. The afternoon was spent on the lightly scrub-covered slopes digging-in and building sangers where the rocky ground proved too hard. In only a few hours the Australians managed to prepare hasty defensive positions, although <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> tasks were unable to be registered as the artillery Forward Observers were unable to reach the company positions until after dark.|$|E
50|$|The barrage {{continued}} in use into the Korean War. At the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, UN forces employed on-call, pre-registered <b>defensive</b> <b>fires</b> called flash fire {{to defend its}} outposts, in which artillery laid down a box barrage in a horseshoe-shaped pattern around the outpost. It was still in use in the Vietnam War.|$|R
5|$|Carpenter, {{seeking a}} more {{defensive}} posture closer to Beaver Creek, advanced {{for a short}} period then circled the supply wagons in a defensible area. This was possible because his mounted troopers fought a mobile delaying action. On his command, Carpenter's men rushed inside at the gallop. They dismounted and took up a <b>defensive</b> <b>firing</b> line at the gap between the wagons they had just entered.|$|R
50|$|The {{second and}} third attacks {{followed}} the same pattern. Each lasted over an hour during the early morning of June 28, and each time the Chinese failed {{to break through the}} wall of <b>defensive</b> <b>fires.</b> After suffering casualties estimated at between 250 and 325 men, the Chinese broke off the fight. The 179th Infantry reported six men killed and sixty-one wounded during the three engagements.|$|R
5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, it was soon modified {{in the field to}} carry more machine guns in {{what became known as the}} helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of <b>defensive</b> <b>fire.</b> The helicopter was effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the tactical nuclear weapons that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the light}} of {{lessons learned from the}} partial Canadian success during Operation Windsor, Charnwood was to be {{launched}} on a broad front to increase the pressure on the German defences and disperse their <b>defensive</b> <b>fire.</b> SHAEF planners had advised, on 10 June, {{that the best way to}} break a stalemate was to use air power to support an attack; this method was to be used for Charnwood as Montgomery enlisted the aid of RAF Bomber Command. Heavy bombers would attack Caen on the night preceding the assault, with 15% of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched. A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a third wave of American bombers would attack on the morning of the operation.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{attack on}} San Leonardo by the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada began late on 5 December 1943 with A Company {{establishing}} a bridgehead across the Moro, taking heavy casualties. In {{the early morning}} of 6 December, A Company was withdrawn and two additional Seaforth companies resumed the offensive. As PPCLI secured and held their bridgehead over the Moro River, the Seaforth Highlanders were struggling to enter San Leonardo. By 07:15, a single objective had been taken, with Canadian units pinned down by well-coordinated <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> from several companies of the 361st Regiment. Simultaneously, small arms fire prevented C Company from moving up {{the road from the}} Moro to San Leonardo, while D Company remained on the southern banks of the Moro throughout the early morning.|$|E
5000|$|Israel {{gave the}} name [...] "nature reserves" [...] to Hezbollah's {{vast network of}} {{underground}} bunkers, barracks, caches and firing positions. Hezbollah combat engineers have built <b>defensive</b> <b>firing</b> positions and well-hidden strongpoints throughout southern Lebanon since 2000. Hezbollah bunkers are well-defended, with blast doors and security cameras, and are deeply buried to stymie Israeli airstrikes. These fortifications are also well camouflaged, with launch sites particularly challenging to locate.|$|R
500|$|At 01:10 a large Chinese {{force was}} {{detected}} forming up on a spur {{to the west}} towards Hill 865 and they were engaged by Bren light machines guns and <b>defensive</b> <b>fires.</b> Assaulting 10 Platoon {{under the cover of}} machine-gun and mortar fire, the Chinese were soon effectively engaged by Vickers machine-guns from 12 Platoon firing in mutual support. Switching their axis of assault to 12 Platoon, the Chinese succeeded in overrunning one of the Canadian sections and a medium machine-gun, killing two of its crew who had remained at their post firing until the last moment. The Canadians fought back, engaging the Chinese as they attempted to turn the Vickers on them, rendering it inoperable before calling in pre-arranged <b>defensive</b> <b>fires</b> on to the newly lost position. With the supporting artillery firing at the 'very slow' rate to conserve ammunition, the weight of the Chinese assaults soon prompted the Canadians to request it be increased to the 'slow' rate of two rounds per gun per minute, so that 24 rounds fell every 30seconds within a target area of [...]|$|R
2500|$|The {{finished}} fortification was {{an enclosed}} two-storey cross-shaped blockhouse, with sides about [...] long.

The construction of the fortress on Årøya, led to a comparatively considerable immigration of Norwegians to the area, many arriving as carpenters and soldiers.|$|R
5|$|The first Pe-3s {{were issued}} to the 95th High-Speed Bomber Regiment in the Moscow Military District and the Regiment's {{experiences}} with the aircraft revealed other problems. Firing the guns at night dazzled the pilot and destroyed his night vision and the glare from searchlights through the glazing on the lower nose also blinded the pilot. Crews complained bitterly {{that the lack of}} frontal armor made them vulnerable to <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> from German bombers. Flash hiders installed on the guns and curtains covering the windows cured the first problems, but the lack of armor could not be rectified immediately. Many aircraft were also fitted with launchers for four to six RS-82 and RS-132 rockets for ground-attack missions. Another common addition was a launcher for DAG-10 aerial grenades mounted in the tail.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Nagumo's {{carriers}} {{were attacked}} by six US Navy Grumman TBF Avengers from Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8) and four United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-26 Marauders, all carrying torpedoes. The Avengers went after Hiryū while the Marauders attacked Akagi. The 30 CAP Zeroes {{in the air at}} this time, including the 11 from Akagi, immediately attacked the American aircraft, shooting down five of the Avengers and two of the B-26s. One of Akagis Zeroes, however, was shot down by <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> from the B-26s. Several of the Marauders dropped their torpedoes, but all either missed or failed to detonate. One B-26, piloted by Lieutenant James Muri, strafed Akagi after dropping its torpedo, killing two men. Another, either attempting a suicide ramming, or out of control due to battle damage or an incapacitated pilot, narrowly missed crashing into Akagis bridge, where Nagumo was standing, before it cartwheeled into the sea.|$|E
5|$|It {{was felt}} that too long had elapsed {{in both cases}} between the German {{warships}} being spotted {{and the arrival of}} the strike force, and to rectify matters, it was decided to carry out reconnaissance in force, with formations of bombers being sent out over the North Sea to find and attack German warships. Their orders forbade them from attacking ships in port, infringing neutral airspace or even attacking German warships escorting merchant ships. A patrol on 29 September resulted in five Hampdens being shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s, of II./JG 77, but an attack by 24 Wellingtons of No. 149, No. 38 Squadron RAF and No. 115 Squadron RAF on 3 December was more successful, claiming a German minesweeper sunk (confirmed by German archives), while <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> from the Wellington gun turrets repelled attacks by German fighters, shooting one down without loss to the bombers. The German pilot shot down was future German ace Günther Specht. He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF. The German ships were the Brummer and the minesweeper M1407 both sunk by unexploded bombs passing through the ship. A German report stated the attack was cleverly executed from out of the sun and delivered to avoid the nearby civilian areas.|$|E
50|$|Charlie Company of the 5th RCT took {{responsibility}} for Harry on June 13. That night at approximately 02:55, PVA artillery and mortar fire preceded a screening {{action against the}} outpost from {{the east and west}} for the purpose of protecting recovery of their dead. This screening force was broken up by UNC <b>defensive</b> <b>fires.</b> Action became sporadic, with light PVA artillery and mortar fire falling on the outpost and MLR. By 04:40 the Chinese withdrew and all action ceased.|$|R
50|$|The {{finished}} fortification was {{an enclosed}} two-storey cross-shaped blockhouse, with sides about 22-23 m long. The blockhouse had loopholes for observation and <b>defensive</b> <b>firing.</b> Earthen ramparts surrounded the blockhouse on three sides, with the fourth, eastern, side {{covered by a}} wooden palisade facing the sea. The ramparts were some 2-3 m high and 20-30 m long. The construction of the fortress on Årøya, led to a comparatively considerable immigration of Norwegians to the area, many arriving as carpenters and soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|Company [...] "G", 15th {{infantry}} {{had their}} turn at defending Outpost Harry. At about 01:25 the Chinese moving through friendly artillery and <b>defensive</b> <b>fires</b> gained the trenches {{on the rear}} of the outpost, and intense hand-to-hand fighting followed. At 02:22, UNC forces held the outpost with the PVA reinforcing in the bitter hand to hand action. Company [...] "E", 15th Infantry was committed to reinforce. One platoon from Heavy Tank Company and one platoon of Infantry were again dispatched as diversionary force. At 03:45 the PVA withdrew and action ceased.|$|R
5|$|The {{fortress}} around Sattelberg was methodically {{reduced by}} intensive Allied bombing which lasted five days, {{coming to an}} end on 23 November. The same day, Japanese aircraft also undertook ground support operations with a force of 44Japanese aircraft attacking Australian positions round Jivevaneng. This did not change the situation around Sattelberg as by then the Australians had reached its southern slopes and the following day they began probing forward towards its summit. Throughout the day they launched a number of attacks, but heavy <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> pushed these back until a platoon under the command of Sergeant Tom Derrick fought its way almost to the top, with Derrick leading the way, destroying 10Japanese positions with grenades as he went. With the Australians having secured a toehold just below the summit for the night, the Japanese withdrew under the cover of darkness and the following morning the advance to the mission was completed. For his feat, Derrick later received the Victoria Cross, his nation's highest military decoration.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July, the battalion's {{companies}} were detached to support individual Australian brigades during the First Battle of El Alamein as the Allied forces– which had, {{since the beginning}} of the year, been steadily pushed back by the German and Italian forces– fought desperately to stop the German advance east towards Cairo. Supporting the infantry battalions fighting around Tel el Eisa in early July, several of the battalion's crews played significant roles in turning back attacks on the Australian positions, and in concert with divisional artillery were reported to have inflicted heavy casualties upon the German and Italian soldiers. Later, in the middle of the month, they supported an attack by the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, now commanded by the 2/2nd's old commander, Whitehead, around Makh Khad Ridge to the right of the Qattara Track. By the end of the month the offensive had come to a halt and during the lull that followed the battalion provided <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> from depth positions. In October, it joined the second Allied counter-attack that was launched during the Second Battle of El Alamein. During these battles, the battalion was heavily engaged, with a company supporting a composite force under Whitehead, and another operating in support of the 24th Brigade. Its casualties amounted to 21 killed, 128 wounded and 26 captured.|$|E
5|$|When renewed air {{operations}} began over the Bay, the Command found U-boats not only adhering {{to a new}} strategy (of avoidance), they discovered the Germans obeying new tactical instructions. The German crews were ordered to transit the Bay in groups, submerged, and at night, but on the surface in daylight, to concentrate their <b>defensive</b> <b>fire.</b> Later U-boat designs had their firepower upgraded for this purpose. Also, the Luftwaffe provided Junkers Ju 88 night fighters to escort the submarines. The increased firepower and determination of German air and submarine crews to fight it out did not deter British crews. The Third Bay Offensive became the bloodiest in the aircraft-submarine battle yet, which involved heavy losses. Despite efforts to defend themselves, by 17 June, air attacks had forced German submarines {{to make the trip}} submerged during daylight. The effects were not just indirect; patrols also inflicted increasing losses on U-boats. From 1 July to 2 August 1943, 86 submarines passed through the Bay; 55 were sighted and 16 sunk, in exchange for 14 aircraft.|$|E

50|$|On 5 April 1945, Herget began {{testing a}} {{prototype}} {{variant of the}} Me 262 at the Lechfeld, the Messerschmitt test airfield. The Me 262A-1a/U4 which Herget tested was equipped with an adapted 50 mm MK 214 long barreled cannon. It was believed that this weapon could bring down enemy bombers from outside their <b>defensive</b> <b>firing</b> range. The weapon system suffered from technical problems and was prone to jamming. On 16 April, Herget flew the Me 262A-1a/U4 in an unsuccessful combat mission against an United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bomber formation. The weapon failed and no shot was fired. The Me 262 was then flown to Munich-Riem by Herget where it was placed {{under the control of}} Adolf Galland's Jagdverband 44 (JV 44—44th Fighter Detachment).|$|R

5|$|Within minutes all the Dorniers {{had been}} hit. Feldwebel Johannes Petersen's Do 17 was flying {{higher than the}} others. It was hit, and caught fire, but carried on. Günter Unger lined up his Do 17 in order to attack a hangar and {{released}} his 20 110-lb bombs before his starboard engine was knocked out. Unteroffizier (Junior Officer or NCO) Schumacher watched as three hangars were destroyed by Unger’s bombs. Unger’s Dornier was then was hit by something. It bled black smoke and lost speed. Unger was engaged by No. 111s Harry Newton. Newton was shot down by accurate return fire and bailed out. However, Newton fired a burst of machine gun fire at the Dornier in frustration before leaving the Hurricane. He damaged the Dornier, but Unger flew on. Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hermann Magin was lining up a hangar when he was hit and slumped over. The quick reactions of the navigator, 28-year-old Wilhelm-Friedrich Illg, saved the crew. He took control and {{climbed out of the}} <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> before ordering the crew to abandon the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|At {{first light}} a {{clearing}} patrol from D Company, 3 RAR swept {{the area with}} tanks and APCs in support, killing and capturing a number of attackers that had been pinned down in old B-52 bomb craters {{to the north of}} Balmoral. The daylight revealed that the North Vietnamese had once again been soundly defeated leaving 42 dead and seven prisoners, while Australian losses were one killed and eight wounded. Quantities of weapons, clothing, ammunition and equipment were also recovered by the Australians. Phillips was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the battle. Many of the North Vietnamese dead were teenagers of 16 or 17 years, evidence that the PAVN had begun drafting 15-year-old boys into its combat units; as had happened after the earlier fighting, their bodies were collected by a bulldozer and buried in a mass grave. Later, a large number of shell scrapes were discovered to the north-east of Balmoral during an aerial reconnaissance by a Sioux light observation helicopter, and they were thought likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as an assembly area before being engaged by artillery firing <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> tasks early in the battle. The successful defence of Balmoral and the high ratio of North Vietnamese killed had confirmed the judgement of MacDonald and Dunstan and validated the decision to adopt an aggressive defence with strong static positions and forceful patrolling. The failed assault proved to be the final attempt to remove 1 ATF from AO Surfers, and there were no further attacks by the North Vietnamese against either Coral or Balmoral.|$|E

50|$|On 7 December 1941, the 11th FAB {{came under}} enemy fire as the Japanese {{aircraft}} that had bombed Wheeler Army Airfield strafed Schofield Barracks inflicting minor casualties and damage.

The 11th FAB {{claims to have}} shot {{down one of the}} twenty-nine Japanese planes downed during the attack on Pearl Harbor.After the attack, the 24th ID executed well-rehearsed operational plans designed to repel an amphibious assault on Oahu. As part of that plan, the 11th FAB moved to its pre-designated <b>defensive</b> <b>firing</b> positions on the north shore of Oahu. Here the battalion would remain until May 1943.

25|$|After {{the smoke}} from the {{explosion}} cleared away it was discovered that the tough old bridge was still intact. One side of the arch was gone, but the span was still standing. By this time, the French artillery had succeeded in dismounting one of Mayne's cannons and silencing the rest. Victor ordered one of Lapisse's brigades to rush the bridge. When the French soldiers managed to brave the <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> and gain a foothold on the north bank, Mayne ordered a retreat to the Salvaterra Pass.|$|E
25|$|When the Independent Air Force {{was set up}} in June 1918 {{to carry}} out {{strategic}} bombing of targets in Germany, the DH.4s of 55 Squadron formed part of it, being used for daylight attacks. 55 Squadron developed tactics of flying in wedge formations, bombing on the leader's command and with the massed <b>defensive</b> <b>fire</b> of the formation deterring attacks by enemy fighters.
