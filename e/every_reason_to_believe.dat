The sailors were in a compartment that was initially at surface atmosphere pressure, so they did not risk decompression sickness ('the bends') if they used the rescue hoods to ascend to the surface. But the Arctic water was extremely cold and they could not survive long in the water. Also, water was slowly seeping into the ninth compartment, increasing the atmospheric pressure and thus the risk of decompression sickness and death when they ascended to the surface. In addition it was likely that some of the men were seriously injured and escape would have been very difficult for them.|$|E
5000|$|Potential buyers made {{a careful}} {{examination}} of the [...] "merchandise": they checked the state of health {{of a person who}} was often standing naked with wrists bound together. In Cairo, transactions involving eunuchs and concubines happened in private houses. Prices varied according to the slave's quality. Thomas Smee, the commander of the British research ship Ternate, visited such a market in Zanzibar in 1811 and gave a detailed description: 'The show' commences about four o'clock in the afternoon. The slaves, set off to the best advantage by having their skins cleaned and burnished with cocoa-nut oil, their faces painted with red and white stripes and the hands, noses, ears and feet ornamented with a profusion of bracelets of gold and silver and jewels, are ranged in a line, commencing with the youngest, and increasing to the rear according to their size and age. At the head of this file, which is composed of all sexes and ages from 6 to 60, walks the person who owns them; behind and at each side, two or three of his domestic slaves, armed with swords and spears, serve as guard.Thus ordered the procession begins, and passes through the market-place and the principle streets... when any of them strikes a spectator's fancy the line immediately stops, and a process of examination ensues, which, for minuteness, is unequalled in any cattle market in Europe. The intending purchaser having ascertained there is no defect in the faculties of speech, hearing, etc., that there is no disease present, next proceeds to examine the person; the mouth and the teeth are first inspected and afterwards every part of the body in succession, not even excepting the breasts, etc., of the girls, many of whom I have seen handled in the most indecent manner in the public market by their purchasers; indeed there is <b>every</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the slave-dealers almost universally force the young girls to submit to their lust previous to their being disposed of.

Some quoted cases in point, of ships seen off the coast of New-England, navigated by witches and goblins. Old Hans Van Pelt, who had been more than once to the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope, insisted that this must be the Flying Dutchman which had so long haunted Table Bay, but, being unable to make port, had now sought another harbour. Others suggested, that, if it really was a supernatural apparition, as there was <b>every</b> natural <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> it might be Hendrick Hudson, and his crew of the Half-Moon; who, it was well-known, had once run aground in {{the upper part of the}} river, in seeking a north-west passage to China.

60|$|Why did he oppose it?

40|$|Injury to the podocyte {{results in}} {{proteinuria}} and {{often leads to}} progressive kidney disease. As podocytes have limited ability to repair and/or regenerate, the extent of podocyte injury is a major prognostic determinant in diabetic nephropathy and other common causes of end-stage renal disease. Therapies aimed at preventing or limiting podocyte injury and/or at promoting podocyte repair or regeneration therefore have major potential clinical and economic benefits. Many current therapies-including glucocorticosteroids and calcineurin antagonists-have potent effects on podocytes. The nonspecific natures of these agents lead to undesirable systemic adverse effects: an agent with a more specific focus on podocytes would cause less treatment-associated morbidity. Recent years have seen dramatic advances {{in our understanding of}} podocyte biology and in particular regulation of its actin cytoskeleton, the major determinant of the complex architecture on which these cells depend for their function. This advance has allowed the identification of potential therapeutic targets and the next few years should see the development and testing of specific therapies aimed at the podocyte. Thus we are about to move from a situation where some of our 'blunderbuss' older therapies fortuitously happened to have beneficial effects on podocytes to a new era where advances in biological knowledge about a key cell type in the kidney will allow targeted drug design. As well as being intellectually more satisfying, <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> exists <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that patients of the future will benefit and that the scourge of progressive kidney disease will be more effectively tackled. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

60|$|I {{will now}} ask the {{attention}} of the House for a moment while I examine a group of communications from officers of the Indian Government, and if the House will allow me I will tell them what to my mind is the result of all these communications as to the general feeling in India. That, after all, is what most concerns us. For this unrest in the Punjab and Bengal sooner or later--and sooner, rather than later, I hope--will pass away. What is the situation of India generally in the view of these experienced officers at this moment? Even now when we are passing through all the stress and anxiety, it is a mistake not to look at things rather largely. They all admit that there is a fall in the influence of European officers over the population. They all, or nearly all, admit that there is estrangement--I ought to say, perhaps, refrigeration--between officers and people. There is less sympathy between the Government and the people. For the last few years--and {{this is a very important}} point--the doctrine of administrative efficiency has been pressed too hard. The wheels of the huge machine have been driven too fast. Our administration--so shrewd observers and very experienced observers assure me--would be a great deal more popular if it was a trifle less efficient, a trifle more elastic generally. We ought not to put mechanical efficiency at the head of our ideas. I am leading up to a practical point. The district officers representing British rule to the majority of the people of India, are overloaded with work in their official relations, and I know there are highly experienced gentlemen who say that a little of the looseness of earlier days is better fitted than the regular system of latter days, to win and to keep personal influence, and that we are in danger of creating a pure bureaucracy. Honourable, faithful, and industrious the servants of the State in India are and will be, but if the present system is persisted in, there is a risk of its becoming rather mechanical, perhaps I might even say rather soulless; and attention to this is urgently demanded. Perfectly efficient administration, I need not tell the House, has a tendency to lead to over-centralisation. It is inevitable. The tendency in India is to override local authority, and to force administration to run in official grooves. For my own part I would spare no pains to improve our relations with native Governments, and more and more these relations may become of potential value to the Government of India. I would use my best endeavours to make these States independent in matters of administration. Yet all evidence tends to show we are rather making administration less personal, though evidence also tends to show that the Indian people are peculiarly responsive to sympathy and personal influence. Do not let us waste ourselves in controversy, here or elsewhere, or in mere anger; let us try to draw to our side the men who now influence the people. We have <b>every</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that most of the people of India are on our side. I do not say for a moment that they like us. It does not come easy, in west or east, to like foreign rule. But in their hearts they know that their solid interest is bound up with the law and order that we preserve.|$|R

500|$|More {{controversial}} {{than the}} distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision {{to withdraw from the}} battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach.

But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, [...] "S'ils avaient bien manouevré, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire périr à la côte" [...] (If [...] had manouevred successfully they could have taken all of our vessels, or made them perish on the coast). Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage, while William Laird Clowes wrote in 1901 that [...] "We may be pretty sure that had a Nelson, a Hawke or even a Boscawen commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated." [...] Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and Richard Woodman have compared Groix with the battles of Genoa and Hyères fought during in the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, William Hotham, had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.|$|E
