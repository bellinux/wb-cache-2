6000|$|The {{few words}} {{that set the}} doctor right {{when he arrived at}} the cabin might in any other {{community}} have required further explanation, but Dr. Duchesne, an old army surgeon, was prepared for everything and indifferent to all. [...] "The infant," [...] he said, [...] "was threatened with inflammation of the lungs; at present there was no danger, but the greatest care and caution must be exercised. Particularly exposure should be avoided." [...] "That settles the whole matter, then," [...] said Bessy potentially. Both gentlemen looked their surprise. [...] "It means," [...] she condescended to further explain, [...] "that YOU must ride that filly home, wait for the old man to come to-morrow, and then ride back <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> of my duds, for thar's no 'day-days' nor picknicking for that baby ontil she's better.

60|$|The {{great and}} illustrious Frederick had scores of these white slave-dealers all round {{the frontiers of}} his kingdom, debauching troops or {{kidnapping}} peasants, and hesitating at no crime to supply those brilliant regiments of his with food for powder; and I cannot help telling <b>here,</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> satisfaction, the fate which ultimately befell the atrocious scoundrel who, violating all the rights of friendship and good-fellowship, had just succeeded in entrapping me. This individual was a person of high family and known talents and courage, but who had a propensity to gambling and extravagance, and found his calling as a recruit-decoy far more profitable to him than his pay of second captain in the line. The sovereign, too, probably found his services more useful in the former capacity. His name was Monsieur de Galgenstein, {{and he was one}} of the most successful of the practisers of his rascally trade. He spoke all languages, and knew all countries, and hence had no difficulty in finding out the simple braggadocio of a young lad like me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I've {{sometimes}} {{taken that}} view of it.

I like to go about and note the mystification of strangers who've come <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> notion of a little attention. It's delightfully poignant; I suffer with them; it's a cheap luxury of woe; I follow them through all the turns and windings of their experience. Of course the theory is that, being turned loose here with the rest, they may speak to anybody; but the fact is, they can't. Sometimes I should like to hail some of these unfriended spirits, but I haven't the courage. I'm not individually bashful, but I have a thousand years of Anglo-Saxon civilisation behind me. There ought to be policemen, to show strangers about and be kind to them. I've just seen two pretty women cast away in a corner, and clinging to a small water-colour on the wall with a show of interest that would melt a heart of stone. Why do you come, Mrs. Brinkley? I should like to know. You're not obliged to." ...|$|E

60|$|I cannot however, but observe <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> regret, how {{it appears}} by the consequence, that the Devil was not mistaken {{when he made}} an early {{judgment}} of Mrs. Eve; and how Satan really went {{the right way to}} work, to judge of her; 'tis certain the Devil had nothing to do but to look in her face, and upon a near steady view he might easily see there, an instrument for his Turn; nor has he fail'd to make her a Tool ever since, by the very methods which he at first proposed; to which, perhaps, he has made some additions in the corrupting her composition, as well as her understanding; qualifying her to be a compleat snare to the poor weaker vessel MAN; to wheedle him with her Syren's voice, abuse him with her smiles, delude him with her crocodile tears, and sometimes cock her crown at him, and terrify him with the thunder of her TREBLE; making the effeminated Male Apple-eater tremble at the noise of that very Tongue, which at first commanded him to Sin. For it is yet a debate which the Learned have not decided, whether she persuaded and entreated him, or like a true she-tyrant, exercised her authority and oblig'd him to eat the forbidden fruit.|$|E

'If we {{can manage}} {{to carry on}} a winter's school <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> ten or twelve of the lads left under Mr. Pritt's charge, while I go off with the rest, I really think that the {{industrial}} department may become something considerable. It {{is an essential part of}} the system, for we must begin with teaching habits of order, punctuality, &c:, in respect of those things with which they have already some acquaintance. No Melanesian can understand why he is to sit spelling away at a black board; and he is not like a child of four or five years old, he must be taught through his power of reasoning, and perceiving the meaning of things. Secondly, we can gradually invest the more advanced scholars with responsible duties. There are the head cooks in the various weeks, the heads of departments in garden work, &c., &c. As these lads and men are being trained (we hope) to teach others, and as we want them to teach industry, decency, cleanliness, punctuality, to be, and to teach others to be honest, and careful, and thoughtful, so we find all these lessons are learnt more in the industrial work than in the mere book work, though that is not neglected. Indeed school, in the restricted sense of the word, is going on for four or four and a half hours a day.|$|E

Fellows tell you that's old fashioned. It appears to be peculiar any way; it never occurs to us to embody the main principle of life in our buildings; we load our houses with decoration, gimcracks, corners, anything to distract the eye. On the contrary the eye should rest; get your effects with a few strong lines. The whole thing is regularity there's no self-respect without it." ...|$|E
