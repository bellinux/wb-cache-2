In this study, a textile stimulation electrode was developed using conductive fabrics and then its impedance spectroscopy, stimulation thresholds, and stimulation comfort were quantitatively assessed and {{compared with those of}} a wet textile electrode and a hydrogel electrode on healthy subjects. The equivalent circuit models and the finite element models of different types of electrode were built based on the measured impedance data of the electrodes to reveal the possible mechanism of electrical stimulation pain.

However, the <b>dry</b> <b>textile</b> electrode was found to have very low pain threshold and induced obvious cutaneous painful sensations during stimulation, in comparison to the wet and hydrogel electrodes.

40|$|Carbon fibre textile {{semi-finished}} products are playing {{an important role}} {{for the production of}} carbon fibre reinforced plastics via (liquid) resin infusion processes, e. g. in aircraft manufacturing and other industrial applications. The focus of the present work is on multiaxial warp knitted fabrics, also called non-crimp fabrics (NCF), a form of textile with the reinforcement fibres placed in multiple (mostly 2 - 4) layers upon each other, held together by a knitting yarn pattern. An assessment methodology is presented, comprising seven test methods, of which there are four on the processability of the NCF-textiles in part manufacturing and three to characterize the textile quality aspects related to laminate mechanical properties. For each of these test methods, approaches are explained to derive quantifiable values from the results to make the textile characteristics of different materials comparable. With regard to processability, the deformation or drape behaviour of the multiaxial fabrics and the alteration in textile quality by such processes are predominantly addressed. For this purpose, a test method for bulk and compaction characteristics is described as well as two test methods to characterize the in-plane (shear) deformation behaviour, one for biaxial and another for tri- and quadraxial warp-knitted fabrics. From the application of the test methods, results on the identification of the ply structure and textile production parameters governing this deformation behaviour are also presented. The area of processability is completed with a simple test on the infuseablity of the NCF with resin. For assessment of textile quality, methods to quantify the fibre angle deviations, both in and perpendicular to the textile plane are presented, as well as a method to assess the influences of the knitting yarn induced ply distortions. All tests can already be performed on the <b>dry</b> <b>textile,</b> before laminate specimen manufacturing and preparation. Concerning the laminate mechanical properties, examinations are made as to how the different structures of the <b>dry</b> <b>textile</b> are transferred into laminate structures.

Thus, they allow a more structured and objective assessment of new NCF {{semi-finished products}} and the identification of weak points early in the selection process, to make a more precise and efficient material development possible.
