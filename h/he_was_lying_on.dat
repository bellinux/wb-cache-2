5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight and felt the League did little {{to protect him from}} players wanting {{to make a name for}} themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the ice.|$|E

500|$|Having {{finished}} work early, Parker and Toms were walking {{to visit her}} friend's house when they were confronted by a gang of around ten Pakistani youths, {{some of whom were}} wearing balaclavas; the 2002 trial judge concluded that they had planned to find [...] "a white male to attack simply because he was white" [...] in the context of [...] "hostility {{on the part of some}} of the younger white residents of the city against the Asian community". They warned Parker he had [...] "better start running", but then blocked his path and quickly sprayed him in the face with CS gas. He was punched in the stomach then stabbed three times from behind through the throat and chest with a foot-long hunting knife. The knife penetrated completely through his body on two occasions and as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the ground he was repeatedly kicked and struck with a panel beater's hammer.|$|E

2500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the church is the natural lighting, {{facilitated}} by the all-white interior. It is achieved by means of high lateral windows across the entire width of the nave or, {{in the case of the}} smaller rooms, through sidelights bringing daylight in from the courtyards. In addition, there are extensive skylights which, in Utzon's words, result from [...] "the inspiration that I derived from the drifting clouds above the sea and the shore [...] a wondrous space in which the light fell through the ceiling — the clouds — down on to the floor represented by the shore and the sea." [...] Indeed, Utzon was inspired to design the church when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> a Hawaii beach, shortly after his premature departure from Australia as a result of disagreements over the Sydney Opera House. Contemplating a regular succession of cylindrical clouds, he concluded that they provided a perfect basis for modelling a church ceiling.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its first}} report, {{submitted}} in September 2010, the UN fact-finding mission {{found that the}} IDF broke international law, {{and that there was}} evidence sufficient to initiate prosecutions for breaches of the Geneva Convention. The report stated that: [...] "The conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla passengers was not only disproportionate to the occasion but demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence," [...] and determined that Israeli commandos summarily executed six passengers aboard the MV Mavi Marmara. It cites forensic analysis indicating that Furgan Dogan was shot five times, including once in the face while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> his back. [...] "All of the entry wounds were {{on the back of his}} body except for the face wound, which entered the right of his nose", the report concluded.

2500|$|The LAPD did {{not allow}} Mătăsăreanu to receive medical attention, stating that {{ambulance}} personnel were following standard procedure in hostile situations by refusing to enter [...] "the hot zone," [...] as Mătăsăreanu was still considered to be dangerous, and because there were still reports and/or the belief {{that there was a}} third gunman still loose. Some reports indicate that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the ground with no weapons for approximately an hour before ambulances arrived, and was groaning in pain and pleading for help. A lawsuit on behalf of Mătăsăreanu's children was filed against members of the LAPD, claiming that Mătăsăreanu's civil rights had been violated and that he was allowed to bleed to death. The lawsuit was tried in United States District Court in February and March 2000, and ended in a mistrial with a hung jury. The suit was later dropped when Mătăsăreanu's family agreed to dismiss the action with a waiver of malicious prosecution.|$|E

Cornell was 52 years old. Footage of his final concert was posted on YouTube. Cornell's wife said, [...] "When we spoke after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different.

2500|$|In one of {{the most}} famous matches in {{professional}} wrestling history, Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential bumps. The first one came as both wrestlers were brawling on top of the cell, and The Undertaker threw Mankind from the top of the cage from a height of (22ft [...] including angle of the fall) and sent him crashing through the Spanish announcers' table, prompting announcer Jim Ross to famously shout, [...] "Good God Almighty! Good God Almighty! That killed him! As God as my witness, he is broken in half!". Foley remained motionless underneath debris, while The Undertaker remained on top of the cell staring down. Terry Funk was the first person on the scene, followed by WWE's resident doctor, François Petit, and various others, including a concerned-looking Vince McMahon. Foley was placed on a stretcher and began to be wheeled out to the arena. While The Undertaker was still atop the cage, the cage actually had to be raised in order to make room for the stretcher to reach Foley as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> the opposite side of the ring to the entrance aisle. Moments later, there was commotion on the entrance ramp as Foley got up from the stretcher and proceeded to make his way back to the cage, climbing to the top of the cell, with The Undertaker doing likewise (this time they both climbed the cage surprisingly quickly despite Foley having suffered a dislocated shoulder due to the fall, and The Undertaker wrestling with a broken foot that night). With both men back on the top of the cell the match resumed.|$|E
