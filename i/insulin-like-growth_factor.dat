40|$|Obesity {{and type}} 2 {{diabetes}} are two risk factors of breast cancer, especially after menopause. Underlying mechanisms are multiple and include hyperinsulinism due to insulin resistance (insulin, as <b>insulin-like-growth</b> <b>factor</b> -IGF-, is a growth factor), hyperleptinaemia associated with hypoadiponectinaemia, {{and high levels of}} estrogens resulting from aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue. In presence of {{type 2 diabetes}} associated with obesity, hyperglycaemia might provide energy substrate promoting tumour growth. These data have therapeutic implications with expected favourable effects of weight loss, resulting in a reduction of fat mass and insulin resistance, and the promising results recently reported with metformin contrasting with the negative effects of exogenous administration of high doses of insulin.

40|$|International audiencePhysical {{exercise}} {{has been}} shown to stimulate neurogenesis, increase resistance to brain trauma and disease, improve learning and increase levels of growth factors. We show that low intensity exercise has profound effects on the phenotype of a mouse mutant with progressive motor neuronopathy.

When mice undergo low intensity exercise, their lifespan increased by 74 %, they exhibited a decreased loss of motoneurons, improved muscle integrity and a twofold increase in proliferating cells in the spinal cord. The molecular mechanism of neuroprotection may be related to <b>insulin-like-growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 (IGF- 1) since injections of antibodies to IGF- 1 abrogated the effects of exercise on the increased life-span.

40|$|Italy. It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that healthy centenarians have more favorable anthropometric characteristics and insulin-mediated glucose uptake than aged subjects. The plasma <b>insulin-like-growth</b> <b>factor</b> I (IGF-I) concentration may account for such differences. Three groups of subjects were studied: 1) adults (� 50 yr; n � 30), 2) aged subjects (75 – 99 yr; n � 30), 3) centenarians (� 100 yr; n � 19). In all subjects, fasting plasma IGF-I, IGF-binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3), leptin, and lipid concentrations were determined; body composition was assessed by bioimpedance analysis; and insulin-mediated glucose uptake was evaluated by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp. IGF-I declined with advancing age, but no differences between aged subjects and centenarians were found. IGFBP- 3 showed a trend similar to IGF-I, but lower values were present in centenarians than i...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disorder of unknown origin, which ultimately leads to death. Several growth {{factors such as}} IGFs (<b>insulin-like-growth</b> <b>factor)</b> and IGFBPs (insulin like growth factor binding proteins) seem to take part to the pathogenesis. We evaluated IGFs and IGFBPs in serum from patients with IPF and healthy subjects including 24 untreated IPF and 26 IPF receiving anti-fibrotic therapy and to compare them with healthy subjects. METHODS: Serum of 50 idiopathic {{pulmonary fibrosis}} and 55 healthy subjects (HS) were analysed by ELISA for IGFs and IGFBPs, TGF-beta and KL- 6, the latter being tested as positive control in IPF. RESULTS: Serum levels of IGFBP- 1 and IGFBP- 2 and KL- 6 were significantly higher in the IPF group than in the healthy subjects (p < 0. 05, p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 0001 respectively) while the picture was inversed regarding IGFs. By contrast {{there was no significant}} difference between the groups with respect to TGF-beta. IGFBP- 2 was significantly reduced in the patients with specific anti-fibrotic therapy pirfenidone and nintedanib compared to untreated patients (p < 0. 05) but still significantly elevated in comparison to HS (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Serum IGFBP- 1 and - 2 are increased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and IGFBP- 2 may be reduced by anti-fibrosing therapy. IGFBPs may be promising biomarkers in IPF. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mexican Americans are {{the fastest}} aging {{segment of the}} U. S. population, yet little {{scientific}} literature exists regarding the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) among this segment of the population. The extant literature suggests that biomarkers of AD will vary according to race/ethnicity though no prior work has explicitly studied this possibility. The {{aim of this study}} was to create a serum-based biomarker profile of AD among Mexican American. Methods: Data were analyzed from 363 Mexican American participants (49 AD and 314 normal controls) enrolled in the Texas Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s Research 2 ̆ 6 Care Consortium (TARCC). Non-fasting serum samples were analyzed using a luminex-based multi-plex platform. A biomarker profile was generated using random forest analyses. Results: The biomarker profile of AD among Mexican Americans was different from prior work from non-Hispanic populations with regards to the variable importance plots. In fact, many of the top markers were related to metabolic factors (e. g., FABP, GLP- 1, CD 40, pancreatic polypeptide, <b>insulin-like-growth</b> <b>factor,</b> and insulin). The biomarker profile was a significant classifier of AD status yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0. 77, 0. 92, and 0. 64, respectively. Combining biomarkers with clinical variables yielded a better balance of sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: The biomarker profile for AD among Mexican American cases is significantly different from that previously identified among non-Hispanic cases from many large-scale studies. This is the first study to explicitly examine and provide support for blood-based biomarkers of AD among Mexican Americans. Areas for future research are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Ataxia {{telangiectasia}} (AT) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by progressive ataxia, neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. Pathoanatomical studies reported a degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells as the striking feature of the disease. Although recent studies suggested the involvement of extracerebellar structures such as the brainstem and basal ganglia, this has rarely been studied in human AT. Thus, we performed a detailed cliniconeuroradiological investigation of 11 AT patients, aged 8 to 26 years by collecting clinical neurological data, ataxia scores, growth status, body mass index (BMI), growth hormone (GH), and <b>insulin-like-growth</b> <b>factor</b> 1 (IGF- 1) and correlated them to extracerebellar neuroimaging findings in human AT. Neuroimaging was done by cranial and spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T 1 - and T 2 -weighted spin-echo and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences. We compared clinical and neuroradiological findings of six patients with IGF- 1 levels and BMI below the third percentile to five patients with normal IGF- 1 serum levels and BMI above the third percentile. Three of the six first mentioned patients older than 20 years and two patients older than 12 years showed noticeable high Klockgether ataxia scores above 25 points. Three of these patients presented with marked hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white matter of T 2 -weighted MR images. Interestingly, all six patients suffered from marked spinal atrophy. Two of the patients presented with severe extra-pyramidal symptoms, but only one patient showed associated MRI abnormalities of the basal ganglia. MRI in patients with normal IGF- 1 levels showed the expected cerebellar lesions in four patients, whereas spinal atrophy was found only in two patients. There was no affection of the cerebral white matter or basal ganglia in this group. We conclude that central cerebral white matter affection, spinal atrophy, and extrapyramidal symptoms are more often present in patients with pronounced deficiency of the GH/IGF- 1 axis accompanied by markedly reduced body weight and high ataxia scores. This may point to a major role of IGF- 1 and nutritional status in neuroprotective signaling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Insulin-like-growth</b> <b>factor</b> II (IGF II) {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of neoplasm of different tissues, including liver of rats and men. This growth factor is believed to exert its effect during cellular proliferation. During the process of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), different hepatic altered foci appear. They {{are believed to be}} the putative precursors of HCC in rats and in men. Thus, to study the role of the gene in a defined model of hepatocarcinogenesis was the target to elucidate its role in various cancer phenotypes during the entire development stage of cancer, right from earlier preneoplastic lesions to HCC Methods Antisense in situ hybridization technique was used here to characterize the type(s) of foci in which IGF II mRNA had expressed during the development of hepatocarcinogenesis-induced by diethylnitrosamine and promoted by phenobarbital in rats. Various focal lesions have been categorized depending on the stages and sizes along with IGF II expression patterns in them. Immunohistochemical detection for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was made to detect the role of the gene in preneoplastic and neoplastic cellular proliferation. Results IGF II expression was located in the glycogen-storage acidophilic cell foci maximally followed by mixed cell lesions and the least in basophilic lesions. The expression of IGF II was found to be predominant in the HCC. The expression of gene was also located at the peripheral cells of spongiosis hepatis which are believed to be the precursor of ito cell carcinoma. It was noted that there is a direct correlation between IGF II expression and Immunohistochemical detection for PCNA. Conclusion It may be concluded that IGF II gene expression plays an important role during the development of neoplasia and the gene expresses in the sequence of events leading from glycogen-rich-acidophilic lesions to glycogen poor basophilic lesions to HCC with an expression pattern of “high-low-high” in terms of degree of expression. Moreover, the essential role of the gene at the immediate initiation stage of carcinogenesis (first few weeks) and during HCC development cannot be ignored. Thus this expression {{can be used as a}} suitable marker for very early detection of the cancerous process and can save numbers of future cancer victims by very early detection of this disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fish are {{becoming}} {{more important in the}} human diet as they represent a high protein source and a source of essential free fatty acids. Fish production from aquaculture has been improved by the selection of faster growing individuals, but fish continue to remain an expensive nutrient source. A better understanding of fish growth mechanisms and regulation will help to further improve aquaculture techniques. Moreover, studying those factors that stimulate cells implicated in fish muscle growth could provide useful knowledge and possible applications in mammalian muscle illness. In contrast to mammals and birds, fish growth is generally indeterminate and most fish grow throughout their life by the formation of new muscle cells (hyperplasia) and/or by increasing muscle cell volume (hypertrophy). Proliferation and differentiation of muscle cells are regulated by transcription factors called myogenic regulatory factors (MRF). MyoD and myogenin are MRF involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in vertebrates. Many factors affect fish growth including external factors such as temperature and food availability, and internal factors, principally hormones. The effects of temperature on fish growth and metabolism were assessed in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and the effects of hormones were investigated using Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) made transgenic for growth hormone (GH) and rainbow trout fed beta-agonists. In order to understand the mechanisms and regulation of myogenesis, morphometric parameters were recorded, metabolic enzymes were assayed in liver and skeletal muscle and myogenesis was measured in white and red muscles in each experiment. Moreover, several growth factors and hormones were tested in vitro on myosatellite cell proliferation and differentiation. The results demonstrate that metabolism and myogenesis are not affected by the same factors, and an increase in growth is not absolutely accompanied by an effect on tissue metabolism. High and constant water temperatures increased juvenile cod growth though there were no significant alterations in liver and white muscle metabolism. In contrast, factors such as photoperiod and internal cycles appear to be more important in the control of cod tissue metabolism. However, myogenesis was significantly decreased and metabolism increased in rainbow trout exposed to cold compared with high temperatures. Growth hormone, <b>insulin-like-growth</b> <b>factor</b> I (IGF- 1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) were found to increase in vitro myosatellite cell proliferation in salmonids. My results also show that proliferation and differentiation of salmon muscle does not happen simultaneously but may alternate in red and white muscles. These results taken together contribute to a better understanding offish muscle growth and metabolism and will be used in future studies to optimize fish growth in aquaculture...|$|E
