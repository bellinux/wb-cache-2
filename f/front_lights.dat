25|$|The lux (lx) is this SI {{unit for}} illuminance, {{that is the}} amount of light that {{illuminates}} a surface (the road, {{in the case of a}} bike light) per unit area at a given point, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. Some manufacturers indicate the illuminance their <b>front</b> <b>lights</b> provide to the road at a point located a standard distance right in front of the bicycle.|$|E
25|$|The Ford Escort was revised in January 1995, {{although}} it was still based on the previous model. This version had new <b>front</b> <b>lights,</b> bonnet, front wings, front and rear bumpers, wing mirrors, door handles and 4 different front radiator grilles (slats, honeycomb, circles and chrome). At the rear, the Ford logo moved from the right to {{the centre of the}} boot, except for the van and convertible models. The interior of the car was hugely revised too following heavy criticism of the original 1990 car which featured low quality plastics for its interior mouldings - the car now featured an all new dashboard arrangement of competitive quality. However, the underlying car was now five years old and most of its rivals were either new or to be imminently replaced.|$|E

2500|$|The {{change in}} the body style from the Mark B was both {{functional}} and aesthetic. The Mark C utilised the same 180° steering lock and worm and sector steering system that {{was seen in the}} prototype Commercial and the front wings allowed for ample clearance at full lock. They also addressed a demand from customers for a [...] "greater smoothness of line", and allowed a more robust location for the mounting of the <b>front</b> <b>lights.</b> Other improvements included rod and cable operated brakes on all three wheels, which [...] "appreciably shortens stopping distances." ...|$|E

Having in the {{preceding}} chapter seen the grounds on which to explain and justify Turner's choice of facts, we proceed to examine finally those modes of representing them introduced by him;--modes so utterly at variance with the received doctrines {{on the subject of}} art, as to cause his works to be regarded with contempt, or severe blame, by all reputed judges, at the period of their first appearance. And, chiefly, I must confirm and farther illustrate the general statements made respecting light and shade in the chapters on Truth of Tone,[13] and on Infinity,[14] deduced from the great fact (§ 5. chapter on Truth of Tone) that [...] "nature surpasses us in power of obtaining light as much as the sun surpasses white paper." [...] I found that this part of the book was not well understood, because people in general have no idea how much the sun does surpass white paper. In order to know this practically, let the reader take a piece of pure white drawing-paper, and place it in the position in which a drawing is usually seen. This is, properly, upright (all drawings being supposed to be made on vertical planes), as a picture is seen on a room wall. Also, the usual place in which paintings or drawings are seen is at some distance from a window, with a gentle side light falling upon them, <b>front</b> <b>lights</b> being unfavorable to nearly all drawing. Therefore the highest light an artist can ordinarily command for his work is that of white paint, or paper, under a gentle side light.[15] But if we wished to get as much light as possible, and to place the artist under the most favorable circumstances, we should take the drawing near the window. Put therefore your white paper upright, and take it to the window. Let ac, cd, be two sides of your room, with a window at bb. Under ordinary circumstances your picture would be hung at e, or in some such position on the wall cd. First, therefore, put your paper upright at e, and then bring it gradually to the window, in the successive positions f, g, and (opening the window) finally at p. You will notice that as you come nearer the window the light gradually increases on the paper; so that in the position at p it is far better lighted than it was at e. If, however, the sun actually falls upon it at p, the experiment is unfair, for the picture is not meant to be seen in sunshine, and your object is to compare pure white paper, as ordinarily used, with sunshine. So either take a time when the sun does not shine at all, or does not shine in the window where the experiment is to be tried; or else keep the paper so far within the window that the sun may not touch it. Then the experiment is perfectly fair, and you will find that you have the paper at p in full, serene, pictorial light, of the best kind, and highest attainable power.|$|E
