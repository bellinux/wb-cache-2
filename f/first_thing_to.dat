25|$|There {{really are}} two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{notice when}} {{working within the}} ring Z of {{integers}} {{is that if the}} prime number q is [...] 3 (mod 4) then every quadratic residue (mod q) is also a biquadratic residue (mod q). The first supplement of quadratic reciprocity states that 1 is a quadratic nonresidue (mod q), so that for any integer x, one of x and x is a quadratic residue and the other one is a nonresidue. Thus, if r [...] a2 (mod q) is a quadratic residue, then if a [...] b2 is a residue, r [...] a2 [...] b4 (mod q) is a biquadratic residue, and if a is a nonresidue, a is a residue, a [...] b2, and again, r [...] (a)2 [...] b4 (mod q) [...] is a biquadratic residue.|$|E

That evening, Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis presided over a large meeting in Boston's Melodeon Hall, while Lucy Stone served as secretary. Stone, Henry C.

Garrison, whose name had headed the first woman suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature the previous year, said, [...] "I conceive that the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done by the women of this country is to demand their political enfranchisement.

2500|$|On December 15, 2014, Coburn stalled the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act {{aimed at}} {{stemming}} veteran suicides. [...] The bill {{would require a}} report on successful veteran suicide prevention programs and allow the VA to pay incentives to hire psychiatrists.

[...] “It’s a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide,” he said. “If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen.

2500|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{realize is}} that the pawn {{may be able to}} queen unassisted by his king, simply by {{advancing}} to the queening square before the opposing king can capture or block the pawn. The rule of the square is useful in determining whether the pawn can queen unassisted, or whether the king can stop the pawn. In this position, the pawn is on the fifth square from the queening square (counting the queening square itself). [...] A square of five by five squares with the queening square in one corner and the pawn in an adjacent corner can be imagined. (Often, the easiest method of constructing the square is to draw a diagonal mentally from the pawn to the last rank; this is the diagonal of the square). [...] If the black king can move into this square, he can stop the pawn, otherwise the pawn wins the race. In this position, if it is Black's move, he can move to b4 and enter the square, therefore he can stop the pawn. If it is White's move, the pawn advances, the square shrinks to four by four, and the king cannot move into the square, so the pawn queens [...] See [...] for further discussion on the rule of the square.|$|E
