500|$|Henderson, who {{had fallen}} behind the net, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the front of the}} net where he was uncovered. Henderson {{recovered}} the rebound of Esposito's shot, shot the puck and was stopped, but recovered the rebound. With Tretiak down, he put the puck past Tretiak with only 34 seconds to play. Foster Hewitt's voice rose in excitement as he called the winning goal: ...|$|E
60|$|Nelson <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{where the}} boatâ€™s crew were sitting after having {{finished}} their meal.|$|E
60|$|She <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the table, {{and felt}} inside the {{pie-dish}} {{again with a}} spoon.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, whistled <b>and</b> drummed, then <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out.|$|R

60|$|A {{second man}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and {{drinking}} near Madame Defarge's counter. A third man <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{suddenly}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> peer at the stranger, poking {{his face}} close to Aaron's face.|$|E
60|$|So {{before the}} sun rose he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the house of the}} Gruagach, who was sitting outside.|$|E
60|$|Dr Thorne {{had nothing}} more to say, so he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> his patient in the next room.|$|E
60|$|Peterson nodded. Two {{more men}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out. The Captain drank some water and sighed.|$|R
60|$|Jethro <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{over to the}} window, {{where he}} stood with his back toward her.|$|R
60|$|John <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{over to the}} window; he, too, {{had been}} {{affected}} by her face.|$|R
60|$|Harry <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the boats, and {{returned}} directly with a joint of meat. Tom {{looked up in}} surprise.|$|E
60|$|Wally <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the window. Jill could smile safely now, and she did, but {{her voice}} was still grave.|$|E
60|$|Fan <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the next}} room, where her supper and a lighted lamp {{were on the}} centre table. Rosie {{followed}} her.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Flanders <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{over to the}} fender {{and stroked}} Topaz on the neck behind the ears.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999: Giuseppe Guerini, {{who broke}} away on his own, {{collided}} with a spectator but <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{on to win the}} stage.|$|R
60|$|The {{landlord}} {{left the}} room, and {{a minute or}} two later the man who had spoken to Hector <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} just one o'clock that Denis woke. He at once <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Ralph's side. The latter opened his eyes.|$|E
60|$|She <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the window, {{looking across}} the snowy field to her own home, nestled between the grove of firs and the orchard.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{interval}} of silence, and then I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the fireplace where the bacon and sausages stood upon a trivet.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the two of}} them <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> away, walking arm-in-arm like {{friends and}} amiable men, as they were in their own fashion.|$|R
60|$|That was {{his whole}} speech for the evening, {{in a note}} of {{suppressed}} passion, and presently, against all our etiquette, he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, for the land's sake," [...] said Cecilia Merritt feebly, as she tied on her gingham sunbonnet. She <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{home in a}} daze.|$|R
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the cabinet}} {{which he had}} brought up with him from Crowswood, {{unlocked}} it, and produced {{the piece of paper}} and the coin.|$|E
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the window. The rain leaped at {{the glass}} like a frolicking puppy. It {{seemed to want to}} get inside and play with Mr. Bennett.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the door}} to look out towards the harbour. [...] "All quiet," [...] he said; [...] "I wonder if Sotillo really means to turn up here?" ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went.</b> Defeat was {{apparent}} enough, {{although it was}} unexpected. Lois stole back to the house--stole {{back to her room}} and locked the door.|$|R
60|$|Upon which, {{every man}} looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out.|$|R
60|$|He {{was quiet}} {{afterwards}} {{and let the}} others talk, until Carrie <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> away with Mrs. Winter and Jake. When the door shut Dick looked up.|$|R
60|$|The {{chief counsel}} for the Northeastern Railroads <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the window, where he stood for some time with his back turned to the president. Then Hilary Vane faced about.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the monkey}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the dairy, and drank all the milk he could find. Afterwards he {{returned}} home and married, {{and that is the}} last we heard of him.|$|E
60|$|Presently Marston <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the general}} office where he interviewed the young manager. He {{did not say}} much, {{but he was very}} firm and when he {{returned}} to his room the other shrugged.|$|E
60|$|All {{the morning}} he grumbled incessantly, until at length, warned by an {{offensive}} smell of rum that dinner was on the table, he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> below.|$|R
60|$|Daylight {{was still}} {{lingering}} when Roy <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{out on the}} porch. His keen ears had heard something. Helen fancied she herself had heard rapid hoof-beats.|$|R
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out, {{leaving the}} sense of mystery behind him. He could not stay any longer, because the witching hour of flute-playing was drawing near.|$|R
