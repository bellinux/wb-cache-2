Adjoining the western perimeter wall, but outside the prison on the northern side of the terrace compound, is staff accommodation.

50|$|The {{municipality}} has {{an average}} altitude of forty meters above sea level. There are three main terrain types, mountain terrain, semi <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>flat</b> <b>areas.</b> The mountains consist of the Sierra de la Laguna and the Sierra de San Lázaro, both formed of volcanic rock, covering about fifteen {{percent of the}} total territory with peaks between 400 and 1000 meters. The semi <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> are located between the coast and the mountain ranges, mostly of sedimentary rock and account for sixty percent of the territory. The <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> are along the coast, beaches and alluvial plains, which account for twenty five percent of the territory.|$|R

5|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, four ceramic sherds {{were found in}} the vicinity which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; although most of these were dated to the fourth century, the sherds reflected all four centuries of this period. Dated to the fourth century was a hut that had been erected on a <b>flat</b> <b>area</b> adjacent to the barrow. Evidence of human activity at this hut was found in the form of 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} east the freeway is routed across a <b>flat</b> <b>area</b> between the Book Cliffs and the Colorado River, called Sagers Flat. Along {{the way it}} passes by the towns of Crescent Junction, Thompson Springs and Cisco. Natural {{features}} visible from this portion include Arches National Park and Castle Valley. Other listed attractions along the byway near this section include Canyonlands National Park and various areas with Morrison Formation, a layer of rock where dinosaur remains are common. I-70, US-6, and US-50 all enter Colorado concurrently. Where I-70 follows the Book Cliffs, it was built parallel to or on top of US-6/50.|$|E

One of the longest trails on the Gifford Pinchot, Boundary Trail #1, has its eastern terminus in the Midway High Lakes area at Council Lake. Other trails in the area include the Council Bluff Trail #117, Green Mountain Trail #110, and East Canyon Trail #265.|$|E
5|$|Safety and {{security}} required a remote, isolated and unpopulated area. The scientists also wanted a <b>flat</b> <b>area</b> to minimize secondary {{effects of the}} blast, and with little wind to spread radioactive fallout. Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert Training Area and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Ratanakiri Province is diverse, encompassing rolling hills, mountains, plateaus, lowland watersheds, and crater lakes. Two major rivers, Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, flow {{from east to}} west across the province. The province is known for its lush forests; as of 1997, 70–80% of the province was forested, either with old-growth forest or with secondary forest regrown after shifting cultivation. In the far north of the province are mountains of the Annamite Range; the area is characterized by dense broadleaf evergreen forests, relatively poor soil, and abundant wildlife. In the highlands between Tonle San and Tonle Srepok, the home of the vast majority of Ratanakiri's population, a hilly basalt plateau provides fertile red soils. Secondary forests dominate this region. South of the Srepok River is a <b>flat</b> <b>area</b> of tropical deciduous forests.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission of}} the ARVN central column was to advance down {{the valley of the}} Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} <b>flat</b> <b>area</b> of brush interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|This region's land is {{appropriate}} for agricultural and livestock activities. It is mostly a <b>flat</b> <b>area,</b> interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Maritime polar air from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes - a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas {{are influenced by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year often leads to higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging from an average of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer.|$|E
5|$|Elevation rise {{across the}} park results from land uplift along the Burnside-Eden fault zone. This zone {{is a major}} land fault {{separating}} the Adelaide Plains from the Mount Lofty Ranges and runs north-north-east across the park from its southwest corner. The park is underlain by neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Burra Group overlying a Precambrian crystalline basement. Sediments were formed approximately 700million years ago (mya) from sand washed into a shallow sea. Sand layers were then folded and slightly metamorphosed during the delamerian orogeny, a period of mountain building caused by tectonic plate movements and resulting east–west compression of Australia. This pushed up a mountain range, {{on the site of}} the present Mount Lofty Ranges, approximately 450mya. The range was eroded to a level plain over the following 350million years. Approximately 40mya, the location of today's ranges and plains were flat, with a hard sedimentary capping. About 2mya, block faulting raised the Mount Lofty Ranges, and much of the former land surface west of the ranges eroded away. The Gun Emplacement is a small remnant of this pre-erosion surface. It is a raised semi-circular <b>flat</b> <b>area</b> and has views over much of Adelaide from the southwestern corner of the park. The Emplacement is seen as an important regolith deposit, particularly for its role in understanding Adelaide's landscape's evolution. The Emplacement was declared a Geological Monument in 1978 for this geologic importance as well as its aesthetic and recreational value.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMany real objects, such as faces, sculptures, or low-reliefs are {{composed}} of many detailed parts {{that can not be}} easily modeled by an artist nor by 3 D scanning. In this paper, we propose a new shape from shading (SfS) approach to rapidly model details of these objects such as wrinkles and reliefs of surfaces from one photograph. The method first determines the surface's <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> in the photograph. Then, it constructs a graph of relative altitudes between each of these <b>flat</b> <b>areas.</b> We circumvent the ill-posed problem of shape from shading by having the user set if some of these <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> are a local maximum or a local minimum; additional points can be added by the user (e. g. at discontinuous creases) – this is the only user input. We use an intuitive mass-spring based minimization to determine the final position of these <b>flat</b> <b>areas</b> and a fast-marching method to generate the surface. This process can be iterated until the user is satisfied with the resulting surface. We illustrate our approach on real faces and low-relief photographs...|$|R
