5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption {{driven by}} the expansion of steam. When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam, water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid rock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the <b>explosive</b> <b>force,</b> outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The large {{spillway}} tunnels {{have only}} been used twice, for testing in 1941 and because of flooding in 1983. During both times, when inspecting the tunnels after the spillways were used, engineers found major damage to the concrete linings and underlying rock. The 1941 damage was attributed to a slight misalignment of the tunnel invert (or base), which caused cavitation, a phenomenon in fast-flowing liquids in which vapor bubbles collapse with <b>explosive</b> <b>force.</b> In response to this finding, the tunnels were patched with special heavy-duty concrete and {{the surface of the}} concrete was polished mirror-smooth. The spillways were modified in 1947 by adding flip buckets, which both slow the water and decrease the spillway's effective capacity, in an attempt to eliminate conditions thought to have contributed to the 1941 damage. The 1983 damage, also due to cavitation, led to the installation of aerators in the spillways. Tests at Grand Coulee Dam showed that the technique worked, in principle.|$|E

500|$|The {{underwater}} {{side protection}} had numerous faults, however. It was extremely strong amidships, but weakened on {{either end of}} the citadel.

The bars were constantly under a great deal of stress, due to normal bending forces in the hull. When combined with the <b>explosive</b> <b>force</b> of a torpedo warhead, the bars could not sustain the increased pressure and could fail.

The underwater protection system was constructed out of several layers: the outer layer that was between 12–66mm (.47–2.6in) thick, directly underneath the main armoured belt, was designed to detonate the torpedo warhead.
