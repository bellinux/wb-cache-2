40|$|International audienceUsing {{sedimentary}} miliacin (olean- 18 -en- 3 β-ol methyl ether) as {{a molecular}} tracer {{of the history}} of Panicum miliaceum (broomcorn millet) cultivation depends upon broomcorn millet being sedimentary miliacin's dominant source. It also requires knowledge of the variability in miliacin concentration in broomcorn millet. Finally, it is affected by the presence of other pentacyclic triterpene methyl ethers (PTMEs) that may exist in conjunction with miliacin in other sources but not in broomcorn millet. Miliacin biosynthesis has been proposed for other Panicum species, Setaria italica (<b>Italian</b> or foxtail <b>millet),</b> Pennisetum sp., and Chaetomium olivaceum (an olive green mold). We found miliacin concentration in seeds of different varieties of P. miliaceum to be similarly high (with trace amounts of β- and α-amyrin methyl ethers). It was absent from hulls and roots, and nominally present in leaves and stems. The transfer of miliacin from plant to sediments is therefore mostly from seeds. it was abundant (often with larger amounts of β- and α-amyrin methyl ethers) in all other Panicum species studied, but only in some species of the genus Pennisetum and was absent from Setaria italica. Neither C. olivaceum nor its growth medium (rice) showed any trace of miliacin. Our results, with miliacin absent from S. italica and C. olivaceum, its high miliacin in seed of P. miliaceum relative to other PTMEs and to other grasses and, considering the high biomass that cultivated broomcorn millet has relative to other potential plant sources, support the use of sedimentary records of miliacin in some contexts to track past millet agricultural dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai in {{collaboration}} with Bioversity International, Rome has been implementing a project on neglected and underutilized crops {{with the support of}} the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Rome. The neglected and underutilized crops chosen for this study included finger <b>millet</b> (Eleusine coracana), <b>Italian</b> or foxtail <b>millet</b> (Setaria italica) and little millet (Panicum sumatrense). Two locations where these crops have been traditionally under cultivation and intrinsically linked with food security, livelihood and cultural identity of local tribal communities, were chosen as target sites. These crops by virtue of their extremely high resilience to the harsh agro-climatic conditions, particularly in marginal soils, hilly terrain and under aberrant rainfall, are well adapted to offer a dependable level of food security to the poor. They are also valued for their better nutritious profile of the grains and high quality straw. The grains have high bio-available minerals, particularly calcium and iron, vitamins, dietary fibre, and other phyto-chemicals. Their unique physico-chemical composition renders them slow digestible and with low glycemic index, which is a valued nutraceutical property in food grains. The long shelf life of these grains is also an attribute preferred by the communities living in regions characterized by poor communication. A unique aspect of this study was that major activities were carried out in farmer participatory mode with a location specific blend of traditional and scientific know how. Major activity components and their outcome in enhancing food and nutritional security and income generation of the communities discussed in the paper are participatory seed selection, shift from marginal to modern crop management, seed selection and quality seed production and sharing, promotion of local landraces, value addition of grain and value chain development to achieve enhanced income, particularly to farm women, multifaceted capacity building, strengthening of common property local infrastructure and creation of community institutions for building sustainability to the change. The paper also discusses the increasing relevance of these crop species in the context of advancing climate change. ...|$|R

At present about 150 {{million people are}} affected by diabetes globally and in India the figure is 40 million. Various foods and herbs have been tested for management of diabetes of which millets have been widely tested and found successful. The evaluation of <b>Italian</b> <b>millet</b> based diabetic mix was carried out through the Institution Village Linkage Programme (IVLP) in rural areas of Dharwad Taluka of Karnataka. Based on the focus group discussion fifteen diabetic volunteers were selected for 6 months intervention study from Mugali, Madanabhavi and Hosatti villages of Karnataka. They were counselled regarding dietary modifications, medications, use of diabetic mix and preparation of millet recipes. The diabetics consumed 80 g diabetic mix per day for 6 months. The height, weight, random blood glucose, dietary practices were recorded {{before and after the}} intervention. The nutritional status of the diabetics improved as assessed by body mass index (BMI). Organoleptic evaluation showed high acceptability of the mix. After the intervention the normal glucose response was found in 60 per cent subjects compared to initial assessment of 20 per cent. Only 20 per cent subjects were categorised into impaired glucose tolerance and 20 per cent as diabetics. Thus <b>Italian</b> <b>millet</b> based mix helped to control glycemic responses of rural diabetics. About half of the subjects restricted the use of sugar, sweets, jaggery, rice and ghee.

At the flowering stage it usually enters the inner side of the flowering glume, and is found stuck to the inner wall of flowering glume until next spring. The number of the nematode found on well-developed unhulledgrain is larger than that on waste unhulled-grain. Examination of the distribution of the nematode on rice straw {{at the beginning of the}} next season, indicates that the population of the nematode is extemely dense on the residual grain. On straw after perfect thrashing, there were found no significant differences in numbers of living nematode due to height difference.

40|$|Rice blast disease {{resistance}} to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea is triggered by a physical interaction between the protein products of the host R (resistance) gene, Pi-ta, and the pathogen Avr (avirulence) gene, AVR-pita. The genotype variation and resistant/susceptible phenotype at the Pi-ta locus of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the ancestor of cultivated rice (O. sativa), was surveyed in 36 locations worldwide to study the molecular evolution and functional adaptation of the Pi-ta gene. The low nucleotide polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene of O. rufipogon {{was similar to that}} of O. sativa, but greatly differed from what has been reported for other O. rufipogon genes. The haplotypes can be subdivided into two divergent haplogroups named H 1 and H 2. H 1 is derived from H 2, with nearly no variation and at a low frequency. H 2 is common and is the ancestral form. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain has a high πnon/πsyn ratio, and the low polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene might have primarily been caused by recurrent selective sweep and constraint by other putative physiological functions. Meanwhile, we provide data to show that the amino acid Ala- 918 of H 1 in the LRR domain has a close relationship with the resistant phenotype. H 1 might have recently arisen during rice domestication and may be associated with the scenario of a blast pathogen–host shift from <b>Italian</b> <b>millet</b> to rice...|$|E

Classical selection indices study {{was carried out in}} 18 Indian genotypes of <b>Italian</b> <b>millet</b> for 13 characters during rainy and spring seasons. The results of classical selection indices indicated that in Indian genotypes GS 448, GS 444, GS 442, and GS 449 for rainy and GS 440, GS 450, GS 451 and GS 448 for spring are to be preferred. In general, the indices, which include more than one character, gave high genetic advance suggesting the utility of selection index for simultaneous improvement of several characters. A selection index of eight characters combination i. e., grain yield per plant, days to 50 % flowering, plant height, number of productive tillers per plant, ear length, ear weight, crude protein content and  calcium content had recorded high genetic advance and relative efficiency over grain yield per plant alone during rainy whereas selection index of nine characters combination i. e., grain yield per plant, days to 50 % flowering, plant height, number of productive tillers per plant, ear length,  ear weight, 1000 grain weight, crude protein content and  calcium content had recorded high genetic advance and relative efficiency over grain yield per plant alone during spring.

40|$|International audienceMiliacin (olean- 18 -en- 3 β-ol methyl ether) is {{a fossil}} {{molecule}} that was recently detected in Lake le Bourget (LlB, French Alps) sediments. Comparison of potential plant producers with plants thriving {{around the lake}} at time of sedimentation concluded that Panicum miliaceum cultivated in the catchment was its most probable source. Since this discovery, it became possible to track the former presence of P. miliaceum over its area of extension and diffusion by detecting miliacin in sediments. This first allowed us reconstructing the history of millet cultivation around LlB, characterized by a beginning around 1700 B. C. and a maximum at 800 B. C. before a drastic drop at the Bronze Age/Iron Age transition. Examination of miliacin in sediments from Lake Lledro (Italy) and Paladru (France) revealed distinct dates of its first occurrence, attesting to a complex pattern of diffusion through the Alps. A twin high resolution record of miliacin in LlB Bronze Age sediments evidences periods of low and high concentrations that could result from varying levels of consumption potentially related to climate changes. While trying tospotpaleo-millet fields cultivated during the Bronze Age around LlB, we have analyzed soils in its surroundings. Miliacin is present but not abundant in soils {{and there is no}} logical pattern in its spatial distribution. Insufficient miliacin concentrations prevented any 14 C measurement that would have ascertained a molecular legacy of soils from Bronze Age millet cultivation. Reversely, we found miliacin in paleosoils from Ukraine that attested to the in situ cultivation of millet by Iron Age nomad populations. Miliacin is not solely produced by P. miliaceum.
