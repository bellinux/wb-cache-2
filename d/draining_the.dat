5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (<b>draining</b> <b>the</b> back of the left ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (<b>draining</b> <b>the</b> bottom of {{the left and right}} ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins drain the front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.|$|E
25|$|Most of the county's {{borders are}} rivers. <b>The</b> Pequannock River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} boundary area. <b>The</b> Pompton River <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> eastern section. The Passaic River also <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> eastern border area. The western border is <b>drained</b> by <b>the</b> Musconetcong River.|$|R
50|$|The Limpach {{river valley}} near Limpach {{has always been}} marshy. The first attempt to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> valley was in the 15th century though it had limited success. In 1746-47 and 1790-91 the first canals were built to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> marshs. The {{municipality}} along with the Cantons of Bern and Solothurn undertook a major project in 1939-51 to completely <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> valley and channel the river. In 1984 two pumping stations were built to help <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> Limpachmoos marsh.|$|R

5|$|In the backstory of , Feolthanos {{established}} a personality cult over Lemurés, labeling {{himself to his}} people as a god. Though Lemurés still {{had a sense of}} peace and paradise, in spite of Yarhi attacks, it was a false paradise due to the Aurcite <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> Aegyl of their anima as part of Feolthanos' plan to destroy Ivalice as revenge against the Occurians.|$|E
5|$|The Seminole Wars {{increased}} the U.S. {{military presence in}} the Everglades, which resulted in the exploration and mapping of many regions that had not previously been recorded. The military officers who had done the mapping and charting of the Everglades were approached by Thomas Buckingham Smith in 1848 to consult on the feasibility of <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> region for agricultural use.|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, WPD {{applied to}} the Environment Agency for a {{discharge}} licence in order to completely drain the reservoir, which was granted in July 2010. The issue was taken to UK Parliament by Jonathan Evans where he stated that an independent report by the Halcrow Group (advising for the Environment Agency) explained that <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> reservoir could create 'new risks to reservoir safety'. Evans' predecessor, Julie Morgan, had previously taken the issue of saving the reservoir site to parliament, and had garnered support from politicians such as Peter Hain (the Welsh Secretary) and Ed Miliband (later leader of the Labour Party), who visited the site during the May 2010 general election campaign, commenting on the site's tranquillity.|$|E

5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E

5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ghats {{form one}} of the four {{watersheds}} of India, feeding the perennial rivers of India. The major river systems originating in the Western Ghats include Godavari, Kaveri, Krishna, Thamiraparani and Tungabhadra. Majority of streams <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> Western Ghats join these rivers and carry large volume of water during the monsoon months. These rivers flow to the east due to the gradient of the land and drain out into the Bay of Bengal. Major tributaries include Kali, Bhadra, Bhavani, Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Hemavathi and Kabini. Periyar, Bharathappuzha, Netravati, Sharavathi, Mandovi and Zuari rivers flow westwards towards the Western Ghats, draining into the Arabian Sea and are fast-moving, owing to the steeper gradient.|$|E
50|$|While in Arizona <b>the</b> Sacramento Wash <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> Sacramento Valley {{southwest}} of Kingman, in Nevada <b>the</b> Piute Wash <b>drains</b> <b>the</b> Piute Valley of southeast Nevada. A separate drainage lies between {{them on the}} Colorado River, the Havasu-Mohave Lakes Drainage. These three drainages, the west, center, and east all <b>drain</b> into <b>the</b> Mohave Valley region.|$|R
50|$|Erica {{began to}} form in 1863. A fuel {{shortage}} prompted large-scale efforts to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> peats {{in the area and}} cut them for fuel. People were drawn to the area and canals were dug, both to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> peat and to transport the cuts. Buckwheat was farmed on <b>the</b> <b>drained</b> peats. Now, <b>the</b> area's primary industry consists of greenhouse cultivation.|$|R
50|$|The {{first attempt}} to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> marshy land around the lake {{was made in the}} 1770s by Johann Rudolf Tschiffeli. He was able to <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> marsh around his country estate but most of the marshy land remained. Around 1780 the course of the Urtenen river was {{corrected}} and its water level dropped, opening up new farmland in the Moossee valley. Further projects in 1855-56 and 1917-20 <b>drained</b> <b>the</b> marshes and adjusted the river course.|$|R
5|$|Although Disston's {{engineered}} canals aided {{water transport}} and steamboat traffic in Florida, he was ultimately unsuccessful in <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> Kissimmee River floodplain or lowering the surface water around Lake Okeechobee {{and in the}} Everglades. He was forced to sell much of his investments {{at a fraction of}} their original costs. However, his land purchase primed Florida's economy and allowed railroad magnates Henry Flagler and Henry Plant to build rail lines down the east coast of Florida, and another joining the west coast, which directly led to the domination of the tourist and citrus industries in Florida. Disston's immediate impact was in the Philadelphia area, where he was active in Republican politics and a philanthropist, but his legacy is often associated with the draining and development of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{contentious}} {{issues facing the}} First Congress during its inaugural session was {{the issue of how}} to raise revenue for the federal government. There were both domestic and foreign Revolutionary War-related debts, as well as a trade imbalance with Great Britain that was crippling American industries and <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> nation of its currency. The first effort to begin addressing these issues resulted in the Tariff of 1789, authorizing the collection of duties on imported goods. Signed into law by the president on July 4, 1789, the act established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry. One year later, the Revenue-Marine was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of ten cutters to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Until Congress established the Navy Department in 1798, it served as the nation's only armed force afloat. Renamed a century later as the Revenue Cutter Service, it and the U.S. Life-Saving Service were merged in 1915 to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E

5|$|Enthusiasts claim {{descent from}} the horses {{painted on the}} cave walls of Lascaux, though {{this has not been}} {{verified}} by scientific studies. Horses have been recorded in the area since at least the 10th century, and the regional type was preferred by magistrates and clergy in medieval times. The Poitevin breed as it is known today began to take shape in the early 17th century, as engineers began <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> French marshes and brought with them their draft horses, which were crossed with native horses. Since early in its history, the Poitevin has been used extensively for the breeding of mules, and although commonly called a draft horse, was not favored for agricultural purposes. During the 19th century, the population of the Poitevin increased, reaching 50,000 pure and crossbred mares by 1867. Crossbreeding with other draft breeds led to concerns about the purity of the Poitevin population, but a small group of breeders worked to preserve the remaining purebred population.|$|E
5|$|In April 1998, the St Germans {{pumping station}} ran at maximum capacity, which was 6134 Ml/d (or 71 tonnes per second), for over 50 hours, and {{this led to}} the {{decision}} to replace it with a brand new installation, with 40% extra capacity. Work started in December 2006, and the pumping station, which is the second largest in Europe, includes a glass wall to enable visitors to see the pumps. The new station was commissioned on 22 April 2010, after which the old station was demolished. A formal opening ceremony was held on 20 April 2011, when the station was opened by Lord James Russell, brother of the Duke of Bedford, and a descendent of the Earl of Bedford who started the process of <b>draining</b> <b>the</b> Fens in the seventeenth century. There are more than one hundred smaller pumping stations scattered throughout the system to maintain the water levels and prevent flooding.|$|E
