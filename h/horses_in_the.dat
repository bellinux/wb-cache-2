5|$|In 1913, the Jockey Club and {{the owners}} of the General Stud Book passed a {{regulation}} named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the race, Secretariat was seen as the {{favorite}} to win by many; however there were doubts about him following a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby.

Many sportswriters believed that the <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a church was present on the site in the Saxon era, although the earliest fabric in the church is Norman.

All styles of English Gothic architecture, are represented in the church: Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular. During the civil war, a group of Roundheads stabled their <b>horses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church. In the 19thcentury the interior of the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott; some wall paintings were revealed, and stained glass was added.|$|E
