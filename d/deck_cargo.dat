5|$|The {{freighter}} {{features a}} large, upward-opening main <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> door on its forward port-side fuselage. Adjacent to this large cargo door is an exit door {{used by the}} pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit, additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as <b>deck</b> <b>cargo.</b> A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} had enough food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|In January 1993, {{following}} {{an order from}} UPS Airlines, Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995. The 767-300F featured a main <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure. In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the , an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER. The first two , featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance radar and other monitoring equipment, were delivered in 1998 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.|$|E
2500|$|United States {{had three}} <b>decks.</b> <b>Cargo</b> {{could have been}} stored on any of them. The ship's hold, where the {{majority}} of a ship's cargo was stored, was not normally considered a deck. Contemporary newspaper accounts specifically mention her [...] "between decks cargo." [...] A [...] "between deck" [...] or [...] "tweendeck" [...] is any deck between the main deck and the ship's hold. [...] "Tweendeck space" [...] is the space between any two continuous decks. The mention of a between <b>decks</b> <b>cargo</b> suggests that her hold was filled to capacity, as, for weight and balance considerations, it would have been loaded first.|$|R

5|$|In June 2008, All Nippon Airways took {{delivery}} of the first 767-300BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), a modified passenger-to-freighter model. The conversion work was performed in Singapore by ST Aerospace Services, the first supplier to offer a 767-300BCF program, and involved {{the addition of a}} main <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> door, strengthened main deck floor, and additional freight monitoring and safety equipment. Since then, Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Wagner Aeronautical have also offered passenger-to-freighter conversion programs for 767-300 series aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF forward fuselage section with a port-side cargo door. The forward two entry doors are retained, resulting in a main <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained stagnant {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a main <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.|$|E
50|$|A {{double-deck}} aircraft has two decks for passengers; {{the second}} deck {{may be only}} a partial deck, and may be above or below the main deck. Most commercial aircraft have one passenger <b>deck</b> and one <b>cargo</b> <b>deck</b> for luggage and ULD containers, {{but only a few}} have two decks for passengers, typically above a third <b>deck</b> for <b>cargo.</b>|$|R
50|$|Design {{capacity}} of the XC-99 was 100000 lb of cargo or 400 fully equipped soldiers on its double <b>cargo</b> <b>decks.</b> A <b>cargo</b> lift was installed for easier loading. The engines face rearward in a pusher configuration.|$|R
25|$|Three primary levels: main deck, gun <b>deck,</b> and <b>cargo</b> hold.|$|R
25|$|A's most {{numerous}} {{product was}} another of its standard designs, the SD14 shelter <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> ship. During the Second World War, shipyards in the United States had delivered more than 2,700 Liberty ship shelter <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> ships. By the 1960s many Liberty ships were reaching {{the end of}} their service lives, so in 1965 A started to develop a low-cost shelter-deck cargo vessel to replace them.|$|E
25|$|In October 1942 Empire Star loaded a {{mixed cargo}} {{including}} some ammunition and a <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> of aircraft. She embarked 12 British, five South African and two Polish passengers and on 20 October left Liverpool independently and unescorted, bound for Cape Town and East London.|$|E
25|$|Further delays were {{experienced}} once the locomotives finally arrived from May 1951 onwards. Corrosion had already set in during their sea voyage as <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> from Scotland to Australia, {{and there were}} numerous manufacturing defects requiring rectification. R 703 {{was the first of}} the class in service, on 27 June 1951, and the last of the fleet R 769 did not enter service until 23 September 1953.|$|E
5000|$|In 1832, when [...] {{became a}} {{parliamentary}} borough, Palmer was {{a candidate in}} the Conservative interest, but was not elected. He later sat in parliament for South Essex from 1836 to 1847, successful in three strongly contested elections. In 1845, after encountering serious opposition, he obtained legislative enactments prohibiting timber-laden vessels from carrying <b>deck</b> <b>cargoes.</b>|$|R
50|$|English River is a Canadian lake {{freighter}} and bulk carrier, {{launched in}} 1961.In her initial years she carried bulk <b>cargoes</b> and <b>deck</b> <b>cargoes</b> to smaller ports on the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River watershed and estuary. Her cargo capacity {{is about a}} quarter that {{of most of the}} Great Lakes fleet, she is slightly more than half the length, and her draught is about two-thirds that of larger vessels.|$|R
50|$|While in theory, <b>deck</b> <b>cargoes</b> can be {{arranged}} between any two ports and at any time, costs are reduced if a number of yachts are shipped together. Because most ships are non-US flag carriers, they are forbidden by law to transport cargoes between US ports. To comply with the law, they load or discharge in Canada, the Bahamas or Mexico. Container shipping offers complete flexibility with respect to ports and timing.|$|R
25|$|The {{corrosion}} of car shells {{was another}} major issue. As both Boston and San Francisco are port cities, {{the cars were}} particularly susceptible to damage from airborne elements. Some cars barely saw a decade of service before being withdrawn due to corroded bodies, as their bodies were shipped from Japan as <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> and spent a further amount of time sitting outside the Boeing plant before being assembled and delivered.|$|E
25|$|Owned by Isak Skaugen, Skaubryn {{was first}} {{intended}} to be a shelter <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> ship for one of his companies, Eikland. She was built by the Öresundsvarvet Shipbuilding Company in Landskrona, Sweden, and launched on October 7, 1950. Whilst being fitted out, Skaugen decided to have her completed as an emigrant liner, and she was transferred to the Howaldtswerke shipyard for completion as a passenger liner. When completed she offered tourist class accommodation for 1,205 passengers, as well as eight twin-bedded cabins accommodating 16 first class passengers on the bridge deck.|$|E
25|$|The {{new ship}} {{improved}} upon {{the design of}} Queen Mary with sufficient changes, including {{a reduction in the}} number of boilers to twelve instead of Mary twenty-four, that the designers could discard one funnel and increase <b>deck,</b> <b>cargo</b> and passenger space. The two funnels were self-supporting and braced internally to give a cleaner looking appearance. With the forward well deck omitted, a more refined hull shape was achieved, and a sharper, raked bow was added for a third bow-anchor point. She was to be eleven feet longer and of 4,000 tons greater displacement than her older sister ship, Mary.|$|E
5000|$|Common and {{specialty}} tools are {{carried on the}} large decks of these vessels. Most carry a combination of <b>deck</b> <b>cargoes</b> and bulk cargo in tanks below deck. Many ships are constructed (or re-fitted) to accomplish a particular job. Some of these vessels are equipped with a firefighting capability and fire monitors for fighting platform fires. Some vessels are equipped with oil containment and recovery equipment {{to assist in the}} cleanup of a spill at sea. Other vessels are equipped with tools, chemicals and personnel to [...] "work-over" [...] existing oil wells for the purpose of increasing the wells' production.|$|R
50|$|Semi-submersible {{ships that}} take on water ballast {{to allow the}} load—usually another vessel—to be floated over the deck, whereupon the ballast is jettisoned and the ship's <b>deck</b> and <b>cargo</b> raised above the waterline.|$|R

25|$|Six Huon-class {{ships were}} built; all were named after famous Australian rivers (the names {{of which had}} been carried by {{previous}} RAN vessels). The hull of the lead ship, , was laid down during September 1994 at the Intermarine SpA Sarzana shipyard in Italy, and was transferred out to ADI's Newcastle facility as <b>deck</b> <b>cargo,</b> arriving on 31 August 1995. Huon was completed in Newcastle in 1999, and the other five ships were constructed completely at the Australian shipyard, with 69% Australian content in the project. All six were completed on schedule, with the last, , commissioning on 1 March 2003.|$|E
25|$|The wreck attracts many divers for {{the amount}} of the cargo that can be seen and explored. Boots and {{motorcycles}} are visible in Hold No. 1. Trucks, motorcycles, Wellington boots, rifles, Westland Lysander wings, about twenty Bristol Mercury radial engine exhaust rings and a handful of cylinders and Bristol Blenheim bomber tailplanes are visible in Hold No. 2. Universal Carrier armoured vehicles, RAF trolley accumulators, and two Pundit Lights can also be found. Off to the port side of the wreck level with the blast area can be found one of the steam locomotives which had been stored as <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> and the other locomotive is off the starboard side level with Hold No. 2.|$|E
25|$|In August 1942 Melbourne Star again {{relieved}} {{the siege}} of Malta, sailing with her sister Brisbane Star in Operation Pedestal. Melbourne Stars cargo included 1,350 tons of kerosene, 1,450 tons of high explosive shells and cartridges and drums containing several thousand tons of heavy oil. She also carried extra Bofors 40 mm guns as <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> to augment Malta's air defence, but mounted {{so that they could}} also supplement the convoy's air defence en route to Malta. The two Blue Star vessels and other merchant ships for the operation sailed from the Firth of Clyde on 2 August as part of Convoy WS 21S, which reached Gibraltar on 10 August. There they transferred to Convoy MW 12 which left for Malta the same day.|$|E

50|$|The {{first full}} {{double-deck}} jet airliner is the Airbus A380, which has two passenger decks extending {{the full length}} of the fuselage, as well as a full-length lower third <b>deck</b> for <b>cargo.</b> It entered regular service in late-October 2007.|$|R
25|$|She {{set sail}} on her {{fourth and final}} voyage from Glasgow on 2 June 1941, destined for Alexandria, Egypt. The vessel's cargo included: Bedford trucks, Universal Carrier {{armoured}} vehicles, Norton 16H and BSA motorcycles, Bren guns, cases of ammunition, and 0.303 rifles as well as radio equipment, Wellington boots, aircraft parts, railway wagons and two LMS Stanier Class 8F steam locomotives. These steam locomotives and their associated coal and water tenders were carried as <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> intended for Egyptian National Railways. The rest of the cargo was for the Allied forces in Egypt. At the time the Thistlegorm sailed from Glasgow in June, this was the Western Desert Force, which in September 1941 {{became part of the}} newly formed Eighth Army. The crew of the ship, under Captain William Ellis, were supplemented by nine naval personnel to man the machine gun and the anti-aircraft gun.|$|E
25|$|Others {{point to}} The Glückauf, another design of Colonel Swan, {{as being the}} first modern oil tanker. It adopted the best {{practices}} from previous oil tanker designs to create the prototype for all subsequent vessels of the type. It was the first dedicated steam-driven ocean-going tanker {{in the world and}} was the first ship in which oil could be pumped directly into the vessel hull instead of being loaded in barrels or drums. It was also the first tanker with a horizontal bulkhead, its features included cargo valves operable from the <b>deck,</b> <b>cargo</b> main piping, a vapor line, cofferdams for added safety, and the ability to fill a ballast tank with seawater when empty of cargo. The ship was built in Britain and was purchased by Wilhelm Anton Riedemann, an agent for the Standard Oil Company along with several of her sister ships. After the Glückauf was lost in 1893 after being grounded in fog, Standard Oil purchased the sister ships.|$|E
25|$|Empire Eve sailed on 25 July to join Convoy ON 116, {{which had}} {{departed}} from Liverpool {{that day and}} dispersed off Boston, Massachusetts on 12 August. Sailing in ballast, without her Hurricane or operational radar, her destination was Sydney, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, which was reached by leaving the convoy and sailing to Halifax, where she arrived on 10 August, and then joining Convoy HS 40, which departed on 11 August and arrived at Sydney on 13 August. She sailed {{the next day with}} Convoy SQ 28, which arrived at Father Point, Quebec on 17 August. Empire Eve returned to Sydney with Convoy QS 30, which departed on 26 August and arrived on 30 August. She sailed on 30 August to join Convoy SC 98, which had departed from Halifax the previous day and arrived at Liverpool on 13 September. She was carrying a cargo of grain and lorries bound for Manchester, Lancashire. and had a <b>deck</b> <b>cargo</b> of 4 Sherman tanks and 8 crated Mustang fighters.|$|E
50|$|The hull was {{subdivided}} {{by seven}} transverse bulkheads, all watertight {{to the main}} <b>deck.</b> Five <b>cargo</b> holds were provided: three forward and two aft of the machinery space. Cargo was handled through five hatches, one for each hold. Deep tanks were provided for 702 tons of liquid cargo.|$|R
