30|$|In our {{previous}} studies [2, 3] involving visual display terminals (VDT) work, which produces {{a high degree}} of eye fatigue [4 – 6], we considered wood affixed around a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen for decreasing eye fatigue.

We attached the wood to a rim around an LCD screen. Referring to literatures [7, 8] about relationships between eye fatigue and the near-point distance (“NPD”, hereafter) with a near-point ruler commonly used in the industrial health field, we measured NPD to objectively clarify that there was less eye fatigue than when a plain LCD screen was utilized. We examined how display screens used for VDT tasks and the wood surrounding the screen affected test subjects. The results suggested that when the subjects only looked at the wood surface, they experienced less eye fatigue.|$|E

30|$|Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) ash {{was used}} as a natural {{activating}} agent and also a precursor to prepare activated carbon (AC) using various ash to water ratios (0.20, 0.25, and 0.33  wt%), activation temperatures (750, 850, and 950  °C), and activation durations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5  h). The yields, iodine value, and methylene blue adsorption value of Japanese cedar AC were in the ranges of 27.3 – 30.7  %, 953.5 – 1150.9, and 695.1 – 1368.0  mg/g. As the ash to water ratio increased, the BET specific surface area and total pore volume of the AC increased. Japanese cedar AC prepared using an ash to water ratio of 0.33  wt%, an activation temperature of 850  °C, and an activation duration of 1.0  h exhibited the highest BET specific surface area (1430  m 2 /g) and total pore volume (0.74  cm 3 /g).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the characteristics of volcanic ash soils in southwestern Tanzania. Twelve pedons of volcanic origin were studied, and 66 soil samples were analyzed. Soil morphology revealed volcanic ash layers of varying thicknesses. Most pedons had a dark thick humus surface and buried A, AB, and BA horizons with melanic indices of 1. 7 or less. Except in two pedons, the NaF pH was 9. 4 or more, reflecting an exchange complex dominated by amorphous materials and/or Al–humus complexes. The phospate-retention capacity ranged from 65 to 100 %, except in two pedons, and {{was positively correlated with}} NaF pH. Both Tanzanian and <b>Japanese</b> volcanic <b>ash</b> soils showed comparable ranges of base saturation (BS) values, but the distribution patterns of BS basic cations, for example, showed some differences. Some Tanzanian volcanic ash soils had higher BS values than their Japanese counterparts. While the Japanese soils were generally more calcic and magnesic, the Tanzanian soils were more potassic and sodic than their counterparts, most likely reflecting lithological differences among parent materials in the two study areas.

All measurements followed well both linear and Freundlich adsorption isotherms. Strong correlations were found between measured Kd values and pH as well as SOM. The 2, 4 -D adsorption increased with decreasing pH and with increasing SOM. Based on the data, a predictive Kd equation for volcanic ash soils, log (Kd) = 2. 04 - 0. 37 pH + 0. 91 log (SOM), was obtained by the multiple regression analysis. The predictive Kd equation was tested against measured 2, 4 -D sorption data for other volcanic ash soils and normal mineral soils from literature. The proposed Kd equation well predicted Kd values for other volcanic ash soils and slightly over- or under-predicted Kd values for normal mineral soils. The proposed Kd equation performed well against volcanic ash soils from different sites and countries, and is therefore recommended for predicting Kd values at different pH and SOM conditions for volcanic ash soils when calculating and predicting 2, 4 -D mobility and fate in soil and groundwater...|$|R
30|$|The Taiwanese {{government}} has strongly encouraged afforestation, using {{species such as}} Cunninghamia lanceolate, Cryptomeria japonica, and Taiwania cryptomerioides. The plantation growing stock is now over 30  years old, {{and has not been}} subjected to thinning, particularly Japanese cedar, which has currently reached 23, 000  ha with approximately 4  million m 3 of wood. Implementing massive thinning is essential to obtain optimal tree growth, because thinning produces logs with a small diameter utilization and generates approximately 3.6  ×  105  m 3 of woody biomass residues [35]. Japanese cedar is a suitable precursor for preparing charcoal [35, 36], bio-charcoal [37] and a potential material for producing wood pellets [19, 38, 39]. In addition, Japanese cedar wood is suitable for preparing AC because of its high carbon content and low cost [2, 8, 40 – 42]. Extensive research has been conducted to investigate the applications of wood pellet ash in farmland and forest fertilization or soil improvement [18, 20 – 29]; however, new applications are rare. In this study, <b>Japanese</b> cedar <b>ash</b> was used as a natural activating agent to prepare AC from the thinning wood of Japanese cedar and also as a precursor under diverse conditions; specifically, the activation temperature, activation duration, and ash to water ratios. The yield, iodine value, methylene blue adsorption value, BET specific surface area, and porosity characteristics of the AC were investigated.

40|$|Membrane {{emulsification}} is {{a process}} of injecting a pure dispersed phase or pre-emulsion through a microporous membrane into the continuous phase. As a result of the immiscibility of the two phases, droplets of the dispersed phase are formed at the outlets of membrane pores. The droplets formed in the process are removed from the membrane surface by applying cross-flow or stirring of the continuous phase or using a dynamic (rotating or vibrating) membrane. The most commonly used membrane for emulsification is the Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) membrane, fabricated through spinodal decomposition in a melt consisting of <b>Japanese</b> volcanic <b>ash</b> (Shirasu), boric acid and calcium carbonate. Microsieve membranes are increasingly popular as an alternative to highly tortuous glass and ceramic membranes. Microsieves are usually fabricated from nickel by photolithography and electroplating or they can be manufactured from silicon nitride via Reactive Ion Etching (RIE). An advantage of microsieves compared to the SPG membrane is in much higher transmembrane fluxes and higher tolerance to fouling by the emulsion ingredients due to the existence of short, straight through pores. Unlike conventional emulsification devices such as high-pressure valve homogenisers and rotor-stator devices, membrane emulsification devices permit a precise control over the mean pore size over a wide range and during the process insignificant amount of energy is dissipated as heat. The drop size is primarily determined by the pore size, but it depends also on other parameters, such as membrane wettability, emulsion formulation, shear stress on the membrane surface, transmembrane pressure, etc...|$|R
30|$|Plywood-sheathed {{structural}} diaphragms with nailed joints {{are commonly}} used {{in the construction of}} light wooden frames or other types of structures. Past {{studies have shown that the}} in-plane shear resistance performance of the diaphragms is mainly dominated by the shear performance of the nailed joints [1 – 4]. The embedment behavior of wood by a nail is an important characteristic that strongly influences the shear performance of the joints. This characteristic has been used to analyze or predict shear performances on the basis of European Yield Theory [5, 6], elastic foundation model [7 – 12], and finite element method [13 – 15]. Therefore, the embedment behavior of wood and wood-based materials by a nail must be clarified. The embedment behaviors of various types of wooden materials by dowel-type fasteners have been investigated under different loading conditions.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the polyaromatic structures of black humic acids (HAs), which are presumably derived from charred materials, are of significant interest for the global carbon cycle. However, the details of those dynamics are not yet well understood. We investigated differences {{in the degree of}} darkness (A 600 /C values), isotopic ratios (δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and Δ 14 C values), and 13 C NMR spectra of size-separated black HAs extracted from <b>Japanese</b> volcanic <b>ash</b> soils in order to estimate the variations in the polyaromatic structures of black HAs during ca. 100 years of natural reforestation of Japanese pampas grassland. For several hundred years, all the study sites were managed similarly as grassland by burning. Subsequently, their management differed: at site G (Miscanthus sinensis: C 4 plant), maintenance as of the time of this study was still performed by mowing, while at sites P (Pinus densiflora: C 3 plant) and Q (Quercus crispula: C 3 plant), maintenance was discontinued ca. 30 and 100 years ago, respectively. Thus, the sites range from grassland (site G) to coniferous forest (site P) to broad-leaved forest (site Q). For all HA size fractions at all sites, we found that δ 13 C values correlate positively with δ 15 N values, although the gradients are much lower for fractions of small to medium molecular size than for fractions of medium to large molecular size (denoted as lower-size and higher-size fractions, respectively). Overall, for the lower-size fractions, the contribution ratio of C 4 -plant-derived carbon shows a significant positive correlation with A 600 /C values and a negative correlation with Δ 14 C values, and their aromatic characteristics are greater than those of higher-size fractions within the same black HA. Furthermore, the relative proportion of lower-size fractions decreases with reforestation, especially from site P to Q. The δ 13 C values for all size fractions are similar for sites G and P, but are relatively low for site Q. The aryl C contents of the lower-size fractions are lower and the O-alkyl C contents and the aliphaticity (alkyl C:O-alkyl ratio) are clearly higher for sites P and Q than for site G. These results strongly suggest that stimulation of HA biodegradation might be achievable by continuous input of new plant litter during reforestation, even for lower-size HA polyaromatic structures, despite the fact that lower-size HAs biodegrade more slowly than higher-size HAs...|$|R
40|$|This {{article has}} two main objectives. First, it {{attempts}} to explain how, as if rising from the <b>ashes,</b> <b>Japanese</b> competition law enforcement has experienced a significant renaissance. Second, it {{provides an overview of}} Japan’s anti-cartel regime. With regard to the first objective, Part II of the article notes the importance of the Strategic Impediment Initiative talks between Japan and the USA but it ultimately characterizes those talks as a second-order factor, underlining instead the deeper issue of Japan’s stagnant economy. It is suggested that the old cultural assumption that economic recovery is possible without a genuine commitment to competitive markets and an effective competition policy has largely been overcome, and that this shifting economic ethos has enabled the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) to become a more assertive enforcer. Additional factors highlighted include the leadership (2002 – 12) of the former Chairman of the JFTC, and other influences such as the OECD’s evaluations of Japanese regulatory reform. As concerns the article’s second objective, Parts III and IV explain the basics of the rules governing Japan’s fight against cartels. The article reviews, inter alia, the concept of a ‘substantial restraint of competition’ and the JFTC’s powers when it investigates and sanctions illegal conduct—either in cartel scenarios or, notoriously in Japan, bid-rigging cases.
