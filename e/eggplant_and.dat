5|$|Baba ghanoush is an {{eggplant}} or aubergine salad or dip {{with several}} variants. The {{root of all}} the variants is broiled and mashed <b>eggplant</b> <b>and</b> tahini lathered with olive oil, which can then be flavored with either garlic, onions, peppers, ground cumin seeds, mint and parsley. Mutabbel {{is one of the}} spicier variants that receives its zest from green chili peppers.|$|E
5|$|Pita {{bread is}} a {{double-layered}} flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, <b>eggplant</b> <b>and</b> other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of potato plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, <b>eggplant</b> <b>and</b> capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E

5|$|The State of Israel faced {{enormous}} {{military and}} economic challenges in its early years, and the period from 1948 to 1958 {{was a time of}} food rationing and austerity, known as tzena. In this decade, over one million Jewish immigrants, mainly from Arab countries, but also including European Holocaust survivors, inundated the new state. They arrived when only basic foods were available and ethnic dishes had to be modified with a range of mock or simulated foods, such as chopped “liver” from <b>eggplant,</b> <b>and</b> turkey as a substitute for veal schnitzel for Ashkenazim, kubbeh made from frozen fish instead of ground meat for Iraqi Jews, and turkey in place of the lamb kebabs of the Mizrahi Jews. These adaptations remain as a legacy of that time.|$|E
25|$|Gratin Languedocien is a {{preparation}} {{made with}} <b>eggplant</b> <b>and</b> tomato, covered in breadcrumbs and oil, then browned.

25|$|Like {{the potato}} and S. lichtensteinii, {{but unlike the}} tomato, which then was {{generally}} put in a different genus, the eggplant was also described as S. esculentum, in this case once more {{in the course of}} Dunal's work. He also recognized the varieties aculeatum, inerme, and subinerme at that time. Similarly, H.C.F. Schuhmacher and Peter Thonning named the eggplant as S. edule, which is also a junior synonym of sticky nightshade (S. sisymbriifolium). Scopoli's S. zeylanicum refers to the <b>eggplant,</b> <b>and</b> that of Blanco to S. lasiocarpum.|$|E

25|$|The cuisine is {{a typical}} {{southern}} Italian Mediterranean cuisine with a balance between meat-based dishes (pork, lamb, goat), vegetables (especially <b>eggplant),</b> <b>and</b> fish. Pasta (as in Central Italy {{and the rest of}} Southern Italy) is also very important in Calabria. In contrast to most other Italian regions, Calabrians have traditionally placed an emphasis on the preservation of their food and packing vegetables and meats in olive oil. Also making sausages and cold cuts (Sopressata, 'Nduja, Capocollo), along the coast curing fish – especially swordfish, sardines (sardelle rosamarina) and cod (Baccalà). Local desserts are typically fried, honey-sweetened pastries Cudduraci, Nacatole, Scalille or scalidde or baked biscotti-type treats (such as nzudda).|$|E
25|$|Manjampatti {{was given}} land for {{cultivation}} when the Reserved Forest was created {{and the families}} have kept their respective fields marked with the original stone boundaries. Villagers earlier practiced shifting cultivation, growing millets such as raagi, thinai and kambu. Later the Forest Department forbade shifting cultivation and restricted cultivation to the allotted lands. The crops now are rice in rainy season and butter beans otherwise, though with a more diverse population a few vegetables such as <b>eggplant</b> <b>and</b> tomatoes are grown. Farmers here have to protect their crops from wild elephants, gaur, wild boar, deer and sometimes peacocks. A complex and well maintained system of small canals distributes water from the Manalar to irrigate the fields.|$|E
25|$|Potatoes contain toxic {{compounds}} {{known as}} glycoalkaloids, {{of which the}} most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine {{is also found in}} other plants in the family Solanaceae, which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana), as well as <b>eggplant</b> <b>and</b> tomato. These compounds, which protect the plant from its predators, are, in general, concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the roots). In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel , stems, and tuber flesh).|$|E

25|$|Bihari cuisine is {{wholesome}} and simple. Litti chokha, a baked salted wheat-flour cake {{filled with}} sattu (baked chickpea flour) and some special spices, {{is well known}} among the middle-class families served with baigan bharta, made of roasted <b>eggplant</b> <b>and</b> tomatoes.

It is salted wheat-flour bread, filled with boiled, crushed, and fried gram pulses. Malpua is a popular sweet dish of Bihar, prepared by a mixture of maida, milk, bananas, cashew nuts, peanuts, raisins, sugar, water, and green cardamom. Another notable sweet dish of Bihar is balushahi, which is prepared by a specially treated combination of maida and sugar along with ghee, and the other worldwide famous sweet, khaja, also very popular, is made from flour, vegetable fat, and sugar, which is mainly used in weddings and other occasions.

500|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Satoru Okada (credited as S. Okada), and produced by {{the general manager of}} the R division, Gunpei Yokoi (credited as G. Yokoi). Hirokazu Tanaka (credited as Hip Tanaka) composed the music for Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena. Yoshio Sakamoto (credited as Shikao.S) joined the team as soon as he had returned from his vacation after the completion of Metroid. He streamlined the development process, and made many decisions that affected the game design of Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena. Several out-of-place elements were included in the game, such as credit cards, a wizard turning player character Pit into an <b>eggplant,</b> <b>and</b> a large, moving nose that was meant to resemble composer Tanaka. Sakamoto attributed this unrestrained humor to the former personnel of the R division, which he referred to as [...] "strange". Osawa said that he had originally tried to make Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena completely serious, but opted for a more humorous approach after objections from the team.|$|E

2500|$|Pakistani {{national}} cuisine is the inheritor of Indo-Aryan {{culture and}} Muslim culinary traditions. The earliest formal civilizations were the Mohenjo-daro (...) and Harappan civilizations in Pakistan. At around 3000 BCE, sesame, <b>eggplant,</b> <b>and</b> humped cattle were domesticated in the Indus Valley, and spices like turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested {{in the region}} concurrently.

2500|$|As the London Nationals, the Knights {{originally}} {{played in}} the blue and white of the Toronto Maple Leafs. The team's logo was the same Leaf as used by the parent club at the time, except with the words [...] "London Nationals" [...] written out across the leaf instead of [...] "Toronto Maple Leafs". After 1968, the colours changed to green, gold and white, and the logo to a classically inspired Knight's head with an Old English [...] "K" [...] on the helmet. In 1980 the striping changed slightly, from classical horizontal stripes around the sleeves {{and bottom of the}} sweater to large arm stripes and a bare sweater bottom. In 1985–86 the green on the uniforms was darkened and the arm stripes were deleted in favour of broad swathes of secondary colour across the shoulders and down the arms. 1986 saw a total re-design of sweater and logo. Black was added as a secondary colour and the striping returned to a more pedestrian design. The logo was also changed, from a classical Knight's head to a more modernized version on a gold circle with the letter [...] "L". These uniforms were used until 1994. In 1994 the green and gold were disposed of completely in favour of the <b>eggplant</b> <b>and</b> teal used by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The logo was changed to [...] "Spiderknight", with normal horizontal striping and pointed shoulder stripes. There was also a teal shoulder patch bearing the word [...] "London" [...] and a hockey stick. In February 2002, the Knights reverted to their 1986–94 uniforms as a commemoration of the closing of the London Gardens. The special uniforms were identical except for two shoulder patches, one bearing the 1968–86 logo and the other bearing the 1994–2002 logo. These uniforms were also used for the 2002–03 preseason. For the opening of the John Labatt Centre in October 2002, the Knights debuted new uniforms with the 1986–94 logo, minus the [...] "L" [...] and the gold circle. These were drawn on a home white uniform and a road uniform that, {{for the first time in}} team history, bore black as its primary colour. Each uniform also bore a new [...] "shield" [...] shoulder patch. The team also debuted green third jerseys, which featured the word [...] "KNIGHTS" [...] printed diagonally across the front of the sweater.|$|E

They give one another presents with the cost mark scratched off with a penknife; and they hang holly wreaths in the front windows and when they are asked whether they prefer light or dark meat from the turkey they say: [...] "Both, please," [...] and giggle and have lots of fun. And the very poorest people have the best time of it. The Army gives 'em a dinner, and the 10 A.
