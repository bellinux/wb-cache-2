The Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> is almost exactly like its European cousin. The only distinction between the two is that the Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> has larger genitalia.

30|$|The <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> Argyroneta aquatica lives under water, diving {{to various}} depths {{from time to}} time. At rest, it {{breathes}} air trapped within its diving bell with a hydrophilic surface. Outside their diving bell <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> trap air on their abdomen under a layer of hydrophobic hair. Is {{the structure of the}} layer of hair trapping a volume of air on the abdomen of the <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> Argyroneta aquatica under water related to its observed diving depth (of the order of decimetre)? A positive answer to this question is given, based on the law of Laplace in combination with information obtained from SEM- photographs of the abdomen of a <b>water</b> <b>spider.</b>|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} some debate amongst arachnologists {{as to whether the}} <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> (A. a. aquatica) belongs to the family Cybinidae or Argyronetidae.

25|$|The Japanese <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> {{is unusual}} in that males are almost always larger than females. This is called sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD). When <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> mate the male begins by approaching the female’s diving bell.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} aimed to {{identify}} the external features of the <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> (Argyroneta aquatica) collected from “The Natural Monument No. 412 Yeoncheon Eundaeri Water Spider Habitat” through observation of their microstructures using a scanning electron microscope. There is no study on the microstructures of the <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> excluding several studies on protection plans and ecological investigations, thus giving this study considerable academic significance. Based on the scanning electron microscopy analysis, the <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> has eight simple eyes, and both of its lateral simple eyes are stuck together. A lateral bump was confirmed on the upper jaw, and the pedipalps had six joints and the legs had seven joints.

40|$|The <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> Argyroneta aquatica (Clerck) is {{the only}} spider that spends its whole life under <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>spiders</b> keep an air bubble around their body for {{breathing}} and build under-water air bells, which they use for shelter and raising offspring, digesting and consuming prey, moulting, depositing eggs and sperm, and copulating. It is unclear whether these bells are an important oxygen reservoir for breathing under water, or whether they serve mainly to create water-free space for feeding and reproduction. In this study, we manipulated {{the composition of the}} gas inside the bell of female <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> to test whether they monitor the quality of this gas, and replenish oxygen if required. We exchanged the entire gas in the bell either with pure O(2), pure CO(2), or with ambient air as control, and monitored behavioural responses. The test spiders surfaced and replenished air more often in the CO(2) treatment than in the O(2) treatment, and they increased bell building behaviour. In addition to active oxygen regulation, they monitored and adjusted the bells by adding silk. These results show that <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> use the air bell as an oxygen reservoir, and that it functions as an external lung, which renders it essential for living under water permanently. A. aquatica {{is the only}} animal that collects, transports, and stores air, and monitors its property for breathing, which is an adaptive response of a terrestrial animal to the colonization of an aquatic habitat.

50|$|Size is {{a factor}} in the {{reproductive}} success of males with species such as Stegodyphus lineatus, Argiope aurantia and Argyroneta aquatica showing sexual dimorphism, beneficial for larger males, stronger and more aggressive, who fight off the smaller ones using their large chelicerae and forelegs. This leads to a decrease in the paternal success for smaller males since they are unable to gain access to females. In Argiope aurantia males can lose legs in combat, with the loss more prevalent in smaller males, evidence that larger males are favored in male-to-male competition. In the <b>water</b> <b>spider</b> Argyroneta aquatica, where males and females permanently live in the water the males are larger, indicating sexual selective pressures for large body size. The large male <b>water</b> <b>spiders</b> are more mobile, helping them obtain more females.|$|R
