2500|$|In deep {{mourning}} {{after her}} daughter Sophie's death, Elisabeth refused to eat for days; a behavior that would reappear in later periods of melancholy and depression. Whereas she previously had supper with the family, she now began to avoid this; {{and if she}} did eat with them, she ate quickly and very little.

Wooden dummies were mounted to maintain the illusion of a heavily armed ship. Kigoma fell to General Charles Tombeur′s forces on 28 July, but Götzen was already gone. The Germans had sailed the ship to the south of Kigoma Bay and, [...] after having her engines thoroughly greased in case there should be need to make use of her again, <b>filled</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> sand and carefully scuttled her on 26 July in a depth of 20 m near the banks of the Katabe Bay (Belgian designation: Baie de l’éléphant; British designation: Bangwe Bay) at the Position 04° 54' 05" [...] S; 029° 36' 12" [...] E.|$|E

6000|$|... “My {{conjecture}} was right,” he said. “They intended, no doubt, to {{keep some}} large merchantman they had captured, <b>fill</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> the contents of their prizes, {{and then with the}} papers and manifests of cargo they could go almost anywhere and dispose of their ill-gotten goods.” ...|$|R

60|$|There was {{a curious}} quivering {{at the corners}} of her mouth and a lump in her throat. She was {{absolutely}} incapable of speech.
