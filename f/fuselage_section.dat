5|$|F-22 Flying Testbed – {{the first}} 757 built {{was used in}} 1998 as a testbed for Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor {{avionics}} and sensor integration. The Boeing-owned aircraft was fitted with a canard above its cockpit to simulate the jet fighter's wing sensor layout, along with a forward F-22 <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> with radar and other systems, and a 30-seat laboratory with communication, electronic warfare, identification, and navigation sensors.|$|E
5|$|Of the 296 {{people on}} board, 111 {{died in the}} crash. Most were killed by {{injuries}} sustained in the multiple impacts, but 35 {{people in the middle}} <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> directly above the fuel tanks died from smoke inhalation in the post-crash fire. Of those, 24 had no traumatic blunt-force injuries. The majority of the 185 survivors were seated behind first class and ahead of the wings. Many passengers were able to walk out through the ruptures to the structure.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF forward <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> with a port-side cargo door. The forward two entry doors are retained, resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E

5|$|Partly as a {{means of}} guaranteeing {{employment}} in the British aerospace industry, agreement was reached that major portions of the UK's Phantoms would be built domestically. The F-4J variant, which was then the primary version in service with the US Navy, was taken {{as the basis for the}} UK aircraft, subject to major redesign. The most significant change was the substitution of the larger and more powerful Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan for the GE J79 turbojet to allow operations from the Royal Navy's carriers. Although several had received major upgrades, all of the UK carriers were smaller than the US carriers from which the J79-GE-8 and −10 powered Phantoms operated. To accommodate the larger engines, BAC redesigned and built the entire rear <b>fuselage</b> <b>section.</b> The Westinghouse AN/AWG-10 radar carried by the F-4J was to be procured and built under licence by Ferranti as the AN/AWG-11 for FAA aircraft and AN/AWG-12 for those of the RAF. The changes to the aircraft led to the two variants being given their own separate series letters, with the FAA version being designated as the F-4K and the RAF version as the F-4M.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, an enlarged, four-rotored {{version of}} the Fa 223 was considered, but not {{developed}} beyond {{the construction of a}} center <b>fuselage</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
25|$|The new <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> is {{constructed}} {{as a single}} large component, including the vertical stabilizer. When attached to the existing nose section, the fuselage is 55 feet (16.8 m) long and 9 feet (2.74 m) diameter. The fuselage has upper and lower halves, each with a roughly-oval shape similar to a canoe. The halves are bonded to circular frames. The <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> ahead of the entrance door consists of the existing (metal) 328J component, with fasteners used to bring the forward and new aft sections together.|$|E
25|$|No {{complete}} aircraft of the 1,814 Whitleys produced remains.

50|$|With re-armament in {{the late}} 1930s, another factory was opened in Park Royal, London, on Western Avenue, next to the Callard & Bowser {{confectionery}} works, and during World War II, they built <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> for De Havilland Mosquito bombers, Airspeed Oxfords and gliders.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 the ZAIM-68A {{designation}} {{was assigned}} to the missile. A 20% model was successfully tested in a wind tunnel during that year and in June a contract was awarded to National Tapered Wing Engineering Company to produce 20 <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> for prototype missiles.|$|R
25|$|Early {{production}} aircraft were built at Hatfield, which {{had originally been}} a de Havilland factory. The Avro RJ family of aircraft was assembled at the Avro International, later BAE Systems Regional Aircraft Centre, at Woodford Aerodrome in Greater Manchester, England. Production of various sections of the aircraft was carried out at different BAE plants. The rear <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> was manufactured at BAE Systems' former Avro site at Chadderton, Greater Manchester. The centre <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> was manufactured at the Filton BAE site. The vertical stabilizer came from Brough and the engine pylons were made at Prestwick. The nose section was manufactured at Hatfield, where the assembly line for the early aircraft was located. Some manufacturing was subcontracted outside the UK; the wings were made by Textron in the United States and the tailplane and control surfaces were made by Saab-Scania in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|A <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> {{displayed}} at the Traces of War museum at Wolfheze, Netherlands, was retrieved from Cholsey, Oxfordshire, where it {{had served as a}} dwelling for over 50 years. It was recovered around 2001 by the Mosquito Aircraft Museum, of London Colney, where it was stored until being bought by museum owner Paul Hendriks. The airframe is believed not to have seen active service.|$|E
25|$|The Eurofighter Typhoon {{is unique}} in modern combat {{aircraft}} in that there are four separate assembly lines. Each partner company assembles its own national aircraft, but builds the same parts for all aircraft (including exports); Premium AEROTEC (main centre fuselage), EADS CASA (right wing, leading edge slats), BAE Systems (front fuselage (including foreplanes), canopy, dorsal spine, tail fin, inboard flaperons, rear <b>fuselage</b> <b>section)</b> and Leonardo (left wing, outboard flaperons, rear fuselage sections).|$|E
50|$|The Hamburg {{factory is}} also home to Airbus’ A380 major {{component}} assembly hall, which houses the structural assembly and the fitting-with equipment of the forward and complete rear <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections.</b> These sections are then shipped to France on a specially built ferry, for final assembly in Toulouse.|$|R
50|$|Prefabrication {{has become}} {{widely used in}} the {{assembly}} of aircraft and spacecraft, with components such as wings and <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> often being manufactured in different countries or states from the final assembly site. However this is sometimes for political rather than commercial reasons, such as for Airbus.|$|R
50|$|The Triton is {{a single}} engine pusher {{aircraft}} with three <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> joined by a mid-wing and a Double-V shaped tailplane. Amphibian and electric hybrid variants are planned. A ballistic parachute will {{be integrated into the}} design. Under development by Micronautix, a division of Bob Smith Industries, Inc.|$|R
25|$|At the time, the Armagnac {{was one of}} {{the largest}} civil {{aircraft}} ever built with a wingspan of almost 50 meters and weight over 77 tonnes. The capacious pressurized cabin (with a near-circular <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> with 4.7 m/ 15ft width and height) was intended for a three tier sleeping compartment configuration which ultimately was not fitted to any of the S.E.2010 versions. The fuselage was left with a good deal of unusable space with only open luggage shelves mounted in the upper fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The PWS-6 was a {{successor}} {{of an earlier}} liaison aircraft design, the PWS-5, which was not accepted for mass production. The designers, Aleksander Grzędzielewski and Augustyn Bobek-Zdaniewski, utilized the experience they had gained on PWS-11 and PWS-12 trainers, {{and as a result}} the new plane had improved aerodynamics, an oval shaped <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> and rounded wingtips. The layout of wings and their bracing were similar to the PWS-5, as was the engine and fixed undercarriage, while the front of the fuselage and the empennage was similar to a final variant of the PWS-12. It was the first Polish aircraft fitted with slats.|$|E
25|$|Recovery {{locations}} of the wreckage from the ocean (the red, yellow, and green zones) clearly indicated that: (1) the red area pieces (from the forward portion of the wing center section and a ring of fuselage directly in front) were the earliest pieces to separate from the airplane; (2) the forward <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> departed simultaneously with or shortly after the red area pieces, landing relatively intact in the yellow zone; (3) the green area pieces (wings and the aft portion of the fuselage) remained intact for a period after {{the separation of the}} forward fuselage, and impacted the water in the green zone.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} of the 747SP stemmed from a joint request between Pan American World Airways and Iran Air, who {{were looking for a}} high-capacity airliner with enough range to cover Pan Am's New York–Middle Eastern routes and Iran Air's planned Tehran–New York route. The Tehran–New York route, when launched, was the longest non-stop commercial flight in the world. The 747SP is [...] shorter than the 747-100. <b>Fuselage</b> <b>sections</b> were eliminated fore and aft of the wing, and the center <b>section</b> of the <b>fuselage</b> was redesigned to fit mating <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections.</b> The SP's flaps used a simplified single-slotted configuration. The 747SP, compared to earlier variants, had a tapering of the aft upper fuselage into the empennage, a double-hinged rudder, and longer vertical and horizontal stabilizers. Power was provided by Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7(A/F/J/FW) or Rolls-Royce RB211-524 engines.|$|R
25|$|During {{the decade}} several {{military}} projects went into production, including Boeing {{support of the}} stealth B-2 bomber. As part of an industry team led by Northrop, Boeing built the outboard portion of the B-2 stealth bomber wing, the aft center <b>fuselage</b> <b>section,</b> landing gear, fuel system and weapons delivery system. At its peak in 1991, the B-2 was the largest military program at Boeing, employing about 10,000 people. The same year, the National Aeronautic Association of the USA awarded the B-2 design team the Collier Trophy for the greatest achievement in aerospace in America. The first B-2 rolled out of the bomber's final assembly facility in Palmdale, California, in November 1988 and it flew {{for the first time}} on July 17, 1989.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the aircraft's unorthodox {{aerodynamic}} features, the Javelin had a fairly conventional structure and materials, being mainly composed of an aluminium alloy, with some use of steel edging. The fuselage was composed of four sections, the nose (containing the radar radome), the front fuselage, centre fuselage and rear fuselage; the nose and rear fuselage were removable for servicing and easy replacement. The engines were {{on either side of}} the centre <b>fuselage</b> <b>section,</b> the internal space in the centre containing the service bay that housed much of the aircraft's electrical, hydraulic, and avionics subsystems. The engine air intakes were placed on the forward fuselage, running directly from beneath the cockpit rearwards into the delta wing. Electricity was provided by a pair of 6,000 watt, 24-volt generators driven by the auxiliary gearbox; inverters provided AC power for equipment such as some flight instruments and the radar.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{construction was}} quite novel. Barnwell borrowed from marine experience by using duralumin sheet, varnished to prevent corrosion and used these {{to make the}} fuselage in four sections. The two forward sections were semi-monocoque (i.e. open channels) with braced longitudinal upper members which, bolted together, held the engine, a water-cooled inline upright 140hp (100kW) Hispano-Suiza) and the pilot's cockpit. Aft, two more sections, both true monocoques, held the observer and carried the tail unit. The two cockpits were close together, with the pilot under the wing at mid-chord and the observer under a trailing edge cutout; Barnwell proposed that the short observer's <b>fuselage</b> <b>section</b> should be removable to turn the M.R.1 into a single-seater, though this configuration was not realised. The monocoque sections were very early examples of double-skinned construction, with a smooth outer skin riveted to a longitudinally-corrugated inner skin. The detailed design was by W.T.Read. The complete fuselage was of round-cornered rectangular cross-section and quite slender, mounted between the wings. The M.R.1 was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep, with ailerons on both planes. Aluminium wing spars proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid and Bristol outsourced their manufacture to The Steel Wing Company at Gloucester, who had built experimental steel wings for other aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A large spares centre is also {{maintained}} at Hamburg (which holds some 120,000 proprietary parts for customers {{from around the}} world), and A320 Family maintenance training facilities {{can also be found}} on-site. Hamburg also {{plays a key role in}} the A330 and A350 XWB programmes, for which it manufactures and equips the forward and rear <b>fuselage</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
