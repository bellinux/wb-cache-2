5|$|A {{party is}} {{held for the}} team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work {{together}} on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard USS Defiant. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir feels out of place and is effectively ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial wormhole in history and Dax <b>hugs</b> <b>her</b> in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), {{who is on the}} science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's quarters and a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and <b>hugs</b> <b>her</b> tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|A {{little girl}} {{introduced}} in volume 4, Nirvana {{is not all}} she appears to be. She is Indian and is first seen as a child who Ah-Gi has taken to kill and make into food. Bi-Ryu and Ah-Rin show up {{just in time to}} save her, though she shows no fear towards the man. He believes her to be a mute, as she has not spoken since he abducted her. Later, after meeting Bi Ryu's Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she apparently is wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu's party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she <b>hugs</b> <b>her</b> like a stuffed animal a lot (She's also {{the only one who can}} understand what Cho Ryung says).

500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room and <b>hugs</b> <b>her</b> father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring at the photo on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male she woke up to {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns to the couch where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in her pocket as she lies back down next to him.|$|E

Robbie said she had [...] "big shoes to fill", but she was honoured to be working on her biggest storyline since she arrived. Clark said that Donna and Ringo had made the decision {{that they are going to}} be with each other for life and that they are [...] "going to be solid from now on". On the wedding day, Donna's car breaks down and she is forced to ride in the back of Lucas Fitzgerald's (Scott Major) truck.

[...] Deryn spends the remainder of her inheritance to come to London and live with her brother, where she studies to take the Midshipman exams to get into the British Air Service like her brother, but the toughest part is acting the role of boy, which she'll have to pull off in order to be accepted. It is her lucky day when her airman test goes awry and she is scooped up by the Leviathan and finishes her tests up there in order to serve aboard as a Midshipman. [...] She is able to best many of the Middies at learning the ropes because she went up so frequently with her father and because she pays attention during class. [...] She does her best to hide that she is a girl from everyone on board, though the observant eye of Dr. Barlow has noticed the lack of a beard on her chin. Luckily, Barlow has attributed it to Deryn lying about her age rather than being a girl. [...] As she gets to know Alek, she realizes that she owes him her life and, after he <b>hugs</b> <b>her,</b> that she may even have feelings for him, though she quickly tries to squelch that.|$|E
2500|$|Hook {{tries to}} comfort Emma by {{telling her that}} when his brother died {{all he could do}} was live in the moment. But Emma wonders how she can be still alive if Snow died. All of a sudden, a ladybug buzzes around Hook and just as he is about to kill the insect, Charming shouts “wait!” Charming takes the ladybug, places it on his hand and it is {{transformed}} back into Snow White by the Blue Fairy, thanks to a special form of fairy dust. The Blue Fairy is also aware that Emma wasn't Leia all along, but says it’s all right, her secrets can be hers. Snow is startled when Emma <b>hugs</b> <b>her</b> with tears in her eyes, shouting, “You’re alive.” Snow and Charming seem to be warming up to each other, causing a slight restoration in the timeline. Emma looks at the prisoner and suggests that she and Hook take her with them back to Storybrooke, but the woman is not happy about that idea, prompting Emma to knock her out to kidnap her. As Emma, Hook, and their additional guest go their separate ways, both Snow and Charming reach the troll bridge, but thanks to the altered timeline Snow doesn’t have her dust as a weapon to defeat the trolls, so she goes towards them and bluffs. They drop their weapons and take off. The timeline is back on track as Charming is now smitten with Snow before they go their separate ways, with Snow holding on to the ring and trying it on. [...] Emma watches from a distance and gets weepy. Hook says, “It’s ok, Swan. Not everyone gets a chance to watch their parents fall in love.” Emma opens the book, and discovers a picture of Snow and Charming getting married, and as expected Regina still seeking vengeance on Snow, resulting in the timeline being restored, only this time Regina turns the trolls into bugs with the dark magic and squashes them.|$|E

2500|$|Garfield's {{world has}} {{specific}} locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, {{a place he}} loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food {{is the center of}} most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield <b>hugs</b> <b>her</b> for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon does take Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, [...] "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts." ...|$|E
