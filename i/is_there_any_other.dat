Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (<b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon {{in the television}} film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{popularity}} of Just Sniffing Around brought requests for a companion poem for cat lovers. In response, Brodsky wrote Purrsnikkity, {{and held a}} contest to find a cat {{to be the main}} character. For every three pictures they submitted of their cat, children were encouraged to donate $5 to a local rescue shelter. The winning cat was selected by illustrator Cameron Bennett to be the model for the illustrations in the book. The Midwest Book Review writes, [...] "Told from the cat's point of view (<b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other?),</b> Pursnikitty presents many recurring themes in tales of pet care and responsible pet ownership." [...] Reviewer Steve McEvoy writes, [...] "this book captures the essence and spirit of a cat and the cat's relationship to the family and the environment it lives in." [...] Brodsky said in a 2010 interview about the book, [...] "the book's messages deal with family interaction and tolerance," [...] noting [...] "how important it is to look beyond first impressions." ...|$|E

40|$|Model or {{variable}} selection is usually achieved through ranking models {{according to the}} increasing order of preference. One of methods is applying Kullback-Leibler distance or relative entropy as a selection criterion. Yet that will raise two questions, why uses this criterion and <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> criteria. Besides, conventional approaches require a reference prior, which is usually difficult to get. Following the logic of inductive inference proposed by Caticha [1], we show relative entropy to be a unique criterion, which requires no prior information and {{can be applied to}} different fields.

According to the mainstream ethology and comparative psychology only the Homo sapiens is cognitively equiped to produce and interpret symbols. Here, I introduce an empirically testable model of symbolic semiosis ("symbolic action of sign ") supported by C. S. Peirce logical-phenomenological theory of categories. I suggest that a specific sign-user pattern of behavior, observed in non-human primate communication, indicate a transition from indexical to symbolic semiosis...|$|R
