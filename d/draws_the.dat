5|$|Despite England {{going into}} the series as the favourites, West Indies won the series 1–0 after winning the first match at Sabina Park. The {{remaining}} matches all ended in <b>draws.</b> <b>The</b> series was originally intended as a four Test series; however the abandonment of the Second Test due to {{the conditions of the}} field at the SVR Stadium in Antigua led to the rapid inclusion of an additional game staged at the Antigua Recreation Ground, resulting in a five, rather than four match Test series.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Fischer {{started a}} 16-game match with Reshevsky, split between New York and Los Angeles.

After 11 games and a tie score (two wins apiece with seven <b>draws),</b> <b>the</b> match ended prematurely due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer and sponsor Jacqueline Piatigorsky. Reshevsky was declared the winner, by default, and received the winner's share of the prize fund.|$|E

5|$|The key {{geographical}} {{features that}} had influenced the landings also influenced {{the next phase}} of the battle: the <b>draws,</b> <b>the</b> natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of carrying out a further assault. In the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.|$|E

5|$|The {{match was}} played in March–April 1921. After four <b>draws,</b> <b>the</b> fifth game saw Lasker blunder with Black in an equal ending. Capablanca's solid style {{allowed him to}} easily draw the next four games, without taking any risks. In the tenth game, Lasker as White played a {{position}} with an isolated queen pawn but failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} {{television}} broadcasts, the film airs occasionally across the United States on networks such as TNT. To permit {{the scene where}} Jack <b>draws</b> <b>the</b> nude portrait of Rose to be shown on network and specialty cable channels, in addition to minor cuts, the sheer, see-through robe worn by Winslet was digitally painted black. Turner Classic Movies also began to show the film, specifically during {{the days leading up}} to the 82nd Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, <b>draws</b> <b>the</b> attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
40|$|Hayashi, KoojiIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the grade of recognition of nature and life, when students were made to <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> picture of familiar life, some students <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> picture of the chicken with 4 legs were seen. The tendency which the rate of <b>the</b> student <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> chicken with 4 legs increases has been seen since the investigation start in 1994. As a result of analysis of gender difference, the rate of female students <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> chicken with 4 legs is clearly higher than male students. It was suggested that the qualitative gender difference of natural experience in childhood was related as this reason. However, from comparison of the questionnaire result of natural experience within female students, the difference of qualitative natural experience was not seen between <b>the</b> student <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> right picture (a chicken with 2 legs), and <b>the</b> student <b>drawing</b> <b>the</b> chicken with 4 legs. It is suggested that the reason of the result {{is related to the}} difference of ability in observation and expression...|$|R

5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the moulded part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and <b>draws</b> <b>the</b> runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The moulded part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished moulded product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E
5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, and <b>draws</b> <b>the</b> {{edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if {{both sides of the}} line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E
5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is actually Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on her voice and appearance. Agent 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May and turns on her; this <b>draws</b> <b>the</b> attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E
