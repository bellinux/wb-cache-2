50|$|With {{the help}} of the Rail Heritage Trust, the station <b>floor</b> <b>boards</b> have been {{completely}} renewed and the building repaired. The flooring job was a major task, as it was discovered that the station had been built with the floor lying straight on top of the dirt. There was no space for air circulation or drainage. Before the <b>floor</b> <b>boards</b> could be laid, the whole area had to be dug out, with large amounts of dirt being removed to allow for adequate space underneath the <b>floor</b> <b>boards.</b> The original wall, floors, and ceiling were beautifully constructed in native tongue and groove timber. All wiring, including underfloor, was completely renewed and new plumbing installed, with the addition of three new toilets.|$|R

5000|$|The Go board (generally {{referred}} to by its Japanese name goban [...] ) typically measures between 45 and 48 cm in length (from one player's side to the other) and 42 to 44 cm in width. Chinese boards are slightly larger, as a traditional Chinese Go stone is slightly larger to match. The board is not square; there is a 15:14 ratio in length to width, because with a perfectly square board, from the player's viewing angle the perspective creates a foreshortening of the board. The added length compensates for this. There are two main types of boards: a table board similar in most respects to other gameboards like that used for chess, and a <b>floor</b> <b>board,</b> which is its own free-standing table and at which the players sit.|$|E

Elliot punches Luc {{and attempts to}} shoot him, but misses due to Caleb's efforts. Elliot takes the boys back to the cabin and locks them inside their room, promising to take care of them. Brad pries up a <b>floor</b> <b>board,</b> and Caleb escapes, seeing Richard's corpse under the house. Caleb finds Luc in his truck, and Luc agrees to take him to safety along with Brad. Brad pries up another board, and starts a fire in the house.|$|E
50|$|A wooden <b>floor</b> <b>board</b> {{with legs}} {{is the most}} traditional, elegant, and {{expensive}} of all boards. Historically, to play on these boards, the Japanese would sit on tatami mats. The legs are carved to resemble gardenias. These boards are still used for important tournament games in Asia. Chinese versions of floor boards are not always made from blocks of wood, and more closely resemble a small table with an inlaid go board. The legs raise the board to the correct height. The board can range from 14-21 cm high. The thickest boards are the most elegant. The undersides often have a square recesses (heso) to prevent warping and to amplify {{the sounds of the}} stones hitting the surface. The best boards are made from Miyazaki kaya, which is rare. These are classified according {{to the quality of the}} wood grain. Itame refers to a bent or irregular grain; masame refers to consistent grain that runs straight across the top of the board. Masame boards are further classified as tenmasa (the top grain is straight, but grain along the cut end is curved, as in the illustration), and most-prized tenchimasa (grain is straight along the cut end as well as on top.) Prices of kaya boards range from US$1,000 to $20,000 plus. Boards made of other woods, such as Alaskan spruce, Agathis, or katsura are cheaper, around $500 to $2,000.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 32. Harvick got {{a run on}} Edwards {{going down}} the backstretch to retake the lead on lap 35. Coming to the lead, Edwards took back the lead on lap 36. Going into turn 1, Harvick drove underneath Edwards to retake the lead on lap 38. The second caution of the race flew on lap 47 for a single-car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, Kyle Larson cut down his left-rear tire, hit the outside wall, turned down the track and slammed the inside wall head-on. He said that he [...] "was going down the back stretch and I think it was my left-rear tire got cut. It must have ripped the brake line because I went to push the pedal and it {{went straight to the}} <b>floor</b> <b>board.</b> I couldn’t slow down. It was definitely a hard hit there, probably one of the harder ones of my career. Even before that we were pretty sub-average there, we were pretty bad. Disappointed in our run today, but glad I’m alright. It was really good for about 20 laps on each run. The take-off speed was awesome and I don’t know I just couldn’t get the thing to last for a whole run. We just kind of struggled there {{at the end of each}} run, that kind of hurt us, but short-run speed that was a lot of fun. I thought we were as competitive as anybody on short-run speed. We just needed something there for the last 10 to 15 laps. We will work on it. The pit crew was awesome. They bounced back with great stops all day.” He would go on to finish 39th. Brad Keselowski was tagged for an uncontrolled tire and restarted the race from the tail-end of the field.|$|E

5000|$|Stagger-EZ is {{a unique}} three place pusher canard aircraft, {{featuring}} staggered seating, a dihedral canard, and a rounder fuselage which differs from other canard aircraft in its class (e.g. Cozy MK IV, Velocity, Long-Ez). The aircraft has standard LongEZ wings and a redesigned fuselage. It was designed by a composite craftsman and pilot {{by the name of}} Steve Wright. After completing a VariEZe, Steve Wright found it to be a good design but small and lacking in features he wanted. He flew over a thousand hours in his VariEZe but wanted to build a second canard. He learned that a couple of pilots had suffered broken legs in Long-EZ accidents. So Steve began his design of a new canard that would incorporate several improvements. In 1999 he started by laying a keel {{down the center of the}} composite fuselage, which in turn caused the nose wheel to be moved to the right several inches. That improved legroom for the PIC position on the left. The reduced area on the right <b>floor</b> <b>board</b> did not allow for dual rudder pedals. The rods that control the elevator and aileron where positioned in a center console rather than down each side like a Cozy III. The right seater stick is 13 inches behind the left seater. Thus the right seat is [...] "Staggered" [...] back 13 inches. Lastly, a third seat is in the back behind the left seat. With a 42 inch wide fuselage, Steve ordered a custom canopy be made that is at least 20% larger than a Cozy III. The canopy does not open to the side, but is electric and moves up and back like many jet aircraft. Another major change was made to the landing gear. It was moved out and anchored in the strake area. (Any rocks or debris kicked up by the main landing gear are outside of the propeller arc.) Steve also incorporated a simpler fuel system. A central sump connects both fuel tanks. So the Stagger EZ has only one fuel cap but still holds 43 gallons. The Stagger EZ flew for the first time in 2004. Steve flew the Stagger EZ to EAA's [...] "Sun-N-Fun" [...] Fly-In and received [...] "Grand Champion" [...] in the home built category in 2005. Steve and Patricia Wright flew the Stagger EZ until 2009 when Steve came down with cancer. Steve died from melanoma cancer in May 2010. David Williford purchased the StaggerEZ in May 2011. He flew it for 50 hours before having to ground it for a major restoration which lasted almost two years. The Stagger EZ still flies today because of both Steve Wright and David Williford.
