5|$|While {{having no}} {{indigenous}} <b>fish</b> <b>population,</b> {{the lake was}} stocked from 1888 to 1941 {{with a variety of}} fish. Several species have formed self-sustaining populations.|$|E
5|$|Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania {{stated that}} Long Pond and Round Pond, two ponds in the watershed, {{had a large}} <b>fish</b> <b>population.</b> The creek was stocked with 700 fingerling, yearling, and adult brook trout in 1909.|$|E
5|$|The Fox River at Silver Springs has {{numerous}} {{species of}} freshwater fish including, bluegill, crappie, channel catfish, bullhead, carp, muskie and northern pike. The Loon and Beaver Lake <b>fish</b> <b>population</b> is maintained through human stocking. Channel catfish, bass, bluegill and crappie are stocked in both lakes.|$|E
50|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to have impacts on water temperatures, coral reefs and rainfall patterns which will in turn impact on local ecologies and habitat, breeding cycles and range of <b>fish</b> <b>populations.</b> Opportunities may be created as <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> shift southward.|$|R
25|$|The Boise National Forest is a US {{national}} forest located {{north and east}} {{of the city of}} Boise, Idaho. Following several uncharacteristically large wildfires, an immediately negative impact on <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> was observed, posing particular danger to small and isolated <b>fish</b> <b>populations.</b> In the long term, however, fire appears to rejuvenate fish habitats by causing hydraulic changes that increase flooding and lead to silt removal and the deposition of a favorable habitat substrate. This leads to larger post-fire <b>populations</b> of the <b>fish</b> that are able to recolonize these improved areas. But although fire generally appears favorable for <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> in these ecosystems, the more intense effects of uncharacteristic wildfires, in combination with the fragmentation of populations by human barriers to dispersal such as weirs and dams, will pose a threat to <b>fish</b> <b>populations.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2009, {{commercial}} fishermen in the New England, South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions that targeted depleted ocean <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> lost $ 164. 2 million and realized just 25 percent of potential revenues because of decades of overfishing  catching fish {{faster than they}} can reproduce (for full analysis, see www. pewenvironment. org/costofoverfishing). This additional income could have been earned had these <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> not been subject to years of overfishing that resulted in their current depleted condition. Congress recognized this costly legacy of overfishing in 2006 when it strengthened the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) with bipartisan requirements to establish science-based catch limits to end overfishing and rebuild depleted <b>fish</b> <b>populations.</b> Congress should stay the course with the MSA {{so that we can}} restore our nation's <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> to healthy levels and put those dollars back in fishermen's wallets...|$|R
5|$|Tourism and {{deforestation}} in {{the surroundings}} {{have taken a}} heavy toll on the lake, adversely affecting its water quality, reducing the water levels and destroying the <b>fish</b> <b>population.</b> As part of conservation measures, the government is undertaking de-silting, de-weeding, water treatment, and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme.|$|E
5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important arapaima (Arapaima gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the <b>fish</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to studies and accounts {{that showed the}} bad condition of the lake, the state restored the <b>fish</b> <b>population</b> of the lake in 1978. In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration {{of the lake and}} forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction. Since then, there have been seven plans for restoring natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration. Gradual improvements began taking place in the late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities. In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted a study to determine the specific elements of the park that needed restoration. Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures. An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts.|$|E

25|$|As {{for other}} Great Lakes <b>fish,</b> <b>populations</b> {{have also been}} {{affected}} by the accidental or intentional introduction of foreign species such as the sea lamprey and Eurasian ruffe. Accidental introductions have occurred in part by the removal of natural barriers to navigation between the Great Lakes. Overfishing has also been a factor in the decline of <b>fish</b> <b>populations.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a {{dredging}} project was proposed on Leggetts Creek {{to repair the}} damage caused by acid mine drainage and coal mining. In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the water chemistry and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington Sewer Authority began upgrading its sewage treatment plant to prevent wastewater and nutrient pollution from entering the creek. They also installed new sewer lines, including some that run parallel to or under the creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD Technical Assistance Program conducted a survey of the <b>fish</b> <b>population</b> in the creek on November 15, 2013. The Lackawanna Valley Conservancy once received a $190,000 Growing Greener grant for the Leggetts Creek Greenway.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual <b>fish</b> <b>population</b> in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the <b>fish</b> <b>population</b> and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E

25|$|Chalan Beel has {{experienced}} {{the negative effects}} of pesticide use in the surrounding farmlands. In 2010, Bangladesh Agricultural University research, found pesticide use has increased sixfold since 1982, and the <b>fish</b> <b>population</b> of Chalan Beel has halved in the same period. A 25 kilometre highway constructed on the Beel has divided into two and caused havoc on the fish breeding by disrupting their movement.

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} {{the role of}} <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> in {{generating}} ecosystem services based on documented ecological functions and human demands of fish. The ongoing overexploitation of global fish resources concerns our societies, {{not only in terms}} of decreasing <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> important for consumption and recreational activities. Rather, a number of ecosystem services generated by <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> are also at risk, with consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and ultimately human welfare. Examples are provided from marine and freshwater ecosystems, in various parts of the world, and include all life-stages of fish. Ecosystem services are here defined as fundamental services for maintaining ecosystem functioning and resilience, or demand-derived services based on human values. To secure the generation of ecosystem services from <b>fish</b> <b>populations,</b> management approaches need to address the fact that fish are embedded in ecosystems and that substitutions for declining populations and habitat losses, such as fish stocking and nature reserves, rarely replace losses of all services. © 199...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} goals {{of this program}} are to Award Number: N 00014 (1) instantaneously detect, image and spatially chart <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> over continental-shelf scales, and (2) continuously monitor the areal densities and behavior of these <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> over time using a novel low to mid frequency acoustic system (300 - 5000 Hz) referred to as Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS). This new method will be applied to explore the abundance, temporal and spatial distributions and behavior of <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> in the Gulf of Maine on and near Georges Bank, a marine ecosystem being studied in the Census of Marine Life program.

40|$|This work is {{the result}} of a 3 -year {{monitoring}} programme for assessing the effect that the Ses Negres marine reserve has had on <b>fish</b> <b>populations.</b> Species richness (based on fish species that are considered to be reserve effect indicators), and the size structure of 4 species vulnerable to angling and spear fishing were studied by visual censuses conducted both inside and outside the marine reserve. Analysis of <b>fish</b> <b>populations</b> inside the reserve showed a reserve effect (larger sizes, higher abundance and richer fish assemblages) when compared to the non-reserve sites, especially by the end of the study period. The results highlight the importance of marine reserves for the recovery of <b>fish</b> <b>populations.</b> Future management plans are discussed for this marine reserve...|$|R
