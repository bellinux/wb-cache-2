40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an installation and assembly device and method for facilitating the <b>fitup</b> of mating components during blind or remote installation and assembly, especially where close <b>fitup</b> tolerances are involved. The present invention is particularly {{useful for the}} purpose of facilitating vertical and/or radial relative positioning of a pump impeller within a mating inlet nozzle during a blind assembly wherein actual <b>fitup</b> cannot be observed during installation. The information within identifies just one successful application of the installation and assembly alignment device for a pump. The device, however, is not solely limited to pump assembly but can be used in other cases where <b>fitup</b> of a sleeve inside a mating bore is required under conditions of close tolerance during a blind or remote assembly. The device is likewise not limited to circular configurations but can be used for many other shapes or configurations. Any material that can be machined and hold reasonably close tolerances can be used for the device. Also, because the sleeve position is adjusted by set screws or bolts, the concentricity can be radially biased, if required, to achieve particular alignment conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a metal's thermophysical {{properties}} on its weldability are examined. The thermal conductivity, melting point, absorptivity and thermal diffusivity of the metal and the laser beam focused diameter and welding speed influence the minimum beam irradiance required for melting and welding. Beam diameter, surface tension and viscosity of the molten metal affect weld pool stability and weld quality. Lower surface tension and viscosity increases weld pool instability. With larger beam diameters causing wider welds, dropout also increases. Effects of focused beam diameter and joint <b>fitup</b> on weldability are also examined. Small beam diameters are sensitive to beam coupling problems in relation to <b>fitup</b> precision in addition to beam alignment to the seam. Welding parameters for mitigating weld pool instability and increasing weld quality are derived from the above considerations. Guidelines are presented for the tailoring of welding parameters to achieve good welds. Weldability problems can also be anticipated from the properties of a metal...|$|E
40|$|This program {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} common manufacturing variables on spike-tempering effectiveness. The investigation used design-of-experiment (DOE) techniques, and examined both dual-phase and martensitic grades of high-strength steels (HSS). The specific grades chosen for this project were: Dual-phase (DP) 600, galvannealed (GA), 1. 55 mm (DP) 600; Dual-phase (DP) 980 (uncoated), 1. 55 mm (DP) 980; and Martensitic (M) 1300, 1. 55 mm (M) 1300. Common manufacturing conditions of interest included tempering practice (quench and temper time), button size, simulated part <b>fitup</b> (sheet angular misalignment and <b>fitup),</b> and electrode wear (increased electrode face diameter). All of these conditions were evaluated against mechanical performance (static and dynamic tensile shear). Weld hardness data was also used to examine correlations between mechanical performance {{and the degree of}} tempering. Mechanical performance data was used to develop empirical models. The models were used to examine the robustness of weld strength and toughness to the selected processing conditions. This was done using standard EWI techniques. Graphical representations of robustness were then coupled with metallographic data to relate mechanical properties to the effectiveness of spike tempering. Mechanical properties for all three materials were relatively robust to variation in tempering. Major deviations in mechanical properties were caused by degradation of the weld itself. This was supported by a lack of correlation between hardness data and mechanical results. Small button sizes and large electrode face diameters (worn electrodes) produced large reductions in both static and dynamic strength levels when compared to standard production setups. Dynamic strength was further degraded by edge-located welds...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began {{developing}} a case management software system called the Virtual Case File in 2000, but eventually abandoned {{the project in}} April 2005. The cost of this project {{was estimated to be}} over $ 170 million, and this waste of tax payer money drew sharp criticism. The impetus for the project was due to the FBI’s aging technology infrastructure that included 386 -based personal computers and a 12 -year-old network system. In 2000, Congress allocated almost $ 340 million for the proposed FBI Information Technology Upgrade Project (<b>FITUP)</b> that was soon divided into three parts and renamed Trilogy. This project was scheduled to take three years and included an enterprise-wide upgrade of desktop hardware and software and the implementation of a more modern and secure network. In addition, a Virtual Case File system would include a case management system, an evidence management system, and a records management system that would replace the FBI’s antiquated case management system which limited the FBI’s ability to carry out its mission effectively. This study provides a qualitative analysis of this IT project failure. More specifically, this study attempts to answer the questions: Was the failure of the FBI’s Virtual Case File project unique...|$|E
