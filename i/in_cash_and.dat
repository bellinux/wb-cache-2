5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 1909, American-Hawaiian, looking to expand its fleet, placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for three new cargo ships—Kentuckian, Georgian, and Honolulan. The {{contract}} for the ships required that American-Hawaiian pay $1,000,000 <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> a further $650,000 in twelve monthly notes at 5% interest. Provisions of the deal allowed that the monthly notes could be converted into longer-term mortgages at 6% interest, and secured by the ships themselves.

Litras picked up $9,385 <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> prizes in five total spins, but because she managed to hit spaces with extra spins, she only used three.|$|E

Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes alleviate contestants' financial burden. An exception is provided for returning champions who must make several flights to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Before December 1981, {{the show}} did not feature a bonus round. Under the bonus round's {{original}} rules, no letters were provided automatically. The contestant asked for five consonants and a vowel, {{and then had}} fifteen seconds to attempt solving the puzzle. Also, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant {{at the start of}} the round. The current time limit and rules for letter selection were introduced on October 3, 1988. Starting on September 4, 1989, the first episode of the seventh syndicated season, bonus prizes were selected by the contestant choosing from one of five envelopes labeled W, H, E, E, and L. One prize was always $25,000 <b>in</b> <b>cash,</b> <b>and</b> the rest were changed weekly. Any prize that was won was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week. During seasons 16 through 18 (1998–2001), the $25,000 remained in-place the entire week of shows regardless if it was won. At the start of season 19 in 2001, there were three car envelopes and two $25,000 envelopes, which were available the entire week of shows. These envelopes were replaced with the bonus wheel on October 22, 2001.|$|E

5|$|By May1, {{the local}} {{branch of the}} Red Cross {{distributed}} essential supplies to residents in Labutta Township. In coordination with the Disaster Assistance Response Team, the areas in greatest need for aid were identified and requests for tarpaulin were made. Members of the Cabinet of Burma donated 3.7million kyat (US$2,960) <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> 140bags of rice to victims in the Ayeyarwady Region. On May3, another 1.7million kyat (US$1,360) was donated by social organizations to residents in rural areas outside Yangon. Temporary shelters were set up across Gwa Township. Local donations provided residents in the town with 200,000kyat (US$160) worth of blankets, clothes, and cash. A local newspaper, The New Light of Myanmar, claimed that government officials immediately provided assistance to affected residents across the country. Red Cross operations continued through November30, by which time 3,485families were provided with aid. Additionally, though the agency planned to assist 4,000families with rebuilding their homes, a lack of necessary funds prevented the operation. Instead, a cash donation was provided to the 1,000most affected families.|$|E
5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 <b>in</b> <b>cash,</b> <b>and</b> notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
5|$|Jaffna kingdom {{was less}} feudalized than other kingdoms in Sri Lanka, such as Kotte and Kandy. Its economy {{was based on}} more money {{transactions}} than transactions on land or its produce. The Jaffna defense forces were not feudal levies; soldiers in the kings service were paid in cash. The king’s officials, namely Mudaliayars, were also paid <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> the numerous Hindu temples seem not to have owned extensive properties, unlike the Buddhist establishments in the South. Temples and the administrators depended on the king and the worshippers for their upkeep. Royal and Army officials were thus a salaried class and these three institutions consumed over 60% of the revenues of the kingdom and 85% of the government expenditures. Much of the kingdom's revenues also came from cash except the Elephants from the Vanni feudatories. At {{the time of the}} conquest by the Portuguese in 1620, the kingdom which was truncated in size and restricted to the Jaffna peninsula had revenues of 11,700 pardaos of which 97% came from land or sources connected to the land. One was called land rent and another called paddy tax called arretane.|$|E

5|$|On January31, the {{government}} of Swaziland {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from the international community. South Africa provided two helicopters to the country to survey the affected areas. Various countries and United Nations agencies provided about $1.01million <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> supplies to Swaziland. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided $20,000. The European Economic Community donated about $80,000 to purchase tents and blankets. The Lutheran World Federation donated $20,000 in cash, along with generators and blankets, while World Vision International sent $10,000 in cash. Within a week, workers reopened most major roads to travel, and by February24, most roads were reopened. Workers also quickly restored the downed power lines. Relief items were distributed by both air and road in the weeks following the storm, coordinated by the Swaziland Red Cross and assisted by volunteer organizations. In part due to Domoina as well as the previously occurring drought, the economy of Swaziland stagnated through 1985.|$|E
5|$|On January4, 1973, a Pacific Western Airlines Convair {{turboprop}} airliner {{preparing to}} take off from Vancouver, British Columbia, for a flight to Penticton with 18 people on board was hijacked by 26-year-old passenger Christopher Kenneth Nielson, who drew a gun and demanded $2 million <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> to be flown to North Vietnam, threatening {{to blow up the}} airliner if his demands were not met. During negotiations at Vancouver International Airport, Nielson allowed the other 13 passengers and one crew member to disembark, leaving three crew members aboard the plane with him. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) then stormed the plane and arrested Nielson, finding that he was armed only with two toy guns. There were no fatalities in the incident.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> <b>and</b> a pack of pornographic playing cards.
