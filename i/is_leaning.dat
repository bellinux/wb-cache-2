25|$|The Saracens have invaded France and {{are laying}} siege to Paris. The Saracen king has a giant {{to whom he}} has promised the hand of his {{beautiful}} daughter Marsabelle if he can bring to her {{the head of the}} French king, Dagobert. At this moment, the giant <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> over the city wall of Paris, taunting the population and threatening to destroy them all. Everyone is terrified. Six knights have already sallied out and been slaughtered by this giant. Now he <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> over the wall again and taunting them all once more.|$|E
25|$|For example, in the Rishabaandhika or the Vrishabavahana murthy pose, we see Shiva {{standing}} {{with one leg}} youthfully crossed across the other and his arm elegantly flexed and raised as if resting or leaning on something. In this elegant posture, it can be surmised that the youthful and athletic Shiva <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> on his bull-vahana, Nandhi, on whose shoulders He is resting His arm.|$|E

25|$|In an {{alternative}} method, {{a large piece}} of fuel wood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile. Then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuel wood, and the other resting on the ground, so that the kindling <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> over the tinder pile. This method is useful in very high winds, as the piece of fuel wood acts as a windbreak.|$|E
25|$|In Paris {{there is}} a full length marble statue by Pierre Julien, now in the Louvre, that was {{commissioned}} in 1781 and exhibited at the 1785 Salon. The writer is represented in an ample cloak, sitting in contemplation on a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes is climbing. On his knee is the manuscript of the fable of the fox and the grapes, while at his feet a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, looking up at him. Small scale porcelain models were made of this by the Sèvres pottery and in polychrome porcelain by the Frankenthal pottery. In the following century small models were made of the bronze statue by Etienne Marin Melingue, exhibited in Paris in 1840 and in London in 1881. In this the poet <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> thoughtfully against a rock, hat in hand. Also in the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre is the 1857 standing stone statue by Jean-Louis Jaley.|$|E
500|$|Matinée de Septembre (English: September Morn) is a {{controversial}} oil painting on canvas completed in 1911 by the French artist Paul Émile Chabas. Painted over several summers, it depicts a nude girl or young woman {{standing in the}} shallow water of a lake, prominently lit by the morning sun. She <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> slightly forward in an ambiguous posture, which has been read variously as a straightforward portrayal of protecting her modesty, huddling against the cold, or sponge bathing. It has also been considered a disingenuous pose permitting the [...] "fetishisation of innocence".|$|E

The maxi CD features an extra lyric booklet, printed on plain white paper. Musically, [...] "Computer City" [...] is a technopop song, influenced by electronic music. A staff editor from Amazon Japan {{noted that the}} song contained elements of technopop and 8-bit music. Ian Martin from AllMusic stated that the song, alongside their back catalogue from Tokuma Japan Communications, [...] "adopt a vocoder-heavy production style strongly influenced by European electro and house". Similarly, a staff editor at CD Journal labelled the songs composition as [...] "addictive technopop".|$|E
500|$|Scenes {{featuring}} Beyoncé and Paul {{are shown}} separately. The video begins with Paul {{sitting on a}} throne while toasting; Beyoncé <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> against a wall and dancing. In the following scene, Beyoncé is seen on a bed tossing herself. Paul is shown with several women who are {{lying on the floor}} caressing each other. Beyoncé walks towards the beach; she spots a man, and the two touch and flirt. As the second verse of the begins, Beyoncé is at a party. At the party Beyoncé decides to dance with the same man that she interacted with earlier. Then, water floods the floor of the party as she sings [...] "the dance floor becomes the sea". As the second chorus of the song begins, the video is cut with scenes of Beyoncé and four back-up dancers dancing on a platform in the sand on the beach. The original track is interrupted towards the end with an Arabic instrumental, designed for the music video. This section showcases Beyoncé vigorously dancing on the sand.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ugly" [...] {{was directed by}} Toby Tremlett and filmed on 1 November 2005. It {{is set in a}} warehouse in New York City that is used for people who are taking part in an audition. It begins with a yellow taxi driving on a New York City road with apartment complexes. As the song begins, Buena sings her verse while looking into a mirror, and other people in the warehouse begin to hold up signs of the song's lyrics. During the chorus, they begin to showcase their talents such as dancing and juggling. Buchanan's chorus features her sitting on a staircase; during this part, a child holds up a sign reading [...] "short" [...] while a woman carries a sign saying [...] "loneliness". As Range sings the bridge, she <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> on a wall in the warehouse while more people begin dancing. When Sugababes sing the chorus again, they dance with the people who also begin to show other talents, including instrumentation and magic tricks. As the video ends, a row of people hold up signs containing one word from the song's lyrics, [...] "people are all the same".|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Lemme See" [...] {{was released on}} June 14, 2012, and was directed by Philip Andelman. The video opens with a close-up of Usher's estate, and a woman bound by ropes. Usher is stood by a swimming pool singing the first verse, with the pool reflecting on him. During the pre-chorus, Usher <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> against a wall while pulling up his top to reveal his chest. Entering the chorus, the video intercuts to Usher preparing drinks for himself and the tied up woman– his love interest. With the second verse, Usher is admiring his still tied up love interest. In the second pre-chorus, leaned against a wall Usher removes his shirt, while the video intercuts to him approaching his love interest to make love. Entering Rick Ross' verse, Ross is sat down shirtless, accompanied by two women sat by him left and right. Touching Ross' back, their tattoos transfer on to Ross and bloom. Him and Usher are both by a pool with Ross performing his rap, while in an intercut scene Usher's love interest is being released from her tied up predicament. In the final chorus, Usher and his love interest make love in a risqué scene, with both their tattoos moving and blooming on {{to each other in}} a similar way to Ross' scene. This alternates with the latter scene, Usher leaned against the wall and him and Ross by the pool, with Usher singing the verse. The video ends with Ross and Usher echoing the song's title.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} footage of Frankie Sandford {{sitting in a}} tree; Mollie King is show riding a bike along a dustry road; while Vanessa White <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> against {{the walls of a}} {{crumbling}} building; the camera flies past Rochelle Wiseman, who stands on the beach by the water's edge and Una Healy drives a convertible car along a dusty road. As the chorus plays for the first time, the cameras follow the girls as they respectively walk around their surroundings, bar Sandford who remains in the tree and White who does not move from her spot. In the verse following, King is sitting by the road side with her bike and Wiseman is seen sitting on the rocks near the water's edge. Then as the chorus breaks for the second time the girls are seen dancing a choreographed routine on a sandy beach. Each is wearing a flowing maxi dress (see image alongside). The interspliced scenes of Sandford walking through trees gained a mention in The Daily Mail. [...] "Sandford is seen wearing a cropped white top and white shorts, Frankie walks casually through a field in the video, seemingly unaware of the attention her astonishing six pack is receiving." [...] The song's bridge mainly focusses on footage of the girls at a beach party dancing to the DJ, while the final run of the chorus sees the camera rotate around the girls as they dance on the beach. There is a brief view of the seaside villas in the background. It ends by showing the footage from the scenes {{at the start of the}} video, showing each of the girls in turn.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the music}} videos for [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] "Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)", and [...] "Diva", {{the one for}} [...] "Ego" [...] was shot in black and white. The word [...] "bitch" [...] is muted out when Beyoncé sings, [...] "I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch!". [...] "Ego" [...] is the first video from I Am... Sasha Fierce in which she has curly afro hair, {{similar to the one}} in [...] "Work It Out". It is also the first video from the Sasha Fierce disc of her album where she does not don her robot-glove. The video {{features}} Beyoncé and her two backup female dancers all dressed in silver leotards and performing similar choreography, which has reminiscence of that of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Later, Beyoncé sits on a white glittery chair in front of the same tiled background; she is wearing black coat and the two dancers are still dancing in unison around her. There are a few shots of her on the chair facing the back of the camera with the dancers doing the same. Beyoncé then gets up to join the dance being executed by the two female around the chair. This scene ends as they walk {{to the left of the}} camera, into the next scene. Beyoncé is still with the tiled background. She and her dancers are now holding poles as props with which they dance. During the same pole scene, some shots of her singing in the chair are intercut. In the next scene, with the same tiled background, Beyoncé <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> against the wall as the bridge of the song has been reached. Her dancers spin in heels around her, and they all then continue to dance against the wall. The last scene shows Beyoncé in the chair, without the black jacket and still dancing until the song ends.|$|E

2500|$|Whichever way a Magnétophone track <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> {{in terms}} of its 'influence' or 'style', there is a {{tangible}} thread of intelligent and careful boundary-searching and maverick but conscientious sound construction through it; and always towards the end of creating a slightly uncomfortable environment for a proper song to play out in. Somehow, like Francis Bacon's 'snail trail of human presence' being evident in a painting, Magnétophone's music quietly announces that they have attended there, whilst suggesting it was perhaps other people.

2500|$|The {{forms of}} Chola bronzes are very plastic. They are devoid of {{intricate}} ornaments and designs {{in comparison with}} the subsequent bronzes of the Vijayanagar and Nayaka period. There is gentle grace, a restrained and quiet elegance, an ethereal, out-worldly beauty, and above all else - a life that throbs and pulsates and thereby enlivens the bronze sculpture. By means of [...] the facial expressions, the gestures or mudras the overall body posture and other accompanying bronzes we can imagine the surroundings and the religious context of the figure of the god or goddess; what instrument or weapon he or she is holding; what he or she <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> on; and what he or she is doing or about to do.|$|E
2500|$|Leaving the apartment, Mamiya crosses {{paths with}} Yasujiro and {{questions}} {{him about the}} rifle. Yasujiro explains {{that there was no}} black market involvement; he gave his rifle as a gift to Hassan Ibrahim, his hunting guide on a trip in Morocco. About to depart, Mamiya offers condolences for the wife's suicide. Yasujiro, however, is confused by the mention of a balcony and angrily replies: [...] "My wife shot herself in the head. Chieko was the first to find the body. I've explained this to the police many times." [...] After leaving, Mamiya stops at a bar to read Chieko's note. The note's contents are not revealed. Chieko <b>is</b> <b>leaning</b> on the balcony nude when her father enters the apartment, and the two embrace as she breaks down in tears.|$|E
