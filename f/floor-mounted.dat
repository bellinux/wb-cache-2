25|$|N {{position}} of the <b>floor-mounted</b> shift lever means that the transmission is in neutral. Similar to P above, both clutch packs and all gear-sets are fully disengaged; however, the parking lock is also disengaged.|$|E
25|$|A <b>floor-mounted</b> three-speed manual {{transmission}} was standard equipment with the V6 {{on the base}} model and the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic was optional. Turbo Hydra-Matic was standard on LJ and SJ models and base models with either of the optional V8 engines.|$|E
25|$|The same {{assortment}} of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option {{this year was}} a <b>floor-mounted</b> four-speed manual transmission.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of the summer focused on the design and construction of key components of a carbon arc/inert gas reactor for fullerene production, that is suitable for reduced gravity experiments onboard the KC- 135 aircraft. The apparatus will be configured for both <b>floor-mount</b> and free-floating operation providing access to reduction to 10 (exp - 2) and 10 (exp - 3) of normal respectively. It is planned to incorporate 'seat belt' restraints that will allow a safe transition from reduced gravity free-float to full gravity, {{at the end of}} the parabolic...|$|R
50|$|As was {{the case}} with {{previous}} Dodge rebadges of Plymouth Valiants, such as the 1961-1962 Lancer, sales of the Demon lagged behind those of the Duster. With optional hood scoops and blackout hood treatment, the car was advertised a performance car. The Demon's Dart-type front fender wheel lips and Duster-type rear wheel fender lips reveal the car was essentially a Duster with Dart front sheetmetal and other minor styling changes. A new audio option became available for 1971: Chrysler's cassette-recorder. Unlike the 8-track tapes, the cassette player was relatively compact, and it was mounted on the console or on its own <b>floor-mount</b> casing. This unit offered an available microphone in which one could record their own dictation.|$|R
25|$|The direct-shift gearbox uses a <b>floor-mounted</b> {{transmission}} shift lever, {{very similar to}} that of a conventional automatic transmission. The lever is operated in a straight 'fore and aft' plane (without any 'dog-leg' offset movements), and uses an additional button to help prevent an inadvertent selection of an inappropriate shift lever position.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} factors to {{consider}} when deciding between ceiling- and <b>floor-mounted</b> systems. Ceiling-mounted systems require substantial ceiling space and, therefore, reduce the options to install surgical lights or booms. Nonetheless, many hospitals choose ceiling-mounted systems because they cover the whole body with more flexibility and – most importantly – without moving the table. The latter is sometimes a difficult and dangerous undertaking during surgery with the many lines and catheters that must also be moved. Moving from a parking to a working position during surgery, however, is easier with a <b>floor-mounted</b> system, because the C-arm just turns in from the side and does {{not interfere with the}} anesthesiologist. The ceiling-mounted system, by contrast, during surgery can hardly move to a parking position at the head end without colliding with anesthesia equipment. In an overcrowded environment like the OR, biplane systems add to the complexity and interfere with anesthesia, except for neurosurgery, where anesthesia is not at the head end. Monoplane systems are therefore clearly recommended for rooms mainly used for cardiac surgery.|$|E
25|$|The Trabant 1100 (also {{known as}} the P1100) was a 601 with a better-performing 1.05-liter, 45HP VW Polo engine. With a more-modern look (including a <b>floor-mounted</b> gearshift), it was quieter and cleaner than its predecessor. The 1100 had front disc brakes, and its wheel {{assembly}} was borrowed from Volkswagen. It was produced between from 1989 to 1991, in parallel with the two-stroke P601. Except for the engine and transmission, many parts from older P50s, P60s and 601s were compatible with the 1100.|$|E
25|$|To {{calculate}} the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have <b>floor-mounted</b> load transducers, {{also known as}} force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces and moments, including the magnitude, direction and location (called the center of pressure). The spatial distribution of forces can be measured with pedobarography equipment. Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at every stage of the gait cycle. The computational method for {{this is known as}} inverse dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The {{monocoque}} fuselage {{is composed}} of composite materials and is equipped with sliding side doors on either side along with a rear clamshell door; an atypical feature of the fuselage {{is the presence of}} a series of <b>floor-mounted</b> windows between the pilots seats for additional vertical visibility. Some of the composite materials used have been produced using out of autoclave composite manufacturing from suppliers such as TenCate and Gurit. According to Marenco, inspiration for the fuselage's design was drawn from the automotive industry. It has been stated that the firm has sought to introduce the cabin volume of medium-sized twin-engine helicopters to the single-engine market.|$|E
25|$|Factory options {{consisted}} of a heating system with windshield defroster, power drum brakes, power steering, bright molding package, protective side moldings, parcel shelf, courtesy lights (separate or in-shelf), luxury wheel covers, sports steering wheel, custom steering wheel, passenger's side remote mirror, remote-controlled driver's side remote mirror, bright panel between taillights, and metal bumper guards with rubber edges. Dealership options included a universal 6000 RPM VDO tachometer with dual hands, full vinyl roof with additional bright moldings, heavy-duty suspension (front sway bar and stiffer adjustable shock absorbers), <b>floor-mounted</b> shifter for the three-speed transmission, front disk brakes, locking gas cap, license plate frames, mud flaps, trunk cover luggage rack, universal air conditioning system, among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} three six-cylinder engines carried {{over to the}} HT series, however the {{transmission}} options for the V8 engines were many and varied. Initially, the 253 V8 only came with either three-speed column- or four-speed <b>floor-mounted</b> manual transmissions. The 307 V8 was only available with two-speed Powerglide automatic. This arrangement continued until the 307 stocks were exhausted, following which the 253 and 308 locally built V8 engines could then be ordered with any manual or automatic transmission across the range, excepting the Holden Brougham which was always specified as a 308 automatic. A new locally manufactured three-speed automatic transmission, the Tri-Matic, was introduced late {{in the life of}} the HT range, except on HT Brougham which retained the two-speed automatic Powerglide transmission.|$|E
25|$|The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were {{updated with}} cleaner {{front-end}} styling {{courtesy of a}} fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. Parking lights moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. Taillight and backup lights were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with <b>floor-mounted</b> four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, oil pressure, and temperature gauges.|$|E
25|$|For 1992, the Taurus was {{available}} in three models; L, GL, and LX. As with the first generation, the L was the basic model, the GL was the mid-priced value model, and the LX was the luxury model. Due to disappointing sales, the L was dropped after 1992, leaving the GL as the entry-level model. For the 1995 model year, a new SE model was added, {{intended to be a}} budget version of the SHO. It was a step above the entry-level GL, a step below the top of the line LX, and came standard with front bucket seats and a center console with a <b>floor-mounted</b> shifter, as well as a rear spoiler borrowed from the SHO. The SE was never available as a wagon.|$|E
25|$|To {{close the}} price {{gap between the}} Taurus and the Ford Contour, {{as well as to}} {{increase}} sales, an entry-level G model was added midway into the 1996 model year, as essentially a slightly de-contented GL. For the 1998 model year, the models of Taurus were completely changed. The G and GL were dropped, and the LX became the entry-level/value model. The SE model from 1995 was revived, and it became the top-tier model. The SE was offered with two special packages; the Comfort package which added chrome wheels carried over from the LX, automatic climate control, the Duratec engine V6 (see below), and bucket seats with a center console and a <b>floor-mounted</b> shifter, or the Sport package, which contained all of the features in the comfort package, but substituted the chrome wheels for 5-spoke alloy wheels.|$|E
25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} <b>floor-mounted</b> shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
500|$|Two {{transmissions}} {{were available}} for the BA—a four-speed automatic and a five-speed manual, both <b>floor-mounted.</b> The automatic unit featured Sequential Sports Shift, a first for the Falcon nameplate in Australia. Utility body styles were also available with an optional column-mounted automatic shifter (without Sequential Sports Shift) {{in lieu of the}} <b>floor-mounted</b> system also offered. The new Control-Blade independent rear suspension (IRS) fitted to all sedans—first used in development of the Ford Focus and the Jaguar X-Type— was superior to the optional double wishbone IRS suspension used on AU sedans, and was cheaper. However, it was heavier than the previous live rear axle used for base models, and the change contributed to the base model XT sedan's [...] weight increase from the previous model. The wagons and utilities retained the leaf spring live axle rear suspension of the AU wagon and utility; consequently, they did not gain as much weight as the sedan.|$|E
2500|$|R {{position}} of the <b>floor-mounted</b> shift lever means that the transmission is in reverse. [...] This functions {{in a similar way}} to D, but there is just one reverse gear. When selected, R is highlighted in the instrument display.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1968, the new AMX [...] {{engine was}} {{offered as a}} [...] "Go-package" [...] option with a <b>floor-mounted</b> {{automatic}} or manual four-speed transmission. [...] "Its impressive [...] and [...] of torque could send the Javelin from zero to [...] in the seven-second range." ...|$|E
2500|$|Information is {{provided}} to the driver through a [...] freestanding instrument cluster and a [...] central information display. The bench-derived front seats replace the center tunnel that bisected the cabin and a <b>floor-mounted</b> transmission, brake levers or center console are also absent.|$|E
2500|$|This generation's {{interior}} wasn't as configurable {{as that of}} {{the first}} two generations. The G and GL models (see below) were only available with steering column-mounted shifter, along with a cloth front bench seat and the [...] "Flip-Fold" [...] center console. The LX, on the other hand, came standard with bucket seats that could be ordered with either cloth or leather upholstery, along with a center console and <b>floor-mounted</b> shifter. However, a column-mounted shifter and a cloth front bench was available as a no-cost option. In 1999, the interior was again available in three configurations, like that of the first-generation Taurus; a front bench seat with a column-mounted shifter, front bucket seats with a center console and <b>floor-mounted</b> shifter, or front bucket seats with a center console and a column-mounted shifter. Each configuration was offered in both Taurus models (see below).|$|E
2500|$|This model {{featured}} bucket seats, special {{interior and}} exterior trim, {{as well as a}} revised roofline. The base price of this top-of-the-line model was US$2,523 with the standard [...] I6; however, more sports oriented options were available that included a new-for-1966 Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual <b>floor-mounted</b> transmission, dash mounted tachometer, as well as the [...] V8 producing , which was only an extra $65.|$|E
2500|$|While some candlepin alleys have {{automated}} scoring systems, {{and thus}} {{know when to}} clear and reset pins, other alleys, especially older ones have a button, or <b>floor-mounted</b> foot pedal switch, which players must press to manually initiate the clearing and resetting of pins. Automatic pinsetters were introduced in the late 1940s; prior to this, as with ten-pin, pins were set by workers called [...] "pinboys".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "X" [...] Package: Available as the Pacer X from 1975–1978 in coupe form, {{this version}} was renamed Sport in 1978 and {{subsequently}} eliminated. The trim package consisted of vinyl bucket seats, sports {{steering wheel and}} custom trim, {{as well as a}} <b>floor-mounted</b> gear shift and front sway bar. The model received exterior chrome features, styled road wheels, Pacer X decals on the doors, and other package identification.|$|E
2500|$|P {{position}} of the <b>floor-mounted</b> gear shift lever means that the transmission is set in park. [...] Both clutch packs are fully disengaged, all gear-sets are disengaged, and a solid mechanical transmission lock {{is applied to the}} crown wheel of the DSG's internal differential. [...] This position must only be used when the motor vehicle is [...] [...] Furthermore, this is the position which must be set on the shift lever before the vehicle ignition key can be removed.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{innovation}} was the [...] "Flip-Fold" [...] {{center console}} on cars not {{equipped with a}} standard floor console. [...] It was a seat in between the bucket seats that could {{be transformed into a}} console, reducing the seating count by one. [...] The seat cushion folded out into a console with a lockable storage bin and cupholders, resting against the dashboard. [...] The seatback also folded down to become an armrest. A traditional center console with a <b>floor-mounted</b> shifter was installed on cars equipped without the flip fold console.|$|E
2500|$|When the <b>floor-mounted</b> gear {{selector}} lever is in position D, the DSG works in fully automatic mode, with {{emphasis placed on}} gear shifts programmed to deliver maximum fuel economy. That means that shifts will change up and down {{very early in the}} rev-range. As an example, on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 GTI, sixth gear will be engaged around , when initially using the DSG transmission with the default ECU adaptation; although with an [...] "aggressive" [...] or [...] "sporty" [...] driving style, the adaptive shift pattern will increase the vehicle speed at which sixth gear engages.|$|E
2500|$|Under the bonnet, the car {{utilised}} the new Villiers Mk 35A unit {{designed specifically}} for it. A development of the 9E, the new engine incorporated numerous mechanical refinements to improve strength and reliability, albeit slightly {{at the cost of}} overall power, now rated at [...] at 4,500rpm. Rear suspension was completely revised, with trailing arm units controlled by Armstrong dampers. The rod and cable brake systems of previous cars was also replaced by a Lockheed semi hydraulic and rod braking system (front brake fully hydraulic, but rear brakes still rod operated from a central <b>floor-mounted</b> hydraulic cylinder) acting on all three wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The package {{started with}} an {{exclusive}} engine version, the high performance [...] 9.8:1 compression ratio 232 six cylinder with Carter WCD carburetor and 266 degree camshaft designed by VAM's own engineering department. The {{rest of the}} accessories consisted of a black two-arm sports steering wheel with a central bullseye emblem, wide reclining individual front seats, <b>floor-mounted</b> Hurst Performance shifter 150-T three-speed manual transmission with locking mechanism connected to the steering wheel ignition switch, full bright molding package including rear panel overlay between the tail lights and two courtesy lights. Unlike the 1969 version, power drum brakes were no longer included, which were available separately as optional equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Slight {{interior}} cosmetic {{changes were}} also implemented for each new model year, and a full-length center console with <b>floor-mounted</b> shifter was available as an extra-cost option with the Strato bucket seats from 1968 to 1970, though few Toronados were so ordered. The {{vast majority of}} customers went for the standard Strato bench seat {{to take full advantage}} of the flatter floor resulting from the front-drive layout; the lack of a [...] "hump" [...] in the floor made three-abreast seating more comfortable than in rear-drive cars, as the center passengers both front and rear did not have to sit with their legs in an awkward position.|$|E
2500|$|Some transit buses, such {{as those}} in New York, have had, since at least the 1950s, turn signals {{activated}} by <b>floor-mounted</b> momentary-contact footswitches on the floor near the driver's left foot (on left-hand drive buses). The foot-activated signals allow bus drivers to keep both hands on the steering wheel while watching the road and scanning for passengers as they approach a bus stop. New York City Transit bus drivers, among others, are trained to step continuously on the right directional switch while servicing a bus stop, to signal other road users they are intentionally dwelling at the stop, allowing following buses to skip that stop. [...] This method of signalling requires no special arrangements for self-cancellation or passing.|$|E
2500|$|It has an {{electronically}} controlled five-speed ZF 5HP24A tiptronic {{automatic transmission}} (parts code prefix: 01L, identification code: GAG) (gear ratios—1st: 3.571, 2nd: 2.200, 3rd: 1.505, 4th: 1.000, 5th: 0.804), with lock-up torque converter in all forward gears. [...] It has [...] "hill detection" [...] capability, and, despite many press articles {{stating that the}} gearbox was programmed to [...] "blip" [...] the throttle for downshift gear changes, no UK owners have ever found this feature to be present. [...] The transmission control unit ECU incorporates [...] "fuzzy logic" [...] with its [...] "Dynamic Shift Programme" [...] (DSP), with the shift pattern adapting to suit individual driving styles. [...] 'Tiptronic' manual control can be achieved with either the <b>floor-mounted</b> gear shift lever, or the steering wheel mounted 'paddles'.|$|E
2500|$|British-made Mokes were {{fitted with}} a low-end 848cc {{transverse}} inline-four engine, detuned to use low-octane fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10inch wheels as the standard Mini. In the initial offering, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, windscreen washer and a removable canvas top were all optional equipment delivered separately from the vehicle. Owners had to bolt these optional extras onto the vehicle themselves. The base price was GB£ 405. The [...] "Mk I" [...] Mokes had a single windscreen wiper and a <b>floor-mounted</b> headlight dip switch, and the only colour available was [...] "Spruce Green". In 1967, the [...] "Mk II" [...] Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.|$|E
2500|$|The 1969 {{model year}} cars were {{almost the same}} as their {{immediate}} predecessors with only minor changes. VAM developed its own performance model {{in the form of an}} optional package for the two-door sedan that was named Rambler American Rally, being the highest novelty for the year. This model was inspired by VAM's successful 1965 racing season using Rambler American sedans and hardtops, as well as a growing domestic market demand for muscle and performance cars. The package consisted of a two-barrel [...] I6 engine, power drum brakes, fender-mounted [...] "232 SIX" [...] rectangular emblems and individual reclining front seats with center folding armrest. Transmission was a three-speed manual with column-mounted shifter with a <b>floor-mounted</b> gearshift as a dealership option. Other factory options included a dash mounted 8,000 RPM tachometer and the sport steering wheel used in the Javelin models.|$|E
2500|$|For 1975, {{changes on}} all three {{versions}} were few. The Classic DPL obtained a new grille design with rectangular parking lights alongside new seats and door panels. The luxury steering wheel obtained a new design for the both Classic DPL and the Classic Brougham. Both coupe models obtained new interior door panels with AMC's full-length X-model side armrests; the panels of the sports version also carried an etched [...] "AMX" [...] emblem over the vinyl near the top front corner of the door. The Classic AMX also featured AMC's X-model <b>floor-mounted</b> shifter design. All three versions shared the upgrades of electronic ignition, a vacuum gauge {{in place of the}} electric clock, a [...] I6 with a lower 7.7:1 compression ratio, and Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. The rear differential gear ratio was changed to 3.31:1 for both transmissions.|$|E
