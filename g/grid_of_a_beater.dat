6000|$|The {{instrument}} {{with which}} David {{was prepared to}} carry out my orders was a formidable one. In the days of my youth my family was very fond of [...] "Maryland biscuit," [...] which owes much of its delicacy {{to the fact that}} before baking it is pounded and beaten by <b>a</b> piece <b>of</b> heavy iron. Some people used one kind <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>beater</b> and some another, but we had had made for the purpose a heavy iron club a little over a foot long, large and heavy at one end and a handle at the other. In my present household Maryland biscuits were never made, but I had preserved this iron <b>beater</b> as <b>a</b> memento <b>of</b> my boyhood, and when the burglaries began in our vicinity I gave it to David to keep in his room, {{to be used as a}} weapon if necessary. I did not allow him to have a pistol, having a regard for my own safety in a sudden night alarm, and nothing could be more formidable in a hand-to-hand encounter than this skull-crushing club.|$|R
5000|$|The {{objective}} <b>of</b> using <b>a</b> <b>beater</b> (rather {{than another}} process like grinding, as many wood-pulp mills do) {{is to create}} longer, hydrated, fibrillated fibers. (Fibrillated fibers are abraded {{to the extent that}} many partially broken-off fibers extend from the main fiber, increasing the fiber's surface area, and hence its potential for hydrogen bonding). Grinding of fibers is not desirable. Therefore, the [...] "blades" [...] are not what might be thought of as [...] "sharpened," [...] and well-designed beaters make it possible to minimize the shear action of the rotating blades against the bottom of the water raceway.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{scattering}} of the H-polarized wave by single- and double-layer <b>grids</b> <b>of</b> circular silver nanowires is considered.

Extraordinary resonance enhancement is discovered if {{both kinds of}} resonances are tuned together. Comparison of the light scattering by single and double-layer <b>grids</b> <b>of</b> wires shows better field enhancement for double-layer grids.

25|$|The bludger is a slightly-deflated dodgeball {{that can}} only be {{manipulated}} by beaters. At any given time there are four beaters in play, but only three bludgers. The bludgers are used to hit any other player on the field. Upon being hit by a bludger previously in the possession <b>of</b> <b>an</b> opposing <b>beater,</b> the player suffers the knockout effect. This means they must dismount their broom, drop any ball that they may have been carrying, and touch their team's hoops before resuming play. It's worth noting that there is no friendly fire, meaning that bludgers thrown by beaters cannot affect any of their teammates.|$|R
