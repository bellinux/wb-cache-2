40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{a paucity}} of data {{available}} on the exact prevalence of delta hepatitis among HBsAg positive carriers in Saudi Arabia. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the exact prevalence of <b>delta</b> <b>antibody</b> in HBsAg positive carriers in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and January 1997 the serum of 19, 250 patients was tested for HBsAg. HBsAg positive sera were subsequently tested for <b>delta</b> <b>antibody.</b> In addition, 3147 healthy blood donors underwent HBsAg testing. Those who were HBsAg positive had <b>delta</b> <b>antibody</b> testing using the ELISA method. RESULTS: Among 19, 250 patients, 780 (4. 1 &#x 0025;) were HBsAg positive, of which 67 (8. 6 &#x 0025;) patients were anti-delta positive and 2 (0. 25 &#x 0025;) were anti-delta borderline. Among 3147 healthy donors, 60 (1. 9 &#x 0025;) were HBsAg positive with 2 (3. 3 &#x 0025;) being <b>delta</b> <b>antibody</b> positive. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of <b>delta</b> <b>antibody</b> among hospital- and clinic-based HBsAg positive patients was 8. 6 &#x 0025; and among healthy blood donors who were HBsAg positive, the prevalence was 3. 3 &#x 0025;. Furthermore, <b>delta</b> <b>antibody</b> prevalence was 0. 06 &#x 0025; for "all comers", i. e., healthy blood donors. With decreasing hepatitis B prevalence as a result of universal vaccination, it is expected that delta hepatitis infection among Saudis will decrease with time...|$|E

40|$|A new antigen-antibody system {{associated}} with the hepatitis B virus and immunologically distinct from the HB surface, core, and e systems is reported.

Design. - Our study {{was carried out in}} 215 HBs antigen positive patients, including 176 asymptomatic carriers originated from regions of variable hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemicities, and 39 hepatitis B chronic patients with delta positive serology. <b>Delta</b> antigen, <b>delta</b> <b>antibodies</b> and HBe antigen were investigated for all patients; detection and genotyping of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA and detection of HBV DNA were conducted in the second group patients. Results. - Twelve patients (6. 8 %) out of 176 asymptomatic carriers had HDV positive serology. Delta prevalence was relatively more elevated in regions of high HBV endemicity than on those with moderate or weak endemicity. The mean age of patients was 5 years higher in the delta positive subjects than in the global population. For hepatitis B chronic patients with delta positive serology, HDV RNA was detected in 53. 8 % of cases; HBV-HDV co-replication was observed in 38. 4 % of cases. Genotype I was found for one of the amplified samples. Conclusions. - The results of our study enrich the limited data on HDV prevalence in Tunisia and on the molecular epidemiology of circulating isolates. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The gamma delta T-cell-depleted mice did not show any exaggerated bacterial multiplication compared with control mice.

40|$|An alloanti-delta {{antibody}} {{was prepared}} by immunizing C 57 BL/Ka mice with BALB/c spleen cells. Its specificity for delta-chain was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE of 125 I-labeled membrane proteins from BC 8 spleen cells. BC 8 mice possess C 57 BL/Ka "background" genes and BALB/c IgH genes. The anti-delta reagent without complement inhibited the primary in vitro anti-TNP antibody response to TNP-AECM-Ficoll by BC 8 spleen cells, {{although it had}} no effect of the anti-TNP response of congenic C 57 BL/Ka spleen cells, which lack the delta-allotype identified by this antibody. On the other hand, the anti- <b>delta</b> <b>antibody</b> {{had no effect on}} the anti-TNP response of BC 8 spleen cells to TNP-BA, except at limiting antigen concentrations. Both TNP- AECM-Ficoll and TNP-BA are T-I antigens, but they differ in that TNP- AECM-Ficoll fails to stimulate in vitro responses by immunologically defective CBA/N and neonatal spleen cells whereas TNP-BA can cause responses from both these animals. These results suggest that the IgD receptor is critical to T-I antibody responses initiated by TNP-AECM- Ficoll but that it is not required for T-I responses stimulated by TNP- BA...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the expression significance of PPAR beta/delta {{in relation to}} radiotherapy (RT), clinicopathologic, and prognostic variables of rectal cancer patients. Experimental Design: We included 141 primary rectal cancer patients who participated in a Swedish clinical trial of preoperative RT. Tissue microarray samples from the excised rectal cancers and the adjacent or distant normal mucosa and lymph node metastases were stained with PPAR <b>delta</b> <b>antibody.</b> Survival probability was computed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. The proliferation of colon cancer cell lines KM 12 C, KM 12 SM, and KM 12 L 4 a was assayed after PPAR delta knockdown. Results: PPAR delta was increased from adjacent or distant normal mucosa to primary cancers, whereas it decreased from primary cancers to lymph node metastases. After RT, PPAR delta was increased in normal mucosa, whereas it decreased in primary cancers and lymph node metastases. In primary cancers, the high expression of PPAR delta was {{related to higher frequency}} of stage I cases, lower lymph node metastasis rate, and low expression of Ki- 67 in the unirradiated cases, and related to favorable survival in the cases either with or without RT. The proliferation of the KM 12 C, KM 12 SM, or KM 12 L 4 a cells was significantly accelerated after PPAR delta knockdown. Conclusions: RT decreases the PPAR delta expression in primary rectal cancers and lymph node metastases. PPAR delta is related to the early development of rectal cancer and inhibits the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the host defense mechanism in primary infection with Listeria monocytogenes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice at pre-diabetic stage showing an impaired responsiveness of the alpha beta T cells to T-cell receptor (TCR) triggering. The NOD mice showed a deteriorated resistance at the late stage after an intraperitoneal infection with L. monocytogenes compared with BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice as assessed by bacterial growth in organs.

In vivo administration of anti-TCR gamma <b>delta</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (mAb) allowed L. monocytogenes to grow exaggeratedly in the NOD mice.

40|$|A {{significant}} part of liver disease, once considered the result of infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV), {{are the result of}} infection HBV, and hepatitis delta virus (HDV). HDV is hepatotropic, defective RNA virus that requires obligatory HBV presence for its replication and the formation of infectious particles. About 10 % of patients with chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis infected by HDV. HDV results in coinfection (simultaneous infection of HBV and HDV) and superinfection (HDV infection with chronic hepatitis B). The natural course of the infection is characterized by rapid progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnosis of HDV-infection is based on the detection of <b>delta</b> antigen, <b>antibodies</b> to the virus (anti-HDV IgM and IgG) and RNA HDV in serum. The effectiveness of antiviral therapy proved only on the treatment by interferon (IFN- 2 α and PEG-IFN- 2 α).

40|$|Three {{peptides}} {{corresponding to}} residues 354 - 367, 364 - 374, 373 - 387 of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) delta subunit were synthesized. These peptides represent the proposed phosphorylation {{sites of the}} cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the tyrosine-specific protein kinase and the calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase respectively. Using these peptides as substrates for phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase it was shown that only peptides 354 - 367 was phosphorylated whereas {{the other two were}} not. These results verify the location of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site within the AChR <b>delta</b> subunit. <b>Antibodies</b> elicited against these peptides reacted with the delta subunit. The antipeptide antibodies and two monoclonal antibodies (7 F 2, 5. 46) specific for the delta subunit were tested for their binding to non-phosphorylated receptor and to receptor phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Antibodies to peptide 354 - 367 were found to react preferentially with non-phosphorylated receptor whereas the two other anti-peptide antibodies bound equally to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated receptors.

The purified enzyme was a doublet with molecular masses of 78 and 76 kDa on SDS/PAGE. The doublet proteins were separated partially by Mono Q column chromatography; both were recognized by the antibodies raised against synthetic oligopeptides, parts of the deduced amino acid sequence of the rat delta PKC. Protein phosphatase 2 A treatment suggested that the 78 -kDa protein was a phosphorylated form of the 76 -kDa protein. To confirm the structural and genetic identity of the doublet proteins, delta PKC was expressed in COS 7 cells by transfecting its cDNA-constructed plasmid and was purified for comparison. This recombinant enzyme was also a doublet. The enzymes isolated from the brain and COS 7 cells showed identical reactivities with <b>delta</b> PKC-specific <b>antibodies,</b> chromatographic behaviors, and V 8 protease peptide mappings.

40|$|Abstract Background and purpose: Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) agent, or HDV, is a {{defective}} RNA virus that infects with HBV (Hepatitis B Virus). 15 millions {{people around the}} world are infected to HDV. There are different statistics in Iran and other countries about HDV incidence, according to accomplished studies. This study was done for determining HDV incidence in sari and considering its correlative factors. Materials and methods: This study was done in a descriptive procedure on 167 patients. Correlative factors like demographic data and the ways of receiving disorder, history of tattoo, blood transfusion, were multi partner and IV drug abusers were considered. Diagnosing of blood Anti HDV in patients was by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) way. Results: We couldn’t find any evidences of advantage of HDV in patients. Among 167 HBS-Ag positive subject (63 (% 37. 7) women and 104 (% 62. 3) men) were included. Average age of participants was 35. 52 ± 14. 036. 2 subject had an addiction history (% 1. 7), 15 subject (% 9) had a blood transfusion history, 4 (% 2. 4) were multipart and 1 (% 0. 6) had tattoo history and 2 (% 1. 2) were Prisoners previously.

40|$|Two generic enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were {{developed}} for detection of anti-hepatitis <b>delta</b> virus <b>antibodies</b> (anti-HD) and {{compared with a}} commercially available radioimmunoassay. Both generic assays were configured as blocking assays and used hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) derived from infected chimpanzee liver (EIA- 1) or from Escherichia coli transformed with a plasmid containing an insert from within an open reading frame encoding HDAg (EIA- 2). Absolute sensitivity was ascertained by endpoint titration, which demonstrated essentially identical endpoints for EIA- 1 and EIA- 2. The absolute sensitivities of the EIAs were approximately four times {{greater than that of}} the radioimmunoassay. Specificity and sensitivity were ascertained by testing a panel of 176 serum specimens by each assay. The specimens were selected to represent a panel composed of sera from individuals with or without markers of viral hepatitis as follows: (i) serologically confirmed by exclusion as posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis; (ii) acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection, positive for hepatitis B surface antigen; (iii) resolved hepatitis B virus infection, positive for anti-hepatitis B surface antigen; (iv) acute hepatitis A virus infection, positive for anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M; and (v) normal human sera. All three assays for anti-HD gave similar specificity and sensitivity values. In conclusion, the recombinant expressed HDAg can replace antigen derived from infected liver tissue as a diagnostic reagent used to configure an EIA for detection of anti-HD.

An episode of acute hepatitis was frequently seen in connection with seroconversion to anti-delta. Among the domestic cases of acute, self-limited hepatitis, no simultaneous infections with hepatitis B virus and delta agent were found before 1975.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{clarify the}} {{pathological}} mechanisms of acute cutaneous graft versus host disease (GvHD) following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. METHODS [...] Skin biopsy specimens from five patients were examined by immunoelectron microscopy. A panel of monoclonal antibodies against T cell and {{natural killer cell}} subpopulations was used, including anti-CD 4, -CD 8, -CD 16 b, -CD 56, -CD 57, and -TCR <b>delta</b> 1 <b>antibodies.</b> RESULTS [...] All the specimens contained CD 8 + cells, CD 4 + cells, and CD 56 + cells infiltrating the epidermis. Cells stained with anti-CD 16 b, -CD 57, or -TCR delta 1 were very sparse or absent. Most of the CD 8 + cells in the epidermis displayed morphological features of activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and apposition of such cells to degenerating keratinocytes was shown. CD 4 + cells outnumbered CD 8 + cells in the epidermis in all five cases. Noticeable intercellular as well as intracellular oedema of keratinocytes was observed {{at the site of}} prominent CD 4 + cell infiltration, suggesting that these also have a role as actual effector cells by secreting cytotoxic cytokines. CD 56 + cells infiltrating the epidermis did not exhibit the characteristic ultrastructural morphology of the natural killer cells thus far examined, and their lineage remained uncertain.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we have {{characterized}} the reactivity of two mAbs that are {{directed at the}} human TCR-gamma/delta. These reagents, designated anti-A 13 and anti-TiV delta 2, were found to recognize antigenic determinants encoded by the TCR V delta 1 and V delta 2 gene segments, respectively. Immunofluorescence analyses performed with the antibodies confirmed that, in the TCR-gamma/delta+ cell subpopulation, the expression of V delta 2 + delta chains is largely predominant, {{as compared with the}} V delta 1 + counterparts. However, these experiments led to an apparently discrepant finding. Indeed, the total number of cells recognized by the anti-A 13 plus the anti-TiV <b>delta</b> 2 <b>antibodies</b> was often greater than that detected with anti-TCR-delta 1, a reagent specific for a constant epitope of the human delta chain. Further investigation showed that the presence of a sizeable peripheral lymphocyte subset coexpressing the BMA 031 and the A 13 epitopes. Because the former antibody is known to recognize an invariant antigenic determinant of the TCR-alpha/beta dimer, these results suggested that the V delta 1 gene segment may be expressed with either C delta or C alpha. This hypothesis was confirmed using T 2, an IL- 2 -dependent BMA 031 + A 13 + polyclonal cell line developed from peripheral blood of a healthy adult donor. Indeed, T 2 cells were found to have productively rearranged the V delta 1 gene. Together, results of Northern blot analysis and cDNA cloning indicated that V delta 1 was expressed in these cells as part of a 1. 6 -kb full-length message including J alpha-C alpha segments...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increase}} in number of gamma delta T cells in the peritoneal cavity after intraperitoneal (i. p.) inoculation with Escherichia coli. The E. coli-induced gamma delta T cells in C 3 H/He mice contain a large amount of Thy- 1 -negative population in addition to the Thy- 1 -positive population. We investigated the difference between the Thy- 1 -positive and the Thy- 1 -negative gamma delta T cells. Although it was found that only up to 4 % of the gamma delta T cells on day 5 after infection were in cycling phase, and that the gamma delta T cells did not proliferate by immobilized anti-T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma <b>delta</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> stimulation, the gamma delta T cells proliferated in the presence of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and IL- 7. The Thy- 1 -negative gamma delta T cells showed higher proliferative response compared with the Thy- 1 -positive gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, the Thy- 1 -negative gamma delta T cells showed lower IFN-gamma mRNA expression than the Thy- 1 -positive gamma delta T cells. On the other hand, both the Thy- 1 -positive and Thy- 1 -negative gamma delta T cells predominantly expressed V gamma 1, V gamma 4, V gamma 5, V gamma 6 and V delta 1, and no difference of V region usage was detected between them.

40|$|The role of T-cell {{receptor}} (TCR) gammadelta T {{cells in}} the induction of protective TCR alphabeta T cells against infection by the intracellular bacteria Listeria monocytogenes was analysed. We found that depletion of gammadelta T cells by anti-TCR <b>delta</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> treatment before intravenous immunization of mice with a sublethal dose of viable L. monocytogenes resulted in reduction of protection against secondary challenge infection in the immunized mice. The gammadelta T-cell depletion also reduced induction of protective alphabeta T cells capable of transferring the protection against challenge infection of L. monocytogenes into naive mice. Furthermore, the protective T cells that were affected by the gammadelta T-cell depletion were suggested to be CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells rather than CD 4 + T cells by the following observations. First, induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific to a L. monocytogenes-derived H- 2 Kd-restricted peptide (listeriolysin O 91 - 99) was significantly suppressed by gammadelta T-cell depletion before immunization. Second, gammadelta T-cell depletion did not affect cytokine production and proliferation of T cells from immunized mice in response to in vitro stimulation with heat-killed Listeria which preferentially stimulates CD 4 + T cells. Third, CD 8 + alphabeta T cells from control immunized mice transferred protection against infection of L. monocytogenes into naive mice but only a limited degree of protection was transferred by CD 8 + T cells from the gammadelta T-cell-depleted immunized mice; and fourth, CD 4 + alphabeta T cells from the gammadelta T-cell-depleted mice transferred a similar level of protection as those from the control immunized mice.

Extensive molecular heterogeneity was {{seen at the}} gamma-chain level and, to a lesser extent, at the delta-chain level. Both disulfide and non-disulfide gamma delta TCR were found and use different gamma chains with similar molecular masses (range, 41 - 43 kDa). In contrast, gamma chains of 55 - 60 kDa, which are expressed on T-cell lines derived from the peripheral blood of patients with immunodeficiency disorders, were not found on T-cell clones derived from the peripheral blood of normal donors. delta chains expressed on these T-cell clones had a molecular mass of 37 kDa and were either disulfide or nondisulfide linked. Significant delta-chain heterogeneity was identified in these clones using the anti-delta TCS 1 and the anti-TCR <b>delta</b> 1 monoclonal <b>antibodies.</b> All clones tested were TCR delta 1 +, whereas only 25 % of the clones were delta TCS 1 +.

CD 45 RA-TcR alpha/beta+ IEL expressed CD 45 RO significantly more often (75 %) than the preferentially expanded TcR gamma/delta+ counterpart (59 %). Triple staining for CD 3, CD 4 / 8 and CD 45 RA or CD 45 RB revealed that all CD 3 + 4 - 8 - IEL (taken to be TcR gamma/delta+) expressed CD 45 RB and none were CD 45 RA.

40|$|T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) {{are divided}} into common alpha beta and less common gamma delta types. In the murine skin, TCR gamma delta+ cells have been {{reported}} to form the great majority of epidermal T lymphocytes. We have examined the relative contribution of TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ cells to the T-cell population in normal human skin. Serial sections of freshly frozen skin specimens were acetone fixed, incubated with anti-CD 3, beta F 1 (anti-TCR alpha beta), anti-TCR gamma delta- 1 and anti-TCR delta 1 (anti-TCR gamma <b>delta)</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> (MoAb), and stained with a highly sensitive method. Over 90 % of the T cells of normal human skin are localized around the postcapillary venules of the dermis, while less than 5 % are present within the epidermis. In papillary dermis, TCR gamma delta+ cells formed on average 7 % (anti-TCR gamma delta- 1) or 9 % (anti-TCR delta 1) {{of the total number of}} CD 3 + cells, while TCR alpha beta+ cells constituted up to 80 %. In epidermis, these percentages were 18 % and 29 % for TCR gamma delta+ cells, and up to 60 % for TCR alpha beta+ cells. It is concluded that there is no preferential immigration or in situ expansion of TCR gamma delta+ T cells in normal human skin, because the relative percentages found for the TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ populations in skin are comparable to those found in lymphoid organs and peripheral blood. However, the percentage of TCR gamma delta+ cells in epidermis seemed on average higher than in papillary dermis. Therefore, there may still be a difference in migration patterns of TCR gamma delta+ v TCR alpha beta+ cells, but this does not result in their preferential localization in human epidermis.

To examine the influence of cAMP, cells were treated with 10 µM forskolin and incubated for 6 h before harvesting for measurement of luciferase activity. For DNA–protein binding experiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of nuclear proteins was performed with wild type and mutated oligonucleotides. Results:Forskolin–treatment stimulated luciferase activity driven by a 4 kb reporter construct and all 5 ’–deletion constructs except the smallest, AANAT (– 217 to + 120) luc. Both the basal and forskolin–stimulated expression levels were maximal with AANAT (– 484 to + 120) luc, which contains an 8 x TTATT repeat (TTATT 8) and three CRE–like sequences, designated CLS 1 – 3. Basal expression of AANAT (– 217 to + 120) luc, which does not contain the TTATT 8 sequence, was minimal and unresponsive to forskolin. EMSA demonstrated a number of nuclear protein complexes that bind to the TTATT 8 sequence and CLS 1 – 3. Proteins that bound to the TTATT 8 sequence were displaced by unlabeled TTATT oligonucleotides, and also by an oligonucleotide containing CLS 1, suggesting an interaction between these sites. Mutations of TTATT 8 or CLS 1 reduced protein binding and eliminated forskolin–stimulated promoter activity. Supershift EMSA using c–Fos and <b>delta</b> CREB <b>antibodies</b> identified these factors as probable components of the protein complexes that bind to the TTATT 8 and CLS sites. Conclusions:Transcription driven by this promoter is enhanced by activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade. This appears to be mediated by CLS elements in the promoter acting in concert with the TTATT 8 motif, and that combination mediates the full cAMP–induced transcriptional response of a 484 bp segment of AANAT proximal promoter, in the absence of a consensus CRE...|$|R
40|$|Expression of the CD 3 delta gene of the T-cell {{receptor}} (TCR) {{complex is}} regulated by a T-cell-specific enhancer. A highly conserved 40 -bp motif (element delta A) within the CD 3 delta enhancer {{is responsible for}} mediating its activity and specificity. Element delta A exhibits sequence similarities to the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) but does not respond {{to changes in the}} level of cyclic AMP. Using the delta A element as a probe, we have isolated three cDNA clones encoding three distinct protein isoforms, products of differential splicing and alternate promoter usage of the CRE-BP gene. These isoforms share the DNA binding and dimerization domains at the C terminus of the protein but differ at their N termini. In transfection assays, their activities as transcription regulators differ: CRE-BP 2 is a potent activator, CRE-BP 3 is a weak activator, and CRE-BP 1 is transcriptionally inert. Mutations in the basic region of the CRE-BP 1 protein which abrogate its ability to bind DNA render this protein a dominant repressor of the <b>delta</b> A enhancer. <b>Antibodies</b> to the CRE-BP protein interact specifically with the ubiquitous and predominantly T-cell-restricted nuclear complexes that bind to the delta A element and suggest the presence of this protein in homo- and heterodimeric complexes. Since the delta A motif is also present in the enhancer and promoter of the TCR alpha and beta genes, the CRE-BP isoforms may mediate expression of other members of the CD 3 /TCR complex during T-cell development...|$|R
40|$|In 29 {{patients}} experiencing {{their first}} P. falciparum malarial attack, {{blood levels of}} TcR gamma delta+ lymphocytes were studied from the onset of infection to up to 6 - 9 months later. Blood TcR gamma delta+ lymphocytes, revealed using the TcR <b>delta</b> 1 monoclonal <b>antibody</b> (MoAb), were increased both in absolute and relative numbers. Alterations lasted for up to 3 - 4 months following the attack. A Ti gamma A/BB 3 reactive V gamma 9 subset was preferentially amplified. In vitro, TcR gamma delta+ lymphocytes from both malaria-sensitized and unprimed donors responded to P. falciparum schizont extract (PFSE). PFSE-stimulated polyclonal T cell lines consisted principally in TcR gamma delta+ cells with a Ti gamma A+/BB 3 + phenotype. Several TcR gamma delta+ T cell clones obtained from patients recovering from acute malarial attack were maintained {{in the presence of}} PFSE and autologous irradiated PBL. They belong to the V gamma 9 subset. In long-term cultures, TcR gamma delta+ clones progressively lost their capacity to react to PFSE antigen while they were able to proliferate and to exert cytotoxic activity in response to autologous TcR alpha beta+, PFSE-specific T lymphocyte clones. This suggests that regulatory interactions occur between activated TcR gamma delta+ and TcR alpha beta+ cells generated by P. falciparum. Sequential variations in blood TcR gamma delta+ and TcR alpha beta+ lymphocyte levels after primary exposure to P. falciparum suggest that such regulatory interactions may occur in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Although gamma delta T cell receptor-bearing {{lymphocytes}} (gamma delta T cells) {{constitute a}} significant minority of circulating and tissue-associated T lymphocytes, the mechanism {{responsible for the}} activation of these cells is unknown. To address this question, resting gamma delta TCR+, CD 3 +, CD 4 -, CD 8 - cells isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were cultured with allogeneic dendritic cells (DC) or monocytes, and their proliferative response measured. DC alone induced gamma delta T cells to proliferate, with a peak response on the sixth day of culture. Pretreatment of DC with an anti-HLA-DR mAb, but not anti-HLA class I or anti-CD 1 mAbs, inhibited the response of gamma <b>delta</b> T cells. <b>Antibodies</b> to gamma <b>delta</b> T cell receptor, CD 2, CD 3, or CD 11 a were also inhibitory, whereas antibodies to alpha beta T cell receptor, CD 4, CD 5, and CD 8 had no effect. Although only 40 - 60 % of freshly isolated gamma delta T cells expressed CD 28, mAbs directed against CD 28 or its ligand, CD 80, were markedly inhibitory. Moreover, removal of CD 28 + cells from the gamma delta T cell population nearly abrogated the response to DC. These results demonstrate that resting gamma delta T cells recognize and respond to MHC class II determinants on allogeneic DC {{in a manner that}} is highly dependent on the CD 28 activation pathway as well as molecules such as CD 2 and CD 11 a that mediate cell-to-cell adhesion...|$|R
40|$|A variant form of {{the human}} {{oestrogen}} receptor (ER) mRNA lacking sequences encoded within exon 5 has been described (Fuqua SAW, Fitzgerald SD, Chamness GC, Tandon AK, McDonnell DP, Nawaz Z, O'Malloy BW, McGuire WL 1991, Cancer Res 51 : 105 - 109). We have examined {{the expression of the}} exon 5 -deleted ER (HE delta 5) mRNA variant in breast biopsies using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT - PCR). HE delta 5 mRNA was present in only 13 % of non-malignant breast tissues compared with 32 % of carcinomas (95 % CI, P= 0. 05). Presence of the HE delta 5 mRNA was associated with the presence of immunohistochemically detected ER (P= 0. 015) and progesterone receptor (PR) (P= 0. 02). There was a positive correlation between the presence of HE delta 5 and disease-free survival (P= 0. 05), suggesting that the presence of HE delta 5 may be an indicator of better prognosis. We have raised a monoclonal antibody specific to the C-terminal amino acids of HE <b>delta</b> 5. This <b>antibody</b> recognized the variant but not the wild-type ER protein. We show that HE delta 5 protein is present in breast cancer using immunohistochemical techniques. We also analysed trans-activation by HE delta 5 in mammalian cells and showed that, in MCF- 7 cells, HE delta 5 competes with wild-type ER to inhibit ERE-dependent trans-activation. Our results indicate that this variant is unlikely to be responsible for endocrine resistance of breast cancer, but its presence at both the mRNA and protein level suggest that it may, nevertheless, be involved in regulating the expression of oestrogen-responsive genes in breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|The {{enumeration}} {{of total}} T cells, an important {{function of the}} clinical immunology laboratory, utilizes antibodies to CD 3, the macromolecular complex associated with the antigen-specific receptors of T cells. We compared the ability of some commonly employed commercial anti-CD 3 reagents to stain human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Surprisingly, the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate of Coulter clone T 3 (FITC-T 3) stained most T cells brightly, but selectively stained gamma delta T cells very dimly {{or not at all}}. In contrast, the other anti-CD 3 reagents studied (FITC-Leu 4, PE-T 3, PE-Leu 4, and indirectly labelled T 3 and Leu 4) stained all T cells equivalently. Dual-colour flow cytometric analysis with FITC-T 3 and PE-Leu 4 readily demonstrated a FITC-T 3 -/PE-Leu 4 + population of T cells. This unique population stained dimly or not at all with a combination of anti-CD 4 and anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibodies and positively with the pan-gamma <b>delta</b> T cell <b>antibody</b> TCR <b>delta</b> 1. Moreover, an excellent correlation was found between the number of FITC-T 3 -/PE-Leu 4 + cells and the number of TCR delta 1 + cells in 32 normal individuals. Thus, the FITC-T 3 -/PE-Leu 4 + phenotype accurately marks all gamma delta T cells. In contrast to FITC-T 3, both PE-conjugated and unconjugated T 3 stained gamma delta T cells brightly. Therefore, T 3 binds to an epitope present on all T cells, but fluoresceinylation specifically attenuates this antibody's ability to bind to gamma delta T cells. These findings indicate that the use of FITC-T 3 can result in a significant and variable underestimation of peripheral blood T cell number and demonstrate further that the CD 3 complexes of human alpha beta and gamma delta T cells are significantly different...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} how antibodies against anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents influence response after switching from infliximab to adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: This cohort {{study consisted of}} 235 patients with RA, all treated with adalimumab. At baseline 52 patients (22 %) had been previously treated with infliximab ('switchers'), and 183 (78 %) were anti-TNF naive. Disease activity (using the 28 -joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS 28)) and presence of antibodies against infliximab and adalimumab were assessed. Clinical response to adalimumab was compared between switchers and anti-TNF naive patients and their anti-infliximab and anti-adalimumab antibody status. RESULTS: After 28 weeks of adalimumab treatment the decrease in DAS 28 (Delta DAS 28) for the 235 patients was 1. 6 +/- 1. 5 (mean+/-SD). Anti-adalimumab antibodies were detected in 46 patients (20 %). Delta DAS 28 was 1. 8 +/- 1. 4 in patients without anti-adalimumab and 0. 6 +/- 1. 3 in patients with anti-adalimumab (p < 0. 0001). Thirty-three of the 52 switchers (63 %) had anti-infliximab antibodies. Patients with anti-infliximab more often developed anti-adalimumab than anti-TNF naive patients (11 (33 %) vs 32 (18 %); p= 0. 039). Delta DAS 28 was greater for anti-TNF naive patients (1. 7 +/- 1. 5) than for switchers without anti-infliximab <b>antibodies</b> (<b>Delta</b> DAS 28 = 0. 9 +/- 1. 4) (p= 0. 009). Delta DAS 28 for switchers with anti-infliximab was 1. 2 +/- 1. 3 and {{did not differ significantly}} from anti-TNF naive patients (p= 0. 262). CONCLUSION: Switchers with anti-infliximab antibodies more often develop antibodies against adalimumab than anti-TNF naive patients. Response to adalimumab was limited in switchers without anti-infliximab antibodies, which raises the question whether a second anti-TNF treatment should be offered to patients with RA for whom an initial treatment with an anti-TNF blocker fails, in the absence of anti-biological antibodie...|$|R
40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{population of}} gamma delta T cell receptor (TCR) -bearing cells was characterized {{with regard to}} V delta and V gamma subtype expression. For this purpose, we utilized V gene-specific PCR of mRNA prepared from intestinal biopsies. Predominant expression of the V delta 1 subtype was demonstrated in the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease and in the inflamed colon of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) {{as well as in}} colon biopsies taken from macroscopically normal areas of colon. Although intestinal gamma delta T cells preferentially expressed V delta 1, other V delta transcripts could be detected, of which V delta 2 and V delta 5 were commonly expressed. Analysis of biopsies from mesenteric lymph nodes demonstrated a V delta repertoire similar to the mucosa. In peripheral blood on the other hand, high expression of both V delta 2 and V delta 1 was found. The predominant expression of V delta 1 transcripts in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients correlated well with protein cell surface expression as analysed by flow cytometry using V delta 1 - and V <b>delta</b> 2 -specific <b>antibodies.</b> Selective expansion of gamma delta T cells could not be demonstrated within the inflamed mucosa as shown by mRNA analysis and flow cytometry. Instead, IBD patients demonstrated a decreased proportion of TCR gamma delta-carrying T cells in the inflamed mucosa compared with macroscopically normal area of colon. On the other hand, a significantly increased percentage of T cells bearing the gamma delta TCR was found in peripheral blood of patients with Crohn's disease compared with healthy individuals, indicating that local mucosal inflammation may influence the circulating gamma delta T cell population...|$|R
40|$|The {{key to the}} {{discovery}} of the Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) was the description in Turin, Italy in the mid- 1970 s of the <b>delta</b> antigen and <b>antibody</b> in carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen. The new antigen was first thought to be a marker of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and in view of its intricate true nature, it would have possibly died away as another odd antigenic subtype of HBV, like many that were described in the 1970 s. Fortunately, instead, a collaboration started in 1978 between the Turin group, and the National Institute of Health and Georgetown University in the US. With American facilities and expertise this collaboration led just a year later, in 1979, to the unfolding of an unexpected and amazing chapter in virology. Experiments in chimpanzees demonstrated that the delta antigen was not a component of the HBV but of a separate defective virus requiring HBV for its infection; it was named the hepatitis D virus to conform to the nomenclature of hepatitis viruses and classified within the genus Deltavirus. The animal experiments were also seminal in proposing to future clinical interpretation, the paradigm of a pathogenic infection (hepatitis D), that could develop only in HBV-infected patients, was mainly transmitted by superinfection of HDV on chronic HBV carriers and had the ability to strongly inhibit the helper HBV. The discovery of the HDV has driven three directions of further research:(1) The understanding of the replicative and infectious mechanisms of the HDV. (2) The assessment of its epidemiological and medical impact. (3) The search for a therapy for chronic hepatitis D (CHD). This review summarizes the progress achieved in each field of research in the thirty years that have passed since {{the discovery}} of HDV...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Liver {{fibrosis}} {{is often}} {{the first stage of}} liver disease in people living with HIV (PLWHIV) in industrialized countries. However, little is known about liver fibrosis and its correlates among PLWHIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: The study was undertaken in three HIV referral clinics in Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal and Togo. Enrolled PLWHIV underwent a non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis combining liver stiffness measure (LSM) with transient elastography and the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI). Significant liver fibrosis was defined as LSM ≥ 7. 1 kPa. Patients were screened for alcohol use (alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT) -C questionnaire), hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen, hepatitis <b>Delta</b> virus (HDV) <b>antibody</b> and anti-hepatitis C (HCV) antibody. A logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with significant liver fibrosis. Results: A total of 807 PLWHIV were screened at a median age of 43  years (interquartile range (IQR) : 36 – 50). Their median CD 4 count was 393 cells/mm 3 (IQR: 234 – 563) and 682 (84. 5 %) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The prevalence of significant fibrosis was 5. 3 % (3. 8 – 6. 7). Infections with HBV and HCV were identified in 74 (9. 2 %) and nine (1. 1 %) participants. Main factors associated with liver fibrosis were alcohol use (AUDIT-C > 6) : (odds ratio (OR)  =  4. 0, confidence interval (CI) : 1. 2 – 14. 0), (Ref. AUDIT-C < 4) and HBV infection (OR =  2. 9, CI: 1. 2 – 7. 2). Of the 74 patients positively screened for HBV, 50. 0 % were on a tenofovir-based ART regimen. Overall, 10 % of HIV/HBV coinfected patients were detected with a positive HDV antibody with a higher prevalence in patients with a significant liver fibrosis (43. 0 %) compared to others (6. 3 %) (p =  0. 01). Conclusions: Considering the WHO recommendations to screen for HBV infection and treat co-infected patients with tenofovir-based ART, screening of alcohol use and brief interventions to prevent alcohol abuse should be implemented in West Africa, especially in HBV/HIV co-infected patients...|$|R
40|$|Recombinative {{events of}} the T cell antigen {{receptor}} (TCR) delta-chain gene were studied in 37 cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) and related to their clinical presentation and {{the expression of the}} alpha beta or gamma delta heterodimers as determined by immunostaining of frozen tissue samples. There were 22 cases of alpha beta, 5 cases of gamma delta, and 10 cases of silent TCR expressing neither the alpha beta nor gamma delta TCR. 5 different probes were used to examine the delta locus. The 22 cases of alpha beta PTCL displayed biallelic and monoallelic deletions; a monoallelic V delta 1 J delta 1 rearrangement was observed in 1 case and a monoallelic germ line configuration in 7 cases. The 5 cases of gamma delta PTCL displayed biallelic rearrangements: the productive rearrangements could be ascribed to V delta 1 J delta 1 joining in 3 cases and VJ delta 1 joining in 2 cases according to the combined pattern of DNA hybridization with the appropriate probes and of cell reactivity with the TCR delta- 1, delta TCS- 1, and anti-V <b>delta</b> 2 monoclonal <b>antibodies.</b> In the VJ delta 1 joining, the rearranged V segments were located between V delta 1 and V delta 2. Interestingly, in the third group of 10 cases of silent PTCL, 5 cases were found to have a TCR gene configuration identical to that in the TCR alpha beta PTCL, as demonstrated by biallelic delta gene deletion. These 5 cases were CD 3 positive. The 5 remaining cases showed a monoallelic delta gene rearrangement with a monoallelic germ line configuration in 4 and a monoallelic deletion in 1. Four of these cases were CD 3 negative, which was consistent with an immature genotype the TCR commitent of which could not be ascertained. Finally, TCR gamma delta PTCL consisted of a distinct clinical morphological and molecular entity whereas TCR alpha beta and silent PTCL had a similar presentation...|$|R
