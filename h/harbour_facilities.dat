5|$|Before a {{decision}} was made to establish a harbour (now the second largest in Denmark) at Esbjerg in 1868, the area consisted of only a few farms. Esbjerg developed quickly with the population rising to 13,000 by 1901 and 70,000 by 1970. In addition to its fishing and shipping activities, it also became an important centre for agricultural exports. Over the years, many of the city's visitors have arrived by ferry from Harwich, Essex, England, but this service closed in September 2014 having run since 1875. The <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> are being expanded to answer the needs of the wind-turbine industry and container shipping traffic. Esbjerg is served by Esbjerg Airport with flights to Aberdeen, Scotland and Stavanger, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Greyfriars, in Bristol, England, was a Franciscan friary. The name Greyfriars {{derived from}} the grey robes worn by the friars. It was founded at some time before 1234, within the town walls and then moved to Lewin's Mead in 1250. The site {{included}} extensive gardens surrounded by a stone wall. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the sixteenth century, the premises were leased to the town council in 1541, who desired to use the stone to make repairs to the town walls, and the <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities.</b> In succeeding centuries many different uses have {{been made of the}} site, which is currently occupied by an office block and part of Bristol Dental School.|$|E
5|$|After Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814, Aalborg {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as the}} country's centre for Norwegian trade. Its former prosperity also suffered {{as a result of}} difficulties with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange (which had linked Thy with the rest of Jutland at the western end of Limfjord) in the 1825 North Sea storm. The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city. In the mid-19th-century, Aalborg was overtaken by Aarhus as the largest city in Jutland. Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an upturn. In 1865, the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed, and in 1869, the railway reached the city with a railway bridge over the sound to Vendsyssel three years later. The <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> were also improved, making Aalborg Denmark's second port. Aalborg became the country's main producer of tobacco products and spirits, followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement. By 1901, the population had increased to almost 31,500.|$|E
50|$|Charles Nevill came to Llanelly and in 1804 {{established}} a copper works with an associated <b>harbour</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|R

5|$|From the 1840s, {{the city}} enjoyed {{a period of}} rapid {{expansion}} beyond its traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed {{into one of the}} most important industries while the <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> were further expanded. In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense. Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across Funen in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions. All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and food and beverages. Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion, and the population of the city began to grow markedly; by 1900 it had 35,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration encouraged Japanese {{businessmen and}} settlers to the expand phosphate mining and copra production, which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era. During this time, new infrastructure was built between towns—including road and <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities,</b> and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out. Immigration from Japan, Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified {{as a result}} of new job opportunities. A state-owned enterprise, Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Colonization Corporation) was formed in 1936 to streamline the islands' economic activities with the administration objective of developing the islands' self-sufficiency capabilities. In the late 1930s, Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea, and stopped by Palau from October to April. The influx of pearl divers from Japan {{led to the development of}} the island's tourist industry, and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés, geisha houses and liquor houses in Koror to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April.|$|E
25|$|Alderney, {{which was}} lacking in <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> {{found in the}} 1840s {{that it would be}} given a harbour large enough for the whole of the Royal Navy. It was partly {{constructed}} by the 1860s before being abandoned. It was rarely used by commercial ships as it was exposed to the North East.|$|E
50|$|Manly Boat Harbour is now {{the largest}} boat <b>harbour</b> <b>facility</b> in the Southern Hemisphere, with over 3,000 dry standings and wet berths, plus two public boat ramps (one {{at each end of}} the harbour).|$|R
50|$|The Harbour Board {{decided to}} build and island <b>harbour</b> <b>facility</b> that could handle the then latest bulk meat loading methods. This new island {{construction}} was begun in 1955. The island would have a substantial rail network built on it.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the community's fishing fleet is berthed at the South River <b>Harbour</b> <b>facility</b> which is operated by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Other wharves include the Murray Harbour wharf, Machon Point wharf, and Beach Point wharf, {{as well as the}} Bowridge Landing Marina.|$|R
25|$|During {{the rest}} of the 1800s <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> {{expanded}} and the town grew. It gained an impressive range of commercial and institutional buildings. Many have survived, resulting in Port Adelaide having one of the best concentrations of colonial buildings in South Australia. Their significance was recognised in May 1982, when a sizeable part of the town centre was declared a State Heritage Area.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{establishment}} of the <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> in Commercial Bay and Official Bay suffered from the tidal mudflats that made establishing good wharves difficult. After control of the Waitematā Harbour passed to the Auckland Provincial Council in 1853, the Council did much work on improving the facilities, which included constructing the first Queen Street Wharf, building a quay along Customs Street and a breakwater at Point Britomart.|$|E
25|$|Ports of Auckland Limited (POAL), the {{successor}} to the Auckland Harbour Board, is the Auckland Council-owned company administering Auckland's commercial freight and cruise ship <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities.</b> As the company operates all of the associated facilities in the Greater Auckland area (excluding the ferry terminals and local marinas for recreational yachting), this article is about both the current company and the ports of Auckland themselves.|$|E
50|$|It was the Forth and Clyde Canal {{which took}} the {{initiative}} to build a railway branch line into its <b>harbour</b> <b>facility</b> at Grangemouth. It built a single line from just east of Grahamston station to the harbour; the line opened in 1860 for goods, and for passengers on 1 November 1861. It was worked by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway.|$|R
50|$|The Greenock Harbour Trust {{had been}} {{continuing}} {{improvement of the}} harbour, providing alongside berthing for quick turnrounds, and with more capacity. In 1875, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, landed at the pier and the opportunity was taken to rename the <b>harbour</b> <b>facility</b> Prince's Pier. The station itself was renamed at the same time. In 1894 the station was relocated {{a little to the}} north-west, closer to the steamer berths, and providing more lavish facilities, and with six italianate towers.|$|R
50|$|Production {{began in}} July 2014, {{reported}} in November 2014. Vale's nickel processing plant in Long Harbour received its first major shipment from its Labrador mine in Voisey's Bay in May 2015. As of that date, {{a small proportion}} of the plant's raw materials came from Voisey's Bay but the majority were imported from Indonesia. A spokesman for Vale said 100 per cent of the Long <b>Harbour</b> <b>facility's</b> production materials will come from Voisey's Bay by early 2016.|$|R
25|$|The remote islands were {{considered}} to be a suitable place to punish the independence activists. Not only were they isolated from the mainland, the overseas journey (Kala Pani) to the islands also threatened them with loss of caste, resulting in social exclusion. The convicts could also be used in chain gangs to construct prisons, buildings and <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities.</b> Many died in this enterprise. They served to colonise the island for the British.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} Dover and its <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> was {{expected}} to add another 800 tons per day, raising to 40% the amount of supplies brought in through ports. However, this rested on the rather unrealistic assumption of little or no interference from the Royal Navy and RAF with the German supply convoys {{which would have been}} made up of underpowered (or unpowered, i.e. towed) inland waterways vessels as they shuttled slowly between the Continent to the invasion beaches and any captured harbours.|$|E
25|$|In 1835 {{the total}} number of {{passengers}} using Newhaven harbour and the Chain Pier was estimated at 400,000 per year, but the number of ferries using the pier began to decline as Leith and Newhaven improved their <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities.</b> In 1834 there had been rival plans to build a large new harbour, either at Trinity or Granton. The latter was chosen and in 1838 {{the first phase of the}} Duke of Buccleuch's new harbour opened at Granton, causing Chain Pier traffic to fall even further.|$|E

25|$|The {{coastline}} of Norfolk Island consists, {{to varying}} degrees, of cliff faces. A downward slope exists towards Slaughter Bay and Emily Bay, {{the site of}} the original colonial settlement of Kingston. There are no safe <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> on Norfolk Island, with loading jetties existing at Kingston and Cascade Bay. All goods not domestically produced are brought in by ship, usually to Cascade Bay. Emily Bay, protected from the Pacific Ocean by a small coral reef, is the only safe area for recreational swimming, although surfing waves can be found at Anson and Ball Bays.|$|E
25|$|In effect, La Rochelle was {{surrounded}} efficiently enough, and suffered {{enough from the}} siege, with <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> being damaged by Allied air attacks, that the Germans were unable to launch major U-Boat attacks on Allied shipping {{for the duration of}} the siege. However, every week a Luftwaffe plane was able to break through the blockade and supply the garrison. In order to raise the morale of German troops in La Rochelle, the propaganda movie Kolberg, celebrating resistance against the French in 1806, was sent in by Göring and premiered simultaneously in Berlin and La Rochelle on 30 January 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Midland Railway had {{invested}} heavily in new <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities</b> at Heysham and was anxious that its influence in Ulster would not end at Donegall Quay in Belfast. To extend its activity in Ireland it decided to purchase an interest in a large Irish railway. The BNCR was an efficient, prosperous company and well suited the Midland's purposes; it connected the two largest cities {{in the north of}} Ireland and had direct links to County Donegal. The Midland made a very tempting offer which the BNCR's directors advised the shareholders to accept. This was also agreed by the Midland's shareholders.|$|E
50|$|Later {{in the war}} it {{was decided}} that an {{emergency}} west coast port should be established, to continue transatlantic trade in the event that Glasgow or Liverpool docks were disabled by enemy action. A new <b>harbour</b> <b>facility</b> was developed on Loch Ryan, called Cairnryan Harbour, and it was served by the Cairnryan Military Railway. This was a considerable undertaking. The new railway joined the Stranraer to Challoch line at Cairnryan Junction, about two miles (about 1 km) east of Stranraer, facing for trains approaching from the east. The point of junction was later moved closer to Stranraer, at Aird.|$|R
50|$|Sydney's {{economy was}} {{buoyed by the}} 2011 {{announcement}} of funding for the Sydney Harbour dredging project, which was completed in 2012. The dredge, {{which is expected to}} lead to commercialization of the port, is purported to create hundreds of jobs in the area, and position Sydney as a world-class <b>harbour</b> <b>facility.</b> Other important investments that have helped position Sydney as an eastern hub of Nova Scotia include the twinning of Highway 125 and the creation of the Centre for Sustainability in the Environment at nearby Cape Breton University, which draws hundreds of international students each year.|$|R

25|$|Throughout the 19th century, Malta {{benefited from}} {{increased}} defence spending by Britain, {{particularly from the}} development of the dockyards and the <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities.</b> The Crimean War and the opening of the Suez Canal further enhanced Malta's importance as a supply station and as a naval base. Prosperity brought with it a dramatic rise in the population, from 114,000 in 1842, to 124,000 in 1851, 140,000 in 1870, and double that amount by 1914. Malta became increasingly urbanized, with {{the majority of the population}} inhabiting the Valletta and the Three Cities. Malta's fortunes waned during times of peace in the early 20th century, and again after World War II, leading to massive waves of emigration.|$|E
25|$|The {{stages of}} the air {{campaign}} were managed into three; attacking Soviet reserves beyond German artillery; raids against <b>harbour</b> <b>facilities,</b> airfields, fortresses and shipping; cooperating with German artillery to cancel out Soviet mortar and gun batteries. Richthofen acknowledged {{that not all of}} these components could be conducted simultaneously. He chose shattering the fortifications through relentless air bombardment as most important. To do this, Richthofen garnered most of the air units into supporting the land operations. His view of anti-shipping operations, and von Wild’s conduct of them, was scathing. However, he did {{not take into account the}} systemic technical problems with German U-Boat and aerial torpedoes which were unreliable, and blamed von Wild and the air units instead for failing to achieve much success.|$|E
