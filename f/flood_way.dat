FIRMs are used to set rates of insurance against risk of flood and whether buildings are insurable at all against flood. It is similar to a topographic map, but is designed to show floodplains. Towns and municipalities use FIRMs to plan zoning areas. Most places will not allow construction in a <b>flood</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

No lives were lost, but property damages were severe and estimated to have exceeded the million-dollar mark.|$|E
50|$|An {{elaborate}} {{system of}} <b>flood</b> <b>way</b> defenses {{can be found}} in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The Red River flows northward from the United States, passing through the city of Winnipeg (where it meets the Assiniboine River) and into Lake Winnipeg. As is the case with all north-flowing rivers in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, snow melt in southern sections may cause river levels to rise before northern sections have had a chance to completely thaw. This can lead to devastating flooding, as occurred in Winnipeg during the spring of 1950. To protect the city from future floods, the Manitoba government undertook the construction of a massive system of diversions, dikes, and flood ways (including the Red River Floodway and the Portage Diversion). The system kept Winnipeg safe during the 1997 flood which devastated many communities upriver from Winnipeg, including Grand Forks, North Dakota and Ste. Agathe, Manitoba.|$|E

The access road from I-10, exit 127 south, has been barricaded and thus the only direction of travel is north. The route is a poorly maintained gravel road that, as most roads of this type, is very dusty during the dry season. Starting in Iberia Parish, LA 975 crosses into St. Martin Parish, then Pointe Coupee Parish before intersecting with US 190. The road travels north through the swampy bottomland of the Atchafalaya Basin, {{that is part of}} the Morganza <b>Flood</b> <b>way</b> system, and prone to severe flooding with high water. LA 975 passes Bobtail Bayou, intersects with Bayou Manuel Road, which is at the split of the Atchafalaya River and the beginning of the Whiskey Bay Pilot Channel, then passes the base of Big Alabama Bayou, intersecting with River Road. Continuing north, LA 975 begins to run between the Atchafalaya River, Little Alabama Bayou, and intersects with Happytown Road.

5000|$|Silex had {{its start}} in the 1880s when the {{railroad}} known as the Northern Hannibal Railway, was extended to the town {{for the purposes of}} transportation. A post office called Silex has been in operation since 1882. The community was named after the main cash crop production of silicon sand. The Silex original township was located approximately a quarter mile north of the current old town portion now. The original town was located next to the Hannibal Railroad and much of the towns habitats that lived in the town also worked in the silicon mine. As many settlers and farmers moved to the area for work and settling, the town started to grow. The town relocated to the now called old town portion of Silex due to space issues. The town had shut down the production of silicon sand due to imperfections in the sand and most of the settlers stayed and began to farm. The town became a center point for shopping, trade, social events and festivals that brought many from afar. With the town rich history of farming and mining some of the rich history is standing today. I would call them historic but not listed as a building that is still standing on MO Hwy E also known as Main Street has the engraved carving of 1908 when the building had been built. Also to be noted is Duncan Mansion located on top on the bluff looking over the City. There are few buildings standing in the old town portion of Silex due to flooding. The town has sustained several floods that devastated the town's people due to flash flooding. The Town is surrounded by local waterways, creeks and a river. In 2008 the town flooded and displaced most of the residents. This had a major impact on the small town forcing it {{to come up with an}} options. With the County as a whole facing financial difficulty's in revenues and the town also due to losing business' from the flood, the trustees decided to move the residents out of <b>flood</b> <b>way</b> and plain. After the town applied for a relocation grant from USDA it was granted partial funding for the move in sections. First and foremost moving the residents out to a safe location. Some accomplished this by agreeing to build a new home at a special rate and given grant funds to do so and some residents took a portion of the grant funding and simply picked their house up and moved it up on the hill and the City's new location Stephens bluff addition. With the move of a whole town there were many complications in the process and that are ongoing. One is removing the old households many of which had contaminated pipes because of the age of the home and re-engineers City utility services. With the move of the town to its new location has taken the people out of harms way. But with the difficult time of the economy the town still has an open project to this date on the original plans and struggles to meet, Department of Natural Resource requirements because of the relocation project. The town had applied for infrastructure grants and received one in late 2008 for a sewer project. That came at a price of issuing bonds to pay for the project which was another out of pocket expense for residents. This is still an ongoing project to this date with the finalization of the project to completed in December 2015. Before the project was finalized in 2015 the town was hit with another flood in the spring of 2015. With a small work force City employees' scrambled and only one boil order was issued and City services continued which was an amazing to accomplish. Many residents were stunned that they had lost water in the new town portion, but during the storm that had dropped 7 inches of rain on the City and points north the new water tower was struck by lightning and disabled the pump. With all of the towns sewer lift stations underwater and the towns sewer treatment plant under this was a major task and test for the City. The worker's and even the town Chief of Police jumped into action. Several people who lived just outside of town had to be rescued by boat from the second story windows of their home. [...] "This was the fastest I have ever seen it come up and I've lived here all my life" [...] said local resident Johnny Thompson. The 2015 flood has been the highest on record flood event for the town. Reminiscence of this is painted on the rear wall of Bargeoloa Hardware and lumber. The town has recently annexed a portion of Mo Hwy E towards Hwy 40/61 to Mo RA and plans to grow the town while keeping a small town feel. The City's Administrator and Chief of Police William Barnes II gave the town its first City logo and slogan in early 2016. The City of Silex's slogan is [...] "A rural City Moving Forward" [...] and just that is what they are doing.|$|E
40|$|East <b>Flood</b> <b>Way</b> {{is one of}} {{the rivers}} in Semarang City that often cause flooding. Flood water level in the East <b>Flood</b> <b>Way</b> is {{affected}} by the discharge of storm water runoff and tide (rob). Facts on the ground indicate that the flood water level in the canal tends to increase from year to year. One possible reason is the increased flood discharge associated with climate change, besides the impacts of land use changes. This study aims to analyze the impacts of climate change on rainfall characteristics and their effects on flood hydrograph in the East <b>Flood</b> <b>Way.</b> The study begins with the collection and analysis of historical rainfall data to get a change of rainfall characteristics over time. The flood hydrograph was then analysed by HEC HMS. The results showed that in the period of last 30 years annual rainfall and maximum daily rainfall tended to increase of 22. 64 mm / year and 2. 56 mm / year consecutively, while the number of rainy days tend to decrease of 4 days / year. As a result of changes in the characteristics of the rainfall, the flood discharge of East <b>Flood</b> <b>Way</b> is expected to increase in the range between the 15. 10 m 3 /s (31. 5 %) for 2 -year return period up to 32. 28 m 3 /s (25. 5 %) for 200 -year return period...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{estuaries}} in Lingding bay are {{not only}} the main <b>flood</b> <b>way</b> for the Pearl river, but also the main tide way for south sea. The navigation in LingDing bay is very important. The variation of the hydrodynamic environment is the direct reason {{for the evolution of}} Lingding bay and the evolution is correlative to the discharging capacity of the estuaries, the flood control, drainage, and so on. In recent years, the shallow areas have become bigger and bigger, and the channels deeper and deeper. The hydrodynamic condition has changed because of the reclaimed project, the optional dredging, the constructions of the docks and the bridges, and so on. These changes are disadvantageous to the capacity of absorbing tidal and its transportation in Lingding bay. According to the observed data, the changes of the hydrodynamic condition of the Lingding bay have been studied in this paper. The improvement measures for Lingding bay are put forward to keeping up its dynamic condition and reducing sedimentation by regulating river way...|$|E

(2) RSBLQ does not neglect the FIB function and avoids to apply a widely used <b>flooding</b> <b>way</b> in VANET but makes full use of FIB to guide the Interest forwarding process, which reduces the useless network traffic and lowers the probability of packet collision. (3) What is more, in order to make the routing paths in RSBLQ more stable and reduce broken link, we also introduce LET and link available probability as metrics for a FIB selecting process, getting more reliable FIB outgoing faces for Interest and ensuring the successful return of Data packet as much as possible.|$|R

Although the first question may be how to prevent power failure, the nuances of backup and redundant power generation are not generally within the expertise of health professionals.

To explore the new way to improve oil recovery, the polymer and surfactant (SP for short) important pilot test has been developed. The low permeability reservoir indoor core data in high water cut stage and inspection well results indicate that the reservoir permeability, pore combination characteristics and pore type changed greatly after long-term water flooding development.
