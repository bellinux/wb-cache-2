50|$|The T-X was {{designed}} in Stan Winston studios, {{where it was}} considered particularly challenging to design, as the script required a character capable of holding its own against the original Terminator. Originally, the T-X's endoskeleton was meant to convey an androgynous shape which would permit the android to assume the superficial traits of both men and women, though later designs veered on it being more feminine. The final, approved T-X design was done by Aaron Sims, who designed it entirely on computer through a mixture of Photoshop and 3D software. The T-X endoskeleton was painted chrome black, in order to differentiate it from the silver sheen of the T-850 endoskeleton. The T-X was also fitted with blue running lights, rather than the original's red. John Rosengrant later stated that the individual parts of the T-X endoskeleton were <b>hard</b> <b>coated,</b> sanded and polished through machines, resulting in a mathematically perfect model, unlike the endoskeleton in The Terminator, which was sculpted by hand and lacked symmetry.|$|E

Firstly, the theoretical model of TCS with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> is established to calculate its natural frequencies and modal shapes {{so as to}} roughly understand vibration characteristic of TCS when it is <b>coated</b> with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> material. Then, by considering its nonlinear stiffness and damping influences, an experiment system is established to accurately measure vibration parameters of the shell, and the corresponding test methods and identification techniques are also proposed. Finally, {{based on the measured}} data, the influences on natural frequencies, modal shapes, damping ratios, and vibration responses of TCS with <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> are analyzed and discussed in detail. It can be found that <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> can {{play an important role in}} vibration reduction of TCS, and for the most modes of TCS, <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> will result in the decrease of natural frequencies, but the decreased level is not very big, and its damping effects on the higher frequency range of the shell are weak and ineffective.

In this study, a hard-coating cantilever thin plate under base excitation was taken as the research object, and an inverse method was developed to identify these mechanical parameters. Firstly, the principles of identifying storage modulus and loss factor of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> were presented according to the inverse method. Then, from the need of parameters identification, the analytical model and calculation formula of equivalent strain for the hard-coating composite plate were derived.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and repeatability of exact constraint devices {{rely on the}} geometric stability of their Hertzian contacts. These contacts act as structural and aligning interfaces, therefore they must bear large loads and maintain stable alignment through repeated engage-disengage cycles. Under these circumstances, the geometry of the contacting elements is prone to change due to wear. When this occurs, the {{accuracy and}} repeatability of the alignment interfaces they form degrades. The minimization of wear is therefore of prime importance to the continued advancement of precision alignment devices. This may be accomplished by placing hard coatings on the surface f the contacting elements. In precision applications, the loading of the contacts between these elements results in a ratio of coating thickness to Hertzian contact radius, t’, less than 0. 1. Stresses within hard coatings for ratios below 0. 1 have not been examined in sufficient detail to enable deterministic engineering of <b>hard</b> <b>coated</b> Hertzian contacts. In this paper, we formulate the appropriate relationships by fitting equations to the non-dimensionalized results of multi-parametric Finite element analysis simulations. The relationships link coating stresses to coating characteristics (thickness and material properties) and contact conditions (substrate geometry, material properties and loading). These relationships enable engineers to (1) perform deterministic design of <b>hard</b> <b>coated</b> contacts for precision equipment, (2) to ascertain the sensitivity of coating stresses to changes in design parameters, and (3) to develop rules of thumb {{for the design of}} these contacts...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Surface {{treatments}} of the titanium alloys are frequently applied {{in order to}} modify the surface layer microstructure and to improve tribological properties or {{resistance to high temperature}} oxidation of the alloy. Various surface engineering techniques can be used to increase the surface hardness, e. g. deposition of the coatings composed of metallic carbides, nitrides or more recently DLC. The stiffness and strength properties of the coating and substrate materials differ significantly. Cracking of the usually brittle coating leads to stress concentration and localized plastic deformation of the substrate which can facilitate propagation of microcracks into the substrate. This can result in premature failure of the <b>hard</b> <b>coated</b> component. In the paper the crack penetrating hard coating was analysed and the influence of coating and substrate properties on crack driving force was numerically investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Two dimensional finite element analysis of the four point bending test of surface modified titanium alloy with the crack penetrating hardened layer was carried out. Findings: The effect of the coating thickness and stiffness, residual stresses in the coating, yield strength of substrate material and yield properties of diffusion hardened layer on crack driving force was determined. Research limitations/implications: Some extension of the numerical model should be introduced in order {{to take into account the}} interactions of the crack with microstructure of the material.

The reasons for this mainly lie in the combination of properties such as high strength at increased temperatures, {{a high degree of}} chemical resistance and high wear resistance. However, these advantages are offset by a major disadvantage: the machining, in particular milling, is very difficult. Only relatively low cutting speeds can be used and tool life is usually short. Developing tool and technology solutions aimed at obtaining an enhancement of the machining techniques used for milling of difficult-to-cut materials.

In HPC (High Performance Cutting) machining, tools and tool coatings have to show a better thermal and chemical stability due to the higher process temperatures and the higher load of the tools. With oxygen-improved coating systems the thermal or the chemical stability of the used coatings at higher process temperatures can be improved. Therefore, the cutting process can be stabilized. The combination of stable oxidic and oxynitridic structures with conventional {{hard coatings}} was used to develop coatings with higher strength and higher hardness as well as an improved stability at higher temperatures. These oxygen-improved hard coatings were produced with the material systems Al-Cr-O-N or Zr-O-N and deposit with an arc-PVD process by use of an oxygen-nitrogen gaseous mixture.
