There are different ways to examine the magnetospheric magnetic field in dependency of the internal one. One is to use MHD simulations; another method is to rely on quantitative modeling. The first method gives a detailed view of the magnetic field topology within the magnetosphere. Vogt et al. (2004, 2007) simulated magnetospheres with different internal magnetic field, dipoles as well as quadrupoles. MHD simulations allow to study reconnection effects and the resulting magnetic field topology particularly in the outer magnetosphere where the magnetic field is relatively weak.

This suggests that the fine structure is an indication of modulations of the efficiency of the wave–particle interaction. The scale sizes and variations of these structures, mapped to the magnetosphere, can give us information about the characteristics of the modulating wave activity.

40|$|International audienceMAVEN {{observations}} {{show that}} the global spatial distribution of ions precipitating toward the Martian upper atmosphere has a highly asymmetric pattern relative to the upstream solar wind electric field. MAVEN observations indicate that precipitating planetary heavy ion fluxes measured in the downward solar wind electric field (−E) hemisphere are generally larger than those measured in the upward electric field (+E) hemisphere, as expected from modeling. The −E(+E) hemispheres are defined by the direction of solar wind electric field pointing towards (or away from) the planet. On the other hand, such an asymmetric precipitating pattern relative to the solar wind electric field is less clear around the terminator. Strong precipitating fluxes are sometimes found even in the +E field hemisphere under either strong upstream solar wind dynamic pressure or strong interplanetary magnetic field periods. The results imply that those intense precipitating ion fluxes are observed when the <b>gyro</b> <b>radii</b> of pickup ions {{are estimated to be}} relatively small compared with the planetary scale.

40|$|The bright "swirl" {{features}} {{observed on}} {{the lunar surface}} are generally associated with crustal magnetic anomalies. Prominent explanations that invoke these fields include: magnetic shielding {{in the form of}} a mini-magnetosphere, which impedes space weathering by the solar wind; magnetically controlled dust transport; and cometary or asteroidal impacts, that could result in shock magnetization with concomitant formation of the swirls. Here we consider another possibility in which the ambient magnetic and electric fields can transport and channel secondary ions produced by micrometeorite or solar wind ion impacts. We use a simplified model of the fields, which incorporates a two-dipole magnetic field model for Reiner Gamma, and typical solar wind conditions. We will present preliminarily results suggesting that ions created over significant regions of the lunar surface can be transported under the influence of local and interplanetary electromagnetic fields to narrow areas ncar arcas of high crustal magnetic field strength. The flux of these focused ions may be of sufficient intensity to chemically process (or otherwise bleach) the surface leading to the formation of the high albedo component of the lunar swirls. The theory is appealing since through a lensing effect, it is possible that this flux is sufficient to overcome other space weathering processes which would otherwise tend to erase the features.

40|$|We {{show that}} an upper {{limit on the}} maximum {{brightness}} temperature for a self-absorbed incoherent synchrotron radio source is obtained from {{the size of its}} gyro orbits, which in turn must lie well {{within the confines of the}} total source extent. These temperature limits are obtained without recourse to inverse Compton effects or the condition of equipartition of energy between magnetic fields and relativistic particles. For radio variables, the intra-day variability (IDV) implies brightness temperatures ∼ 10 ^ 19 K in the co-moving rest frame of the source. This, if interpreted purely due to an incoherent synchrotron emission, would imply <b>gyro</b> <b>radii</b> > 10 ^ 28 cm, the size of the universe, while from the causality arguments the inferred maximum size of the source in such a case is <_∼ 10 ^ 15 cm. Such high brightness temperatures are sometimes modeled in the literature as some coherent emission process where bunches of non-thermal particles are somehow formed that radiate in phase. We show that, unlike in case of curvature radiation models proposed in pulsars, in the synchrotron radiation mechanism the oppositely charged particles would contribute together to the coherent phenomenon without the need to form separate bunches of the opposite charges. At the same time we show that bunches would disperse over dimensions larger than a wavelength in time shorter than the gyro orbital period (<_∼ 0. 1 sec). Therefore a coherent emission by bunches cannot be a plausible explanation of the high brightness temperatures inferred in extragalactic radio sources showing variability over a few hours or longer.

40|$|We {{describe}} the cascade of plasma waves or turbulence injected, presumably by reconnection, at scales {{comparable to the}} size of a solar flare loop, L ∼ 10 9 cm, to scales comparable to elementary particle <b>gyro</b> <b>radii,</b> and evaluate their damping at small scales by various mechanisms. We show that the classical viscous damping valid on scales larger than the collision mean free path (∼ 10 8 cm) is unimportant for magnetically dominated or low beta plasmas and the primary damping mechanism is the collisionless damping by the background particles. We show that the damping rate is proportional to the total random momentum density of the particles. For solar flare conditions this means that in most flares, except the very large ones, the damping is dominated by thermal background electrons. For large flares one requires acceleration of essentially all background electrons into a nonthermal distribution so that the accelerated electrons can be important in the damping of the waves. In general, damping by thermal protons is negligible compared to that of electrons except for quasi-perpendicular propagating waves. Damping due to nonthermal protons is also negligible compared to nonthermal electrons in most flares which are electron dominated, except for rare proton dominated flares with strong nuclear gamma-ray line emission. Thus for common flares collisionless damping by background thermal electrons is the primary damping mechanism. Using the rate for this process we determine the critical scale (or wave vector kc) below which (i. e. for k> kc) the damping becomes important and the spectrum of the turbulence steepens. This critical scale, however, has strong dependence on the angle of propagation of the waves with respect to the...|$|R

The Rosetta Plasma Consortium observed regions of very weak magnetic field outside the predicted diamagnetic cavity.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} heating of outowing oxygen ions at high {{altitude}} above the polar cap {{using data from}} the Cluster spacecraft. oInospheric plasma may flow up from the ionosphere but at velocities which are low enough that the ions are still gravitationally bound. For the ions to overcome gravity, further acceleration is needed. The cusp/polar cap is an important source of outowing oxygen ions. In the cusp/polar cap, transverse heating is more common than eld-aligned acceleration through a magnetic eld-aligned electric eld. It is thus believed that transverse heating of ions is important for ion outow and one of the probable explanations for transverse heating is wave-particle interaction. A general conclusion from our work on high altitude oxygen ion energization is that ion energization and outow occur in the high altitude cusp and mantle. The particles are often heated perpendicularly to the geomagnetic eld and resonant heating at the gyrofrequency is most of the time intense enough to explain the observed O+ energies measured in the high altitude (8 { 15 Earth radii, RE ) cusp/mantle region of the terrestrial magnetosphere. The observed average waves can explain the observed average O+ energies. At lower altitude only a few percent of the observed spectral density around the oxygen gyrofrequency needs to be in resonance with the ions to obtain the measured O+ energies. A difference as compared to low altitude measurements is that we must assume that almost all wave activity is due to waves which can interact with the ions, and of these we assume 50 % to be left-hand polarized. We also have shown a clear correlation between temperature and wave intensity at the gyrofrequency at each measurement point. We have described the average wave intensity and corresponding velocity diffusion oeffcients as a function of altitude in a format convenient for modelers. Furthermore we have shown that the wave activity observed in this high altitude region is consistent with Alfven waves, and inconsistent with static structures drifting past the spacecraft. We have also shown how large the variability of the observed spectral densities is, and how sporadic the waves typically are. Based on three cases we have found that the regions with enhanced wave activity and increased ion temperature are typically many ion <b>gyro</b> <b>radii</b> in perpendicular extent...|$|R
40|$|The Aurora is {{a visual}} {{manifestation of the}} complex plasma {{processes}} that occur as the solar wind interacts with the Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere. Therefore, studies of the aurora can lead to {{better understanding of the}} near-Earth space environment and of fundamental physical processes. This thesis focuses on optical studies of the aurora, both ground-based observations using the Auroral Large Imaging System (ALIS) and measurements from instruments onboard the Japanese micro-satellite Reimei. Various properties of the aurora are studied, such as the characteristic energy of precipitating electrons and scale sizes of diffuse auroral structures. Our understanding of the ionospheric physical processes involved in a particular auroral emission is improved using conjugate particle and optical data. Auroral light is a result of radiative transitions between excited states of the ionospheric gases. These excited states are formed either by direct electron impact or by a series of more complicated processes, involving chemical reactions, where part of the energy is converted into auroral light. Studies of auroral emissions can therefore give information about primary particle fluxes, ionospheric composition, and the magnetospheric and ionospheric processes leading to auroral precipitation. One way of deducing the characteristic energy of the precipitating particles is by using intensity ratios of auroral emissions. To be reliable, this method requires a good understanding of the processes involved in the auroral emissions used. The method works well if the measurements are made along the geomagnetic field lines. Using data from ALIS, both in magnetic zenith and off magnetic zenith, this method is tested for angles further away {{from the direction of the}} magnetic field lines. The result shows that it is possible to use this technique to deduce the characteristic energy for angles up to 35 degrees away from magnetic zenith. Using ALIS we have also been able to study structures and variations in diffuse aurora. When mapped to the magnetosphere, this provides information about the characteristics of the modulating wave activity in the magnetospheric source region. A statistical study of the scale sizes of diffuse auroral structures was made and the result shows widths and separation between structures of the order of 13 - 14 km. When mapped to the magnetosphere, this corresponds to 3 - 4 ion <b>gyro</b> <b>radii</b> for protons with a typical energy of 7 keV. Magnetometer data show that the structures move southward with a speed close to zero in the plasma convection frame. Stationary mirror mode structures in the magnetospheric equatorial plane are a likely explanation for these diffuse auroral structures. In another study we use measured precipitating electron energy spectra to improve our understanding of how the auroral process itself relates to the 427. 8 nm auroral emission, which is often used when studying intensity ratios between different emission lines. The 427. 8 nm emission is a fairly simple emission to model, with only a few processes involved, but still has some uncertainties, mostly due to the excitation cross section. Simultaneous measurements of the intensity of this emission from ALIS and the intensity and electron flux from Reimei provide a way to evaluate different sets of cross sections in order to find the best fit to the experimental data. It also allows a comparison of the absolute calibration of ALIS and Reimei imagers, improving the possibility to use the space-borne data for other detailed quantitative studies. In order to compare absolute measurements of aurora using different imagers, optical instruments are usually absolute calibrated by exposing them to a calibration light source. In 2011 an intercalibration workshop was held in Sodankylä, Finland, where nine low light sources were compared to the radioactive Fritz Peak reference source. The results were compared with earlier calibration workshop results and show that the sources are fairly stable. Two sources were also calibrated with the calibration standard source at UNIS, Svalbard, and the results show agreement with the calibration workshop in Sodankylä within 15 to 25 %. This confirms the quality of the measurements with ALIS and in turn also of the the Reimei imagers.

In {{additional}} heating experiment of translated theta-pinch produced Field-Reversed-Configuration (FRC) plasma with {{density of}} 5 × 1019 m 3 and pressure balance temperature of 100 by hydrogen neutral beam, only electron is observed to be heated; electron and ion temperature is controlled independently {{for the first}} time in the FRC plasma. So far, confinement times of the FRC plasma were known to depend approximately on eV 10 keV R 2 ρ io (R; major radius, ρ io; ion <b>gyro</b> <b>radius)</b> and dependence on electron temperature was small, which is confirmed by the present experiment. The FRC plasma is also produced and sustained for longer than by a rotating magnetic field (RMF) in a metal confinement chamber. Though the performance of the present RMF produced FRC plasma is low, or the density and the temperature are lower than 4 ms 5 × 1017 m 3 and respectively, and can be sustained in quartz chamber. But future high temperature FRC plasma should be sustained in metal chamber. The efficiency of the FRC plasma production is higher for higher RMF frequency...|$|E
