40|$|Flexibility {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the design of space missions. Algorithms able to derive the dynamical equations for a generic chain of flexible and rigid bodies have been developed in the past decades so that accurate dynamic simulations of large multi-body chains are possible. On the other hand control devices are getting more and more sophisticated so that the guidance of satellite platforms equipped with last generation <b>fly-wheels</b> is a quite complex task. In order to develop control laws, restrictive hypotheses are commonly introduced to make the equation of motion as simple as possible: rigid body dynamic, small angular velocities, small deforma-tions, symmetric appendages bending, reduced degrees of freedom and many other hypotheses lead to as many different mathematical models. Simple modeling leads to fast simulations and allows an easier design of attitude steering laws or vibration sup-pression controls. In this work a mathematical model describing the full non-linear dynamic of a flexible satellite platform equipped with a system of rigid <b>fly-wheels</b> is developed in an explicit form. The equations are than compared to those obtained by applying standard multi-body analysis. The advantages of having an explicit form of the equations in term of the sole state of the central platform (the state of the wheels is considered as a control) are particularly attractive for control design. The set of ordinary differential equations written returns widely used model when restrictive hypotheses are introduced and has to be used in connection to a preliminary Finite Element Method analysis in order to evaluate the structural invariants...|$|R

Compared with the traditional energy storage methods such as <b>fly-wheels</b> and batteries, the capacities of PtG plants are much larger [5], as the converted NG can be restored in both the NG storage tank and the NG network. On the other hand, a simple PtG plant only converts electrical energy into NG, while other storages could transfer their stored energy back to the power system when needed. A possible solution is the combined operation of PtG plants and NGFPs, which enables the bidirectional energy flows between the power systems and NG networks.|$|R
40|$|Large {{structures}} in space do deform in a non negligible manner.

As the “Velocity Based ” steering law for a VSCMG device is designed under the hypothesis of rigid dynamic, “spill-over ” effects are visible. Even though vibrations are suppressed quite rapidly, the “spill-over ” introduces a tracking error {{that has to be}} accounted for.

5000|$|Security {{in the use}} of {{machinery}} is provided for by precautions as regards the cleaning {{of machinery}} in motion and working between the fixed and traversing parts of self-acting machines driven by power, by fencing of machinery, and by empowering inspectors to obtain an order from a court of summary jurisdiction to prohibit the use, temporarily or absolutely, of machinery, ways, works or plant, including use of a steam boiler, which cannot be used without danger to life and limb. Every hoist and <b>fly-wheel</b> directly connected with mechanical power, and every part of a water-wheel or engine worked by mechanical power, and every wheel race, must be fenced, whatever its position, and every part of mill-gearing or dangerous machinery must either be fenced or be in such position that it is as safe as if fenced. No protected persons may clean any part of mill-gearing in motion, and children may further not clean any part of or below manufacturing machinery in motion by aid of mechanical power; young persons further may not clean any machinery if the inspector notifies it to the occupier as dangerous. Security as regards the use of dangerous premises is provided for by empowering courts of summary jurisdiction, on the application of an inspector, to prohibit their use until the danger has been removed. The district council, or, in London, the county council, or in case of their default the factory inspector, can require certain provisions for escape in case of fire in factories and workshops in which more than forty persons are employed; special powers to make by-laws for means of escape from fire in any factory or workshop are, in addition to any powers for prevention of fire that they possess, given to every district council, in London to the county council. The means of escape must be kept free from obstruction. Provisions are made for doors to open outwards in each room in which more than ten persons are employed,/and to prevent the locking, bolting or fastening of doors so that they cannot easily be opened from inside when any person is employed or at meals inside the workplace. Further, provisions for security may be provided in special regulations. Every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop or place where the act applies must have a proper safety valve, a steam gauge, and a water gauge, and every such boiler, valve and gauge must be maintained in proper condition. Examination by a competent person must take place at least once in every fourteen months. The occupier of any factory or workshop may be liable for penal compensation not exceeding £Ioo in case of injury or death due to neglect of any provision or special rule, the whole or any part of which may be applied {{for the benefit of the}} injured person or his family, as the secretary of state determines. When a death has occurred by accident in a factory or workshop, the coroner must advise the factory inspector for the district of the place and time of the inquest. The secretary of state may order a formal investigation of the circumstances of any accident as in the case of mines. Careful and detailed provisions are made for the reporting by occupiers to inspectors, and entry in the registers at factories and workshops of accidents which occur in a factory or workshop and (a) cause loss of life to a person employed there, or (b) [...] are due to machinery moved by mechanical power, molten metal, hot liquid, explosion, escape of gas or steam, electricity, so disabling any person employed in the factory or workshop as to cause him to be absent throughout at least one whole day from his ordinary work, (c) are due to any other special cause which the secretary of state may determine, (d) not falling under the previous heads and yet cause disablement for more than seven days' ordinary work to any person working in the factory or workshop. In the case of (a) or (b) notice has also to be sent to the certifying surgeon by the occupier. Cases of lead, phosphorus, arsenical and mercurial poisoning, or anthrax, contracted in any factory or workshop must similarly be reported and registered by the occupier, and the duty of reporting these cases is also laid on medical practitioners under whose observation they come.

40|$|Hybridization of {{the metro}} {{traction}} systems has been the research focus {{during the last few}} years. Research has been done on various technologies that combine, in addition to its main energy source (DC rail), reversible energy storage devices like <b>fly-wheels,</b> ultra-capacitors, and batteries. Among these technologies, ultra-capacitors are promising because of their high power density and the fact that their lifespan is about ten years longer than that of batteries. The idea is to store the regenerative braking energy in an ultra-capacitor module. This energy will be used during the acceleration. As such, the grid will be protected from the over-currents related to start-up {{of the metro}} car. Moreover, the traction system efficiency will increase since the braking energy which is dissipated in resistors in the current system, will be recovered. In this thesis the Montreal Metro Traction system is studied. The main energy source (MES) is the DC rail in Metro. The metro system is first analysed and model. Ultra-capacitor sizing is done for the system. For the purpose of simulation, the initial system is scaled down. A 2 Hp machine is used as the traction motor. A bidirectional buck-boost DC/DC converter is designed to drive the motor. The ultra-capacitor interfaced bidirectional DC/DC converter and the ultra-capacitor bank are modeled and simulated. A unidirectional boost DC/DC converter is designed and simulated along with PI controllers, to control the flow of power from the DC rail (MES). Moreover, two efficient supervisory control strategies are developed for two possible ultra-capacitor bank sizes of the Montreal metro system. The novel control strategies enables superior regulation capability and ease of control. ...|$|R
