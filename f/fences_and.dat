5|$|<b>Fences</b> <b>and</b> Windows was {{published}} as a trade paperback by Picador in the US, Vintage Canada in Canada, and Flamingo in the UK. It {{was released in}} October 2002 with little promotion. The resulting sales were lower than expected. A portion of the book's proceeds was given to a legal defense fund for activists and for education concerning global democracy. Just after the book's release, a debate {{on the topic of}} globablization was held between Klein and The Economist journalist Sameena Ahmad in New York.|$|E
5|$|High winds {{across the}} state {{included}} a report of 47mph (76km/h) near the state's southeastern coastline. The winds downed some trees and resulted in power outages, and one person in Carrolwood was injured after a tree fell onto a house. The storm spawned several tornadoes in the southern portion of the state, some of which damaged <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> power lines. One possible tornado in Goulds left about 2,000people without power after it knocked down a power line. Another tornado near Miami damaged a few homes and trees.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, {{shortly after}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{established}} {{itself as a}} success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> cow skulls. As {{one of the first}} horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.|$|E

He reportedly {{dropped into the}} hole from which the roller coaster track re-emerges from the underground tunnel, walked through the underground section and emerged on a ledge where the track enters the ground. Neither he nor any guests on the ride were harmed following the ride cars being held at the boarding station. He was arrested for a public order offence, and the ride returned to normal operation the following day.|$|E
5|$|Paths, arbors, and fences use {{traditional}} or antique looking materials. Wooden <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> gates, paths {{covered with}} locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look and feel to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional finishes—everything is chosen {{to give the}} impression of an old-fashioned country garden.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{sections}} of the Kolonnenweg remain in place to serve as farm and forestry access roads, though the accompanying anti-vehicle ditches, <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> other obstacles have been almost entirely removed.

5|$|The {{computer}} game for this series became Grabbit Rabbit which involved guiding 'Warren the Rabbit' down a course collecting carrots whilst dodging obstacles such as <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> bushes. Ball later {{said in an}} interview that Blake Harrison of The Inbetweeners had told her that he had once been a player on Grabbit Rabbit when he was younger. Blobby's game also now became known as Blobby's Office Trolley which saw him as a postman for the BBC with viewers having to guess which celebrity a letter was for.|$|E
5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} of brick walls with a top made of barbed wire. Clay bricks and concrete slabs were used for construction. Further obstacles of barbed wire and upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Straße, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places safety installations of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> barbed wire barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 L-shaped concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} pasture-based dairy {{operations}} across the United States is rapidly increasing. This shift from confinement dairying to pasture-based dairying {{is driven by}} goals of reduced feed and labor costs. Efficient use of pasture resources is crucial to accomplish cost reduction and optimize milk production from pasture. <b>Fence</b> <b>and</b> water distribution systems are the tools used for controlling the grazing dairy herd. Practical, easy-to-use <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> water technologies are needed to reduce labor requirements. Dairy herd management requires flexibility in pasture allocation throughout the grazing season, so water <b>and</b> <b>fence</b> systems must also be flexible. This publication describes various <b>fence</b> <b>and</b> water systems appropriate for dairy grazing management...|$|R

5|$|<b>Fences</b> <b>and</b> Windows: Dispatches {{from the}} Front Lines of the Globalization Debate is a 2002 book by Canadian {{journalist}} Naomi Klein and editor Debra Ann Levy. The {{book is a}} collection of newspaper articles, mostly from The Globe and Mail, with a few magazine articles from The Nation and speech transcripts. The articles and speeches were all written by Klein in the 30 months after the publication of her first book, No Logo (1999), from December 1999 to March 2002. The articles focus upon the anti-globalization movement, including protest events and responses by law enforcement. The book was published in North America and the United Kingdom in October 2002.|$|E

She made a brief uncredited cameo appearance in one episode of Kelley's television series Picket <b>Fences</b> <b>and</b> played the title character in To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday, for which Kelley wrote the screenplay. Pfeiffer had entered into private adoption proceedings before she met Kelley. In March 1993, she adopted a newborn daughter, Claudia Rose, who was christened on Pfeiffer and Kelley's wedding day. In August 1994, Pfeiffer gave birth to a son, John Henry.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other species}} have become {{naturalized}} outside the Americas {{after having been}} introduced by people, especially in Australia, Hawaii, and the Mediterranean region. In Australia, species of Opuntia, particularly Opuntia stricta, were introduced in the 19th century for use as natural agricultural <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> {{in an attempt to}} establish a cochineal industry. They rapidly became a major weed problem, but are now controlled by biological agents, particularly the moth Cactoblastis cactorum. The weed potential of Opuntia species in Australia continues however, leading to all opuntioid cacti except O. ficus-indica being declared Weeds of National Significance by the Australian Weeds Committee in April 2012.|$|E

Members of several disability groups picketed before the premiere, protesting at the portrayal of mental retardation shown in the film. The groups revealed {{that it was the}} first time that they had ever protested together at an event. As a result of the protest, the normally unobstructed views of the red carpet leading to the premiere were blocked off by 10-foot (3-m)-high <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> there was an increase in the number of security personnel present. No protests were held at the United Kingdom's September premiere.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} Lincoln's assassination, on April 16, 1865, Hines was in Detroit, Michigan, {{when he was}} mistaken for John Wilkes Booth, {{who was then the}} subject of a massive manhunt. After finding himself in a fight, Hines jumped several <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> made his way to Detroit's wharf. He waited for a {{ferryboat}} to empty its passengers and then forced the captain at gunpoint to take him across the Detroit River to Canada. On arrival, Hines apologized to the captain and gave him five dollars. Hines' exploit led to the mistaken rumor that Booth had escaped into Canada.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{decipher}} Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold opt to reboot the entire park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats {{to an emergency}} bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining <b>fences</b> <b>and</b> released the raptors. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm.
