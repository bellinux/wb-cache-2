25|$|Several years later, in Alice v. CLS Bank, the Supreme Court readdressed {{the patent}} {{eligibility}} {{of a business}} method. It held patent ineligible a method of securing intermediated settlement—a form of electronic escrow. In invalidating Alice's patent, the Court announced a two-step test based on the Court's earlier decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo <b>Inoculant</b> Co. This test first determines whether the claimed invention is directed to an abstract idea, law of nature, mathematical formula, or similar abstraction, If it is, the court is to proceed to the second step—determining whether the way the claimed invention implements the abstraction contains an inventive concept, as contrasted with being routine and conventional. Under the Alice test, the claimed invention is patent eligible only if it contains an inventive concept.|$|E
25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case an easy one. But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo <b>Inoculant</b> Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, {{it would seem that the}} Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it would seem that the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E

40|$|<b>Inoculants</b> are silage {{additives}} containing {{lactic acid bacteria}} (e. g. Lactobacillus plantarum, other lactobacilli, pediococci or Enterococcus faecium) that help to improve fermentation (production of lactic acid) in the silo. <b>Inoculants</b> bacteria are usually selected from epiphytic microflora or other environments. Bacterial spectrum includes homofermentative species producing exclusively lactic acid and heterofermentative species producing mixture of lactic and acetic acids and/or other by-products like ethanol and carbon dioxide. Mode of action of <b>inoculants</b> include: 1) rapid production of lactic acid, 2) improvement of the aerobic stability of silage due to production of acetic acid, 3) detoxification of mycotoxines and inhibition of pathogenic and/or spoiling bacteria, 4) probiotic action.

In this study we evaluated the effects of <b>inoculants</b> containing Azospirillum brasilense with or without metabolites of Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899 highly enriched in lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) in six field experiments performed for three summer crop seasons in Brazil with maize (Zea mays L.). <b>Inoculants</b> and metabolites were applied either at sowing by seed inoculation, or by leaf spray at the V 3 stage of plant growth. Improvement in shoot dry weight (SDW) and total N accumulated in shoots (TNS) by single, but especially by dual inoculation was observed in some of the experiments. Statistically significant increases in grain yield in relation to the non-inoculated control were observed in five out of six experiments when maize was inoculated with Azospirillum supplied with enriched metabolites of R. tropici applied by seed or leaf spray inoculation.
