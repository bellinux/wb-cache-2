A third type of biodiesel, which {{is proving to be}} more strategic than both, is the algae biodiesel [2, 6, 13, 14, 23, 35, 47, 50]. Among the most photosynthetically efficient plants are those various types of algae. Some species of algae are ideally suited to biodiesel production due to their high oil content (some well over 50  % oil) [7, 13, 35] and extremely fast growth rates, 200 times faster than soya bean [20]. Extensive research is carried out now on the growth of specially chosen strains of microalgae [3, 28, 40, 49] in optimally designed and operated photobioreactors [3].|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{has great}} {{potential}} as a clean renewable feedstock for producing biofuels such as <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> <b>biodiesel,</b> methanol, and hydrogen. The use of biomass is accompanied by possible ecological drawbacks, however, such as limitation of land or water and competition with food production. For biomass-based systems a key challenge is thus to develop efficient conversion technologies which can also compete with fossil fuels. The development of efficient technologies for biomass gasification and synthesis of biofuels requires a correct use of thermodynamics. Energy systems are traditionally analyzed by energetic analysis based on the first law of thermodynamics. However, this type of analysis shows only the mass and energy flows and {{does not take into}} account how the quality of the energy and material streams degrades through the process. In this review, the exergy analysis, which is based on the second law of thermodynamics, is used to analyze the biomass gasification and conversion of biomass to biofuels. The thermodynamic efficiency of biomass gasification is reviewed for air-blown as well as steam-blown gasifiers. Finally, the overall technological chains biomass-to-biofuels are evaluated, including methanol, Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. The efficiency of biofuels production is compared with that of fossil fuel...|$|E
50|$|The {{type of fuel}} used is {{selected}} to meet a combination of service requirements, and fuel costs. Good-quality diesel fuel can be synthesised from vegetable oil and alcohol. Diesel fuel {{can be made from}} coal or other carbon base using the <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> process. <b>Biodiesel</b> is growing in popularity since it can frequently be used in unmodified engines, though production remains limited. Recently, biodiesel from coconut, which can produce a very promising coco methyl ester (CME), has characteristics which enhance lubricity and combustion giving a regular diesel engine without any modification more power, less particulate matter or black smoke, and smoother engine performance. The Philippines pioneers in the research on Coconut based CME with the help of German and American scientists. Petroleum-derived diesel is often called petrodiesel if there is need to distinguish the source of the fuel.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program was to quantify the emissions from heavy-duty vehicles operating on alternative fuels or advanced fuel blends, often with novel engine technology or aftertreatment. In {{the first year of}} the program West Virginia University (WVU) researchers determined that a transportable chassis dynamometer emissions measurement approach was required so that fleets of trucks and buses did not need to be ferried across the nation to a fixed facility. A Transportable Heavy-Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratory (Translab) was designed, constructed and verified. This laboratory consisted of a chassis dynamometer semi-trailer and an analytic trailer housing a full scale exhaust dilution tunnel and sampling system which mimicked closely the system described in the Code of Federal Regulations for engine certification. The Translab was first used to quantify emissions from natural gas and methanol fueled transit buses, and a second Translab unit was constructed to satisfy research demand. Subsequent emissions measurement was performed on trucks and buses using ethanol, <b>Fischer-Tropsch</b> fuel, and <b>biodiesel.</b> A medium-duty chassis dynamometer was also designed and constructed to facilitate research on delivery vehicles in the 10, 000 to 20, 000 lb range. The Translab participated in major programs to evaluate low-sulfur diesel in conjunction with passively regenerating exhaust particulate filtration technology, and substantial reductions in particulate matter were recorded. The researchers also participated in programs to evaluate emissions from advanced natural gas engines with closed loop feedback control. These natural gas engines showed substantially reduced levels of oxides of nitrogen. For all of the trucks and buses characterized, the levels of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and particulate matter were quantified, and in many cases non-regulated species such as aldehydes were also sampled. Particle size was also quantified during selected studies. A laboratory was established at WVU to provide for studies which supported and augmented the Translab research, and to provide for development of superior emissions measurement systems. This laboratory research focused on engine control and fuel sulfur issues. In recent years, as engine and aftertreatment technologies advanced, emissions levels were reduced such that they were at or below the Translab detectable limits, and in the same time frame the US Environmental Protection Agency required improved measurement methodologies for engine emissions certification. To remain current and relevant, the researchers designed a new Translab analytic system, housed in a container which can be transported on a semi-trailer. The new system's dilution tunnel flow was designed to use a subsonic venturi with closed loop control of blower speed, and the secondary dilution and particulate matter filter capture were designed to follow new EPA engine certification procedures. A further contribution of the program has been the development of techniques for creating heavy-duty vehicle test schedules, and the creation of schedules to mimic a variety of truck and bus vocations...|$|R
