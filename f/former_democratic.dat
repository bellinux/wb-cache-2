5|$|Daley {{defeated}} Sawyer in the primary. In the 1989 general election, Daley faced Republican candidate Edward Vrdolyak, a <b>former</b> <b>Democratic</b> alderman who {{had opposed}} Mayor Washington, and Alderman Timothy C. Evans, {{the candidate of}} the newly created Harold Washington Party. After winning the general election on April 4, 1989, Daley was inaugurated as Mayor of Chicago on April 24, 1989, his 47th birthday, at a ceremony in Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2001, Universal Music Group {{was criticized}} for airing {{commercials}} promoting the album during episodes of Total Request Live. Manson suspected that <b>former</b> <b>Democratic</b> vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman {{played a role in}} the criticism. Lieberman and Hillary Clinton had recently introduced the Media Marketing Accountability Act before the United States Congress. This legislation proposed to ban the entertainment-industry from marketing suspected violent or explicit material to minors.|$|E

5|$|During the 1892 presidential campaign, {{there was}} talk of Russell being the Vice Presidential nominee if Senator John M. Palmer were to receive the Democratic Presidential nomination. In early February 1892, Palmer and Patrick A. Collins, a <b>former</b> <b>Democratic</b> Massachusetts Congressman, agreed to make Palmer the Democratic Presidential {{candidate}} and Russell, Collins' personal and political friend, the Vice Presidential candidate. Palmer ended up rejecting the bid, and argued against it at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. Russell received one vote for President on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy was re-elected in 2006, {{and died}} on August 25, 2009 from a {{malignant}} brain tumor. On September 24, 2009, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick appointed {{longtime friend of}} Kennedy and <b>former</b> <b>Democratic</b> National Committee Chairman Paul G. Kirk to succeed Kennedy until a special election could be held. Kirk's appointment was especially controversial, as the Governor's ability to appoint an interim Senator was removed during the Romney administration by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as a precaution if Senator and presidential nominee John Kerry was elected President in 2004. Laws surrounding Senate appointment were quickly changed following Kennedy's death. The Massachusetts Republican Party sued {{in an attempt to}} halt Kirk's appointment, but it was rejected by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly.|$|E

5|$|In May 1968, Bush was {{commissioned}} into the Texas Air National Guard. After {{two years of}} active-duty service while training, {{he was assigned to}} Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. Critics, including <b>former</b> <b>Democratic</b> National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that Bush was favorably treated due to his father's political standing {{as a member of the}} House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance. In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.|$|E
5|$|One of Barack Obama's first {{decisions}} as president-elect was to appoint Hillary Clinton, US Senator from New York and <b>former</b> <b>Democratic</b> presidential primary opponent, as Secretary of State; Clinton resigned her Senate seat {{to take the}} position. The district's seat became vacant in January 2009 when Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to the United States Senate to replace Clinton. On February 23, 2009, Governor Paterson issued a proclamation setting the date for the special election as March 31, 2009. Under state law, Paterson was not required to issue a proclamation for a special election until July 2010. Both the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report listed the race as a toss-up.|$|E
5|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the {{special election}}. (Kennedy had been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, <b>former</b> <b>Democratic</b> National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the Senate seat until {{the completion of the}} special election. Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the special election. In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the seat in a stunning upset, ending Democratic control of it going back to 1953.|$|E

5|$|As the Kentucky Supreme Court {{prepared}} to hear Fletcher's appeal {{on whether the}} grand jury could continue to indict people covered by his blanket pardon, two of the court's seven justices recused themselves from the case, citing conflicts of interest. Kentucky's constitution provides that, {{in the case of}} more than one recusal on the court, the governor is to appoint special justices to replace them. Accordingly, Fletcher named two replacements, but one of those – Circuit Judge Jeffrey Burdette – declined to serve on grounds that he had contributed to Fletcher's 2003 gubernatorial campaign. Fletcher then named another special justice to replace Burdette, consistent with a precedent set by <b>former</b> <b>Democratic</b> Governor Brereton Jones. Stumbo challenged this third appointment, claiming that Burdette's refusal to serve created only one vacancy on the court, and that the case could be tried with six justices. The Kentucky Supreme Court sustained Stumbo's complaint. In a 4–2 ruling issued May 18, 2006, the Kentucky Supreme Court barred the grand jury from issuing further indictments against individuals covered by Fletcher's blanket pardon, reversing the Court of Appeals. The ruling did not affect indictments for crimes allegedly committed after the pardon was issued. The Supreme Court also held that the grand jury could issue a general report of its findings at the conclusion of its investigation, but left open {{the question of whether the}} names of unindicted individuals could appear in the report. A later decision by the Court of Appeals found that unindicted individuals could not be named in the report.|$|E
