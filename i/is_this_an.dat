Gordon was chosen as showrunner for the series by Killen, and commended the pilot script at first glance on a flight to New York City. [...] "I read the pilot, and once I got past my envy, I {{was struck by the}} voice," [...] he stated. [...] "So few writers have real voices. Kyle is disarmingly self-effacing; and at the same time, he's disarmingly confident. It's that duality thing: On the one hand, he's open; on the other, he's closed." [...] Gordon later compared the television series to The Good Wife: [...] "The Good Wife has so many procedural aspects that they have to decide which format to use each week...Why <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>an</b> Awake episode?" [...] He and Killen served as executive producers (with David Slade and Jeffrey Reiner) for the pilot episode.|$|E

That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it.
