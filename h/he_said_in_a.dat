25|$|In October 2004, Cohen {{released}} Dear Heather, {{largely a}} musical collaboration with jazz chanteuse (and romantic partner) Anjani Thomas, although Sharon Robinson returned to collaborate on three tracks (including a duet). As light {{as the previous}} album was dark, Dear Heather reflects Cohen's own change of mood – <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of interviews that his depression had lifted in recent years, which he attributed to Zen Buddhism. In an interview following his induction into the Canadian Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Cohen explained that the album {{was intended to be}} a kind of notebook or scrapbook of themes, and that a more formal record had been planned for release shortly afterwards, but that this was put on ice by his legal battles with his ex-manager.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 2011 SIS {{warned the}} {{national}} transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary William Hague. 'The agencies obtained firm intelligence, {{were able to}} warn the NTC of the threat, and the attacks were prevented,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said. The speech follows criticism that SIS had been {{too close to the}} Libyan regime and was involved in the extraordinary rendition of anti-Gaddafi activists. Mr Hague also defended controversial proposals for secrecy in civil court involving intelligence material.|$|E

500|$|Carruth {{chose to}} {{deliberately}} obfuscate the film's plot to mirror {{the complexity and}} confusion created by time travel.

[...] "I'd like to get away from straight villain roles," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1936 interview. [...] "But I have no wish to be a hero. I enjoy roles where I get slapped around a bit. It's far more stimulating to play a character that isn't all one thing—not all bad and not all good."

500|$|Calhoun was {{consistently}} {{opposed to the}} War with Mexico, arguing that an enlarged military effort would only feed the alarming and growing lust of the public for empire regardless of its constitutional dangers, bloat executive powers and patronage, and saddle the republic with a soaring debt that would disrupt finances and encourage speculation. Calhoun feared, moreover, that Southern slave owners would be shut out of any conquered Mexican territories, as nearly happened with the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the war would detrimentally lead to the annexation of all of Mexico, which [...] would bring Mexicans into the country, whom he considered deficient in moral and intellectual terms. <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> speech on January 4, 1848: ...|$|E

Base officials responded, saying that the crimes committed by its soldiers were isolated events which do not [...] "reflect on the work and dedication of all service members." [...] Robert H. Scales, a retired U.S. Army major general and former commandant of the Army War College, suggested that the {{major factor in the}} shootings was the overuse of infantry personnel {{in the last ten years}} for close combat in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|In interviews, Gane and Sadier have {{discussed}} their musical philosophy. According to Gane [...] "to be unique {{was more important}} than to be good." [...] On the subject of being too obscure, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1996 interview that [...] "maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [...] esoteric music to understand what we're doing." [...] Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she [...] "think we have achieved a music that will make sense {{to a lot of people}} whether they know about Steve Reich or not."

[...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise.

500|$|In 1993, {{brothers}} Héctor and Oscar Serrano formed Grupo Manía in Puerto Rico. They enlisted Alfred Cotto, Reynaldo Santiago, and Elvis Crespo to {{tour and}} record two-step merengue music, popularizing the genre {{to a younger}} audience. In 1996, Crespo left Grupo Manía and signed with Sony Music Latin (the company which signed his former band), beginning his solo career. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> May 1999 Billboard interview that leaving the band was [...] "a very hard decision", since they worked well together. While Crespo was writing [...] "Suavemente", he began singing the song and discovered that his son [...] "spent all afternoon singing it".

Crespo originally intended for [...] "Suavemente" [...] and [...] "Tu Sonrisa", the singles which brought him international recognition, to be recorded with Grupo Manía.|$|E
