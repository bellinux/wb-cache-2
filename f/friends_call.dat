500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{called it}} [...] "flat-out the best comedy {{series of the}} new season". Varietys Tony Scott had optimistic hopes for the series; he enjoyed the premise but was {{concerned}} that dialogue from the writers of Dream On should be [...] "snappier". Scott was also concerned that the Monica storyline set a bad example to younger viewers; [...] "Friends touts promiscuity and offers liberal samples of an openness that borders on empty-headedness". He singled out Cox and Schwimmer as the best actors of the ensemble. Robert Bianco was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him [...] "terrific". He also praised the female leads, but wrote that Perry's role as Chandler was [...] "undefined" [...] and that LeBlanc was [...] "relying {{too much on the}} same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it". Entertainment Weekly rates the episode B+ and states that [...] "After 22 minutes, these six people are believably set up as lifelong buddies". Ross's line, [...] "Do the words 'Billy, Don't Be a Hero' mean anything to you?" [...] is singled out as the best line of the episode. The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to <b>Friends</b> <b>call</b> it a [...] "good, solid start to the series" [...] but [...] "the regular cast (particularly Perry and Schwimmer) might be trying just a little too hard". Schwimmer recalls enjoying the physical humor involving Ross, particularly the scene where Ross greets Rachel and opens an umbrella on her.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Dansky {{comments}} that [...] "for {{all of its}} elemental simplicity, The Settlers of Catan has breathtaking depth and breadth of experience. It's a resource-management game, defined by position and strategizing. It's a social game, defined by horsetrading of resource cards and 'Siccing the Fritz' (as my <b>friends</b> <b>call</b> the robber) with bloodthirsty bonhomie. It's a game of chance, ruled by dice rolls and card draws. It's a hardcore game and a light social pastime and everything in between, a laboratory where I can test a hundred different play styles and a genuine reason to invite friends over." ...|$|E

In 1975 he stopped calling himself [...] "Woody" [...] Mellor and adopted the stage name of Joe Strummer, {{and insisted that}} his <b>friends</b> <b>call</b> him by that name. The name [...] "Strummer" [...] {{apparently}} referred to his role as rhythm guitarist, in a rather self-deprecating way. Strummer was the lead singer of the 101ers and began to write original songs for the group. One song he wrote was inspired by his girlfriend at the time, Slits drummer Palmolive. The group liked the song [...] "Keys to Your Heart", and picked it as their first single.|$|E

Ace's interdimensional ship collides with the Starbug shuttle, causing it to crash land on an ocean planet. With Lister's help, Ace repairs Starbugs starboard engine. After returning to Red Dwarf, Ace decides he can't stay, as he couldn't bear to be near the weaselly Rimmer of this universe. Ace can't return home but decides to explore other realities with [...] "a billion other Arnold Rimmers to meet." [...] Ace explains that the diverging {{point in their lives}} where Ace gets his big break and Rimmer doesn't is that at the age of seven, Ace went down a year in his class while Rimmer stayed up. Being kept down a year was according to Ace what changed him and made him fight back.|$|E

It was at this recording session that Evans got his stage name from Clark's wife, who asked Evans what his name was. [...] "Well", he replied, [...] "my <b>friends</b> <b>call</b> me 'Chubby'". As he had just completed a Fats Domino impression, she smiled and said, [...] "As in Checker?" [...] That little play on words ("chubby" [...] describing a degree of fatness and [...] "checkers" [...] being, like [...] "dominoes", a game) got an instant laugh, and stuck: from then on, Evans would use the name [...] "Chubby Checker".|$|E
