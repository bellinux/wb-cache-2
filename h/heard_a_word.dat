500|$|The army al-Mukhtar sent under Ibn al-Ashtar's command {{consisted}} {{largely of}} mawālī (sing. mawlā; non-Arab clients of Arab tribes). The {{ranks of the}} mawālī were dominated by the Persians of Kufa led by Abu Amra Kaysan; the latter was a mawlā of a Bajila tribesman who either commanded the shurṭa or the ḥaras (personal guard) of al-Mukhtar. The predominance of Persians in al-Mukhtar's army was noted by Umayyad defectors to Ibn al-Ashtar; they complained to have rarely <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of Arabic spoken by al-Mukhtar's soldiers whom they viewed as unfit to confront the elite troops of the Umayyad army. According to 9th-century historian al-Dinawari, Ibn al-Ashtar responded that his troops were [...] "the sons of noble warriors and chiefs of the Persians". Arab cavalry also formed {{a significant part of}} Ibn al-Ashtar's forces and his lieutenant commanders were also Arabs.|$|E
500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{the album}} {{consists}} of urban contemporary gospel music containing elements of R, neo-soul and traditional black gospel music, with inspirational lyrics about building, maintaining and appreciating {{a relationship with}} God which also encourage the listener that [...] "everything {{is going to work}} out fine". The album's lead single, [...] "Heard a Word", sums up the theme of the album, with its chorus: [...] "I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> / Saying girl, you'll be fine / I <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> that would ease my troubled mind / Took all the hurt away / Warmed me up inside like a summer day / So glad that you'd never break your promises". Other songs are tributes to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States; [...] "Better Place", written by Michelle Williams, Damon Elliott and Kayla Parker, is one such example which was inspired by the catastrophic event and is an emotional tribute to those who died in the attack.|$|E

2500|$|The benign {{intentions}} of the United States were also argued by John Bright and Richard Cobden, strong supporters of the United States and leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League in Britain. Both had expressed strong reservations about the legality of American actions, but argued strongly that the United States had no aggressive designs against Great Britain. [...] Bright publicly disputed that the confrontation had been intentionally engineered by Washington. In an early December speech to his constituents, he condemned the British military preparations [...] "before {{we have made a}} representation to the American Government, before we have <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> from it in reply, [...] should be all up in arms, every sword leaping from its scabbard and every man looking about for his pistols and blunderbusses?" [...] Cobden joined with Bright by speaking at public meetings and by writing letters to newspapers, organizers of meetings that he could not attend, and influential people in and out of Britain. As time passed and voices opposing war were heard more and more, the Cabinet also began considering alternatives to war, including arbitration.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{stand-up}} comic John Ridley {{had originally}} written the screenplay, then titled Spoils of War, {{as an experiment}} to see how fast he could write and sell a film. The writing took him seven days, and Warner Bros. bought the script 18 days later. When the studio showed a list of their purchased scripts to Russell, the one-sentence description of Spoils of War, [...] "heist set in the Gulf War", appealed to him. Although Russell claimed he never read Ridley's script, so as not [...] "to pollute my own idea", he admits that [...] "John gets credit where it's due. The germ {{of the idea that}} I took was his." [...] Ridley maintains that Russell shut him out of the process, saying [...] "I never <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> while he was shooting the movie. Never saw any of the script changes. And then finally, a year later, I get a copy of the script, and my name isn't even on it." [...] Although Warner Bros. worked out a deal to give Ridley a [...] "story by" [...] credit, Ridley remains unhappy with the experience, and has blocked Russell's efforts to publish the Three Kings screenplay in book form.|$|E

2500|$|Murphy's accomplishments are all {{the more}} {{remarkable}} as he was deaf. He was known as [...] "Silent Mike" [...] due to his affliction, and contemporary reports state that, though he was deaf, the affliction was not so severe as to prevent him from hearing all remarks. One report in 1905 noted: [...] "It was characteristic of Murphy to encourage the belief that he was very deaf and thus break down the caution of the lads who prided themselves on their ability to outwit the veteran." [...] In 1908, The Washington Post noted that, though Murphy had been [...] "rather deaf" [...] for several years, his deafness had worsened, such that anyone wanting to speak with him [...] "has to shout {{at the top of his}} lungs." [...] Murphy joked at the time, [...] "I'm not much of a one to tell secrets to." [...] When he was in Reno in 1910 for the Jack Johnson–James Jeffries fight, Murphy recalled being approached by a woman who went on at length telling him about her marital problems. After she finished, Murphy told her, [...] "Madame, you have come to the right person. Your secrets are safe. I have not <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> you said." ...|$|E
