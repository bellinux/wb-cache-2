5|$|Sabre Wulf is an action-adventure game by Ultimate Play the Game, {{initially}} released for the ZX Spectrum {{home computer}} in 1984.

The player does not receive explicit <b>guidance</b> <b>on</b> how to play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabreman moves between the maze's 256 connected screens by touching the border where one screen ends and another begins. Each screen is filled with colourful flora, enemies that spawn at random, and occasional collectibles.|$|E

5|$|For its fiftieth anniversary, Fantasia {{returned}} to 550 theaters nationwide on October 5, 1990, in its traditional 1946 version including the live action scenes with Taylor {{and the original}} Stokowski score. The film underwent a two-year restoration process which began after a six-month search {{to piece together the}} original negatives that had been in storage since 1946. This marked the first time since then that a release of the film had been processed from the original and not from a copy. Each of its 535,680 frames were restored at YCM Laboratories, and an untouched print from 1951 was used for <b>guidance</b> <b>on</b> color and tone. Theaters were required to have specific stereo equipment installed, and to present the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with black borders on the side of their screens. The Stokowski soundtrack was digitally remastered using the 1955 magnetic soundtrack, with an estimated three thousand pops and hisses being removed in the process. The 1990 reissue of Fantasia went on to gross $25 million domestically.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE <b>Guidance</b> <b>on</b> Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E
5|$|Rain World is a 2017 {{survival}} platformer {{video game}} in which the player controls a part-slug, part-cat creature searching a hostile, derelict world for its family. The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit <b>guidance</b> <b>on</b> how to survive, which was {{the intention of the}} developers, who wanted players to feel like a rat living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function. Rain World was developed by Videocult, a small indie team, over six years and published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 and Windows in March 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but disliked its brutal difficulty and imprecise controls.|$|E
5|$|The player {{does not}} receive any {{explicit}} <b>guidance</b> <b>on</b> {{how to play}} and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabre Wulf graphics fill the screen with a minimal user interface consisting of the current game score, number of lives left and a high score meter on the top row. Sabreman can eat orchid power-ups, which bloom {{for only a few}} seconds, to turn the colour of the orchid and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. invulnerability, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player's controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and extra lives scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases include a two-player mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.|$|E

Such compacts were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922.|$|E
5|$|As the Canucks {{opened the}} 1992 playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets, Bure {{recorded}} his first NHL hat trick in game six to help force a seventh and deciding game. Vancouver won the series {{to advance to}} the second round, but were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers. Bure finished his first Stanley Cup playoffs with six goals and 10 points in 13 games. At the end of the season, he was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. His 60 points were second among first-year players to Tony Amonte's 69 points with the Rangers, although Bure played in 14 fewer games. When accepting the award, Bure thanked Canucks linemate Igor Larionov for his <b>guidance.</b> <b>On</b> arriving in Vancouver, his former Red Army teammate took him into his home for two weeks before Bure moved into his own apartment; the two also roomed together on the road. Bure's Calder Trophy, along with head coach Pat Quinn's Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach, marked the first major individual NHL awards in Canucks' team history. However, despite being named the league's top rookie, Bure was left off the NHL All-Rookie Team, making him the only Calder recipient not to be named to the lineup. This was because he split his time playing both left and right wing. When it came to voting for the players, Bure had the most total votes, but not enough at either position to claim a spot.|$|E
5|$|In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha {{announced}} plans to increase the Territorial Army (TA) from 130,000 men to 340,000 {{and in so doing}} double the number of territorial divisions. The intended plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided by an increase in pay for territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks, and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form 'second-line' divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 61st Infantry Division was to be created as a second-line unit, a duplicate of the first-line 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. In April, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 'Militiamen', all of the age of 20, were conscripted into the regular army with the intent of being trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. However, despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central <b>guidance</b> <b>on</b> the expansion and duplication process, and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment, and instructors.|$|E
