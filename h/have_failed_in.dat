5|$|Speyer's two {{principal}} legacies {{are the three}} deep-level tube lines of the London Underground, and the Promenade Concerts. The former {{might not have been}} built without the finance he raised with Yerkes, and would have struggled without his chairmanship. The latter may <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century without his financial support. The tube lines now form the central sections of the Underground's Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. After Speyer's funding of the Promenade Concerts ended, they were taken over by music publishers Chappell & Co. and, in 1927, by the BBC. The characters of Sir Hermann and Lady Aline Gurtner in E. F. Benson's 1919 novel Robin Linnet were based on Sir Edgar and Lady Speyer. Leanne Langley suggests that the character of Appleton, a villainous stockbroker, in John Buchan's The Thirty-Nine Steps may have been based on Speyer.|$|E

40|$|On 5 May 1992, Australia’s Commonwealth Government passed {{legislation}} {{resulting in the}} mandatory detention of persons arriving in Australia without a valid visa. The contingent political reasons that led Keating’s Labor Government to adopt the policy are not widely remembered or remarked upon. But the legacy of that initial introduction of mandatory detention – embodied in destroyed lives, a toxic public discourse, and the expenditure {{of billions of dollars}} of Commonwealth revenues – continues to exert itself in the bipartisan political consensus that perpetuates the policy. This paper provides a thick description of the evolution of mandatory detention under both Labor and Coalition Governments. It continues in more analytical mode, arguing that for twenty years the policy has been an abject failure. It <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> terms of the objectives that its proponents have advanced; it <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> terms of Australia’s human rights obligations under international law; it <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> terms of unnecessarily depleting the public purse; it <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> terms of the coarsening and degradation of Australia’s public discourse; and it <b>has</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> terms of its impacts on the lives of several generations of asylum seekers. The paper ends with a discussion of the reasons why both the Labor Party and the Coalition have persevered with the failed policy of mandatory detention. 22 page(s...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of the Howard Government's {{amendment}} to the Marriage Act 1961 in 2004, federal law in Australia officially bans same-sex marriage.

25|$|Physical {{evidence}} and CCTV {{footage of the}} fire showed that it probably started towards {{the stern of the}} ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off {{at the end of each}} day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.|$|E
25|$|We must {{single out}} the {{children}} who are endowed with high potentialities, and develop them as completely as possible. And in this manner give to the nation a non-hereditary aristocracy. Such children may be found in all classes of society, although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others. The descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities. These qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration. But this degeneration is often superficial. It comes chiefly from education, idleness, lack of responsibility and moral discipline. The sons of very rich men, like those of criminals, should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings. Thus separated from their family, they could manifest their hereditary strength. In the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality. The issue of the Crusaders is by no means extinct. The laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords. It is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination, courage, and judgment, of the heroes of the French or Russian Revolutions, of the high-handed business men who live among us, might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority. As we know, criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble-mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects. High potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest, intelligent, hard-working men who have had ill luck in their careers, who <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> business or have muddled along all their lives in inferior positions. Or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries. However, from such people sometimes spring artists, poets, adventurers, saints. A brilliantly gifted and well-known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Charlemagne to that of Napoleon.|$|E

500|$|Not {{all of the}} {{reactions}} were positive: several of Duncan's captains were criticised for their failure to rapidly and decisively engage the enemy, including Captain Wells of Lancaster. The worst criticism fell on Captain John Williamson of Agincourt. Agincourt had been barely engaged in the battle and had suffered not one single casualty. As a result, Williamson was accused of failing to do his duty by Captain Hopper of Agincourts Royal Marines and court-martialled on 4 December 1797, at Sheerness aboard Circe, on the charges of [...] "disobedience to signals and not going into action" [...] and [...] "cowardice and disaffection". Williamson {{had a history of}} indecisiveness: in 1779, while a junior officer on Captain James Cook's voyage to the Pacific Ocean, Williamson had prevaricated about bringing boats to evacuate Cook from Kealakekua Bay while under attack by Hawaiians. As a result, Cook was trapped on the beach and stabbed to death. At the conclusion of the trial on 1 January 1798, Williamson was found guilty of the first charge and not guilty of the latter, resulting in demotion {{to the bottom of the}} post captains list and prohibition from further naval service. Williamson was reported to have died in 1799, shortly after his dismissal from the service, but Edward Pelham Brenton later claimed that he had instead gone into hiding under an assumed name and continued to draw his pension for many years. In the Batavian Republic, there were also recriminations against those officers who were deemed to <b>have</b> <b>failed</b> <b>in</b> their duty: De Winter's despatch from London after the battle placed much of the blame with six ships that had failed to follow his orders and had withdrawn early from the battle. Several officers were brought up on charges, including Admiral Bloys van Treslong who was convicted at court-martial and dismissed the service although later reinstated, and Commander Souter of Batavier who was convicted and imprisoned. Admiral Story was also criticised, particularly by De Winter, and was only permitted to keep his command once he had satisfied the Batavian government that he had had no option but to retreat.|$|E
