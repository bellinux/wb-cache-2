40|$|Population {{introduction}} is {{an important}} tool for ecosystem restoration. However, before introductions should be conducted, {{it is important to}} evaluate the genetic, phenotypic and ecological suitability of possible replacement populations. Careful genetic analysis is particularly important if it is suspected that the extirpated population was unique or genetically divergent. On the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the introduction of greater prairie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) to replace the extinct heath hen (T. cupido cupido) is being considered as part of an ecosystem restoration project. Martha's Vineyard was home to the last remaining heath <b>hen</b> <b>population</b> until its extinction in 1932. We conducted this study to aid in determining the suitability of greater prairie chickens as a possible replacement for the heath hen. We examined mitochondrial control region sequences from extant populations of all prairie grouse species (Tympanuchus) and from museum skin heath hen specimens. Our data suggest that the Martha's Vineyard heath <b>hen</b> <b>population</b> represents a divergent mitochondrial lineage. This result is attributable either to a long period of geographical isolation from other prairie grouse populations or to a population bottleneck resulting from human disturbance. The mtDNA diagnosability of the heath hen contrasts with the network of mtDNA haplotypes of other prairie grouse (T. cupido attwateri, T. pallidicinctus and T. phasianellus), which do not form distinguishable mtDNA groupings. Our findings suggest that the Martha's Vineyard heath hen was more genetically isolated than are current populations of prairie grouse and place the emphasis for future research on examining prairie grouse adaptations to different habitat types to assess ecological exchangeability between heath hens and greater prairie chickens...|$|E
40|$|Vaccination {{remains the}} {{principal}} {{way to control}} seasonal infections and {{is the most effective}} method of reducing influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. Since the 1940 s, the main method of producing influenza vaccines has been an egg-based production process. However, {{in the event of a}} pandemic, this method has a significant limitation, as the time lag from strain isolation to final dose formulation and validation is six months. Indeed, production in eggs is a relatively slow process and production yields are both unpredictable and highly variable from strain to strain. In particular, if the next influenza pandemic were to arise from an avian influenza virus, and thus reduce the egg-laying <b>hen</b> <b>population,</b> there would be a shortage of embryonated eggs available for vaccine manufacturing.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Eggshell {{ultrastructure}} organization, including effective layer thickness, mammillary layer thickness, {{and average}} size of mammillary cones, {{is important for}} breeding and significantly influences eggshell mechanical properties. Several matrix proteins {{were known to be}} important in eggshell formation. However, the proteins and variations that determine eggshell ultrastructure organization are not known. Results: In this study, 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of three major genes in a <b>hen</b> <b>population</b> using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a very low minor allele frequency (< 1 %) were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were used for analysis of associations with eggshell ultrastructure organization. Associations were found for (i) ovocleidin- 116 with effective layer thickness (EFF), mammillary layer thickness (MAM), and average size of mammillary cones (SMAM); (ii) ovalbumin with eggshell thickness (ESH), effective layer thickness, and density of the mammillary cone (DMAM); and (iii) calmodulin 1 with density of the mammillary cone.

40|$|Title of the paper: Mortality {{of laying}} hens housed in single and group cages This study {{provides}} genetic parameters for mortality of laying hens estimated with linear and threshold models. Records of one {{line from a}} commercial breeding programme of White Leghorns from three generations were available. Data included observations of 8636 hens from single and from 6908 hens of group cages. Mortality was defined as death {{in the first six}} months of lay with dead= 1 and alive= 0. The average mortality was 3. 3 % in single and 6. 3 % in group cages. The binary traits were analysed separately by linear animal (LAM), by threshold animal (TAM) and by threshold sire models. Further the two mortalities were analysed together by a linear-linear animal (LLAM) and threshold-threshold animal model (TTAM). The LLAM estimates of heritability were 1. 5 % for single and 3. 2 % for group cages. The heritability estimates of TTAM ranged from 9. 6 % to 9. 9 %. The rank correlations between breeding values of LAM and TAM were for all sires, the 10 % best and the 5 % best sires in the range 0. 96 to 1. 00.

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} precipitation and predator abundance on Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo; RGWT) in Texas. My results suggested that RGWT production was strongly correlated with cumulative winter precipitation over {{the range of the}} RGWT in Texas. However, I found no evidence that predator abundance influenced RGWT production, although spatial-asynchrony of predator populations at multiple spatial scales might have masked broad-scale effects. Using the results of these analyses, as well as empirical data derived from the literature and from field studies in the southern Edwards Plateau, I developed a stochastic, density-dependent, sex- and agespecific simulation model of wild turkey population dynamics. I used the model to evaluate the effect of alternative harvest management strategies on turkey populations. Sensitivity analysis of the model suggested that shape of the density-dependence relationship, clutch size, hatchability, juvenile sex ratio, poult survival, juvenile survival, and nonbreeding hen mortality most strongly influenced model outcome. Of these, density-dependence, sex ratio, and juvenile survival were least understood and merit further research. My evaluation of fall hen harvest suggested that current rates do not pose a threat to turkey populations. Moreover, it appears that hen harvest can be extended to other portions of the RGWT range without reducing turkey abundance, assuming that population dynamics and harvest rates are similar to those in the current fall harvest zone. Finally, simulation of alternative hen harvest rates suggested that rates &# 8805; 5 % of the fall <b>hen</b> <b>population</b> resulted in significant declines in the simulated population after 25 years, and rates &# 8805; 15 % resulted in significant risk of extinction to the simulated population...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The compartmental {{model has}} been shown to be a {{suitable}} model for egg production based on physiological age of the hen. Assumptions made in developing the compartmental model are consistent with the physiology of egg production in poultry. However, when it is applied to egg production data from <b>hen</b> <b>populations</b> where the increasing slope of the egg production curve is jointly affected by the actual rate of change in the egg production and the variation in age at sexual maturity, the compartmental model cannot accurately characterize the change in the initial period of lay, due to limitations in its mathematical properties. In addition, the parameters for the initial age of egg laying and the rate of increase in egg laying no longer make reasonable biological sense. The new model derived in the present study incorporates a component of variation in sexual maturity, with two parameters defined in relation to the characteristics of sexual maturity in the flock. Thus the model will provide more information about the flock and can accurately characterize the whole period of lay. It may be reasonable to consider that the compartmental model and the modified compartmental model have respective suitable application areas and could complement each other. From a practical point of view, the modified compartmental model would have a wider application because it does not rely on synchronized egg production data which are of limited availability in practice.

Methods: Data on Hen Harrier breeding distribution in 10 km[*]×[*] 10 km survey squares from national surveys were used in conjunction with information on the location of wind farms to examine whether, and to what extent, changes in Hen Harrier distribution and abundance between 2000 and 2010 were related to wind energy development. Results: Of the 69 survey squares holding Hen Harriers during the 2010 breeding season, 28 % also overlapped with one or more wind farms. Data from 36 of the squares with breeding Hen Harriers during the 2000 survey revealed a marginally non-significant negative relationship between wind farm presence and change in the number of breeding pairs between 2000 and 2010. Conclusions: A considerable overlap exists between Hen Harrier breeding distribution and the location of wind farms in Ireland, particularly in areas between 200 and 400 m above sea level.

40|$|Diseases {{caused by}} E. coli are {{numbered}} {{among the most}} frequent causes of increased mortality rates in the alternative husbandry of laying hens. Due to the very limited therapeutic possibilities for laying hens, prophylactic measures such as vaccinations are of great significance. Within the framework of this study, various population-specific inactivated E. coli vaccines were tested on 7. 196 laying hens living in alternative husbandry systems. The laying hens were divided into four test groups and one unvaccinated control group, and stayed, for both the breeding and the laying period, under equal conditions in the same coop. The strains used for the population-specific vaccines were isolated from laying hens which had died from colibacteriosis, then serotyped and {{with the aid of}} PCR checked for the presence of 7 APEC specific, virulence associated genes (astA, irp- 2, fyua, iucD, tsh, fim C, pap C). After carrying out a pathogenicity test, we eventually selected 3 out of 25 isolated E. coli strains in the embryonated egg for the vaccine production, two of them being isolates of the O-group O 1 and one of them an isolate of the O-group O 18. They showed 5, 6 or 7 of the virulence associated genes. Two vaccines were produced from it which contained all three strains, but differed in their amount of germs (10 (hoch 8) resp. 10 (hoch 9) KbE per ml). These vaccines were subcutaneously administered to the animals on one or two occations during their breeding. The measurement of results of the examined vaccines was carried out based on the clinic examination of the animals, on the mortality rate and pathological-anatomical examinations as well as on bacteriological and serological tests which were performed using the indirect ELISA test system developed by ourselves. Clinically, there were no variations from the state of health and the general condition to be expected for animals of that age. The mortality rate during the laying period averaged at 7. 38 %, while the values ranged from 6. 54 % (unvaccinated control group) to 8. 35 % (one vaccination with 0. 5 ml x 10 (hoch 9) KbE/ml during the 12 th laying week). In the course of the whole study, we could not determine any differences between the vaccinated groups and the unvaccinated control group regarding the clinical parameters and the mortality. Bacteriologically, 36 strains of E. coli could be isolated, 21 of which were serotyped and tested for virulence associated genes. While there were only 4 (19. 0 %) E. coli isolates that could be allocated to serotype O 2 through serotyping, we were able to detect at least one APEC specific, virulence associated gene [(iss (95, 2 %), iucD (52, 4 %), irp 2 (33, 3 %), astA (33, 3 %), tsh (23, 8 %), papC (4, 8 %) ] in all tested E. coli strains using the molecular biological detection method. In particular the high prevalence of the anti-host defence system Iss (incresaed serum survival; iss: 95, 2 %) not covered by the vaccine points out its key role in the pathogenesis of colibacteriosis. The serological progression study showed an increase of the serum titer until the 19 th laying week (LW), whereas the comparison of the mean values from the vaccine groups measurement readings of the 12 th and 16 th LW (Scheffes procedure within the multicomparison testing) presented a significant difference (P &# 8804; 0. 05) of the increase of titers between the group of two vaccinations (2 x 0. 5 ml x 10 (hoch 9) KbE/ml) and the unvaccinated control group. From the 20 th LW onwards, the antibody level began to fall steadily and in the 50 th LW, it showed its lowest value of the whole laying period. For the diagnostic serological test of hen serums, we demonstrated the specifity of the applied indirect ELISA for the detection of antibodies against E. coli and proved the repeatability of the results with intra- and interassay differences. Towards the end of the laying period, a load test was conducted on 50 animals per group. For this purpose, 25 animals per group were intratracheally administered 0. 5 ml of a germ-containing Tryptose Phosphate Broth (10 (hoch 7) KbE resp. 10 (hoch 8) KbE). The strained animals were observed and the time sequence of their mortality documented. The results of this test indicated that groups with a higher challenge dose also showed higher mortality rates regardless of the respective test group. The mortality rate of the groups with the higher infection dose ranged between 68 - 80 %, while the lower infection dose ranged between 48 and 68 %. Therefore, we cannot assume that the E. coli vaccination has an effect on the course of mortality or that there is an immunization {{until the end of the}} laying period of the hens. As a conclusion of this study, there was no measurable effect of the E. coli vaccination on the development of productive relevant parameters such as the mortality of laying hens within one group and between the test groups. If we take, according to the usual practice, the health of the <b>hen</b> <b>population</b> as a basis for the control of success, there is a definitely positive tendency throughout the development of the overall mortality (7. 38 %) compared to the rate of previous herds (25 - 30 %). However, the employment of population-specific E. coli vaccines can only be a promising remedy for controlling APEC infections if sufficient pathogen identification tests, especially of the present virulence factors, are conducted beforehand. For an efficient prophylaxis, it is not only indispensable to ensure proper application of effective E. coli vaccines, but also to optimize all management parameters (husbandry, feeding and biosecurity) ...|$|E

The goals of this study were to determine whether DR 6 is expressed by malignant ovarian epithelial tumors at an early stage and to examine whether DR 6 expression is associated with ovarian cancer (OVCA) progression in a laying hen model of spontaneous OVCA. Expression of DR 6 was examined in normal and malignant ovaries, normal ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells, or malignant epithelial cells and in serum of 3 -year-old <b>hens.</b> The <b>population</b> of microvessels expressing DR 6 was significantly higher in hens with early-stage OVCA than hens with normal ovaries (P <. 01) and increased further in late-stage OVCA.

Similar patterns of DR 6 expression were also observed by immunoblot analysis and gene expression studies. Furthermore, DR 6 was also detected in the serum of hens. In conclusion, DR 6 expression is associated with OVCA development and progression in laying hens.

Results showed that respondents, sampled from the Scottish general public, were willing to pay both for avoiding reductions in harrier populations and for increases, but that these values were lower than those associated with equivalent changes for another raptor sharing the same moorland habitat, the Golden Eagle. Respondents valued a move away from current management, but were largely indifferent to which management option was taken up, suggesting that management options should be selected in terms of relative costs, and on who bears these costs.

The PCA-LINMAP model made the evaluation for meat quality easily and the all main meat quality indicators were gathered to one integrated trait which could be contained in the breeding plan with other traits such as production and reproduction traits of broiler...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{determine}} the effect of average daily lighting duration and battery cages level on the production performance of laying quails, an experiment on 500 quail <b>hens</b> of Baloteşti <b>population</b> in 1 - 15 months laying period was organized. To achieve this, quails were divided into two equal groups (250 heads/lot), the control group was maintained on a 24 -hour lighting period and experimental group was maintained in a program with discontinuous illumination, using natural lighting completed with artificial light with a variable duration (12 hours and 30 minutes during the first 6 months of laying curve, 14 hours and 10 minutes in the following). To complete the study on the battery cage effect temperature was recorded on each level in both groups. During the period studied, the results were significantly higher in the experimental group compared with the controls ones. The average production performance regarding the percentage of laying was higher by 10. 21 % and egg production per capita was higher by 21. 92 %. Average consumption of mixed feed was 4. 33 % higher in the experimental group, while specific consumption was 25. 51 % higher in the control group quail. Average mortality was 10. 60 % lower in the experimental quails group. In conclusion, the use of a discontinuous lighting with variable duration program depending on the laying curve (lower {{in the first part of}} the lay curve and higher in the second part of it) is recommended. The influence of the cages battery was insignificant, but should be considered that temperature fluctuations in the 5 levels were not higher than 4 Celsius degrees in both groups...|$|R
40|$|Extracelluar matrix {{undergoes}} constant remodeling, cell–cell, and cell–matrix interactions during chicken {{ovarian follicle}} growth, which is coordinated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their associated endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs). Transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of MMP 13 in sexually mature chicken ovaries. In this study, {{we found that}} the expression of MMP 13 in chicken ovary was stably elevated from 60  d to 159  d, and was significantly higher at 159  d than at the other three developmental stages (P <  0. 05). The expression of MMP 13 mRNA increased from SW (small white follicles) to F 5 (fifth largest follicles), then decreased to F 1 (first largest follicles), and dramatically increased again in POF 1 (newly postovulatory follicles) follicles (P <  0. 05). The MMP 13 protein was localized in stroma cells and primordial follicles of sexually immature chicken ovaries, in the theca cell layers of all sized follicles of sexually mature chicken ovaries. Furthermore, we identified a positive element (positions – 1863 to – 1036) controlling chicken MMP 13 transcription, and, in this region, six single nucleotide polymorphisms were found and genotyped in chicken populations. In the White Recessive Rock <b>population,</b> <b>hens</b> with A– 1356 -C– 1079 /A– 1356 -C– 1079 genotype had earlier “age at first laying” than those with G– 1356 -T– 1079 /G– 1356 -T– 1079 genotype (P <  0. 05), and exhibited significantly lower transcriptional activity (P <  0. 01). Collectively, chicken MMP 13 {{plays an important role in}} ovarian follicle growth and regression, and polymorphisms in its promoter region could be used as molecular markers for improving the trait “age at first laying” in chicken breeding...|$|R
40|$|As governments {{pledge to}} combat climate change, wind {{turbines}} {{are becoming a}} common feature of terrestrial and marine environments. Although wind power is a renewable energy source and a means of reducing carbon emissions, {{there is a need}} to ensure that the wind farms themselves do not damage the environment. There is particular concern over the impacts of wind farms on bird populations. In this thesis I have explored how to assess the cumulative impacts of wind farms on birds. Cumulative impact assessment is a legislative requirement of environmental impact assessment but too frequently it has been tacked on to the end of assessments as an afterthought. Reasons for this are numerous but a recurring theme is the lack of clear definitions and guidance on how to perform cumulative assessments. Therefore I developed a conceptual framework to promote transparency. The core concept is that explicit definitions of impacts, actions and scales of assessment are required to reduce uncertainty in the process of assessment and improve communication between stakeholders. Only when it is clear what has been included within a cumulative assessment, is it possible to start to make comparisons between developments. I also recommend a more strategic approach to cumulative impact assessment. If birds avoid wind farms then the structures act as barriers to movement and birds must fly further to reach their destination. If the additional distance has an associated energetic cost then this will impact an individual. With data collected using surveillance radar, I investigated the impact of the Nysted offshore wind farm on a population of common eider Somateria mollissima migrating from Finland to the Wadden Sea. The impacts of the wind farm appeared trivial and it required 100 equivalent wind farms before a significant impact was detected. Using the same radar data I also constructed a model to quantify the movement process of birds in response to wind turbines and therefore provide wind farm developers with a useful tool to predict the impacts of different wind farm designs. The impacts of wind farms may be greater for birds that interact with the turbines on a daily basis than for migrating individuals. Using an energetic modelling approach I explored the impact for a suite of breeding seabirds commuting past a wind farm between their breeding and feeding areas. Impacts of flying increasing distances associated with increasing numbers of wind turbines were species-specific and costs were highest for species with high wing loadings and high daily frequency of foraging flights. However, costs of extra flight to avoid a wind farm appear much less than those imposed by low food abundance or adverse weather conditions. Finally, a spatially-explicit individual-based model was developed to assess cumulative impacts of wind turbines through collision mortality and direct and indirect habitat loss, on a <b>population</b> of <b>hen</b> harriers Circus cyaneus on Orkney. Increasing numbers of wind turbines caused declines in the <b>hen</b> harrier <b>population</b> but the population response varied according to where turbines were located. Therefore, although wind turbines impact hen harriers, it may be possible to reduce the effects by considering hen harrier ecology during the planning procedure and/or implementing mitigating measures such as rough grassland restoration in strategic locations away from turbines. ...|$|R
