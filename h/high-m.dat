Some {{researchers}} believe that alginates with <b>high-M</b> content could produce an inflammatory response and an abnormal cell growth while some have demonstrated that alginate with high-G content lead to an even higher cell overgrowth and inflammatory reaction in vivo as compared to intermediate-G alginates.Even ultrapure alginates may contain endotoxins, and polyphenols which could compromise the biocompatibility of the resultant cell microcapsules. It {{has been shown that}} even though purification processes successfully lower endotoxin and polyphenol content in the processed alginate, it is difficult to lower the protein content and the purification processes could in turn modify the properties of the biomaterial. Thus it is essential that an effective purification process is designed so as to remove all the contaminants from alginate before it can be successfully used in clinical applications.|$|E

Epigenetic changes can be pharmacologically reverted; therefore, identification of groups of patients with specific epigenomic alterations might have therapeutic relevance. Here we integrated genome-wide DNA-promoter methylation profiling with gene expression profiling, and clinical and biological variables. An unsupervised clustering analysis of a test series of 98 samples identified 2 clusters with different degrees of promoter methylation. The cluster comprising samples with higher-promoter methylation (<b>High-M)</b> had a poorer overall survival compared with the lower (Low-M) cluster. The prognostic relevance of the <b>High-M</b> phenotype was confirmed in an independent validation set of 36 patients. In the whole series, the <b>High-M</b> phenotype was associated with IGHV 1 - 02 usage, mutations of NOTCH 2 gene, 7 q 31 - 32 loss, and histologic transformation. In the <b>High-M</b> set, a number of tumor-suppressor genes were methylated and repressed. PRC 2 subunit genes and several prosurvival lymphoma genes were unmethylated and overexpressed. A model based on the methylation of 3 genes (CACNB 2, HTRA 1, KLF 4) identified a poorer-outcome patient subset.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{evolution of}} resistive double tearing modes (DTMs) with safety factor values q= 1 and q= 3 is studied in a reduced cylindrical {{model of a}} tokamak plasma. We focus on cases where the resonant surfaces are a small distance apart. Recent numerical {{studies have shown that}} in such configurations <b>high-m</b> modes are strongly unstable. In this paper, it is first demonstrated that linear DTM theory predicts the dominance of <b>high-m</b> DTMs. A semi-empirical formula for estimating the poloidal mode number of the fastest growing mode, m_peak, is obtained from the existing linear theory. Second, using nonlinear simulations, it is shown that the presence of fast growing <b>high-m</b> modes leads to a rapid turbulent collapse in an annular region, whereby small magnetic island structures form. Furthermore, consideration is given to the evolution of low-m modes, in particular the global m= 1 internal kink, which can undergo nonlinear driving through coupling to fast growing linear <b>high-m</b> DTMs. Factors influencing the details of the dynamics are discussed. These results may be relevant for the understanding of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) activity near the minimum of q and may thus be of interest to studies concerned with stability and confinement in advanced tokamaks.

Based on fluency-attribution accounts, which posit that familiarity can {{be driven by}} multiple forms of fluency, the relationship between masked priming-induced fluency and familiarity was investigated. We classified pictographic characters into High-Meaningfulness (<b>High-M)</b> and Low-Meaningfulness (Low-M) categories {{on the basis of}} subjective meaningfulness ratings and identified the distinct electrophysiological correlates of perceptual and conceptual fluency. The two types of fluency differed in associated ERP effects: 150 - 250 ms effects for perceptual fluency and FN 400 effects for conceptual fluency. The ERPs of Low-M MP-same (items that were preceded by matching masked items) false alarms were more positive than correct rejections during 150 - 250 ms, whereas the ERPs of <b>High-M</b> MP-same false alarms were more positive than correct rejections during 300 - 500 ms. The topographic patterns of FN 400 effects between <b>High-M</b> MP-same false alarms and Low-M MP-same false alarms were not different from those of <b>High-M</b> hits and Low-M hits. These results indicate that both forms of fluency can contribute to familiarity, and the neural correlates of conceptual fluency are not different from those of conceptual priming induced by prior study-phase exposure.

40|$|In {{magnetic}} configurations {{with two}} or three q= 1 (with q being the safety factor) resonant surfaces in a tokamak plasma, resistive magnetohydrodynamic modes with poloidal mode numbers m much larger than 1 are found to be linearly unstable.

40|$|Alginate is {{a popular}} {{candidate}} for encapsulation of cells due {{to the formation of}} gels with divalent ions under physiological conditions. Stable alginate gels can be formed by the selection of alginates with a high content of guluronic acid (G) and gelling in a mixture of calcium and barium. These alginate gels have been proposed as immune protective barriers for the transplantation of human pancreatic islets (insulin producing cells) for the treatment of type 1 diabetes where the alginate gel protects the transplant from the host immune system. Microencapsulation can thus provide a way to overcome the need for immunosuppressive drugs. Although showing promising results in animal models, there are potential limitations of the Ca 2 +/Ba 2 +-beads concerning growth of host cells on the surface of capsules in primate models. Development of coating strategies for alginate based capsules could thus be beneficial for reducing the attachment of host cells. Alginate microbeads/capsules were formed by electrostatic bead generator producing beads of 400 &# 181;m. Afterward, the alginate beads were coated by fluoresceinamine labeled alginate that was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and quantified by fluorescent spectroscopy. The binding of coating alginate to alginate-poly-L-lysine (PLL) capsules was also studied. In this project, in the optimalisation of coating of alginate beads some parameters were studies such as concentration of coating alginate, different gelling ions both for core and coating alginate, exposure time for gelling solution for fixation of coating layer and different washing solution. The long-term stability of coating layer of coated alginate beads was determined by measuring the fluorescent intensity of fluorescently labeled of coating alginate during a period of forty nine days. A stability study of alginate-alginate capsules revealed that Ca 2 +/Ba 2 + alginate coated with high-G alginate and washed with saline and used Ca 2 + and Ba 2 + with ratio 50 : 1 for fixation of coating layer were more stable coating than other capsules. The alginate beads coated with <b>high-M</b> or epimerized alginate were produced. It shows higher intensity of coating layer in both capsules coated with <b>high-M</b> or epimerized alginate than alginate beads coated with high-G alginate. In continue of the study, the alginate-PLL capsules were coated with high-G, <b>high-M,</b> and epimerized and sulfated alginate. Alginate-PLL capsules coated with high-G, <b>high-M</b> and epimerized alginate shows no detective signal by confocal images and sulfated alginate coating shows some signal of coating. The stability of coating for alginate-PLL-alginate capsules and alginate beads coated with epimerized or <b>high-M</b> alginate revealed that both kind of coating have high-stability over one week screening. Three dimensional images of capsules, in confocal microscope, both epimerized and <b>high-M</b> coating alginates cover whole of capsules.

In this study, we show that several well-defined polysaccharides, including polymers with different sizes of beta 1 - 4 -linked D-mannuronic acid (poly-M, <b>high-M</b> alginate, and M-blocks) and cellulose oxidized in the C- 6 position, induced human monocytes to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Poly-M was the most efficient polysaccharide tested and, on a weight basis, was approximately as efficient as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. TNF-alpha production was shown to depend strongly on the molecular weights of poly-M and <b>high-M</b> alginate, with maximal TNF-alpha production occurring at molecular weights above 50, 000 and 200, 000, respectively. G-blocks, alpha 1 - 4 -linked L-guluronic acid polymers that did not induce cytokine production from monocytes, reduced the cytokine production induced by the beta 1 - 4 -linked polyuronic acids and LPS. Furthermore, both G-blocks and LPS were found to inhibit the binding of poly-M to monocytes, as measured by flow cytometry. In addition, we found that the binding of LPS to monocytes was inhibited by G-blocks, M-blocks, and poly-M.

30|$|The {{principal}} transverse harmonic of the resonator must {{be close}} to the Gaussian function, which offers a satisfactory explanation of the radial shape of the Pgs wave field. However, if the resonator is excited by some external source, its structure must be the superposition of all transverse harmonics. In order to explain the amplitude modulation it is sufficient to suppose that the resonator is excited by some non-stationary process. Both the non-stationary sources considered lead to similar temporal structures of the oscillation shown in Figs. 6 and 8.

Oral administration of immuno-stimulants from 6 wpf resulted in decreased WCI 12 (+) (B) cell percentages in PBL (only after administration of LPS) and head kidney (all test groups), and a decreased total IgM level in plasma, suggesting that suppressive effects are strongly indicative of oral or juvenile tolerance.

40|$|The linear {{instability}} {{characteristics and}} nonlinear dynamics of collisional (resistive) and collisionless (electron inertia) double tearing modes (DTMs) are compared using a reduced cylindrical {{model of a}} tokamak plasma. We focus on cases where two q = 2 resonant surfaces are located a small distance apart. It is found that regardless of the magnetic reconnection mechanism, resistivity or electron inertia, the dominant modes are those with high poloidal mode numbers m ~ 10. However, the collisionless case tends to have a significantly broader spectrum of unstable modes. In the nonlinear regime, it is shown that {{in both cases the}} fast growing <b>high-m</b> DTMs lead to a turbulent collapse in an annular region, whereat small magnetic island structures are formed. In addition, collisionless DTMs exhibit multiple reconnection cycles due to reversibility and strong ExB flows. Collisionless reconnection leads to a saturated stable state, while in the collisional case resistive decay keeps the system weakly dynamic by driving it back towards the unstable equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|Secreted and transmembrane mucins are {{important}} components of innate defence at the body's mucosal surfaces. The secreted mucins are large, polymeric glycoproteins, which are {{largely responsible for}} the gel-like properties of mucus secretions. The cell-tethered mucins, however, are monomeric but are typically composed of two subunits, a larger extracellular subunit which is heavily glycosylated while the smaller more sparsely glycosylated subunit has a short extracellular region, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. These two families of mucins represent high-molecular-weight glycoproteins containing serine and threonine-rich domains that are the attachment sites for large numbers of O-glycans. The <b>high-M</b> (r) and high sugar content have been exploited for the separation of mucins from the majority of components in mucus secretions. In this chapter, we describe current and well-established methods (caesium chloride density-gradient centrifugation, gel-filtration and anion-exchange chromatography, and agarose gel electrophoresis) for the extraction and purification of gel-forming and cell-surface mucins which can subsequently be used for a variety of structural and functional studies...|$|E
40|$|Microcapsules of {{alginate}} cross-linked with divalent ions are {{the most}} common system for cell immobilization. In this study, we wanted to characterize the effect of different alginates and cross-linking ions on important microcapsule properties. The dimensional stability and gel strength increased for high-G alginate gels when exchanging the traditional Ca 2 + ions with Ba 2 +. The use of Ba 2 + decreased the size of alginate beads and reduced the permeability to immunoglobulin G. Strontium gave gels with characteristics lying between calcium and barium. Interestingly, <b>high-M</b> alginate showed an opposite behavior in combination with barium and strontium as these beads were larger than beads of calcium−alginate and tended to swell more, also resulting in increased permeability. Binding studies revealed that different block structures in the alginate bind the ions to a different extent. More specifically, Ca 2 + was found to bind to G- and MG-blocks, Ba 2 + to G- and M-blocks, and Sr 2 + to G-blocks solely...|$|E
40|$|A self-consistent {{model of}} the {{multiscale}} interaction of zonal flows (ZFs), zonal fields (ZFLDs) and geodesic acoustic mode (GAMs) with edge turbulence is presented. In the collisionless and collisional regimes, the dominant short scale modes in the background {{at the edge of}} tokamak plasmas are electrostatic ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode and electromagnetic <b>high-m</b> drift-resistive-ballooning mode (DRBM), respectively. The modulational instability of ZFs, ZFLDs, and GAMs in the background of ITG and DRBM driven turbulence has been studied. The kinetic wave equation is used to study the adiabatic interaction between long-scale ZFs, ZFLDs and GAMs, and the small-scale background turbulence (DRBM, ITG). We have also determined conditions under which ZFs saturate by different mechanics such as by (i) collisional damping (ii) instability to tertiary modes (iii) nonlinear trapping of ITG mode turbulence in ZFs, giving coherent structures etc. From a ‘predator-prey ’ model, the turbulent transport in a collisional edge (Low-confinement regime) has been estimated. We have also derived the condition for density limit from the threshold of the tertiary modes. The dependence of critical density...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} semi-analytic model for low (L) to high (H) mode {{transition}} power threshold (P th). Two main assumptions {{are made in}} our study. First, high poloidal mode number drift resistive ballooning modes (<b>high-m</b> DRBM) {{are assumed to be}} the dominant turbulence driver in a narrow edge region near to last closed flux surface. Second, the pre-transition edge profile and turbulent diffusivity at the narrow edge region pertain to turbulent equipartition. An edge power balance relation is derived by calculating the dissipated power flux through both turbulent conduction and convection, and radiation in the edge region. P th is obtained by imposing the turbulence quench rule due to sheared E × B rotation. Evaluation of P th shows a good agreement with experimental results in existing machines. Increase of P th at low density (i. e., the existence of roll-over density in P th vs. density) is shown to originate from the longer scale length of the density profile than that of the temperature profile. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
