50|$|Ranges for <b>fictitious</b> {{telephone}} <b>numbers</b> {{are common}} in most telephone numbering plans. One {{of the main reasons}} these ranges exist is to avoid accidentally using real phone numbers in movies and television programs because viewers frequently call the numbers used. In North America, the area served by the NANPA system of area codes, <b>fictitious</b> telephone <b>numbers</b> are usually of the form (XXX) 555-xxxx. The use of 555 numbers in fiction, however, led a desire to assign some of them in the real world, {{and some of them are}} no longer available for use in fiction.

50|$|Channel Umptee-3 (also known {{simply as}} Umptee-3) is a Saturday morning {{animated}} television series created by Jim George and produced by Norman Lear that aired on The WB in 1997.

This one-season cartoon show was designed to teach kids to appreciate the wonders of everyday things, such as sleep and water.

40|$|District heating {{networks}} are very common energy systems {{all over the}} world but only few studies have been carried out to assess their performances through quality indicators. These indicators express district heating performances through different points of view. Four ones are developed in this study: energy sources, efficiencies, heat delivering equipments characteristics and environmental efficiency as a sum up. First, the only energy indicator generally used is the primary energy factor (PEF), which quantifies the primary energy use of a device. However it does not give a complete insight of the whole energy use of district heating networks. Two other parameters have to be stated for this purpose: primary energy efficiency and the energy share. Second, district heating efficiencies are generally not been taken into account unless sometimes the only amount of heat losses. A first indicator is defined to quantify networks heat losses relatively to the amount of heat delivered to customers. To take heat plant efficiencies into account, a more global indicator is defined. Its definition is close to a seasonal efficiency and it permits comparisons with other heating systems. Third, indicators have been defined for heat plants equipments. Their aim is to permit stakeholders to check networks management of district heating companies. Two indicators are defined: one measures subscripted power relatively to network length and the other one represents the <b>fictitious</b> <b>number</b> of plants working hours while maximum plants power was delivered all the year. Finally, environmental efficiency is stated. This analysis can include different aspects: green house gas emissions, water use and other pollutants emissions. For both design and management of district heating networks, an indicator representing CO 2 emissions appears to be the most suitable one. Expressed relatively to delivered energy, it {{can be seen as a}} sum up of previous indicators because result of bad performances increases these emissions. In this paper, these eight indicators are defined and their use is highlighted by a comparison of four different Finnish district heating networks. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the 18 th-century {{calculus}} {{the classical}} notion of quantity was understood as general quantity, which was expressed analytically and {{was subject to}} formal manipulation. Number was understood as the measure of quantity; however, only fractions and natural numbers were considered numbers in the true sense of term. The other types of <b>numbers</b> were <b>fictitious</b> entities, namely ideal entities firmly founded {{in the real world}} which could be operated upon as if they were numbers. In this context Eulerian infinitesimals should also be considered as <b>fictitious</b> <b>numbers.</b> They were symbols that represented a primordial and intuitive idea of limit, although they were manipulated {{in the same way as}} numbers.

40|$|When young {{children}} attempt {{to locate the}} positions of numerals on a number line, the positions are often logarithmically rather than linearly distributed. This finding has been taken {{as evidence that the}} children represent numbers on a mental number line that is logarithmically calibrated. This article reports a statistical simulation showing that log-like positioning is a consequence of 2 factors: the bounded nature of the number line and greater uncertainty about the meaning of the larger, less frequent number words. Two experiments likewise show that even college students produce log-like placements under the same 2 conditions. In Experiment 1, participants identified positions on a number line for a set that included both conventional and <b>fictitious</b> <b>numbers</b> (e. g., a zillion).
