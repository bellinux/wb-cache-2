25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{has three}} sites for tRNA to bind. They are the aminoacyl site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P) and the exit site (abbreviated E). With {{respect to the}} mRNA, the three sites are oriented 5’ to 3’ E-P-A, because ribosomes move toward the 3' end of mRNA. The A site binds the incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. The P site holds the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain. The <b>E</b> <b>site</b> holds the tRNA without its amino acid. When an aminoacyl-tRNA initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, {{it is in the}} A site. Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site and the amino acid of the charged tRNA in the P site. The growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA in the P site, now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in the A site, now charged with the polypeptide chain, is moved to the P site. The tRNA in the <b>E</b> <b>site</b> leaves and another aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site to repeat the process.|$|E
25|$|The small ribosomal subunit, {{typically}} {{bound to}} an aminoacyl-tRNA containing the amino acid methionine, binds to an AUG codon on the mRNA and recruits the large ribosomal subunit. The ribosome contains three RNA binding sites, designated A, P and E. The A site binds an aminoacyl-tRNA; the P site binds a peptidyl-tRNA (a tRNA {{bound to the}} peptide being synthesized); and the <b>E</b> <b>site</b> binds a free tRNA before it exits the ribosome. Protein synthesis begins at a start codon AUG near the 5' end of the mRNA. mRNA binds to the P site of the ribosome first.

40|$|In Escherichia coli B/r Her+ {{irradiated}} {{with two}} separate fluences, dimer excision is prematurely interrupted. The {{present study was}} designed to follow tha fate of dimers remaining unexcised. The results imply that these dimers (or distortions containing dimers) are transformed on replication from the state of sensitivity to the state of insensitivity to endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus. This conclusion is based on the following findings: (a) dimers were radiochromatographically detectable in DNA replicated after UV, which indicated that they were tolerated on replication. (b) Similar amounts of dimers were detected radiochromatographically both in DNA remaining unreplicated and DNA twice replicated after UV, This along with the low transfer of parental label into daughter DNA, indicated that dimers remained in situ in parental chains. (c) Immediately after UV, all parental DNA contained numerous sites sensitive to the extract from M. luteus. 2 h after UV, a portion of parental DNA still contained a number of endonuclease-sensitive (<b>Es)</b> <b>sites,</b> while another portion of parental DNA and all daughter DNA were free of <b>Es</b> <b>sites.</b> (d) The occurrence of parental DNA free of <b>Es</b> <b>sites</b> was not temporally correlated with dimer excision, but with the first round of DNA replication.

40|$|Determining the {{mechanism}} by which transfer RNAs (tRNAs) rapidly and precisely transit through the ribosomal A, P and <b>E</b> <b>sites</b> during translation remains a major goal {{in the study of}} protein synthesis. Here, we report the real-time dynamics of the L 1 stalk, a structural element of the large ribosomal subunit that is implicated in directing tRNA movements during translation. Within pre-translocation ribosomal complexes, the L 1 stalk exists in a dynamic equilibrium between open and closed conformations. Binding of elongation factor G (EF-G) shifts this equilibrium towards the closed conformation through one of at least two distinct kinetic mechanisms, where the identity of the P-site tRNA dictates the kinetic route that is taken. Within post-translocation complexes, L 1 stalk dynamics are dependent on the presence and identity of the E-site tRNA. Collectively, our data demonstrate that EF-G and the L 1 stalk allosterically collaborate to direct tRNA translocation from the P to the <b>E</b> <b>sites,</b> and suggest a model for the release of E-site tRNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of Australian plantation-grown Eucalyptus globulus and E. nitens into rotary veneer {{was shown to}} produce acceptable recoveries.

For fast and accurate recognition of the appropriate tRNA, the ribosome utilizes large conformational changes (conformational proofreading) [...] Now the P site contains {{the beginning of the}} peptide chain of the protein to be encoded and the A site has the next amino acid {{to be added to the}} peptide chain. The growing polypeptide connected to the tRNA in the P site is detached from the tRNA in the P site and a peptide bond is formed between the last amino acids of the polypeptide and the amino acid still attached to the tRNA in the A site. This process, known as peptide bond formation, is catalyzed by a ribozyme (the 23S ribosomal RNA in the 50S ribosomal subunit). Now, the A site has the newly formed peptide, while the P site has an uncharged tRNA (tRNA with no amino acids). The newly formed peptide in the A site tRNA is known as dipeptide and the whole assembly is called dipeptidyl-tRNA. The tRNA in the P site minus the amino acid is known to be deacylated. In the final stage of elongation, called translocation, the deacylated tRNA (in the P site) and the dipeptidyl-tRNA (in the A site) along with its corresponding codons move to the E and P sites, respectively, and a new codon moves into the A site.
