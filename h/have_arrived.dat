5|$|Puerto Rico's herpetofauna {{consists}} of 25 amphibian species and 61 reptile species. The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade {{is believed to}} <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> by flotsam dispersion from South America. Little evidence exists to support the alternative hypothesis of proto-Antillean vicariance. Other terrestrial herpetofauna are believed to <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> to the West Indies (and Puerto Rico) by the same method and subsequently undergone vicarization by banks or islands. As a result, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in general, {{has one of the}} highest percentages of endemism among amphibians and reptiles in the world. Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families: Bufonidae (2 species), Hylidae (3), Leptodactylidae (18) and Ranidae (2). Reptiles include turtles (freshwater and marine), lizards, worm lizards, snakes and a caiman.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, the {{ancestor}} of Oryzomys peninsulae may <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> by rafting {{during the late}} Miocene, about six million years ago, when {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California peninsula was an island located near what is now Nayarit and Jalisco in western Mexico. Some plants and birds from the area may have a similar biogeographic heritage.|$|E

Just as the Boss is informed, the invasion begins, spearheaded by the alien warlord Zinyak, who captures the entire cabinet, including the Boss.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses bring {{captured}} prey {{back to the}} den {{where they}} can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share the den with the octopus, either because they <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> as scavengers, or because they have survived capture.|$|E
5|$|Presumably Romanus came to England with Augustine of Canterbury's {{mission to}} Kent, He would <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> either in 597 {{with the first}} group of missionaries, or in 601 with the second group.

5|$|Probably the {{earliest}} horses with Arabian bloodlines to enter Europe came indirectly, through Spain and France. Others would <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> with returning Crusaders—beginning in 1095, European armies invaded Palestine and many knights returned home with Arabian horses as spoils of war. Later, as knights and the heavy, armored war horses who carried them became obsolete, Arabian horses {{and their descendants}} were used to develop faster, agile light cavalry horses {{that were used in}} warfare into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> in Fiji in 1925 on Ono-i-lau and Vatoa islands. It may have colonised from New Zealand via Raoul in the Kermadec Islands {{where it is}} abundant, that group being roughly equidistant between New Zealand and Fiji. Its spread in Fiji has been limited, and there are doubts about the population's viability. Tonga was colonised {{at about the same}} date and the birds there have been slowly spreading north through the group.|$|E
5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet.

While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would <b>have</b> <b>arrived.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already <b>have</b> <b>arrived.</b> In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|As far as {{documented}} {{evidence is}} concerned, genealogies attest {{that many of}} the predecessors of those living in the communities today originally came from the town of Loon on Bohol’s western coast; Mariano Datahan is reported to <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> at the site of present-day Biabas {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century; The Philippine Independent Church in Biabas was established in 1902; Datahan wrote a letter to President Manuel Quezon in 1937; and the resistance hero Col. Esteban Bernido records a meeting with Datahan in Biabas in 1944. A project to document the history of the Eskaya community via the Eskayan language is presently being undertaken at The Australian National University.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{decision}} was made to establish a harbour (now the second largest in Denmark) at Esbjerg in 1868, the area consisted of only a few farms. Esbjerg developed quickly with the population rising to 13,000 by 1901 and 70,000 by 1970. In addition to its fishing and shipping activities, it also became an important centre for agricultural exports. Over the years, many of the city's visitors <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> by ferry from Harwich, Essex, England, but this service closed in September 2014 having run since 1875. The harbour facilities are being expanded to answer the needs of the wind-turbine industry and container shipping traffic. Esbjerg is served by Esbjerg Airport with flights to Aberdeen, Scotland and Stavanger, Norway.|$|E

5|$|Glastonbury {{has been}} {{described}} as a New Age community which attracts people with New Age and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.|$|E
5|$|How the Phylloxera aphid was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration {{of the possibility of}} the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon {{suggested}} that Sturnus-like species could <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> in Africa, and {{given rise to}} the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> in Glastonbury by boat {{over the}} flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} he stuck his staff {{into the ground and}} it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Leguat {{mentioned}} that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This {{may be the}} reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could <b>have</b> <b>arrived</b> in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets {{would have been the}} last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist Alexandre Guy Pingré visited Rodrigues during the French 1761 Transit of Venus expedition.|$|E
