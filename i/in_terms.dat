It is necessary to realize detection and classification processes and systems for water quality analysis. The important direction is to lead to uncomplicated understanding for public utilization. This paper presents the river Sensing Processing Actuation processes (rSPA) for determination and classification of multiple-water- parameters in Chaophraya river. According to rSPA processes of multiple-water-quality-parameters, we find the pollutants of conductivity, salinity and total dissolved solid (TDS), which are accumulated from upstream to downstream. In several spots of the river, we have analyzed water quality in a maximum value of pollutants <b>in</b> <b>term</b> of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP).
