The {{interaction}} of water hyacinth area with growth {{is known to}} be strongly influenced by area size, but {{little is known about the}} interdependent role that size and time have on dynamic estimation of water hyacinth area. We report on the fusion of specially designed, satellite and GPS sensor data into area growth model as a function of area and time. We employ a multi-sensor fusion technique that is able to generate uniform data of <b>fitting</b> <b>area</b> growth model with complete control of area and time. Evidence of an overall Goodness of Fit Index of 0. 9753 was obtained by using conventional statistic analysis.

40|$|Processing {{of nuclear}} {{medicine}} images is generally performed by essentially linear methods with the non-negativity condition being applied {{as the only}} non-linear process. The various methods used: matrix methods in signal space and Fourier or Hadamard transforms in frequency or sequency space are essentially equivalent. Further improvement in images {{can be obtained by}} the use of inherently non-linear methods. The recent development of an approximation to a least-difference method (as opposed to a least-square method) has led to an appreciation of the effects of data bounding and {{to the development of a}} more powerful process. Data bounding (modification of statistically improbable data values) is an inherently non-linear method with considerable promise. Strong bounding depending on two-dimensional least-squares fitting yields a reduction of mottling (buttermilk effect) not attainable with linear processes. A pre- bounding process removing very bad points is used to protect the strong bounding process from incorrectly modifying data points due to the weight of an extreme but yet unbounded point as the <b>fitting</b> <b>area</b> approaches it.

40|$|Background: Loss {{of teeth}} affects the individual's health. Many factors {{determine}} {{the need to}} wear a removable dental prosthesis. Due to nature of design, age and lack of awareness, prosthesis often are neglected to maintain in an aseptic condition leading to microbial contamination. This provided an impetus {{for the present study}} with the aim of determining the microbial contamination of removable dental prosthesis. Methodology: Total, 45 patients wearing removable dental prosthesis were randomly selected. Patients were divided into three groups as per duration of usage since 1 month, 6 month and ≥ 1 year. Sterile cotton swab moistened with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was used to collect swab from the <b>fitting</b> <b>areas</b> of prosthesis. Swab samples was inserted immediately into the sterile tube containing 1 ml of PBS solution, 10 μl PBS is inoculated on the blood agar and MacConkey agar plates using spread plate technique. Samples were cultured and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Calibrated microbiologist isolated, identified and counted microorganisms using colony counter. Depending on the nature of data, statistical analysis was done applying Kruskal–Wallis test, Mann–Whitney U-test and Chi-square test. Result: Streptococcus species and Staphylococcus aureus were the common microorganisms isolated in all three groups and was statistically significant at P< 0. 05. Candida albicans, Diptheroid, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus species were isolated from Group II and Group III. Conclusion: There is a linear increase in microbial contamination of removable dental prosthesis as the duration of usage increases and might increase the susceptibility of individuals' to many diseases...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{catalogue}} of photometric and structural properties of 228 nuclear star clusters (NSCs) in nearby late-type disk galaxies. These new measurements are derived from a homogeneous analysis of all suitable WFPC 2 images in the HST archive. The luminosity and size of each NSC is derived from an iterative PSF-fitting technique, which adapts the <b>fitting</b> <b>area</b> to the effective radius (r_ eff) of the NSC, and uses a WFPC 2 -specific PSF model tailored {{to the position of}} each NSC on the detector. The luminosities of NSCs are ≤ 10 ^ 8 L_ V,, and their integrated optical colours suggest a wide spread in age. We confirm that most NSCs have sizes similar to Globular Clusters (GCs), but find that the largest and brightest NSCs occupy the regime between Ultra Compact Dwarf (UCD) and the nuclei of early-type galaxies in the size-luminosity plane. The overlap in size, mass, and colour between the different incarnations of compact stellar systems provides a support for the notion that at least some UCDs and the most massive Galactic GCs, may be remnant nuclei of disrupted disk galaxies. We find tentative evidence for the NSCs' r_ eff to be smaller when measured in bluer filters, and discuss possible implications of this result. We also highlight a few examples of complex nuclear morphologies, including double nuclei, extended stellar structures, and nuclear F 606 W excess from either recent (circum-) nuclear star formation and/or a weak AGN. Such examples may serve as case studies for ongoing NSC evolution via the two main suggested mechanisms, namely cluster merging and in situ star formation.

40|$|AbstractGolf club fitting is {{becoming}} a more and more precise science. In the last 10 years, {{a number of different}} devices have become available to club fitters for measuring either the flight of the golf ball (e. g. Trackman™ and Flightscope® radar devices) or just the initial launch conditions (e. g. Vector Pro™ and 3 Trak® camera devices, Golf AchieverTM laser device). In 2008, PING released the nFlight® fitting software to tie in with any of these devices, capture data, digitally analyze and scientifically compare every aspect of every shot taken by a golfer to provide the best possible golf club fitting. One challenge arising from this approach was how to account for large differences in golf ball construction and performance, both in the initial launch conditions immediately after impact and the resultant ball flight. In particular, many golf courses use various kinds of range balls in practice and <b>fitting</b> <b>areas.</b> To conduct a golf club fitting using data derived from these balls could be misleading and result in inappropriate club choices. For example, a driver fitting using an exceptionally high spin ball could result in a low loft and stiff shaft being chosen to minimize the spin rate when actually the high spin is {{due to the nature of}} the ball used in the fitting rather than aspects of the golfer’s swing. To account for these differences and ensure accurate data from a golf club fitting, the nFlight® fitting software provides a way to convert launch data from one category of golf ball into another. So far over 60 different brands of ball have been subjected to static, robot and player comparison testing including at least 1500 shots hit by Ping Man, PING’s robotic testing machine. A cluster analysis was used to group similar golf balls into various categories and C# code in the nFlight® fitting software was used to manage the data conversion. The poster describes the testing conducted, the methods behind the cluster analysis and the patent-pending nFlight® fitting software application of the data conversion...|$|R

When the load is inserted, a rather flat attenuation level (S 21) is observed over the whole range, it spanning from - 9 dB to - 6 dB as the frequency increases. On the other hand, when shorted, the module exhibits a loss (S 21) better than - 1. 4 dB up to 50 GHz. The discussed basic module can then be exploited as building block to implement more complex RF signal conditioning functions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} Hierarchical D-NURBS {{as a new}} shape {{modeling}} representation that generalizes powerful, physics-based D-NURBS for interactive geometric design. Our Hierarchical D-NURBS {{can be viewed as}} a collection of standard D-NURBS finite elements, organized hierarchically in a tree structure and subject to continuity constraints across the shared boundaries of adjacent D-NURBS elements at different levels. Hierarchical D-NURBS are amenable to the flexible and powerful representation of curves, surfaces, as well as higher dimensional geometric entities. The layered and composite construction of Hierarchical D-NURBS affords users the effective creation of local features and their flexible, global/local control at different level of details. Within the framework of Hierarchical D-NURBS, users can interactively sculpt NURBS geometry more intuitively and conveniently through both global and local toolkits.
