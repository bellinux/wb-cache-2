40|$|Keywords:GIS; {{emergency}} evacuation; large building; visual simulation Abstract. To {{meet the}} requirements of emergency evacuation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building, this paper introduces design and implementation of emergency evacuation simulation model <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building based on GIS in detail. Firstly, three-tire architecture and functions of the simulation model are designed in the paper. Secondly, the key technologies of the model are emphasized. The base data of the model is the internal design map of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hotel and the urban electronic map. The spatial analysis function of GIS is used to determine evacuation analysis of emergencies and disasters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building and achieve the optimal emergency evacuation plan for crowd. Research results showed the model improves the simulation precision and can provide effective service for emergency evacuation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building...|$|R
