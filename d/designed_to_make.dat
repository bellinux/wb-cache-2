5|$|An {{example of}} a seductive detail in a {{training}} context might be a training class that includes cartoons on slides containing tips for effective supervision. Although not necessarily relevant to the topic, the cartoons are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the training material more interesting, but the results of multiple studies suggest that their inclusion will harm recall from the primary training content.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Albert Bridge was rewired {{and painted}} {{in an unusual}} colour scheme <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it more {{conspicuous}} in poor visibility, and avoid being damaged by ships.

5|$|A {{weekend edition}} titled Super Sloppy Double Dare began taping in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, {{with an initial}} 26-episode run. Super Sloppy Double Dare {{featured}} gameplay {{identical to the original}} format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged to send in a postcard with their contact information and could win a prize if their card was selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of Super Sloppy Double Dare were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV.|$|E

5|$|In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, players {{select a}} team of three {{characters}} to engage in combat and attempt to knock out their opponents. It features similar tag team game mechanics to earlier games in the series, along with new methods of play <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the game more accessible to new players. The game was produced by Ryota Niitsuma, who had previously worked on , which utilizes the same simplified three-button attack system.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{it more difficult to}} interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E

5|$|Stelmach {{clashed with}} rural landowners again in 2009 when his {{government}} introduced the Land Assembly Project Area Act, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{it easier for}} the government to acquire large blocks of land for public purposes such as ring roads or reservoirs. The Act allowed the government to identify land that it may be interested in expropriating {{at some point in the}} future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E
5|$|The 189th Infantry Brigade was {{activated}} {{once again}} on 1 December 2006 at Fort Bragg. This was done by reflagging the 4th Brigade, 78th Division back to the 189th Infantry Brigade. The reflagging was {{just one part of}} the overall streamlining of the First Army from five training support Divisions commanding 16 divisional brigades to two larger regions commanding 16 separate brigades. The process was also <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> identification of the brigades easier. It was assigned to Division East of the First Army. Division East contains eight training brigades with responsibilities for the entire region east of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder {{was built}} for {{commercial}} freight, and although the volume carried has dropped significantly, particularly since coal deliveries to Ferrybridge power station by canal stopped, the navigation still carried 300,000 tonnes of freight in 2007, down from 1.64 million tonnes in 2000. The Leeds to Castleford section {{and much of the}} Wakefield branch are now mainly used as leisure routes, but below Castleford, the industrial nature of the waterway is more obvious, and pleasure boats must give way to commercial vessels. 600 tonne vessels, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> maximum use of the locks, produce considerable wash, and are not as manoeuvrable as a narrow boat.|$|E

5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} year's {{film about}} nude dancers, Showgirls, was generally disliked, so filmmakers feared audiences would pre-judge Striptease on this basis. To avoid any association, advertisements were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Striptease look more comedic than Showgirls, {{which was a}} drama. Besides the subject matter, Striptease and Showgirls did have two notable connections. The choreography in these films was by the same person, Marguerite Derricks. Both also featured performances by Rena Riffel, who plays a dancer in each. To promote the film, Moore appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and a Barbara Walters special. In both cases, she danced or otherwise exhibited her body.|$|E
5|$|The recruits' {{indoctrination}} {{period at}} Palm Beach was six weeks. It covered instruction on subjects such as: activities, organization, personnel, current events, and social hygiene. The physical education aspects consisted of: body mechanics, swimming, games, and drill. Another {{important part of}} recruit training was the testing, classification, and selection process. This was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{the most of the}} recruit's abilities, background and interests. The results of the testing were usually the basis for general assignments or the opportunity for specialized training.|$|E

5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012â€“2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} bank rate to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 {{the central bank}} shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record. The moves were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of money would {{be passed on to}} businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy. The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies, which it was hoped would boost exports from the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E
