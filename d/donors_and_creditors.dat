We concentrate on the <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> official <b>creditor</b> side, by exploring how the growing debt of African countries, over the last two decades, has affected the provision of new resources by the donor community. Our results indicate, if debt levels are reduced sufficiently in high debt countries, that donors can shift from the current pattern of non-selectivity and defensive lending to a low debt regime – a regime that has in the past allowed selectivity in lending in relation to levels of poverty and quality of policy. debt relief foreign aid; international organizations; low-income countries...|$|R

This study analyzes the influence of stakeholders (<b>donors,</b> employees, customers, <b>and</b> <b>creditors),</b> on board structure (board size and CEO duality), and on organizational performance. We use a global data set of 379 microfinance institutions from 73 countries, collected from rating organizations. Supported by stakeholder theory, agency theory and resource dependence theory, we find stakeholders to be important and have various influences on microfinance institutions. We find donors to be associated with small boards, non-duality and better performance. Employees are associated with large boards, while customers are associated with duality and good financial performance. Creditors opt for duality and better social performance.

40|$|We examine both {{grants and}} net loans made to low income {{countries}} {{during the last}} two decades to understand the main reasons that motivated the behaviour of both <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>creditors.</b> We find that the total amount of net transfers to HIPCs, as compared to non-HIPCs, have been increasing with their debt level. Greater net transfers have taken the form of net loans from multilateral organisations and grants in exchange for loans from bilateral institutions. This evidence thus suggests that HIPCs have kept receiving large amounts of resources just because of their high indebtedness, thereby supporting both the hypothesis of defensive lending and defensive granting. debt relief, foreign aid, highly indebted poor countries...|$|E

Specifically, it explores nineteen benchmark indicators in six major categories: profitability, capital, asset quality, liquidity, productivity, and growth. The report finds important patterns with regard to institutional form, size, and maturity. Moreover, the report represents an attempt to assign reference values to these indicators for the microfinance industry in Latin America and the Caribbean.

40|$|We examine both {{grants and}} net loans made to low income {{countries}} {{during the last}} two decades to understand the main reasons that motivated the behaviour of both <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>creditors.</b> Our results point to an overall "mixed" evidence, concerning the hypotheses of defensive lending (and defensive granting). Specifically, while a higher level of multilateral debt negatively affects both multilateral new loans and grants to low-income countries, in the case of HIPC such "correction" does not take place at all (in the case of grants) or it is much weaker (in the case of net loans). Bilateral creditors reduce their loans as their debt exposure increases and significantly so in the case of HIPC, while bilateral donors give more grants to HIPC as their bilateral debt share increases.

A large body of literature has developed in recent years on country factors and other factors that influence the effectiveness of aid and of the development aid business more generally. Two major findings have emerged. First, aid is more effective when the recipient country’s policy and institutional environment satisfies some minimal criteria. Second, aid and debt relief have not been targeted particu-larly toward countries with adequate policies and institutions (Burnside andDollar 2000). 1 In this article, we concentrate on understanding the dynamics behind th...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argued that}} the {{emergence}} of democracy in Sub-Saharan Africa is rooted in socioeconomic grievances and demand for better standards of living expressed by the people against obnoxious regimes - colonialism, military or civilian. Besides, the form of economic system, internal misrule, the complicity of western governments, development <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>creditors</b> (such as IMF and World Bank) have also influenced the process of democratization and governance in particular directions generating serious implications for the continent's overall development. Thus, since 1999, the expectation {{of the people of}} Nigeria that the return to civilian administration would create platform for them to savour the dividends of democracy have not being met. This is particularly so given the high jacking of the processes of political competition and elections by the elite and the middle class who exploit it for their selfish benefits rather than for economic redistribution of resources and improving {{the quality of life of}} the citizenry. This realism explains the fact that twelve years into civilian rule, massive corruption, absence of political openness, transparency, accountability, electoral rigging, god-fatherism etc holds sway in the polity, coupled with huge incidence of poverty, inequality, unemployment and poor social infrastructure. The paper interrogates the subject of political corruption and national development in Nigeria through the prism of clientelism, prebendal ism and patrimonial ism, in espousing the bane of continuing underdevelopment in the Nigerian society. The paper concludes on the premise that political corruption will be fought headlong when we create political stntctures where the economic and political rights of the people are justiceable; create an environment where the citizenry can define the kind and type of political change they really desire rather than the one that are foist on them...|$|E

40|$|This article utilises leximetric analysis, which {{involves}} the numerical coding {{of the strength}} of legal protections, to show changes in levels of shareholder <b>and</b> <b>creditor</b> protection in Australia for the period 1970 to 2010. This form of analysis, originally developed by La Porta et al, and subsequently used by many scholars in different legal fields, allows for the production of graphs which illustrate changes to the law, reducing complexities and allowing for comparisons of shareholder <b>and</b> <b>creditor</b> protection. The data show levels of shareholder protection have increased, most notably against actions {{of the board of directors}} rather than against other shareholders. In contrast, levels of creditor protection have been relatively stable. The article explores how and why these developments in shareholder <b>and</b> <b>creditor</b> protection have occurred.
