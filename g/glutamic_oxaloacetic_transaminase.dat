50|$|The {{presence}} of elevated transaminases {{can be an}} indicator of liver and cardiac damage. Two important transaminase enzymes are aspartate transaminase (AST), also known as serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> (SGOT); and alanine transaminase (ALT), also called alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) or serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). The discovery of these transaminases was by Arthur Karmen and colleagues in 1954 and their clinical importance by Fernando De Ritis, Mario Coltorti and Giuseppe Giusti in 1955 at the University of Naples.|$|E
5000|$|Aspartate {{transaminase}} (AST) or aspartate aminotransferase, {{also known}} as AspAT/ASAT/AAT or serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> (SGOT), is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminase enzyme (...) that was first described by Arthur Karmen and colleagues in 1954. AST catalyzes the reversible transfer of an α-amino group between aspartate and glutamate and, as such, is an important enzyme in amino acid metabolism. AST {{is found in the}} liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells. Serum AST level, serum ALT (alanine transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels.|$|E
50|$|AST, {{also called}} serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> or {{aspartate}} aminotransferase, {{is similar to}} ALT {{in that it is}} another enzyme associated with liver parenchymal cells. It is raised in acute liver damage, but is also present in red blood cells, and cardiac and skeletal muscle, so is not specific to the liver. The ratio of AST to ALT is mostly useful in differentiating between causes of liver damage. Elevated AST levels are not specific for liver damage, and AST has also been used as a cardiac marker. When the AST is higher than ALT, a muscle source of these enzymes should be considered. For example, muscle inflammation due to dermatomyositis may cause AST>ALT. This is a good reminder that AST and ALT are not good measures of liver function because they do not reliably reflect the synthetic ability of the liver and they may come from tissues other than liver (such as muscle).|$|E

Significant {{increases in the}} levels of blood glucose and the activities of glutamic pyruvic acid <b>transaminase,</b> <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> acid <b>transaminase</b> and alkaline phosphatase were observed in the fish treated with cadmium during all experimental periods. The levels of blood triglycerides and total protein were statistically elevated at second and last periods. Insignificant alterations in the levels of blood cholesterol were noted. The observed hyperglycaemia induced by cadmium might be explained in part by increasing rate of glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. The observed hypertriglyceridaemia and the elevations of glutamic pyruvic acid <b>transaminase,</b> <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> acid <b>transaminase</b> and alkaline phosphatase {{may be due to}} liver dysfunction.

To determine whether similar changes occur after qualitative alteration of portal blood flow, portacaval transpositions (PCT) were constructed in six conditioned mongrel dogs. Estimated hepatic blood flow (EHBF) was determined scintigraphically by the rate of hepatic uptake of a 500 -[mu]Ci dose of 99 mTc-sulfur colloid (Tsc). Hepatic reticuloendothelial cell (RES) phagocytic (PI) and degradative (DI) indices were calculated from the half-time blood disappearance of 131 I-labeled RES test lipid emulsion, and the half-time urine appearance of free 131 I, respectively. Opsonic activity (OI) was determined by gelatin latex particle agglutination and normalized to control values.

A single inhalation exposure of rats to furfural was fully tolerated up to a concentration of 126 ppm. However, exposure to higher concentrations of furfural resulted in a dose dependent mortality. Exposure of rats to vapor of kerosene ranging from 426 - 1054 ppm did not show toxic signs and mortality up to a period of seven days. Simultaneous exposure of rats to furfural and kerosene vapors ranging in concentration from 35 ppm to 138 ppm showed a suppression of LC 50 value of furfural.

40|$|AIMS: This study {{characterized}} the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of imatinib {{in patients with}} severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), investigated drug-drug interactions (DDI) among imatinib, sildenafil and bosentan, and evaluated their clinical implications. METHODS: Plasma concentrations of imatinib, bosentan and sildenafil were collected in a phase III study and were used to characterize the PK of imatinib in this population. DDIs among the three drugs were quantified using a linear mixed model and log-transformed drug concentrations. RESULTS: The population mean estimates of apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume (V/F) were 10. 8 [*]l h(- 1) (95 % CI[*] 9. 2, 12. 4 [*]l h(- 1)) and 267 [*]l (95 % CI[*] 208, 326 [*]l), respectively. It was estimated that sildenafil concentrations increased, on average, by 64 % (95 % CI[*] 32 %, 103 %) and bosentan concentrations by 51 % (95 % CI[*] 12 %, 104 %), {{in the presence of}} imatinib. Despite increased concentrations of co-medications, treatment differences between imatinib and placebo for change in 6 min walk distance and pulmonary vascular resistance were relatively constant across the entire concentration range for sildenafil and bosentan. Overall, higher concentrations of imatinib and bosentan were not associated with increasing liver enzymes (serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminases</b> [SGOT]/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]). CONCLUSIONS: Population PKs of imatinib in patients with severe PAH were found comparable with those of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.

40|$|Routine {{biochemical}} {{tests of}} hepatic function {{are useful in}} detecting subclinical acute alcoholic liver disease, {{but they do not}} correlate well with ab-normalities of hepatic histology, and they are too nonspecific to use in unravelling the pathophysiology of the condition. The most frequently observed biochemical abnormalities are raised levels of serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> (SGOT), serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), and bromsulphthalein (BSP) retention, suggesting either parenchymal cell injury (Leevy, 1962; Green, Mistilis, and Schiff, 1963), abnormal canalicular function (Ballard...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{and precise}} automated method is described for the colorimetric determi-nation of serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase.</b> The enzymically generated oxaloacetic acid is dialyzed, coupled with Fast Ponceau L, a diazonium salt, {{to form a}} colored solution whose absorbance is measured at 455 m. Dialysis {{eliminates the need for}} a serum control determination, thereby halving the analysis time, which is usually 1 hr. per 40 specimens. Comparison of values obtained using this procedure with and without dialysis shows excellent agreement. Comparison with the spectro-photometric procedure shows good correlation. The results of sample interaction experiments are also presented. C ONSIDEItABLE EvIl) ENCE has now been accumulated concermliblg the diag-nostic value of serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> <b>transaminase</b> (SOOT) assays in myocardial infarction and other disease states (1). To cope with the consequent exponential increase in requests for this enzyme assay, several autormiated colorimetric procedures were introduced recently (2 - 4) for use on arm automated system (Technicon AutoAnalyzera). This paper presents an improved automated colorimetric procedure for tile determination of SOOT in this automated system.

40|$|Background. 	While {{there is}} {{evidence}} that HIV affects the course and outcome of pregnancy, reports on the effects of pregnancy on HIV infection remain conflicting, especially in low-resource settings. Methodology. A prospective study of two demographically similar cohorts of HIV-seropositive women, 154 pregnant and 151 non-pregnant, was conducted in a hospital setting in Nigeria. Results. Cases and controls were matched for age, but parity in controls was significantly higher than in cases (p< 0. 0001). The time between diagnosis and treatment commencement was greater in controls compared with cases (p< 0. 0001). Electrolyte, urea and creatinine levels were within normal limits, with mean serum urea and potassium higher in controls compared with cases (p= 0. 002 and p= 0. 023). Aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) /serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> acid <b>transaminase</b> (SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) /serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and amylase levels were higher in controls compared with cases (p= 0. 001, p= 0. 0001 and p= 0. 05), but the mean CD 4 count was higher in cases compared with controls (p= 0. 001). The haematological parameters were within normal limits and comparable in cases and controls. A comparison of CD 4 count, total white blood cell count and packed cell volume across the three trimesters in the cases did not reveal any statistically significant differences in these parameters. Conclusion. Pregnancy did not affect biochemical and haematological parameters in HIV-infected Nigerian women...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} {{studying}} the pathogenesis of virulent arenavirus infection was developed by adapting Pichinde virus to produce lethal infections of inbred guinea pigs. This adapted Pichinde virus retained low virulence for primates, thus potentially reducing the biohazard to investigators. Whereas all inbred (strain 13) guinea pigs were infected and killed by 3 plaque-forming units or more of adapted Pichinde virus injected subcutaneously, outbred (Hartley strain) guinea pigs were relatively resistant. All infected, inbred guinea pigs died at 13 to 19 days after inoculation, with viremias in excess of 5 log 10 plaque-forming units/ml, severe lymphopenia (< 1, 000 /mm 3), and elevated serum <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> acid <b>transaminase</b> levels. Immunofluorescent antibody examination of tissues and infectivity titrations of tissue homogenates obtained at 3 - to 4 -day intervals demonstrated significant viral replication in all visceral tissues examined, but not in brain. Livers of all moribund guinea pigs contained moderate to severe hepatocellular necrosis and diffuse fatty change. Splenic red pulp and adrenal cortical tissues were engorged with blood and contained necrotic foci. Pancreatic acinar tissues were atrophied and vacuolated; lung sections typically contained areas of moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia. Inflammatory cells were conspicuously absent from all lesions. The virological and pathological features of adapted Pichinde infection in guinea pigs are remarkably similar to those described for Lassa virus infections in rhesus monkeys and humans, suggesting that this model might {{provide insight into the}} pathogenesis and treatment of Lassa fever in humans...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNatural {{remedies}} from {{medicinal plants}} {{are considered to}} be effective and safe alternative treatment for diabetes mellitus. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the hypoglycemic activity of the crude tea leaves extract on streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic mice. The average body weight of animals with diabetes and their percentage changes of body weight gain after 15 and 30 days were significantly lower than that of the normal control mice. In diabetic mice, supplementation with tea leaves extract decreased the loss of body weight. After 15 and 30 days, significant increases in the levels of serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, urea, uric acid, glutamic pyruvic acid <b>transaminase</b> (GPT) and <b>glutamic</b> <b>oxaloacetic</b> acid <b>transaminase</b> (GOT) were noted in STZ-diabetic mice fed with normal diet. Also, the values of total protein in this group were statistically declined after 15 and 30 days. The levels of serum glucose and GPT were significantly elevated after 15 and 30 days in diabetic mice supplemented with tea leaves extract. Moreover, the level of serum GOT was notably increased after 30 days. Insignificant alterations were observed in the levels of serum triglycerides, cholesterol, total protein, creatinine, urea and uric acid in diabetic mice supplemented with tea leaves extract. Thus, the present results have shown that tea leaves extract has the antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, and antihyperproteinemic effects and consequently may alleviate liver and kidney damage associated with STZ-induced diabetes in mice...|$|R
