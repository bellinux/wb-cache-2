It would have allowed employers the opportunity to terminate employment of workers under twenty-six without any reason, within their first two years of employment. Those opposed to the First Employment Contract were worried that it could compromise job security, encourage social pressure with a view to lowering wages, and impede employees in having legal recourse in cases of sexual harassment or other abuse, since this could lead to their subsequently being fired.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is famous}} for a New Year celebration where lighted tar barrels are carried on the heads of revellers called guisers. This {{tradition}} dates back to 1858. It appears to have originated from the lighting of a silver band that were carolling at New Year. They were unable to use candles to light their music due to the strong winds, so someone suggested a tar barrel be used. Having to move from place to place, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to carry the barrels upon the guisers' heads, rather than rolling them. There have been claims {{that it is a}} pagan festival, however, these claims are unfounded.|$|E
25|$|One of nine {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven, Redmond produced an outstanding performance as Birmingham outclassed Maribor in the last group stage fixture. Apart from Jovan Vidović's early header that went wide, the attacking play was all Birmingham's. After 24 minutes, Rooney scored his first European goal, a close-range header from a Redmond cross, then Žigić failed {{to take a couple}} of chances, Davies failed to make contact with a Redmond corner when <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to score, and Redmond himself hit a half-volley against the post from distance. His marker, Arghus, was perhaps fortunate to escape a red card for a high tackle born of frustration. But ten-man Braga could only draw with Brugge, so Birmingham's ten points were not enough.|$|E

Lamy stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to resolve the conflict if both Russia and Ukraine had been WTO members. Moreover, {{he added that the}} problem had arisen in the first place because neither Russia nor Ukraine experience true market prices, producing inefficient energy uses amongst the states.

Illarionov noted in this respect {{that there is no such}} thing as a market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E
25|$|An {{early and}} {{influential}} {{book about the}} subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing, Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English, was hired as a senior technical writer in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.|$|E

GameSpot Chris Watters acknowledged that the PC's higher resolution was expected and that the Xbox 360 version had an even lower resolution, frame rate issues, and texture pop-in, though it still handled the game well. Peter Bright of Ars Technica wrote that the game's visuals were [...] "lacking", with flat lighting and static environments.

500|$|The {{workforce}} {{consisted of}} a mixture of German specialists and forcibly conscripted Frenchmen from the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO). They were supplemented by Belgian, Dutch, French, Polish, Czech and Soviet prisoners of war and civilian conscripts, who were used as slave labour. The labour force also included many French political prisoners and Spanish Republicans who had fled to France after General Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War but had then been interned by the invading Germans. The non-German workers lived in two camps officially known as Organisation Todt Watten Zwangsarbeitslager 62 (Forced Labour Camp 62) about [...] distant from the site, {{near the village of}} Éperlecques. The camps were guarded by the French civil police with the assistance of Belgian and Dutch Nazis and Russian POWs who had volunteered for guard duty. Although escape attempts were punished by immediate execution, there were up to three escapes daily with external assistance. The commandant of the camp is said to have complained that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to [...] "guard a sack of fleas". Over 35,000 foreign workers passed through the camps during the period in which they were operational.|$|E
500|$|In its place, Stevens {{suggests}} that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends {{not on the}} desirability of compliance and noncompliance {{when compared to the}} norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> were no intervention made.

Soon afterwards, he took the idea to New York-based theatrical producer Jared Geller (who would later co-produce the tribute concert with David Foster), hoping to turn a dream into a reality. Geller initially thought the idea was [...] "insane", but he and Wainwright continued discussing options. Eventually, Geller agreed {{to assist with the}} production and the two found space in Wainwright's schedule to book Carnegie Hall a year in advance. Once the venue was booked, staging elements such as lighting, microphone location and amplification were discussed. Stephen Oremus signed on as the conductor of the 36-piece orchestra and Phil Ramone took charge of the recording. Rehearsals began in April 2006, and while <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to practice in rehearsal rooms, large theaters such as the Lynch at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Museum of Jewish Heritage were utilized because [...] "Rufus wanted a feel for performing this material on a stage".

500|$|Multiple storylines {{spanning}} {{the first two}} seasons were brought to a close in the two-part season finale, including {{the search for the}} demon Azazel and the existence of Azazel's psychic children. As many of the show's questions are answered in one long conversation by Azazel, series creator Eric Kripke and writer Sera Gamble had to rewrite the demon's speech multiple times because they felt that [...] "the payoff [...] never as good as the anticipation". Though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> for them to keep postponing the revelations, the writers believed they would get [...] "crushed under the anticipation" [...] because they {{would not be able to}} satisfy fans if they kept building up more expectations. As for the psychic children, the writers originally intended to continue their storyline into the third season, but ultimately killed them off after deciding that the characters were not as interesting as demons and monsters. In the first version of the script, the character of Lily was two roles: a girl named Alex who could kill with a single touch, and a telepath named Lily. Believing they had too many characters, the writers combined Alex and Lily into one. Gamble had envisioned the episode as a [...] "psychic Breakfast Club", so the new Lily's motivation was that she was Ally Sheedy. The Acheri demon responsible for two of the psychic children's deaths was based on the Acheri from Hindu mythology; writer Sera Gamble felt that it being a [...] "diseased spirit" [...] that comes down from the mountains and [...] "kills everybody in the settlements" [...] fit in with the abandoned mountain-side town that the episode takes place in. Harvelle's Roadhouse—a saloon frequented by demon hunters—was dropped from the show in these episodes as well, as Kripke disliked the concept of having a fixed home for a road-based series. With the Roadhouse's destruction came the death of recurring character Ash, whom the writers had been phasing out during the season because they felt his [...] "comical" [...] and [...] "wacky" [...] personality was too unrealistic for the show.|$|E

2500|$|Fischer {{takes the}} short line 12 {{to be the}} {{beginning}} of the text, reasoning that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to indent the first line than to estimate how long the last line would be when fitting it in, and that the large glyphs in line 13 past the end of line 12 were written that way to fill in the gap. However, he does note that there are remnants of pre-inscription tracings that would have enabled such an estimate. Horley (2011) makes a case that 12 was the last line: That the text starts at line 11, wraps around (in descending order) to 13, and that 12 was fit into the gap between the slightly skew lines 11 and 13. The way lines 12 and 13 squeeze together (the glyphs are 12–14mm high at the thick end of the staff, but only 8–10mm high at the end of line 12 where 13 takes over) is consistent with these being the last lines engraved.|$|E
2500|$|For Daredevil's red suit, {{introduced}} {{at the end}} of the first season, Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which lead to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists higlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor's face is going to be doing something else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, [...] "There was a discussion early in the process, because Charlie Cox [...] Chris Brewster are both right handed, of having the billy clubs holster on the right leg. But Daredevil wears those billy clubs on the left hand side. So while <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to place the holster on the right we all felt that we had to keep to the classic profile and keep them on the left." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Stuart Tave {{noted that}} a major theme of Austen's novel is propriety, as she both mocks those who cling {{outwardly}} to propriety, often in a self-righteous manner without understanding what it really means and praises those who really live up to it. Those who really understand propriety in Austen's novel take into account both the feelings of others and draw the appropriate conclusions. Tave argued that the play Lover's Vows is {{a test of the}} character's commitment to propriety. The priggish Mrs. Norris sees herself as the guardian of propriety and is trusted by Sir Thomas before he leaves for Antigua to uphold propriety, a task she fails at completely by letting Lover's Vows be put on. Edmund objects to the play, as he knows it violates propriety in some way, but he fails to make the point, as bases his objections in specific matters rather the universal one of propriety. Only Fanny understands this point as she knows that playing the characters will also impact on the amateur actors, but she is not strong enough to persuade the others of her viewpoint. As the rehearsals continued, Fanny could clearly see the sexual tension and attraction between Edmund and Mary as they play the part of the two lovers, which fills her with misery and jealousy. Tave wrote about Price and the play: [...] "Excluded from the gaiety and busy employment of others, alone, sad, insignificant, seeing Mrs. Grant promoted to consequence and honor because Mrs. Grant accepted the character she herself refused, Fanny is in some danger of envying her. What distinguishes Fanny here, and throughout, is that she is capable of thought and recovery, and in this instance, reflection brings better feelings, showing her that even if she could have received the greatest respect she would never have been easy. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easier</b> to join a scheme, which considering only her uncle, she must condemn altogether". Finally, Tave suggests that when Sir Thomas shuts down Lover's Vows, this demonstrates the hypocrisy and myopic character of Sir Thomas as he is content to destroy the set and props without considering just what had led his children into putting on Lover's Vows in the first place as he is only concerned with the external aspects of people, not what really drives them.|$|E
