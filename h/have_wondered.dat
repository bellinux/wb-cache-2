5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most likely because of her {{reputation}} as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that scholars <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> {{what would have}} {{happened}} if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E

25|$|Instead of {{pursuing}} the remaining Carthaginians, Duilius sailed to Sicily {{to relieve the}} city of Segesta, which had been under siege from the Carthaginian infantry commander Hamilcar. Modern historians <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> at Duilius’ decision not to immediately follow up with another naval attack, but Hannibal Gisco’s remaining 80 ships were probably still too strong for Rome to conquer.|$|E

25|$|Routledge says in {{her notes}} that a Rapanui elder {{told her that}} all the manu miro ('wood birds') were inscribed with glyphs. However, text X {{is the only one}} known (Fischer 1997). Fischer accepts it as genuine and speculates 'Perhaps it was {{obtained}} on Rapanui {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century by an American whaler.' However, other scholars <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> whether the inscription might have been added later.|$|E
25|$|Several fans {{reading the}} series <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> whether Clamp was hinting a romantical {{relationship}} {{going on between}} Kamui and Fuma. In response, in the book Understanding Manga and Anime writer Robin E. Brenner stated Clamp had no of those intentions as he compared them with the more explicit relationship Subaru had with Seishiro. Kamui's appearance in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle proved to be popular as he was voted as the sixth most popular character in the second poll.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} {{of the concept of}} chance throughout history has been very gradual. Historians <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> why progress in the field of randomness was so slow, given that humans have encountered chance since antiquity. Deborah Bennett suggests that ordinary people face an inherent difficulty in understanding randomness, although the concept is often taken as being obvious and self-evident. She cites studies by Kahneman and Tversky; these concluded that statistical principles are not learned from everyday experience because people do not attend to the detail necessary to gain such knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The Gurjar Pratihar Empire {{acted as}} a barrier for Arab invaders from the 8th to the 11th century. The chief {{accomplishment}} of the Gurjara Pratihara empire lies in its successful resistance to foreign invasions from the west, starting {{in the days of}} Junaid. Historian R. C. Majumdar says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance {{in other parts of the}} world. Now there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of Sindh, their first conquest for nearly 300 years.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{unhappiness}} in Lawrence's life was his romantic entanglement {{with two of}} Sarah Siddons' daughters. He fell in love first with Sally, then transferred his affections on to her sister Maria, then broke with Maria and turned to Sally again. Both the sisters had fragile health; Maria died in 1798, on her deathbed extracting a promise from her sister never to marry Lawrence. Sally kept her promise and refused to see Lawrence again, dying in 1803. But Lawrence continued on friendly terms with their mother and painted several portraits of her. He never married. In later years two women would provide him with companionship, friends Elizabeth Croft and Isabella Wolff who first met Lawrence when she sat for her portrait in 1803. Isabella was married to the Danish consul Jens Wolff, but she separated from him in 1810, and Sir Michael Levey suggests that people may <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> if Lawrence {{was the father of}} her son Herman.|$|E

25|$|While equating Sinai with Petra would {{indicate}} that the Israelites journeyed in roughly {{a straight line from}} Egypt via Kadesh Barnea, and locating Sinai in Saudi Arabia would suggest Kadesh Barnea was skirted to the south, some scholars <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> whether Sinai was much closer to the vicinity of Kadesh Barnea itself. Half way between Kadesh Barnea and Petra is Har Karkom, which Emmanuel Anati excavated, and discovered to have been a major Paleolithic cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings; although the peak of religious activity at the site dates to 2350–2000 BCE, the exodus is dated 15 Nisan 2448 (Hebrew calendar; 1313 BCE), and the mountain appears to have been abandoned between 1950–1000 BCE, Anati proposed that Jabal Idead was equatable with biblical Sinai. Other scholars have criticised this identification, as, in addition to being almost 1000 years too early, it also appears to require the wholesale relocation of the Midianites, Amalekites, and other ancient peoples, from the locations where the majority of scholars currently place them.|$|E

Although he mentioned a black-and-grey [...] "tivouch" [...] or hoopoe, later authors <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> whether this referred to the hoopoe starling or the Madagascan subspecies of hoopoe (Upupa epops marginata), though that bird resembles the Eurasian subspecies.

500|$|Some <b>have</b> <b>wondered</b> if an anti-Christian {{sentiment}} lurks {{behind the}} thefts. Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund), a Christian legal group, stated, [...] "I suspect {{most of it}} is childish pranks. Clearly, there are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas. But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion." [...] Stephen Nissenbaum, the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor, views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes. Nissenbaum writes that, [...] "What it means is that it's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms, as long as real human harm isn't being done. It's not exactly devaluing Christianity, but it is sort of a ritualized challenge to it. It could be Christian kids doing itand on January 2 they become good Christians again." ...|$|E

[...] Charles Lamb, a Romantic writer fascinated by Shakespeare and his works, and particularly intrigued by this question, found in John Ogilby's [...] "Accurate Description of Africa" [...] (1670) two versions of a story about Emperor Charles V's invasion of Algiers in 1541, relating that a witch (not named in the source text) had advised the commander of the city not to surrender, predicting the destruction of the besieging fleet, which was accomplished nine days later by a [...] "dreadful tempest". The principal version given claims that she was [...] "richly remunerated" [...] but the alternative version, [...] "to palliate the shame and the reproaches that are thrown upon them for making use of a witch," [...] attributes the storm to the prayers of a holy man named Cidy Utica.|$|E

Soap opera {{journalist}} Marlena De Lacroix, who {{acknowledged that}} she neither liked nor understood Todd, expressed {{her inability to}} understand his popularity among so many fans, even during his several hiatuses from the show. She asked, [...] "Why has the show devoted years of storyline time to him and all but made a hero out of a criminal?" [...] Hayward, who said that her own response to Todd's redemption was ambivalent, called the writers' attempt to redeem Todd controversial and stated {{that the role of}} Rebecca, the woman the writers paired Todd with during the redemption process, [...] "seems to encourage both female and male fantasies about the power of a 'good woman' to save a man from his own violent impulses". [...] In his book Behold the Man, Edisol Dotson suggested that viewers accepted Todd's redemption because he was physically attractive. Dotson stated, [...] "Were Todd an ugly man, he would have never been forgiven, and female fans would not crowd the studio's backdoor shouting his name." ...|$|E

[...] There was, at the time, significant social friction in New England between established Protestant families and Irish immigrants. [...] While the regimental historian observed that the 29th was [...] "cordially welcomed" [...] to the Irish Brigade, other historians, such as Marion Armstrong, point out the oddity of the [...] "aristocratic 29th Massachusetts ... thrown in with three regiments of New York Irishmen." [...] Historian Daniel Callaghan quotes period sources describing the [...] "unlikely matching of ancient political foes," [...] {{and the manner in which}} the men of the 29th tolerated the Irish-born commander of the Irish Brigade, Brig.
