5|$|Intravenous hydration, if required, is {{typically}} only needed {{for one or}} two days. In children with shock due to dengue a rapid dose of 20mL/kg <b>is</b> <b>reasonable.</b> The rate of fluid administration is than titrated to a urinary output of 0.5–1mL/kg/h, stable vital signs and normalization of hematocrit. The smallest amount of fluid required to achieve this is recommended.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion <b>is</b> <b>reasonable.</b> He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E
5000|$|The {{issue of}} implied power also {{required}} consideration. The ICC {{asserted that the}} power should be implied from the first section, which provided that [...] "all charges ... should <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> and just; and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such serve is prohibited and declared to be unlawful." [...] The ICC deduced that if all charges must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable,</b> and Congress had not determined what <b>was</b> <b>reasonable,</b> then the ICC must determine which rates <b>are</b> <b>reasonable,</b> in order to perform its legal obligation {{to ensure that all}} rates would <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> and just. Therefore, they argued, the only reasonable interpretation of the statute was that Congress intended them to exercise the power to set rates.|$|R

5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E
5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> to suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E

It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. To justify suppression of free speech, there must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced. There must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> ground {{to believe that the}} danger apprehended is imminent. There must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> ground to believe that the evil to be prevented is a serious one." [...] Justice Louis Brandeis in the Whitney opinion.|$|R
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable,</b> taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea, which <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E

5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity say that it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that {{to allow them to}} do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E
5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly less serious offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving <b>is</b> <b>reasonable.</b> The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E
