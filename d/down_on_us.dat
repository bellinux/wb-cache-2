25|$|In {{the ancient}} Celtic world Anu {{was the mother}} goddess and {{considered}} to be the mother of all the gods; the Tuatha de Danann. Other references say that she is the mother earth goddess or the Goddess of fertility. On the Cork Kerry border are two mountains called the Paps of Anu (pap is another word for breast.) On the top of each mountain are stone structures or cairns that when viewed from a distance make the two mountains look like a pair of breasts. Anu was known, in the Celtic World, by several similar names: Danu or Don being the most popular alternatives. She was a Mother-Goddess, the wife of the Sun God, Belenos, and {{considered to be the}} ancestor of all the Gods, the Tuatha dé Danann, who found themselves obliged to reside in the Otherworld when Miled brought the Celts to the British Isles. She still looks <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>us</b> from the night's sky where she appears as Llys Don, better known as the constellation of Casseopeia.|$|E

About 30 of us were killed. I was thinking of my mother and how ironic it would be to be killed at the end of the war—and by your own aircraft." ...|$|E

[...] Jackson said, [...] "I know Barack Obama. I've seen his leadership at work. I've seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois." [...] At the convention, Jackson started what was described as a [...] "hugfest" [...] in an attempt to unite the Illinois Democratic party, which had been squabbling internally. He started by hugging Bobby Rush (who had been upset that Jackson's wife was being positioned for Rush's seat when Rush had been ill earlier in the year) and then he hugged Debbie Halvorson, who as been at odds with him over the proposed airport. He then asked if anyone else was mad at him. At this point Mayor Daley jumped up to hug Jackson. Jackson then said [...] "I'm not going to be satisfied until I see Rod Blagojevich give Mike Madigan a hug." ...|$|E

500|$|The Texian {{position}} {{was surrounded by}} trees, leaving the Mexican cavalry no room to maneuver. [...] The 200 members of the cavalry remained {{on the west bank}} of the river, behind the Texians, to foil any escape attempts. Lieutenant Colonel José Maria Mendosa brought the Mexican infantry and artillery across the river to a position below that of the Texians. [...] In response, Texians trimmed undergrowth near their camp to provide better visibility and dug steps into the embankment so that they could more easily climb up to fire. [...] The two sides skirmished desultorily for two hours, until the fog began to lift. At that point, 5060 Mexican infantrymen crossed the prairie to surround the Texians. [...] Seeing their approach, Bowie shouted to his Texian forces, [...] "Keep under cover, boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare!" [...] At [...] from the Texian position, the Mexican infantry halted and formed a line with the cannon in the middle. [...] They began firing as they advanced toward the Texian positions, to little effect. [...] For the most part, the Mexican volleys passed over the heads of the Texians. [...] According to Texian Noah Smithwick, [...] "grapeshot and canister thrashed through the pecan trees overhead, raining a shower of ripe nuts <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>us,</b> and I saw men picking them up and eating them with as little concern as if they were being shaken down by a norther." [...] In his official report to Austin, Bowie remarked that [...] "The discharge from the enemy was one continued blaze of fire, whilst that from our lines, was more slowly delivered, but with good aim and deadly effect." [...] The Mexican infantry were assigned Brown Bess muskets, which had a maximum range of only , compared to the [...] effective range of the Texian long rifles. [...] The Texians were short of ammunition, however, and although Mexican ammunition was plentiful, it was poor quality. In several cases, Mexican musket balls bounced off Texian soldiers, causing little damage other than a bruise.|$|E

He followed this by stating, [...] "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that...

[...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl.
