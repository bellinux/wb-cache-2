40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines a curricular approach at {{an institution}} that claims to maintain a liberal arts focus – that of the canon of <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> as implemented as a formal curriculum at St. John’s College. My research question is: what enabled the <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> program at St. John’s College to survive for over seventy years? The significance of this question {{can be seen by}} noticing that St. John’s College is the only college in the United States to have exclusively adopted reading the <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> as its four-year curriculum. Other institutions that have experimented with a <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> program prior to and since its introduction at St. John’s College have continued their existing programs as well, but many have limited their <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> efforts to an honors course or general core requirement, if their <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> effort survives at all. My dissertation is historical starting with the influencing factors leading to this curriculum’s introduction at St. John’s College in 1937. I then outline the implementation and document the changes to the list of <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> comprising the program as it was updated over the subsequent seventy years as documented in St. John’s College’s academic catalogs from 1937 through 2008. I show that the list of <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> required to be read by every student over the years has contained a consistent core while making slight adjustments...|$|R

50|$|A {{university}} or college <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> Program {{is a program}} inspired by the <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> movement begun in the United States in the 1920s.

The essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with whole primary texts, called the <b>Great</b> <b>Books.</b> The curricula of <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a student's education, such as Plato's Republic, or Dante's Divine Comedy. Such programs often focus exclusively on Western culture. Their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach, as most of the <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline. <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures, and have small class sizes.

To provide more information to use in judging <b>great</b> <b>books</b> curricula, this article presents a study of relational processes in <b>great</b> <b>books</b> classes. The results show that <b>great</b> <b>books</b> have both strengths and risks. The research focuses on how teachers involve students with the <b>great</b> <b>books</b> by connecting their experiences with the insights presented in the text. Among other devices, teachers use examples to establish these connections: the class explores {{some aspect of the}} text by discussing an analogous case from students 2 ̆ 7 experience. This article describes how such examples carry a certain risk. These examples can lead students to experience the text so fully that they act it out. Instead of dispassionately discussing the text, students and teachers enact the roles described in the text and the example, thus creating an analogous interactional event in the classroom. This article describes and illustrates this interactional pattern, drawing on ethnographic observations, interviews, and analyses of transcripts taken from a three year study of high school English and history classes. In light of the findings, the article reassesses the pedagogical strengths and weaknesses of <b>great</b> <b>books</b> teaching and examples as pedagogical devices...|$|R
40|$|Publisher東京論文The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the <b>great</b> <b>books</b> program as it contends with the {{concerns}} of Eurocentrism. St. John's College, a liberal arts college, which introduced an undergraduate <b>great</b> <b>books</b> program in 1937, will be the main focus. General education programs based on Western civilization, including <b>great</b> <b>books</b> programs, have been criticized vociferously by multiculturalists for being Eurocentric, and since the 1980 s, some of them have been replaced with more multiculturalistic programs. However, despite the criticism by multiculturalists, and some changes in its reading list, St. John's College has maintained its Eurocentric undergraduate <b>great</b> <b>books</b> program. This paper comprises five sections : Section 1 deals with the purpose and structure of the paper; Section 2 presents a review on previous studies concerning the history of the <b>great</b> <b>books</b> program at St. John's College; Section 3 reveals Eva T. H. Brann's understanding of liberal education and multiculturalistic views; she has been a faculty member since 1957 and has worked as a dean from 1990 to 1997 at St. John's College, Annapolis; Section 4 scrutinizes how Brann defended the <b>great</b> <b>books</b> program so as to avoid criticism by the multiculturalists in the early 1990 s; On the basis of the four sections described above, Section 5 presents concluding remarks on the program...|$|R

40|$|In a few urban {{elementary}} schools, in-depth, literature-based {{discussions are}} taking place under the Junior <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> Program. For years, Junior <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> has been a program available to limited numbers of students in special settings. Beginning in 1993, funding from the Ameritech Foundation allowed the <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> Foundation to support the program {{as part of the}} regular curriculum in five urban school districts. Five years later, the Program has substantial evidence that its approach of engaging students in "shared inquiry " about literature's most abiding themes can thrive in high-poverty schools. Program staff have also learned that the implementation of Junior <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> varies from school to school, classroom to classroom, and teacher to teacher depending on a variety of factors. This report provides a snapshot of three schools using the Junior <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> Program. Information from the report was derived from site visits, participation in the Junior <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> leader training, and participation in focus groups about the program. The report lists 10 specific lessons learned about the use of this program in urban schools. Taken together, the 10 lessons show that the poorest students in the United States can benefit from a high quality curriculum that provides all students with opportunities to engage with literature through reading and discussion.
