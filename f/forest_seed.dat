40|$|The Water {{activity}} R&D project, {{carried out}} in cooperation with ONF and Vilmorin, aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of Water Activity assessment applied to <b>forest</b> <b>seeds</b> and pollen moisture management {{as a replacement for}} moisture content assessment. Water Activity assessment is a quick and non destructive technique to qualify the kind and the chemical potential of water remaining in the sample. The growth of micro-organisms require a specific osmotic pressure, or Water Activity(Aw), between cell walls and medium. The reactivity and depreciating ability of hydrolytic reactions, enzymes activity, lipid oxidation or biotic agents growth are dependent on Aw rather than on MC. Consequently, seeds and pollen preservation implies Water Activity control instead of moisture content check. Water dynamics in seeds and pollen have been described by the mean of sorption isotherms, this demonstrates clearly the variability of forest materials and consequently the poor reliability of moisture content for successful moisture management. As a conclusion, Water Activity assessment appears to be a reliable and a quick method to evaluate the ability of a given sample to be stored successfully.

40|$|Question: (i) How does former {{land use}} and land use {{intensity}} affect seed bank development during post-agricultural succession? (ii) How does time since the last clear-cut change seed bank composition during post-clear-cut succession? Methods: One data set was compiled per succession type using the following selection criteria: (i) the data set included a successional series, (ii) plots were located in mesotrophic forest plant communities and (iii) vegetation data were available. The post-agricultural succession data set comprised 76 recent forest plots (eight studies); the post-clear-cut succession data set comprised 218 ancient forest plots (three studies). Each data set was analysed separately using either linear mixed models or generalized linear models, controlling for both environmental heterogeneity and variation between study locations. Results: In the post-agricultural succession data set, {{land use and}} time significantly affected nearly all the studied seed bank characteristics. Seed banks on former arable land recovered poorly even after 150 year of restored forest cover, whereas moderate land use intensities (grasslands, heathlands) yielded more rapid seed bank recovery.

One of the main - and least expensive - restoration strategies is natural forest regeneration. By aiding <b>forest</b> <b>seed</b> influx both into disturbed and undisturbed habitats, frugivorous birds facilitate forest regeneration. This study focuses on the tolerance of a frugivorous bird community to anthropogenic habitat disturbance within the broader context of natural forest regeneration with conservation purposes. It {{was carried out in}} the tropical cloud forest of Costa Rica’s Talamanca Mountains. Bird community response and tolerance to habitat disturbance was assessed by comparing bird presence and densities along a disturbance gradient, ranging from open pastures to closed mature forests. Birds were censused along nine transects applying the variable width line transect procedure. Forty relevant frugivorous bird species were observed during 102 h of survey time. Densities were calculated for 33 species; nine species responded negatively to increasing level of disturbance and nine others positively. Results indicate that large frugivores are generally moderately tolerant to intermediate, but intolerant to severe habitat disturbance, and that tolerance is often higher for medium and small frugivores. It appears that moderately disturbed habitats in tropical cloud forests are highly suitable for restoration through natural regeneration aided by frugivorous birds. Due to a lack of large <b>forest</b> <b>seed</b> dispersers, severely disturbed habitats appear less suitable...|$|E

The statistical design used was completely random; the comparison of means was performed by Tukey test at 5 % probability. Lot II showed higher germination percentage and speed. The electrical conductivity test allows discrimination of the same batch by the germination test under laboratory conditions.

40|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>seed</b> banks mostly {{studied in}} managed forests {{proved to be}} small, species poor and not {{reflecting}} aboveground species composition. Yet studies conducted in undisturbed communities indicate a different seed bank characteristic. Therefore we aimed at describing soil seed bank in an undisturbed forest in a remnant of European lowland temperate forests, the Białowieża Forest. We compared similarity between the herb layer and seed bank, similarity of seed bank between different patches, and dominance structure of species in the herb layer and in the seed bank of two related oak-hornbeam communities. We report relatively high values of Sorensen species similarity index between herb layer and seed bank of both patches. This suggests higher species similarity of the herb layer and soil seed bank in natural, unmanaged forests represented by both plots than in fragmented communities influenced by man. Although there was a set of core seed bank species present at both plots, yielding high Sorensen species similarity index values, considerable differences between plots in seed bank size and dominance structure of species were found, indicating spatial variability of studied seed bank generated by edaphic conditions. Dominance structure of species in the herb layer was not reflected in the underlying seed bank. This stresses, that natural forest regeneration cannot rely only on the seed bank, although some forest species are capable of forming soil seed banks. While <b>forest</b> <b>seed</b> banks may not reflect vegetation composition of past successional stages, they may inform on history and land use of a specific plot...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{assessed}} {{the size and}} composition of the seed bank in 31 plots representing a range of habitats within an old-growth, temperate deciduous forest at Mont St. Hilaire, Québec, Canada. We identified 49 taxa in the seed bank, {{with an average of}} 40 species·m– 2 and a median density of 1218 seeds·m– 2. The most frequent seeds were species of Carex and Rubus, Diervilla lonicera, and Eupatorium rugosum, while seeds of Carex were the most numerous overall. Of the 12 species in the seed bank not found in the forest, 11 were found growing on the developed landscape sur-rounding this 10 -km 2 forest fragment. These nonforest species were numerically only a minor component of the <b>forest</b> <b>seed</b> bank. Vernal herbs were not in the seed bank, and {{there were only a few}} tree species. Variation in seed bank rich-ness among habitats was correlated positively with canopy cover, soil moisture, and soil nutrients, but not with the seed bank density or total number of species in the aboveground vegetation. Seed bank density increased with plot soil moisture. Woody species predominated in the seed bank of plots with richer soils, deeper litter, and more closed cano-pies. Herbaceous species predominated in the seed bank of plots with more open canopies, more mesic water regimes, and greater species richness in the aboveground vegetation. Contrary to earlier results suggesting <b>forest</b> <b>seed</b> banks pri-marily include shade-intolerant species associated with canopy disturbance or secondary succession, the seed bank in this old-growth, primary forest contains many shade-tolerant forest species.

40|$|The Vietnamese Government {{developed}} {{a plan of}} state reforestation for 1986 - 2000 to achieve a target of 2 265 000 ha of plantations for production and protection purposes. The plan called for 153 000 ha of concentrated plantations and 400 - 450 million dispersed trees to be planted annually. Project VIE/ 86 / 026 provided technical assistance to the National <b>Forest</b> <b>Seed</b> and Planting Material Company (NFSC), a State Forest Enterprise (SFE), in establishing seed stands and seed orchards to improve the genetic base and the productivity of the new plantations and dispersed plantings. In addition, the project assisted the NFSC in instituting quality control in seed processing and handling, promoting the use of improved seeds, and carrying out training courses through the newly established extension unit. The project carried out research, and provided training and equipment to increase the capability of the NFSC and its seven <b>Forest</b> <b>Seed</b> Enterprises to produce, collect, store, handle and market seed. As a result of technical assistance provided by the project, the NFSC now {{has the capacity to}} increase the supply of improved seeds in selected Eucalyptus, Pinus, Acacia, and other species. However, due to the emergence of a market-driven economy in Viet Nam and the introduction of the New Economic Mechanism, market demand for improved seeds has decreased and NFSC's costs of production have increased. A facilitating framework of legal, policy and institutional measures must be put in place in Viet Nam to encourage the use of improved seeds, and to ensure the capability to produce improved seeds for popular species in Viet Nam. Project VIE/ 86 / 026 assisted in the establishment of 52. 1 ha of clonal orchards and 2 500 ha of improved seed stands, and carried out training in basic nursery techniques. Growth and yield performance from recent research trials indicate that emphasis should be placed in Viet Nam on Acacias and other nitrogen fixing species, Casuarina, indigenous species and mixtures. Due to the efforts of the project, NFSC stipulated an agreement to supply WFP with domestic seeds for WFP Project 4304 for 1992 / 93. This contract provided the NFSC a major stimulus to apply its expertise and equipment in commercial trade. A sub-contract approved at the Terminal TPR is under way to prepare the guidelines and basic parameters for a National Plan for Seed Procurement. However, an effective Plan can only be developed once the Government has incorporated the new reforestation strategies and priorities into the legal, policy, and planning framework. Future work on the National Plan for Seed Procurement should be carried out by an institution independent of the NFSC to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. The project also suggested that the experts at the Forest Science Institute of Viet Nam (FSIV), NFSC, and other organizations involved in tree improvement research be encouraged to coordinate their work. The project recommended that the Ministry of Forests (MOF) review the organizational framework of the <b>forest</b> <b>seed</b> production sub-sector in Viet Nam. The experience and expertise available within the NFSC (central office), <b>Forest</b> <b>Seed</b> Enterprises, Provincial Forest Enterprises and Seed Production Units, and the FSIV should be rationalized. Technical and extension support systems should be introduced by the MOF to encourage the use of improved forest seeds by public, private and smallholder investors in reforestation. In order to ensure seed quality, the MOF should identify and register approved domestic seed suppliers. The NFSC should examine the advantages of registering with international seed advertising organizations and consider membership in the OECD <b>Forest</b> <b>Seed</b> Certification Scheme. MOF should formally recognize the role of the NFSC in producing improved seeds, and should provide the NFSC with the full mandate to market its products and services in Viet Nam and internationally. The project also recommended that MOF provide additional resources and support to the NFSC to manage and protect seed orchards and improved seed stands from foraging, harvesting, encroachment and fire caused primarily by neighbouring farmers. Priority should be given to providing resources to the NFSC for the promotion of improved seeds in Viet Nam through its extension unit. NFSC should maintain a close liaison with international agencies, FSIV, Forest Research Centres (FRCs) and other SFEs to gain access to improved seed stands that are not owned by the NFSC. A close liaison with FSIV and the FRCs will also provide NFSC the opportunity to gauge the performance of existing species and provenance research trials. Finally, in order to market its seeds internationally, the NFSC should determine the export potential for seed from selected species such as Pinus kesiya, Pinus merkusii, Tectona grandis, Acacia auriculiformis and selected indigenous hardwood species...|$|E

According to the inventory, as of 2014, at <b>forest</b> <b>seed</b> plantations and at the archives of clones grow 4. 837 grafted trees of 282 clones, 139 of whichare progenies of the elite trees, selected for seed production, 124 – for resin production, and 19 – for the productivity and quality of stem wood. All clonal facilities are concentrated on breeding nursery of the Teletskoe forestry district area of about 75 ha. Unique clonal objects of the Siberian stone pine in Teletskoe forestry district {{play a crucial role in}} the preservation, study and rational use of the gene pool of this tree species and require continuous monitoring of their condition and protection. Visual forest pathology inspections and molecular genetic diagnostics revealed that on clonal plantations of the Siberian stone pine, progressive needle disease developed, caused by new for Western Siberia an extremely dangerous pathogen – Dothistroma septosporum (Dorog.) M. Morelet. In this connection it is necessary to conduct appropriate sanitary measures and to carry out additional studies of population genetic features and pathways for this pathogen. The priority activities have been outlined to further development of the unified genetic and breeding complex of the Siberian stone pine in the Republic of Altai...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{recovery}} of abandoned tropical pastures to secondary rainforest benefits from the arrival of seeds from adjacent rainforest patches. Less is known, however, about how the structural attributes of adjacent rainforest (e. g. tree density, canopy cover and tree height) impact seed rain patterns into abandoned pastures. Between 2011 and 2013, we used seed traps and ground seed surveys to track the richness and abundance of rainforest seeds entering abandoned pastures in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s wet tropics. We also tested how seed rain diversity is related to the distance from forest, the proportion of forest cover in the landscape and several structural attributes of adjacent forest patches, specifically average tree height, canopy cover, tree species richness and density. Almost no seeds were captured in elevated pasture seed traps, even near forest remnants. Abundant <b>forest</b> <b>seeds</b> were found in ground surveys but only within 10 m of forest edges. In ground surveys, seeds from wind-dispersed species were more abundant, but less species rich, than animal-dispersed species. A survey of pasture seedling recruits suggested that some <b>forest</b> <b>seeds</b> must be dispersing more than 10 m into pasture at very low frequencies, but only a few species are establishing there. Recruits were predominantly animal-dispersed not wind-dispersed species. In addition to distance from forest and the proportion of forest within a 100 - to 200 -m radius of sampling sites, the richness and density of adjacent forest trees were the most important factors for explaining the probability of seed occurrence in abandoned pastures. Results suggest that without some restoration assistance, the recovery of abandoned pastures into secondary rainforest in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s tropical rainforests will likely be limited, at least in part, by a very low rate of seed dispersal away from forest edges and by the diversity and density of trees in adjacent remnant forests...|$|R
