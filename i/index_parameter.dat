5000|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{a continuous}} stochastic {{process is a}} type of stochastic process that may be said to be [...] "continuous" [...] as a function of its [...] "time" [...] or <b>index</b> <b>parameter.</b> Continuity is a nice property for (the sample paths of) a process to have, since it implies that they are well-behaved in some sense, and, therefore, much easier to analyze. It is implicit here that the index of the stochastic process is a continuous variable. Some authors define a [...] "continuous (stochastic) process" [...] as only requiring that the index variable be continuous, without continuity of sample paths: in some terminology, this would be a continuous-time stochastic process, in parallel to a [...] "discrete-time process". Given the possible confusion, caution is needed.|$|E

The <b>index</b> <b>parameter</b> appearing in the model summarizes {{the effect of the}} covariates in a finite dimensional vector.

40|$|We {{consider}} semiparametric {{estimation of}} the tail <b>index</b> <b>parameter</b> from i. i. d. observations in Pareto and Weibull type models, using a local and asymptotic approach. The slowly varying function describing the non-tail behavior of the distribution is considered as infinite dimensional nuisance parameter. Without further regularity conditions, we derive a Local Asymptotic Normality (LAN) result that describes essentially the least favorable submodel for the tail <b>index</b> <b>parameter.</b> From this result, we immediately obtain the optimal rate of convergence of tail <b>index</b> <b>parameter</b> estimators for more specific models previously studied. On top of the optimal rate of convergence, our LAN result also gives the minimal limiting variance of (regular) semiparametric estimators through the convolution theorem. We show that the Hill estimator is also semiparametrically efficient in the Pareto case in this much stronger sense. We also discuss the Weibull model in this respect.

The same method can be used to determine the plastic limit according to the known relationship between soil moisture content and depth of cone penetration. This relationship is non-linear, yet becomes linear on a log-log scale resulting in a simple methodof determination of liquid limit and plastic limit values. This technical note determines the soil properties that define these <b>index</b> <b>parameters.</b> Experimentally obtained results suggest that the <b>index</b> <b>parameters</b> primarily depend on the type, size, and quantity of the clay minerals in soil.

40|$|Estimating {{the tail}} <b>index</b> <b>parameter</b> {{is one of}} the primal {{objectives}} in extreme value theory. For heavy-tailed distributions the Hill estimator is the most popular way to estimate the tail <b>index</b> <b>parameter.</b> Improving the Hill estimator was aimed by recent works with different methods, for example by using bootstrap, or Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric. These methods are asymptotically consistent, but for tail index ξ > 1 and smaller sample sizes the estimation fails to approach the theoretical value for realistic sample sizes. In this paper, we introduce a new empirical method, which can estimate high tail index parameters well and might also be useful for relatively small sample sizes.

40|$|We {{propose a}} two-step pseudo-maximum {{likelihood}} procedure for semiparametric single-index regression models where the conditional variance is a known {{function of the}} regression and an additional parameter. The Poisson single-index regression with multiplicative unobserved heterogeneity {{is an example of}} such models. Our procedure is based on linear exponential densities with nuisance parameter. The pseudo-likelihood criterion we use contains a nonparametric estimate of the index regression and therefore a rule for choosing the smoothing parameter is needed. We propose an automatic and natural rule based on the joint maximization of the pseudo-likelihood with respect to the <b>index</b> <b>parameter</b> and the smoothing parameter. We derive the asymptotic properties of the semiparametric estimator of the <b>index</b> <b>parameter</b> and the asymptotic behavior of our `optimal' smoothing parameter. The finite sample performances of our methodology are analyzed using simulated and real data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due the cursive {{nature of}} the Arabic scripts {{automatic}} recognition of keywords using computers is very difficult. Content based indexing using textual, graphical and visual information combined provides a more realistic and practical approach {{to the problem of}} indexing large collection of calligraphic material. Starting with low level patter recognition and feature extraction techniques, graphical representations of the calligraphic material can be captured to form the low level <b>indexing</b> <b>parameters.</b> These parameters are then enhanced using textual and visual information provided by the users. Through visual feedback and visual interaction, recognized textual information can be used to enhance the <b>indexing</b> <b>parameter</b> and in return improve the retrieval of the calligraphic material. In this paper, we report an implementation of the system and show how visual feedback and visual interaction helps to improve the <b>indexing</b> <b>parameters</b> created using the low-level image feature extraction technologies. ...|$|R

We also study the mathematical properties of the solution of the inverse problem consisting in the determination of the values of the biocompatibility <b>index</b> <b>parameters</b> from the knowledge of some fibrous capsule tissue measurements. We prove that this model calibration problem admits a unique solution, and establish a characterization of the <b>index</b> <b>parameters.</b> Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically that such a solution is not continuous with respect to the data, and therefore the considered inverse problem is ill-posed {{due to the lack of}} the stability requirement. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
