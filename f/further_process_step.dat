DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises spraying {{a component of}} metal oxide layer through highly ionized, pulsed high-power magnetron sputtering and then condensing on a substrate. The pulse of the magnetron has a peak power density that is greater than 3. 0 kW/cm 2, a time duration of less than or equal to 35 mu s, and a frequency of 350 Hz to 2 kHz. The average current flow density gradient is 106 A/(ms cm 2) during igniting the plasma within a time interval of less than or equal to 0. 025 ms. A ceramic target is sprayed for the production of metal oxide layer. A metallic target is sprayed in a reactive gas process under addition of oxygen for the production of metal oxide layer. The temperature in which the substrate is coated with the metal oxide is less than 100 degrees C. The metal oxide layer is produced with a fine crystalline structure, whose lateral and vertical grain size is less than 35 nm. The substrate is tempered with a metal oxide layer in a <b>further</b> <b>process</b> <b>step.</b> The metal oxide layer retains its crystallinity and/or the crystallite size after tempering. The crystallite size change is less than 10 % after the tempering. The magnetron is operated without arc discharge-handling. USE - Method for the production of transparent and conductive metal oxide layer on substrate. ADVANTAGE - The method ensures efficient production of transparent and conductive metal oxide layer on substrate with good mechanical and optical properties...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} fast {{fabrication}} technique to achieve SU- 8 structures with sloped side walls. We investigate {{the method of}} ‘Step-and-Flash’ which combines hot embossing with UV sensitive materials. The stamps are fabricated in Si by KOH etching to achieve mesa structures with side walls at a 54. 7 ° angle to the bottom. These stamps are imprinted into SU- 8 -coated Pyrex wafers during the soft bake step of the SU- 8 processing, under ambient conditions. The SU- 8 is exposed through the Pyrex wafer and after a post exposure bake the stamp can be removed as the SU- 8 is cross-linked – leaving stamp replicates in the SU- 8. We have optimized the method and show that further processing of the structures is possible. We believe this method to be highly suitable for pattering sloped side wall structures in SU- 8 as it can easily be incorporated into a standard SU- 8 fabrication scheme without adding <b>further</b> <b>process</b> <b>steps,</b> as well as performed under ambient conditions...|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous {{integration}} bridges the {{gap between}} nanoelectronics and its derived applications. Currently MEMS and their signal conditioning ASICs are produced and packaged at different industry sectors (different jabs). To reduce costs and enhance Yield and performance {{at the same time}} this quite expensive way of packaging has to be modified. This paper presents a different pack-aging concept. It uses standard redistribution layer technology (RDL) to package thinned chips on a full wafer substrate e. g. thinned ASIC chips on a MEMS wafer. For this approach no Through Silicon Vias (TSV) are needed Standard chips can be used without redesign. Only Known Good Dies (KGDs) are packaged with the cost benefit of wafer level technology. At the starting point for this type of packaging both ASIC and MEMS chips are still parts of full wafers. The wafer with the larger sized chips (e. g. MEMS chips) is used as a substrate for the <b>further</b> <b>process</b> <b>steps.</b> The wafer with the smaller sized chips (e. g. ASIC chips) is thinned down on wafer level to a thickness of 10 mu m to 40 mu m and diced. These thinned chips are glued onto the base wafer with a polymer layer (BCB from Dow Chemical). The polymer has been deposited and structured before gluing the next chip on top. After placement of the thinned chips the wafer is again coated with BCB to embed the chips. This polymer layer is photostructured to open contact pads on the base chips {{as well as on the}} embedded chips. The next step is the built-up of metal routing. Here a semi-additive process is used, which means electroplating on a sputter seed layer of TiW/Cu. This metal layer is followed by another polymer layer for passivation and acting as a solder mask. Then Under Bump Metallization (UBM) is applied again by electroplating. Finally Balling is done either by Ball Placement or by Solder Paste Printing. Now the wafer is diced and the full ASIC-MEMS package can be flip chiped onto a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The technology will be demonstrated by the project RESTLES (Reliable System Level Integration of Stacked Chips on MEMS). RESTLES will integrate technologies like silicon MEMS, ASIC, wafer thinning, chip stacking and flip chip to one pack-aged chip stack at die scale. The influence of the heterogeneous stack on performance and control mechanisms to eliminate parasitic effects will be investigated...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{polishing}} {{of glass}} {{is a time}} consuming process especially for lenses deviating from spherical surface such as aspheres. With laser polishing, the processing time can be significantly reduced and the wear of hard tooling can be avoided. Using laser radiation for polishing, a thin surface layer of the glass is heated up just below evaporation temperature due to the interaction of glass material and laser radiation. With increasing temperature, the reduced viscosity in the surface layer leads to {{the reduction of the}} roughness due to the surface tension. Hence, a contactless polishing method can be realized nearly without any loss of material or need of polishing agent. In this paper, results for laser polishing of fused silica, BK 7, and S-TIH 6 are presented with area rates up to 5 [*]cm 2 /s. However, the results show that the achieved roughness with laser polishing is strongly influenced by the thermal properties of the type of glass. During laser polishing, the glass material is relocated at the surface, thus no shape errors can be corrected. To reduce the residual waviness and shape errors after laser polishing, the authors investigated a <b>further</b> laser-based <b>process</b> <b>step</b> (laser beam figuring, LBF) which ablates material for a shape correction. Ablation depths < 5 [*]nm allow a high precision laser ablation for selective processing. For both processes, a CO 2 laser is used...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} Sharia Bank in Indonesia has {{increased}} significantly {{during the year}} of 2011. The increase of the growth is contributed by the increase of funding and financing products of Sharia Banks. Risk management and funding and financing products of a bank are things that have a very close relationship in the Sharia banking. Bank Indonesia as central bank also has {{a special interest in}} establishing provisions to all banks in Indonesia to be able to manage their risks. Risks posed to Sharia Banks have several types inherited from products or services offerred to their customer. One of them is legal risk. Legal risks may derive from the weaknesses of legal aspects of products or services of Sharia Bank. Therefore, Mudharabah Muqayyadah On Balance Sheet (MMOB) as a product of PT Bank XYZ which has nature of funding as well as financing, poses legal risks originate from the weaknesses of its legal aspects. Legal risk in a transaction may be in the form of incomplete requirements for a valid agreement which may originates from several factors of legal risks. Factors of legal risk of a transaction cover incorrect legal structure, absence of consent of the parties, absence of competence of the parties, no certain objects, no permissible cause, imperfect clauses in the agreement, and incomplete legal documents. This final project is composed to identify the legal risks that may arise from MMOB transaction, its risk priority and the way to mitigate such legal risks. Legal risks of MMOB transaction derived from the weaknesess of legal aspects of MMOB Transaction. Legal risks of MMOB transaction occur in every <b>steps</b> of MMOB <b>process.</b> MMOB <b>process</b> <b>steps</b> consist of <b>Process</b> <b>Step</b> 1 Offering Product to Customer, <b>Process</b> <b>Step</b> 2 Product/Transaction Explanation, <b>Process</b> <b>Step</b> 3 Structure Selection, <b>Process</b> <b>Step</b> 4 Prepare Legal Document, and <b>Process</b> <b>Step</b> 5 Closing Transaction.
