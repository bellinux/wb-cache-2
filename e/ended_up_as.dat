5|$|Although he {{was also}} Prime Minister of Romania for three {{mandates}} (1918, 1920–1921, 1926–1927), his political success is not as spectacular as the military one. Averescu <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> one of the pawns maneuvered by Brătianu. Argetoianu later repeatedly expressed his distaste for Averescu's hesitant stance and openness to compromise.|$|E

The British television producer Gerry Anderson also stated that he provided a film treatment (although originally planned to be Moonraker) much similar to what <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E

5|$|Fredericton served {{during the}} Battle of the Atlantic from 1941 to 1945. During 1942 she escorted oil tankers from the Caribbean to New York City. From 1943 to 1945 she escorted convoys in the Western Atlantic {{and then later}} on across the Atlantic to Northern Ireland. She was {{decommissioned}} on 14 July 1945. Some question as to her final disposition lies with a possible error in Lloyd's Register.

Barea accumulated 110 points in 5 games, for an average of 22.0 points per game. Barea's scoring statistics were above players like Luis Scola, Andray Blatche, Pau Gasol, and Francisco García.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1947, {{immediately}} after a Great Britain versus Rest of Europe match in Glasgow (Britain won 6–1), {{he made the}} move for £11,500, {{at the age of}} 32. The match itself raised £30,000 for the four Home Nations Football Associations, and since the eleven British players received £14 each, Matthews questioned where exactly this money ended up – he doubted that much of it <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> funding for grass-roots football.|$|E

The December election <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> a failure {{for the opposition}} to Milošević, as Ćosić {{pulled out of the}} campaign in the last moment due to health problems. Multiple politicians of the opposition parties criticized the US-instigated fossil-fuel sanctions {{in the midst of a}} cold 1992-93 winter, saying that they actually further helped sympathy for Milošević and not against him.|$|E

5|$|John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during the Wars of the Roses. The Clifford family {{was one of}} the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century; and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon. He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, who <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.|$|E

A total of 45 F-4As were built and none saw combat and most <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> test or training aircraft. The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which {{was equipped with}} the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a Texas Instruments AAA-4 Infra-red search and track pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900lbf (48.5kN) dry and 16,950lbf (75.4kN) afterburner (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and VF-121 Pacemakers receiving the first examples at NAS Miramar.|$|E
5|$|The church {{featured}} ample {{exterior and}} interior decoration. While the facades were decorated with arches and ceramic tiles, the interior floor mosaics were made of white, yellow and pink marble as well as semi-precious gemstones like sapphire and porphyry. The interior walls were covered with frescoes and mosaics. However, none of the interior decoration has survived. During the church's 20th-century reconstruction, its interior was repainted by artist Teofan Sokerov, who depicted important moments of medieval Bulgarian history in a modernist style. Due to these murals, the church has never been reconsecrated and remains inactive. The facade of the cathedral also includes a stone with a donor's inscription of a Bulgarian ruler, which <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the building}} material.|$|E

The National Coalition Party (NCP) also <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> the biggest party {{for the first time}} in its history. The total turnout rose to 70.5% from 67.9% in the previous election; and corruption scandals also {{resulted in a}}n anti-incumbency vote. The incumbent, Centre Party-led coalition, which included the NCP, Green League and Swedish People's Party (SPP), lost its majority by two seats and their Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party signaled that her party would then sit in opposition.|$|E
5|$|Whilst playing {{part-time}} for Distillery he {{also worked}} at the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding company. Though the maximum wage in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined {{to leave for the}} English Football League at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955. He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat Glentoran 1–0 in the second replay of the 1956 final of the Irish Cup at Windsor Park. He played mostly at half-back in the 1956–57 season as Distillery finished sixth in the Irish League and <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> runners-up in the Ulster Cup, City Cup, and County Antrim Shield.|$|E
5|$|After the hot start, a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February occurred {{during which the}} Senators won only seven of 21 games, and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27, 2008, taking over the coaching duties himself. After the coaching switch, team performance improved but did not match {{the performance of the}} beginning of the season. A playoff spot was in doubt until the Senators' last game of the season, a loss to Boston, but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing. After all other games were played, the team <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round, a repeat of the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators lost the series four games to none, the third time they were swept in a first-round series. The result, after going to the Finals the previous season, led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season, including the buy-out of Ray Emery and the Senators not re-signing their free agents.|$|E

5|$|Cynesige {{had been}} a royal clerk prior to his {{appointment}} to York in 1051, although the monks of Peterborough Abbey maintained that he {{had been a}} monk in their house. It is possible he was both a monk and a royal clerk. He delayed his visit to Rome to receive his pallium until 1055, when he was given it by Pope Victor II. During his time as archbishop he was claimed to have consecrated both John and Magsuen as Bishops of Glasgow, although the two bishops probably never lived in their diocese. John may have <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>as</b> the Bishop of Mecklenburg in Germany. Cynesige dedicated the church of the Abbey of Waltham Holy Cross in the presence of King Edward the Confessor around 3 May 1060. This was at the invitation of Earl Harold Godwinson of Wessex. The chronicle of Waltham Abbey states that Cynesige did the consecration because the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant. However, there was an occupant of Canterbury, Stigand, but his election to Canterbury was not considered canonical by the papacy, and Harold may have excluded him because of concerns about Stigand's canonical status.|$|E
