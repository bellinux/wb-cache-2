This can be overridden by the page author using the tabindex attribute, or by disabling a form field.|$|R
50|$|The ribbon interface, {{introduced}} in Office 2007, is fully customizable and included in all apps in Office 2010.Users can add or rename custom ribbon tabs and groups, add additional commands to the <b>default</b> <b>tabs,</b> and hide tabs {{that are not}} used. Users can also export or import any customization changes made to the ribbon (to facilitate backups, deployment, or sharing) or reset all ribbon customizations.|$|R

25|$|A native {{version for}} the C128 called SpeedScript 128, also written by Kodadek, was finally {{released}} in October 1987. This version eliminated {{the problems of}} the patch and took full advantage of the C128's 80-column screen, its expanded memory and the enhanced keyboard. A later update appeared in September 1989, adding full text justification, <b>tab</b> <b>setting,</b> and online help.|$|R
50|$|IE7Pro modifies Internet Explorer's <b>default</b> <b>tab</b> {{management}} {{features to}} add several options like double clicking {{to close the}} tab, undo closing tabs, enable Super Drag n Drop where dragging a link and dropping it anywhere else on the page opens it in a new tab or dragging and dropping any selected chunk of text opens the results of searching it via the default search engine. IE7Pro also adds an ad blocker that uses a blacklist of sites to block ads in web pages. It can also block ads delivered as rich media such as flash movies. It also allows crash recovery, which lets a browsing session be restored in case the browser crashed. The contents of a tab can be saved as an image as well.|$|R
5000|$|Initially <b>tab</b> stops were <b>set</b> {{by adding}} and {{removing}} clips from the tab rack, but Edward Hess {{working for the}} Royal Typewriter Company filed for a patent in 1904 covering a system where the tab stops were permanently mounted on the <b>tab</b> bar. To <b>set</b> or reset a tab for a particular column, the tab stop for that column was simply rotated {{in or out of}} engagement. [...] In 1940, James Koca filed for a patent on a mechanism allowing the tab stops for each column to be set and cleared from the keyboard, eliminating the need for the typist to bend {{over the back of the}} machine to directly manipulate the tab rack. [...] These keys, if present, are typically labeled <b>tab</b> <b>set</b> and <b>tab</b> clear.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{changes were}} made to the user interface. By <b>default,</b> <b>tabs</b> are now {{on the top of the}} window, above the {{location}} bar in the area formerly occupied by the window's title bar. The [...] "stop" [...] "reload" [...] and [...] "go" [...] buttons have been combined into a single button, placed on the right side of the address bar. The button changes dynamically based upon the current state of the page. On Windows Vista and Windows 7, the menu bar is hidden by default with the most common actions moved to a new [...] "Firefox" [...] menu in the upper left hand corner of the browser. Users can create persistent [...] "app tabs", and customize the tab bar, as well as the bookmark and navigation bars. Many of these features are similar to ones introduced by Google Chrome.|$|R
40|$|The O- 2 ((1) Delta) /I- 2 {{mixing process}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} steps in chemical oxygen-iodine laser (COIL). Based on the chemical fluorescence method (CFM), a diagnostic system was set up to image electronically excited fluorescent I- 2 (B- 3 Pi(o)) by means of a high speed camera. An optimized data analysis approach was proposed to analyze the mixing process of supersonic oxygen-iodine parallel streams, employing a set of qualitative and quantitative parameters and a proper percentage boundary threshold of the fluorescence zone. A slit nozzle bank with supersonic parallel streams and a trip <b>tab</b> <b>set</b> for enhancing the mixing process were designed and fabricated. With the diagnostic system and the data analysis approach, the performance of the trip <b>tab</b> <b>set</b> was examined and is demonstrated in this work. With the mixing enhancement, the fluorescence zone area was enlarged 3. 75 times. We have studied the mixing process under different flow conditions and demonstrated the mixing properties with different iodine buffer gases, including N- 2, Ar, He and CO 2. It was found that, among the four tested gases, Ar had the best penetration ability, whilst He showed the best free diffusion ability, and both of them could be well used as the buffer gas in our experiments. These experimental results can be useful for designing and optimizing COIL systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} these problems, some integrated development environments, such as recent versions of XEmacs and Microsoft's Visual Studio, provide a hybrid interface which allows splitting the parent window into multiple MDI-like [...] "panes," [...] each {{with their own}} separate TDI <b>tab</b> <b>set.</b> Tiling window managers such as Ion {{do the same for}} the entire desktop. This provides many of the advantages of both MDI and TDI, although it can still be difficult for users to get used to. The Konqueror browser by KDE (available on Unix and Unix work-alikes, such as Linux, and Windows) supports multiple documents within one tab by splitting documents. In a Konqueror tab, documents can be split horizontally or vertically, and each split document can be re-split.|$|R
5000|$|The board {{released}} RIFC's {{annual accounts}} on 28 October which revealed annual losses had been halved to £3.3m and turnover increased to £22.2m, however, further funding {{was required to}} maintain the business as a going concern. In March 2017, a decision Takeover Appeal Board (TAB) following a complaint by former Rangers chairman David Somers ruled that Dave King had been acting in concerted with other investors during King's March 2015 boardroom takeover. This meant that King was liable to purchase all of the shares in RIFC, with the <b>TAB</b> <b>setting</b> a price of 20p per share. A few days later, RIFC revealed an operating profit of £300,000 in unaudited results for the six months to 31 December 2016, although this equated to a pre-tax loss of £278,000.|$|R

Its version number, 1607, means that it was supposed to launch in July 2016, however it was delayed until August [...] 2016. Tons of new features were included in the version, including more integration with Cortana, a dark theme, browser extension support for Microsoft Edge, click-to-play Flash by <b>default,</b> <b>tab</b> pinning, web notifications, swipe navigation in Edge, and the ability for Windows Hello to use a fingerprint sensor to sign into apps and websites, similar to Touch ID on the iPhone. Also added was Windows Ink, which improves digital inking in many apps, and the Windows Ink Workspace which lists pen-compatible apps, as well as quick shortcuts to a sticky notes app and a sketchpad. Microsoft, through their partnership with Canonical, integrated a full Ubuntu bash shell via the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Notable tweaks in this version of Windows 10 include the removal of the controversial password-sharing feature of Microsoft's Wi-Fi Sense service, a slightly redesigned Start menu, Tablet Mode working more like Windows 8, overhauled emoji, improvements to the lock screen, calendar integration in the taskbar, and the Blue Screen of Death now showing a QR code which users can scan to quickly find out what caused the error.

50|$|The {{nose and}} cabin {{transparencies}} are smoothly contoured, with no windscreen step, and entry is by an upward opening door {{on each side}} forward of the wing leading edge. There are transparencies aft {{of those in the}} doors, placed over the wing. A baggage space has a maximum volume of 0.20 m3 (7.0 cu ft), depending on layout details. The upper fuselage line drops gently behind the cabin to the T-tail, where the fin is integral with the fuselage, straight edged and swept, with a backward leaning rudder hinge. The rudder, with a swept trailing edge, has a horn balance extending forward of the hinge line under the fuselage, where it is faired into a small ventral fin. There is a small, electrically activated rudder trim <b>tab,</b> <b>set</b> low down. A high aspect ratio, rectangular tailplane is placed on top of the fin, bearing a similarly shaped one piece elevator. This has a central trim tab.|$|R
50|$|The {{first test}} flight was {{conducted}} by Harold Dale on 30 March 1956. The aircraft completed several spin tests, but during one test the canopy opened and the aircraft went into an inverted spin. The pilot bailed out safely and the prototype crashed after performing an unmanned inverted loop. It was later found that the trim <b>tab</b> was <b>set</b> to full nose-down attitude during the test. A scheduled demonstration of the aircraft for the U.S. Navy was canceled. No other Weejets were produced.|$|R
25|$|Investigation of {{the crash}} {{uncovered}} some errors in the information {{used to determine the}} position of the aircraft's centre of gravity. It became clear that the aircraft had taken off with its centre of gravity slightly outside the approved limits. Investigators also found evidence that the takeoff may have been performed with the elevator trim <b>tab</b> still <b>set</b> for landing. If the elevator trim tab had not been set for takeoff this would have been exacerbated by the incorrect position of the centre of gravity and the aircraft would have been uncontrollable.|$|R

Labels in a [...] statement are aligned with the enclosing block (there is only one level of indents). A single-statement body of a compound statement (such as if, while, and do-while) need not be surrounded by curly braces. If, however, one or more of the substatements in an [...] statement require braces, then both substatements should be wrapped inside curly braces. Line length is limited to 80 characters.|$|R
5000|$|The non-coupled {{selenium}} cell exposure meter reads out in exposure values (EVs) only. The camera is then {{set to the}} proper EV setting via an easily reached aperture release tab, though the EV scale itself is rather inconveniently located {{on the underside of}} the lens assembly. Once the aperture release <b>tab</b> is <b>set</b> and released, the shutter ring is coupled to the aperture ring - moving the shutter ring automatically moves the aperture ring, so that the same exposure value is maintained. In other words, when in use, the camera is normally locked into one EV setting until the aperture release tab is pressed. Needless to say this can be confusing to those unfamiliar with the camera.|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] It {{has been}} {{suggested}} in some American investigations that differential gearing, combined with adjustment of the aileron floating angle {{by means of a}} tab, may be a powerful method of balancing ailerons. This report sets out the theory of this method of balance and analysesit in relation to the most pressing problem of aileron design, which is to obtain close balance at high speed without overbalance in any part of the range, or uncomfortable lightness at slow speed. It is shown that this result can be achieved more directly by differential balance than by any other method if the differential and the <b>tab</b> <b>setting</b> are nicely adjusted to the natural floating properties of the aileron. Thus if the aileron tends to float up as incidence increases, a differential giving more downward than upward movement must be used, and this must be combined with an upward-set tab; while if the aileron tends to float down as the incidence increases, a differential giving more upward than downward movement must be used, combined with a downset tab. After examining the possible disadvantages of the downward differential, and the loads set up by the tab, it is concluded that there is a strong case for exploration in flight of differential gearing as a major means of aileron bMance. Some notes on the geometry of differential gearing are given in an Appendix. 1. Introduction. [...] In the past,. when ailerons have been moved differentially, it has always been with the object rather of improving the rolling moments than of lightening the stick force. -The potentiality of differential gearing as a major means of aileion balance has been broache...|$|R
5000|$|Users {{could control}} {{placement}} of text by means of: margins; indentation; normal tab stops; decimal <b>tab</b> stops, which <b>set</b> {{the position of}} the decimal point rather than the start of a number; and left, right or full justification. Different combinations of these settings, called [...] "layouts", were automatically numbered, which made it possible to re-use layouts and to make changes that applied to all parts of a document where a specified layout was used. These facilities could be used for presenting tables.|$|R
50|$|The GNU Emacs {{text editor}} and the GNU systems' indent command will {{reformat}} code {{according to this}} style by default. Those who do not use GNU Emacs, or similarly extensible/customisable editors, may find that the automatic indenting settings of their editor are unhelpful for this style. However, many editors defaulting to KNF style cope well with the GNU style when the <b>tab</b> width is <b>set</b> to two spaces; likewise, GNU Emacs adapts well to KNF style by simply <b>setting</b> the <b>tab</b> width to eight spaces. In both cases, automatic reformatting destroys the original spacing, but automatic line indenting will work properly.|$|R
