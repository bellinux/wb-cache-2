50|$|Basic {{performance}} data include a 120 km/h maximum speed, a 56° gradeability (150%) {{and a maximum}} <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> of 0.700 m.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle had a <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> of 0.70 metres and {{was able}} to climb 60° gradients, clear {{vertical}} obstacles of 0.60 metres in height or cross trenches 1.60 metres wide.|$|E
50|$|The {{top speed}} of SA-240 is 97 km/h and its range is 600 km. The {{cross-country}} mobility is good due to bending frame and good weight distribution. The maximum gradient is 60% and side slope 40%. The vehicle can climb on 0.6 m high step and cross a one metre wide trench. The <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> is one metre.|$|E
50|$|The first, {{second and}} sixth road wheel {{stations}} are fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers. The tank can negotiate a gradient of 320 and side slope of 250. Equally, the tank can <b>ford</b> a water <b>depth</b> of 5m using deep water fording equipment.|$|R
50|$|He {{became the}} starter at {{quarterback in the}} seventh game of his sophomore season, after passing Daniel <b>Ford</b> on the <b>depth</b> chart. He {{completed}} 56% (84 of 150) of his passes, threw for 1,063 yards, 5 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, while helping the team post a 6-5 record.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{powered by a}} [...] Mitisubishi 8 HA 21 WT V8 diesel engine mounted behind the bow gunner. Its tracks were fitted with five road wheels, with a drive wheel at the front and an idler wheel at the rear. Torsion bar {{suspension}} was fitted. No night vision equipment or NBC protection was fitted. The vehicle could <b>ford</b> to a <b>depth</b> of 1 m.|$|R
50|$|Depth {{soundings}} in {{the gulf}} have ranged from <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> at the estuary near Yuma, Arizona, to in excess of 3000 m in the deepest parts. The depth of the water helps to determine its temperature. For example, shallow depths are directly influenced by the local temperature of the air, while deeper waters are less susceptible to changes in air temperature.|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{gradient}} is 60% and side slope 30%. The highest vertical step the vehicle can climb is 0.5 metres and the trenching capability is 0.6 metres. The maximum <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> is 0.8 metres. Raisu's cross-country mobility {{is good and}} it can be quickly moved to a new site. This is a key benefit compared to conventional, heavier tank-based applications.|$|E
50|$|The ZSU-23-4 {{can cross}} {{vertical}} obstacles 0.7 m (2.3') high, trenches 2.5 m (8.2') wide, has a 1.0 m (3.3') <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> and can climb 30° gradients. The ZSU-23-4 has good maneuverability and cross-country ability, but its diesel engine's power is insufficient for a vehicle of its weight. As a result, off-road acceleration capabilities are sub-par, and the vehicle lags behind MBTs and IFVs on up-hill terrain.|$|E
50|$|The MULE's unique, highly {{advanced}} 6x6 independent articulated suspension, {{coupled with}} in-hub motors powering each wheel, provided extreme mobility in complex terrain, far exceeding that of vehicles utilizing more conventional suspension systems. It could climb {{at least a}} 1-meter step traverse side slopes greater than 40 percent, <b>ford</b> water to <b>depths</b> over 0.5 meters and overpass obstacles as high as 0.5 meters, while compensating for varying payload weights and center of gravity locations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a Detroit Diesel/MTU Friedrichshafen 926 {{turbo-diesel}} with [...] and 959 lbft Nm torque. There was optional rear wheel steering, {{along with a}} central tire inflation system and VFI runflat tires. It was capable of <b>fording</b> water at <b>depth</b> of 30" [...] (60" [...] with preparation). It featured an electronically controlled braking (ABS) system and electronic stability control (ECS). There was 30 kW onboard electrical power and 10 kW mobile power.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{mission profile}} of an ASV {{involves}} 50% travel primary roads, 30% travel on secondary roads, and 20% cross-country travel. It uses a model MD3560 Allison Transmission. Front and rear independent suspension provides smooth highway speeds {{of up to}} 70 mi/h km/h, while {{it is capable of}} <b>fording</b> 5 ft <b>depths</b> of water, climbing gradients of 60%, negotiating 30% side slope, and overcoming obstacles of five feet. Its turning radius is 27.5 ft, and it has 18 in ground clearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{was similar}} to the standard Kangoo, only strengthened and raised to provide more ground clearance and wheel travel. These changes gave the Kangoo Trekka a 400 mm <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> and 28 degree hill climbing capability. The Kangoo Trekka was marketed in the United Kingdom with a choice of two engines, the 1.6 L 16 valve petrol engine and the 1.9 L dCi common-rail turbodiesel.|$|E
50|$|On dry {{and stiff}} surface {{the vehicle is}} capable to climb 60% steep uphill and {{downhill}} forward and by reversing. Uphill start is possible on this gradient by help of interlocks. The nominal <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> is 0.8 m, but 1.2-metre depth is achievable with preparation. The angles of approach and departure are 35°. Maximum side slope is 30% and vertical step about 0.6 metres. The terrain capability is further enhanced by a front-mounted hydraulic 150-kN self-recovery winch. The climatic operation range is from -55 °C to +50 °C.|$|E
5000|$|However, all {{variants}} retain an M2 Browning [...]50 caliber machine gun, 432 mm ground clearance, 2.6 m <b>fording</b> <b>depth,</b> 1.1 m wall {{climb and}} 2.6 m trench crossing capabilities. There {{has been no}} major deviation in battlefield role through the M88 series, the later models are merely able to lift heavier loads. The M88A1 was designed around the now obsolete M60 Patton tanks, so it was {{in light of the}} fact that two M88A1's were required to tow the new M1 Abrams tank that the decision was made to upgrade to the M88A2 in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{problem in}} the design of the Maus was developing an engine and drivetrain which was powerful enough to propel the tank, yet small enough to fit inside it — as it was meant to use the same sort of [...] "hybrid drive", using an internal-combustion engine to operate an electric generator to power its tracks with electric motor units, much as its Ferdinand Porsche-designed predecessors, the VK 3001 (P), VK 4501 (P), and Elefant had. The drive train was electrical, designed to provide a maximum speed of 20 km/h and a minimum speed of 1.5 km/h. However, during actual field testing, the maximum speed achieved on hard surfaces was 13 km/h with full motor field, and by weakening the motor field to a minimum, a top speed of 22 km/h was achieved. The vehicle's weight made it unable to utilize most bridges, instead it was intended to <b>ford</b> to a <b>depth</b> of 2 m or submerge up to a depth of 8 m and use a snorkel to cross rivers.|$|R
50|$|Generation Warriors - Sassinak {{has made}} a career out of {{fighting}} the pirates that destroyed her home. Through determination, and a certain disregard for personal safety, she has gained the wholehearted respect of her crew, human and heavyworlder alike. Having found a new family in Fleet, she had long since abandoned her search for relatives, but in an unlikely turn of events, she may find not only the family she thought lost, but the key to the puzzle that has been her life's pursuit - and a plot as big as the Federation itself - but in order to bring those involved to justice, she will need all her training and skill... And more than a little luck. After yet another long sleep, Lunzie finds herself called upon to help bring down a crime syndicate that has managed to remain hidden for more than a century. But to do so will require her to face her two greatest fears. Dupaynil thought himself clever. And his assignment, to probe Sassinak's crew for a saboteur was certainly not beyond his ability, but he made a dreadful mistake in thinking that he was smarter than Sassinak. Everyone knows that heavyworlders have long been a part of piracy, and new evidence proves it, but without proof that someone else is pulling their strings, the heavyworlders will take the blame, and those in charge will just start over somewhere else. Fordliton is Sassinak's executive officer and friend. And maybe more than a friend. But what Sassinak doesn't know yet, is that <b>Ford</b> has <b>depths</b> of his own. And connections that could be the key to determining once and for all who is behind the Planet Pirates.|$|R
25|$|The 2S6 combat vehicle {{uses the}} GM-352 and later GM-352M chassis {{developed}} and {{produced by the}} Minsk Tractor Plant (MTZ) which has six road wheels with hydropneumatic suspension on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear and three return rollers. An NBC system is also integrated into the chassis, which is protected -as the entire vehicle- from small arms fire (7,62) and shell splinters by the armor, {{as well as an}} automatic fire suppression system, an automatic gear change and diagnostic capability are available with latest Tunguska-M1 which uses the new GM-5975 chassis developed and produced by MMZ. GM-5975.25 has a cruising range of 500km and a maximum speed of 65km per hour. It can function at a relative humidity of 98 per cent at 35 degrees C, in ambient temperatures of −50 degrees C to 50 degrees C and up to an altitude of 3,000 m. It has an ability of climb up to 35 degrees, can cross slopes of 25 degrees, 2 m width ditch, 1 m <b>depth</b> <b>ford.</b> Overall, the layout is similar to the previous ZSU-23-4 with a large central 360-degree rotating turret (designated the 2A40) containing the armament, sensors and three of the crew: the commander, gunner and radar operator. The driver sits in the front left of the hull, with a gas turbine APU to his right and the multi-fuel diesel engine {{in the rear of the}} hull.|$|R
50|$|The G63 AMG 6×6 is 5875 mm in length, 2110 mm {{in width}} and 2210 mm in height, having ground {{clearance}} of 460 mm and <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> at 1000 mm. It has arch axles, almost {{similar to those}} fitted on Unimog vehicles. The vehicle was installed with 18-inch beadlock wheels wrapped with gummy 37-inch tires, 4196-mm wheelbase (front axle to rearmost axle) had 4105 kg of curb weight. The G63 AMG 6×6 could deliver 0-60 MPH in 7.8 seconds with a top speed limited to 100 MPH. It appears in the movie Beyond the Reach and also featured in Jurassic World.|$|E
50|$|The {{launch vehicle}} {{is based on}} a TAS5380 8X8 wheeled truck chassis {{developed}} by Tai'an Special Vehicle Manufactory. The vehicle weights 21t and has a maximum load of 22t. The vehicle has a maximum road speed of 60 km/h and a maximum range of 650 km. The vehicles has a gradient of 57% and a <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> of 1.1m. The vehicle is equipped with four hydraulically operated stabilisers which are lowered in preparation for the rocket launch. 10 launcher tubes mounted on the chassis are arranged as two blocks of four (top) and six (bottom) tubes.|$|E
5000|$|New {{features}} in the 2006 M-Class include the 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission, optional Active Curve-Illuminating Bi-Xenon headlights which [...] "steer" [...] {{in the path of}} the vehicle, and an adjustable-height air suspension. The manual transmission has been dropped. Permanent 4Matic four-wheel drive remained, with one-speed transfer case (no low range), center limited-slip differential and four-wheel electronic traction system (4-ETS). In most countries except the U.S., an Off-Road Pro package with center and rear differential locks, 4-ETS, two-speed transfer case with reduction gearing, and adjustable ground clearance was available as an option increasing the original <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> from 500 mm to 600 mm.|$|E
60|$|Rivers {{cannot be}} <b>forded</b> if their <b>depth</b> exceeds 3 feet for men or 4 feet for horses. Fords are easily {{discovered}} by typing a sounding-pole to {{the stern of}} a boat rowing {{down the middle of}} the stream, and searching those places where the pole touches the bottom. When no boat is to be had, fords should be tried for where the river is broad rather than where it is narrow, and especially at those places where there are bends in its course. In these the line of shallow water does not run straight across, but follows the direction of a line connecting a promontory on one side to the nearest promontory on the other, as in the drawing; that is to say, from A to B, or from B to C, and not right across from B to b, from A to a, or from C to c. Along hollow curves, asa, b, c, the stream runs deep, and usually beneath overhanging banks; whilst in front of promontories, as at A, B, and C, the water is invariably shoal, unless it be a jutting rock that makes the promontory. Therefore, by entering the stream at one promontory, with the intention of leaving it at another, you ensure that at all events the beginning and end of your course shall be in shallow water, which you cannot do by attempting any other line of passage.|$|R

50|$|In {{the absence}} of combat engineers, most tanks are limited to fording rivers. The typical <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> for MBTs is {{approximately}} 1 m, being limited by {{the height of the}} engine air intake and driver's position. Modern tanks such as the Russian T-90 and the German Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 tanks can ford to a depth of 3 to 4 m when properly prepared and equipped with a snorkel to supply air for the crew and engine. Tank crews usually have a negative reaction towards deep fording but it adds considerable scope for surprise and tactical flexibility in water crossing operations by opening new and unexpected avenues of attack.|$|E
50|$|The Akatsiya chassis Objekt 303 {{is based}} on that of the Object 123 tracked chassis of the 2K11 Krug surface-to-air missile system; it {{includes}} six (rather than seven as in the 2K11 Krug) twin rubber-tired road wheels, four rubber-tired return rollers (two single and two twin), front drive sprocket with detachable sprocket rings (lantern-wheel gear) and idler wheel per side. The track is 14.375 m long, 482 mm wide and has 115 links. The Akatsiya can cross 0.7 m high vertical obstacles, 3.0 m wide trenches, 1.05 m <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> and climb 30° gradients. It can be transported by transport plane An-22 (carries two self-propelled howitzers of this type).|$|E
5000|$|Because {{procurement}} costs {{would have run}} too high and NATO established a new standard, the amphibious, NBC and multifuel capabilities were subsequently cancelled and requirements re-drafted. Payload of the twin-axle version was increased to 5 t, <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> specified to 1,200 mm, bed height raised to 1,650 mm, and air cooled Deutz V8 engines with and without turbocharger as well as 14.00 R 20 size tires were specified. However, even this [...] "trimmed-down" [...] version was too expensive for comprehensive procurement. After further deliberations {{it was decided to}} procure a smaller number of the specialized, newly developed high-mobility trucks and supplement them with a number of near-standard trucks. This meant the army procured altogether six different new truck models, initially three of them in the high-mobility off-road category.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom's Royal Marines {{operate a}} vehicle {{known as the}} Hippo BARV (or Beach Armoured Recovery Vehicle). The Hippo is a {{conversion}} of a Leopard 1A5 chassis by ALVIS Moelv. The main alteration has been {{the replacement of the}} turret with a raised superstructure that resembles the wheelhouse of a boat. The original 830 hp (634 kW) diesel engine has been retained, but the gearing of the transmission had been lowered, reducing the vehicle's road speed to 32 km/h (20 mph), but increasing tractive effort to 250 kN (56,000 lbf). Other modifications include the addition of working platforms, a nosing block, raised air intakes and an Auxiliary power unit; this has raised the weight of the vehicle from 42.5 tonnes to 50 tonnes. The Hippo has a <b>fording</b> <b>depth</b> of 2.95 m (10 ft) and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne displacement landing craft.|$|E
5000|$|The Hippo is a {{conversion}} by Alvis Moelv of a Leopard 1A5 tank. The incorporation of Alvis Vickers into BAE Systems meant that {{elements of the}} work moved to BAE Land Systems, Sweden, formerly known as [...] "Hägglunds", another ex-Alvis company. As with earlier generations of BARV, the main alteration has been {{the replacement of the}} turret with a raised superstructure which, in this case, resembles the bridge or wheelhouse of a small ship. The original [...] diesel engine has been retained but the gearing of the transmission had been lowered; this has reduced the vehicle's road speed from 65 to 20 km/h, but its tractive force has been increased to 250 kN.
