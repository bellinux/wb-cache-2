40|$|Accurate {{identification}} of resonance frequencies in hard disk drives (HDD) {{is required to}} increase the controller gain in future drives. High gain controllers result in accurate tracking but may excite mechanical resonance modes of the actuator. Mechanical resonances are usually attenuated by notch filters. However, the resonance frequencies of the modes can differ between drives due to manufacturing tolerances. Environmental factors such as temperature can cause time-varying resonances in a <b>drive.</b> <b>Identification</b> of the resonance frequencies during manufacturing and operation is therefore required to design accurate models and subsequently high gain controllers. A two step approach is proposed to deal with both manufacturing issues as well as time-varying resonances in HDD. First the nominal resonance frequency of each mode is identified during manufacturing. A adaptive notch filter is designed to attenuate the mechanical resonance. If during operation the error signal between the actual closed loop and the specified nominal closed loop model exceeds a predefined threshold value the centerfrequency of the adaptive notch filter is quickly adapted to the actual resonance frequency using a least mean squares (LMS) method. The performance {{of this approach is}} verified by simulation of a realistic hard disk drive model...|$|E

A more comprehensive understanding of skin development mechanisms will <b>drive</b> <b>identification</b> of new treatment targets and modalities. Here we report the Zebrafish Integument Project (ZIP), an expression-driven platform for identifying new skin genes and phenotypes in the vertebrate model Danio rerio (zebrafish). In vivo selection for skin-specific expression of gene-break transposon (GBT) mutant lines identified eleven new, revertible GBT alleles of genes involved in skin development. Eight genes [...] fras 1, grip 1, hmcn 1, msxc, col 4 a 4, ahnak, capn 12, and nrg 2 a [...] had {{been described in}} an integumentary context to varying degrees, while arhgef 25 b, fkbp 10 b, and megf 6 a emerged as novel skin genes. Embryos homozygous for a GBT insertion within neuregulin 2 a (nrg 2 a) revealed a novel requirement for a Neuregulin 2 a (Nrg 2 a) -ErbB 2 / 3 -AKT signaling pathway governing the apicobasal organization of a subset of epidermal cells during median fin fold (MFF) morphogenesis. In nrg 2 a mutant larvae, the basal keratinocytes within the apical MFF, known as ridge cells, displayed reduced pAKT levels as well as reduced apical domains and exaggerated basolateral domains. Those defects compromised proper ridge cell elongation into a flattened epithelial morphology, resulting in thickened MFF edges. Pharmacological inhibition verified that Nrg 2 a signals through the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase network. Moreover, knockdown of the epithelial polarity regulator and tumor suppressor lgl 2 ameliorated the nrg 2 a mutant phenotype. Identifying Lgl 2 as an antagonist of Nrg 2 a-ErbB signaling revealed a significantly earlier role for Lgl 2 during epidermal morphogenesis than has been described to date. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that successive, coordinated ridge cell shape changes drive apical MFF development, making MFF ridge cells a valuable model for investigating how the coordinated regulation of cell polarity and cell shape changes serves as a crucial mechanism of epithelial morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains a}} series of essays intended to introduce strategic modeling techniques into the network design problem. While investment in production capacity has long been approached as a critical strategic decision, the increasing need for robust, responsive supply capabilities has made it essential to take a network view, where multiple products and sites are considered simultaneously. In traditional network planning, models have rarely accounted for the behavior of additional players - customers, competitors, suppliers - on whom a firm can exert only a limited influence. We analyze a set of models that account for {{the dynamics of the}} firm's interaction with these outside actors. In Chapters 2 and 3, we develop game-theoretic models to characterize the allocation of resources in a network context. In Chapter 2, we use series-parallel networks to model the arrangement of producers whose output is bundled. This structure may arise, for example, when various components of the production process are outsourced individually. We study supply-function mechanisms through which producers strategically manage scarce capacity. Our results show how network structure can be analyzed to measure producers' market power and its effect on equilibrium markups. Chapter 3 looks at the network design problem of a vertically integrated firm with the ability to flexibly allocate resources across markets. We consider optimal design of the firm's production network as an upper-level decision to be optimized with respect to competitive outcomes in the lower stage. We find that optimal strategies regarding the location and centralization of production will differ across firms, depending on their competitive position in the market. The final two chapters discuss practical issues regarding the availability of model inputs in a multi-product context. In Chapter 4, we propose a method to construct competitor sets through estimation of a latent-segment choice model. We present a case study in a hotel market, where demand is distributed both spatially and temporally. We show how widely available data on market events can be used to <b>drive</b> <b>identification</b> of customer segments, providing a basis to assess competitive interactions.

40|$|Virtual {{manufacturing}} {{has gained}} considerable {{importance in the}} last decade. To obtain reliable predictions in a virtual environment, {{the factors that influence}} the outcome of a manufacturing operation need to be carefully modeled and integrated in a simulation platform. The dynamic behavior of the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) system, which has a profound influence on the final part geometry and tolerance integrity, is among these factors. Classical CNC <b>drive</b> <b>identification</b> techniques are usually time consuming and need to be performed by an engineer qualified in dynamics and control theory. These techniques require the servo loop or the trajectory interpolator to be disconnected in order to inject the necessary identification signals, causing downtime to the machine. Hence, these techniques are usually not practical for constructing virtual models of existing CNC machine tools in a manufacturing environment. This thesis presents an alternative strategy for constructing virtual drive models with minimal intervention and downtime to the machinery. The proposed technique, named “rapid identification”, consists of executing a short G-code experiment and collecting input/output data using the motion capture feature available on most CNC controllers. The data is then processed to reverse engineer the equivalent tracking and disturbance transfer functions and friction characteristics of the machine. It is shown that virtual drive models constructed this way can be used to predict the real machine’s contouring performance for large class of drive systems, controlled with different control techniques. In the proposed scheme, the excitation is delivered by smoothly interpolated motion commands. Hence, convergence of parameters to their true values is not guaranteed. When the real system contains pole-zero cancellations, namely due to feedforward control action, this also results in a loss of identifiability. In order to guarantee the stability of the identified drive models, the pole locations are constrained with frequency and damping ratio limits. Hence, the rapid identification task is cast as a constrained minimization problem. Two solution strategies have been developed. In the first approach, Lagrange Multipliers (LM) technique is applied, which yields successful estimation results. However, implementation of LM is computationally intensive and requires the use of a dedicated symbolic solver. This limits the portability for industrial implementation. In the second approach, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) search technique is developed, which is a more practical but slightly approximate alternative. The GA allows parameter bounds to be incorporated in a natural manner and converges to 2 - 3 % vicinity of the LM solution in one-tenth of the computation time. The GA solution can be easily ported to different computation platforms. Both LM and GA identification techniques were validated in simulations and experiments conducted on virtual and real machine tool drives. It is shown that although the parameters estimated using the rapid identification scheme do not always match their true values, the key tracking and disturbance rejection characteristics of the drives are successfully captured in the frequency range of the CNC motion commands. Therefore, the drive models constructed with rapid identification can be used to predict the contouring accuracy of real machine tools in a virtual process planning environment.

This problem is addressed by plugging aggregated sensitivities of the modes and mode-shapes w. r. t. FEM structural parameters in the above setting.

40|$|Selecting {{the order}} of an {{input-output}} model of a dynamical system is a key step toward the goal of system identification. By determining the smallest regression vector dimension that allows accurate prediction of the output, the false nearest neighbors algorithm (FNN) is {{a useful tool for}} linear and also for nonlinear systems. The one parameter that needs to be determined before performing FNN is the threshold constant that is used to compute the percentage of false neighbors. For this purpose heuristic rules can be followed. However, for nonlinear systems choosing a suitable threshold is extremely important, the optimal choice of this parameter will depend on the system. While this advanced FNN uses nonlinear inputoutput data based models, the computational effort of the method increases along with the number of data and the dimension of the model. To increase the efficiency of the method this paper proposes the application of a fuzzy clustering algorithm. The advantage of the generated solutions is that it remains in the horizon of the data, hence {{there is no need to}} apply nonlinear model identification tools.

This represents the first quantitative assessment {{of the influence of}} defining priority areas on the land acquisitions of a conservation non-governmental organization (NGO). Methodology/Principal Findings: The lands acquired by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) were analyzed using GIS to determine to what extent they were in areas defined as priorities for conservation.

40|$|It is {{especially}} {{during times of}} uncertainty or change in an organization, that a major concern for organizational management is how to elicit and maintain {{a high degree of}} identification and desired behavior from their members. Traditionally, scholars have taken a "bottom-up approach" in understanding these organizational processes, where the assumption is that members’ own, private perceptions of who their organization is, i. e. their perceived organizational identity, is the core driver of their identification and behavior. I challenge this one-sided approach of perceived organizational identity on the grounds that by focusing solely on members’ organizational identity perceptions, we disregard the "top-down approach", i. e. the important role that management plays in setting an overall collective framework that directs and guides members in their identification and behavior. This dissertation is the first to empirically test the comparative significance of bottom-up and top-down identity types. Through three empirical studies in two different organizational settings, I study this force field between the bottom-up and top-down identity processes. My results indicate that especially during times of threat and organizational change, the role of perceived organizational identity is not nearly as prevalent as generally assumed. It is not only the perceived organizational identity in and of itself that <b>drives</b> <b>identification</b> and behavior, but also the degree to which members believe that their perceived organizational identity is consistent with the top-down determined identity types of projected and desired organizational identity.

The accuracy of two output-only identification algorithms (Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition and Covariance <b>driven</b> Stochastic Subspace <b>Identification</b> methods) and of two alternative procedures to process the free decays was also analyzed. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{represents}} a committee {{summary of the}} current state of knowledge regarding aftereffects and sense of presence in virtual environments (VEs). The work presented in this article, and the proposed research agenda, are the result of a special session that was set up in the framework of the Seventh International Conference on Human Computer Interaction. Recommendations were made by the committee regarding research needs in aftereffects and sense of presence, and, where possible, priorities were suggested. The research needs were structured in terms of the short, medium, and long term and, if followed, should lead toward the effective use of VE technology. The 2 most critical research issues identified were (a) standardization and use of measurement approaches for aftereffects and (b) identification and prioritization of sensorimotor discordances that <b>drive</b> aftereffects. <b>Identification</b> of aftereffects countermeasures (i. e., techniques to assist users in readily transitioning betw een the real and virtual worlds), reduction of system response latencies, and improvements in tracking technology were also thought to be of critical importance...|$|R
