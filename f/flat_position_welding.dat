In the present paper， we report on the practical usage of a new apparatus which performs an automatic weaving process making use of an automobile wiper. 　Through the experiments satisfactory results were obtained that this apparatus can be used with good results for automatic <b>flat</b> <b>position</b> <b>welding.</b> A summary of the results is given below : 一 　　（ 1 ）A　straight　bead　penetrates　deeply　in　the　center　of　the　weld，but　shows a tendency of increasing incomplete penetration or overlap on the extreme sides of the bead. With a weaved bead uiform penetration can be obtained. 　（ 2 ）Good welding win be performed under comparatively high current and high torch speed， and with the increase of the weaving cycles defects becomes few. 　But when it goes beyond proportions， lack of fusion， incomplete penetration and slag inclusion will easily be caused. 　　　（ 3 ）The appearance of the bead is better in the foreward process than in the backward process. 　　　（ 4 ）The proper welding conditions for this apparatus must be thought within the following limits : the current is 180 〜 200 A， the voltage is 24 〜 27 V， the torch speed is 13 〜 17 cm/min and the weaving cycle is 40 c/min. 　　　（ 5 ）The appearance　of beads and the strength of joints are the best when the proportion of gas mixture is CO_ 2 8. 0 十Ar 2. 0 ［l/min］.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the dropthrough distance of a full penetration, <b>flat</b> <b>position</b> <b>weld</b> pool is described. Close to incipient root side penetration the dropthrough is metastable, so that a small drop in power can cause a loss of penetration if not followed soon enough by a compensating rise in power. The SPA (Soft Plasma Arc) process with higher pressure {{on top of the}} weld pool loses penetration more quickly than the GTA (Gas Tungsten Arc) process. 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy with a lower surface tension loses penetration more quickly than 2219 aluminum alloy.

40|$|Laser welding {{has been}} {{increasingly}} utilized to manufacture {{a variety of}} components thanks to its high quality and speed. For components with complex shapes, the <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> needs be continuously adjusted during laser welding, which makes it necessary to know {{the effects of the}} <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> {{on the quality of the}} laser welds. In this paper, the weld quality under two (<b>flat</b> and horizontal) <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> were studied comparatively in the laser welding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy, in terms of weld profiles, process porosity, and static tensile strengths. Results show that the <b>flat</b> <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> led to better weld profiles, less process porosity than that of the horizontal <b>welding</b> <b>position,</b> which resulted from the different actions of gravity on the molten weld metals and the different escape routes for pores under different <b>welding</b> <b>positions.</b> Although undercuts showed no association with the fracture positions and tensile strengths of the welds, too much porosity in horizontal laser welds led to significant decreases in the strengths and specific elongations of welds. Higher laser powers and travel speeds were recommended, for both <b>flat</b> and horizontal <b>welding</b> <b>positions,</b> to reduce <b>weld</b> porosity and improve mechanical properties...|$|R

30|$|The {{globular}} arc mode has few applications due to {{its many}} deficiencies. Because {{of the size of}} the drop (bigger than the electrode diameter), it may unexpectedly touch the weld pool and cause a short circuit. The arc root is highly mobile, so the arc forces tend to move the droplet in an irregular manner, which causes a high level of spatter and weld instability. In addition, the molten metal is not accelerated towards the weld pool, leading to a shallow and broad weld bead. The large droplets are detached at low frequencies (< 10 Hz) resulting in low productivity. Consequently, global arc mode is limited to low-quality welded joints welded in a <b>flat</b> <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> or vertical down position (Kou 2003; Xu and Wu 2007). The most suitable application for a globular arc is welding of thin materials at a very low current range. Although it can also be used with a higher current, this is not efficient. It is suitable for GMAW on steel (Althouse et al. 2004; Jeffus and Bower 2010).|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: The effect of hybrid welding parameters such as the shielding gas composition and laser-arc interspacing distance were investigated for the bead-on-plate welding. The pipe girth welding was implemented and the adequate arc welding parameters were selected according to the <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> from a <b>flat</b> <b>position</b> to an overhead position. Findings: The optimized shielding gas composition and laser-arc interspacing distance for disk laser-GMA hybrid welding were 80 % Ar- 20 % CO 2 and 2 mm, respectively for the bead-on-plate welding. The sound welds could be achieved even in the pipe girth welding, but the proper joint shape should be prepared.

Following initial {{work on the}} basic fusion characteristics, the process {{was applied to the}} {{production}} of closed butt joint linepipe welding and narrow gap welding (in the <b>flat</b> and H-V <b>positions).</b> The initial stage of the work covered the determination of pulse parameters for controlled metal transfer with a variety of wires and shielding gases. Basic bead-on-plate fusion characteristics were investigated 1 n all <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> and quantified in terms of the major welding variables of current and travel speed. <b>Welding</b> <b>position</b> was shown to have no effect on fusion behaviour. Successful full penetration closed butt root welds were produced in all <b>welding</b> <b>positions.</b> Heat input was shown to be the factor controlling bead dimensions. Close control over welding parameters are needed to maintain consistent bead sizes. Complete joint simulations were also made. The vertical-up technique was shown to give superior fusion characteristics with the process producing excellent quality results in all positions. Narrow gap MIG welding was shown to be feasible without wire manipulation at gap widths below 12 mm in the <b>flat</b> <b>position.</b> A wire manipulation technique gave excellent fusion characteristics with gap widths greater than 12 mm.

Com isto abre-se uma nova perspectiva para revestimentos metálicos fora de posição plana e neste contexto se insere a recuperação por soldagem de partes erodidas por cavitação de turbinas hidráulicas. Com o objetivo de conhecer o comportamento do processo fora da posição foram conduzidos alguns experimentos com corrente contínua pulsada, utilizando-se a liga Stellite 6, e comparados com os resultados obtidos na posição {{horizontal}} e plana. A liga Stellite 6 vem sendo uma das mais utilizadas por apresentar uma excelente resistência ao desgaste por abrasão, erosão, impacto e cavitação.

30|$|In {{order to}} control heat input and reduce spatter {{generation}} and fumes, power sources {{have been developed}} {{with the ability to}} release one drop for a sequence of arc and pulsed time. The arc uses direct current (e.g. pulsed GMAW) or alternative current (e.g. AC-GMAW) with different current waveforms. A pulsed arc can be used in all <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> and with all base material thicknesses in both manual and automatic welding systems. Out of <b>position</b> <b>welding</b> is also possible due to the lower than average current level. Because of the low heat input, this mode is suitable for filling gaps. It is widely used in the GMAW of aluminium (Kah et al. 2012). The method is suitable for welding all standard and high performance grades of stainless steel when nickel base or stainless steel filler metals are used. High alloy steels can also be welded by pulsed arc.

Pulsed arc welding has applications in the shipbuilding industry, for example, out of <b>position</b> <b>welding</b> of high strength low alloy base materials in ship hull fabrication. The advantages of pulsed arc in shipbuilding are that its electrode efficiency is higher compared to flux-core arc welding (FCAW), and it can deliver lower hydrogen weld deposits (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Knopp and Lorenz 2002; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Ueyama et al. 2005; Lebedev 2010; Torbati et al. 2011; Kah et al. 2013).|$|R
