40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on {{analysis}} of perception of the brand Nutrilon at the market with <b>infant</b> <b>milks</b> in Prague and on segmentation of this market. The main objective of this thesis {{is to find out}} how is Nutrilon perceived among mothers who use or used to use <b>infant</b> <b>milks,</b> according to which attributes they decide to buy milks and why they choose that particular brand. Simultaneously there are discovered and developed particular market segments which can be attractive for Nutrilon. Work consists of two parts. Theoretical part deals with consumer behavior, explains the term brand, process of the market segmentation and describes marketing research and method used in the thesis [...] the questionnaire survey. In the practical part characteristics of the manufacturers that produce <b>infant</b> <b>milks</b> are described and analyzed each of their brands. Furthermore, I analyzed agency data from continuous research MML-TGI that provided Median s. r. o. At first the target group is characterized by a general analysis. Afterwards I used factor analysis to reduce variables to the factors. And then I put women into clusters based on clusters analysis. The segments are described in detail using general and contingency analysis. Primary data are gained from own research through questionnaire survey. In the conclusion of diploma thesis there are presented the results of data analysis. Based on those results there are provided appropriate marketing recommendations for Nutrilon and uncovered segments. These recommendations should help Nutrilon in the future to become number one at the market of <b>infant</b> <b>milks...</b>|$|R

However, {{little is known about the}} protein quality and, specifically, about the digestible AA pattern of goat milk formulas compared with their cow milk counterparts. In this study, the true ileal AA digestibility of a goat <b>milk</b> <b>infant</b> formula was compared with a premium cow <b>milk</b> <b>infant</b> formula. The 3 -wk-old piglet was used as a model for the 3 -mo-old <b>infant.</b> Both <b>milk</b> formulas were prepared as described by the manufacturer, with titanium dioxide added as an indigestible marker. The formulas were fed to the piglets over a 2 -wk trial period. Digesta from the terminal ileum were collected post euthanasia and analyzed for AA content, along with samples of the formulas. True AA digestibility was determined after correcting for endogenous AA loss at the terminal ileum of pigs fed an enzyme-hydrolyzed casein-based diet, followed by ultrafiltration (5, 000 Da) of the digesta. Total urine and feces collection was also undertaken to determine the nitrogen retention from the diets.

The {{aim of this}} study was to isolation and determination antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Enterobacter amnigenus biogroup 1 strains isolated from consumed powdered <b>infant</b> formula (PIF) <b>milk</b> in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) ward. Materials and Methods : In this cross-sectional study, total 125 consumed powdered <b>infant</b> formula <b>milk</b> in NICU ward were surveyed. Isolation and Identification of microorganisms was carried out according to FDA method. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by using the standard disc diffusion method based on CLSI (2011) recommendations. Results: In this study, Enterobacter amnigenus biogroup 1 was isolated from 2 (1. 6 %) of 125 powdered <b>infant</b> formula <b>milk</b> samples. The results showed that isolated strains are sensitive to most antibiotics. All isolates were resistant to amoxicillin and carbenicillin. Conclusion: Contamination of powdered infant formula (PIF) samples could have occurred during different steps. It is imperative to prepare the powdered <b>infant</b> formula <b>milk</b> foods according to the manufacturer’s instruction and in an aseptic condition. Contamination of powdered infant formula only could be reduced or prevented by monitoring the critical control points and taking appropriate action during the processing...|$|R

50|$|According to {{historian}} John Duffy, {{the concept}} of community health centers in the United States {{can be traced to}} <b>infant</b> <b>milk</b> stations in New York City in 1901. In November, 1914, the city established the first district health center in New York at 206 Madison Avenue, serving 35,000 residents of Manhattan's lower east side. The staff consisted of one medical inspector and three nurses stationed permanently in the district who, through a house card system, developed a complete health record of each family. In 1915, the system expanded, adding four district centers in Queens. Wartime and political pressures ended this development in New York City, but privately funded clinics through the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor were started in 1916 (Bowling Green Neighborhood Association), 1917 (Columbus Hill Health Center), 1918 (Mulberry Street Health Center) and 1921 (Judson Health Center). Founded by Eleanor A. Campbell in Greenwich Village, the Judson Health Center became the largest health center in the U.S. by 1924.|$|E

In Europe, FrieslandCampina Domo is offering Vivinal GOS in a syrup format containing 57% oligosaccharides on dry matter and in a two powder format containing 29% or 71% oligosaccharides on dry matter. Clasado Ltd is offering a powder GOS product, Bimuno, with 52% galacto-oligosaccharide content on dry matter, {{as well as a}} syrup and pastille versions of that product.Besides the differences in purity amongst the commercially offered products, there are differences also in the linkages of the oligosaccharide chain due to the different enzymes used in their production. This can have a direct impact on their potential to affect host's physiology and health. The Oligomate range is produced with enzymes originating from Aspergillus oryzae offering mainly β 1-6 linkages, the Bimuno product is produced using enzymes from a probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum and contains mainly β 1-3 linkages whilst Cup-Oligo and Vivinal offer mainly β 1-4 linkages {{as a result of the}} activity of enzymes from Bacillus circulans for the latter and Cryptococcus laurentii for the former GOS product.

40|$|<b>Infant</b> <b>milk</b> formula {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential source of Enterobacter sakazakii. This bacterium can cause a severe form of neonatal meningitis and necrotizing entercolitis. This study determined the effect of acid, alkaline, chlorine and ethanol stresses on the thermal inactivation of E. sakazakii in <b>infant</b> <b>milk</b> formula. Stressed cells were mixed with reconstituted powdered <b>infant</b> <b>milk</b> formula (PIMF) at temperatures between 52 and 58 °C for various time periods or mixed with PFMF prior to reconstitution with water at temperatures between 50 and 100 °C. The D- and z-values of the cells were determined using linear regression analysis. Detergent and sanitizer stresses decreased the thermal resistance of E. sakazakii in powdered and reconstituted <b>infant</b> <b>milk</b> formula. The values for Z) - acid, alkaline, chlorine and ethanol stressed E. sakazakii at 52 - 58 °C were 14. 57 - 0. 54, 12. 07 - 0. 37, 10. 08 - 0. 40 and 11. 61 - 0. 50 min, respectively. The values of alkaline, chlorine and ethanol stressed cells were significantly lower than those of unstressed cells. Only the z-value (4. 4 °C) of ethanol stressed E. sakazakii was significantly different than that of unstressed cells (4. 12 °C). Reconstitution at 60 °C did not significantly reduce the number of pre-stressed E. sakazakii cells compared with unstressed control cells, whereas significant decreases were obtained at 70 °C. Using water at 70 °C during the preparation of reconstituted PIMF before feeding infants, may be a suitable and applicable means of reducing the risk of E. sakazakii in the formula.
