40|$|The {{principle}} of informed consent {{is becoming increasingly}} important for patients in Japan. A system of disclosure of patients' charts was started in our hospital in November 1999. In {{order to try to}} improve the quality of nursing records, a manual for nursing records was made for nurses in our hospital, and the usefulness of this manual for improving nursing records was tested. The use of this manual resulted in improvements in mechanical <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>records</b> of patients' courses, but there were no improvements in other items of nursing records. It was realized that an overall improvement in nursing records could not be achieved without an improvement in the quality of nursing itself.

40|$|Many {{sanitation}} control problems due {{to aging}} {{facilities and equipment}} were identified when applying an HACCP system to a flatfish (Paralichthys olivaceus) aquaculture farm. Specifically, the major problems included a lack of awareness about worker hygiene, lack of management {{of the use of}} fish medicines, and vulnerability to secondary contamination by cross-contamination owing to a failure to separate breeding tools used for healthy and unhealthy fish. Therefore, the management standards on the farm regarding the surrounding environment, facilities and equipment, breeding tools, feed and medication, and the hygiene of practitioners must be improved. The hygiene management standards were divided into different procedures such as the management of farm hygiene and environmental sanitation, facilities and equipment, fish hygiene, feed, medications, water, and the stocking and shipping of fish. For each procedure, we established the management standards, inspection period, <b>inspection</b> procedures, <b>and</b> how to deal with errors that occur, to enable hygiene management by a small number of managers.

40|$|New EPA Rules Targeting Livestock and Poultry Industry Congress {{passed the}} Clean Water Act (CWA) in 1972 to 2 ̆ 2 restore and {{maintain}} the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation 2 ̆ 7 s waters. 2 ̆ 2 Among its core provisions, it prohibits the discharge of pollutants from a point source to waters of the United States except as authorized by an NPDES permit. EPA 2 ̆ 7 s regulation of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) under the CWA dates to the 1970 s. EPA established effluent guidelines for feedlots in 1974 based on the best available technology that was economically achievable for the industry. CAFO regulations issued in 1976 determined which animal feeding operations (AFOs) were defined or could be designated as CAFOs under the CWA and therefore subject to NPDES permit regulations. The new CAFO rules that took affect April 14, 2003 were adopted within {{the authority of the}} 1972 CWA to address changes in the animal feeding industries. The final rules are more inclusive of all livestock and poultry sectors, removed several registration exemptions, reflect a greater focus on land application of manure and wastewater, <b>and</b> emphasize accountability, <b>inspections,</b> <b>and</b> <b>record</b> keeping while retaining appropriate state flexibility. The rule eliminates current permitting exemptions and expands coverage over types of animals in three important ways: 1) the rule eliminates the exemption that excuses CAFOs from applying for permits if they only discharge during large storms; 2) the rule eliminates the exemption for operations that raise chickens with dry manure handling systems; and 3) the rule extends coverage to immature swine and immature dairy cows. The new rule will affect large livestock and poultry operations. Large CAFOs are defined in the rule as operations raising more than 1, 000 cattle, 700 dairy cows, 2, 500 swine, 10, 000 sheep, 125, 000 chickens, 82, 000 laying hens, and 55, 000 turkeys in confinement...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{has been}} one of the most serious safety {{problems}} in aviation, and the most costly maintenance problem. Contributing to the problematic nature of corrosion is the complexity of its mechanisms and the randomness with which it occurs. The reliability of a structure affected by corrosion is normally based on the forms of the erosion and its severity. Existing research in this area has a primary focus on corrosion induced structure failure due to inadequate residual structural strength. However, it is valuable to recognise that some product failures induced by corrosion are not critically dependent on stress or fatigue-examples include such cases as leakage from oil pipe or containers, leakage into air cabin and landing floats and, or degradation of a high smooth surface required structure. In such cases non-structural failure should be judged on some specific failure criterion involving the number of corrosion spots, as well as their surface area, depth and distribution. Based on data collected from <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance <b>records</b> of the Chinese Yunshu- 7 passenger aircraft, this paper will propose some new concepts formulation of relevant failure criteria and will propose corrosion probabilistic models for reliability assessment...|$|R
