This chain rule expresses the <b>derivatives</b> <b>of</b> FG as a derived composition product <b>of</b> the <b>derivatives</b> <b>of</b> F and G over the <b>derivatives</b> <b>of</b> the identity. There are two main ingredients in our proofs. Firstly, we construct new models for the Goodwillie <b>derivatives</b> <b>of</b> functors of spectra.
