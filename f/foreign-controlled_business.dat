40|$|We {{explore the}} {{comparative}} business failures of foreign-owned or controlled firms and domestically owned firms. Original data are collected regarding foreign-controlled {{firms in the}} U. S. that filed for bankruptcy protection, were involuntarily liquidated or ceased operations mainly due to poor financial performance during the 1978 - 1988 period. Our results show that foreign-controlled firms fail less often than domestically owned firms. The patterns of <b>foreign-controlled</b> <b>business</b> failures and the impacts of entry modes, ownership types, and national culture on the failures of foreign-controlled firms are also examined. © 1991 JIBS.

Industries which must be majority-owned by Thais included the newspaper business, radio stations, television stations, rice farming, animal husbandry, fishing, land trading, mining, wholesaling and retailing, restaurants, and all service businesses. The law criminalized nominees, any Thai who held shares {{on behalf of a}} foreigner. Nominees could be fined 100,000 to 1 million baht and face up to 3 years in prison. However, the law did not prohibit foreigners from being the majority in the board of directors and also did not prohibit having different classes of shares with differing voting rights. This loophole allowed thousands of <b>foreign-controlled</b> <b>businesses</b> to operate in Thailand.|$|R
