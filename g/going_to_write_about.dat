6000|$|My dearest Friend,--I {{am aware}} that I should have written to you before, but {{the cold weather}} is apt to disable me and {{to make me feel}} idle when it does not do so quite. Now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> your remarks on the 'Dublin Review.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Bartley yawned a yawn of {{satisfied}} sleepiness, {{and rubbed}} {{his hand over his}} face. [...] "I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "if I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> anything <b>about</b> Camp Kinney, I had better see all there is to see." ...|$|R
50|$|Being {{one of the}} few International wine writers with {{a formal}} {{tertiary}} education in winemaking and viticulture he has stated that if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> critically <b>about</b> wine, the least you can do is to learn how to make it.|$|R
2500|$|Thematically, {{the album}} {{addresses}} romance, with Boyd noting, [...] "it's {{about love and}} finding art and success in love. I never know what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> until I'm actually <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> it. It's what's relevant in my heart and mind. There's definitely a romantic undertone and overtone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After a {{while we}} got below the ship yards, {{and then there was}} nothing more to see, only some green grounds, and some mountains, and a castle on a rock. Then we landed at Greenock, and came home by the railroad. But Rollo is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> this.|$|E
60|$|Am I {{interested}} in what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about?</b> Do I feel it strongly? Do I know it thoroughly? Do I imagine it clearly? The young contributor had better ask himself all these questions, and as many more like them as he can think of. Perhaps he will end by not being a young contributor.|$|E
6000|$|Paul Ruttledge. Oh! no, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> it; if one writes one can {{do nothing}} else. I am going to express myself in life. [To THOMAS RUTTLEDGE who has {{returned}} with box.] I hope soon to live {{by the work of}} my hands, but every trade has to be learned, and I must take something to start with. [To MRS. RUTTLEDGE.] Do you think you will have any kettles to mend when I come this way again? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Tredgold {{was talking}} {{the same way}} to me," [...] said the mate. [...] "He says he’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a book <b>about</b> them when he goes back. He asked me what I thought’ud be a good title." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was left}} in my study in a very {{unpleasant}} state of mind. I was agitated and apprehensive. Perhaps that young woman would not come any more. I had not told her that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> love, and there was every reason to suppose she would not return. What an imbecile I had been! I had done nothing, because I {{could not think of}} exactly the right thing to do.|$|R
6000|$|... --Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are {{standing}} in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> something <b>about</b> it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till {{the time of the}} union and the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> it {{for that}} paper in Paris." [...] The girl {{had the effect of}} {{gathering}} her courage up for a bold plunge. She looked steadily at her father, and added: [...] "He said he came back because he couldn't help it. He--wished to speak with me, He said he knew he had no right to suppose I cared anything about what had happened with him and Mr. Stoller. He wanted to come back and tell me--that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, listen," [...] said Rachel, quickly, [...] "the {{regiment}} {{is going}} to Scotland, and he and the mother have taken it into their heads that I shall get well faster somewhere away from home. And--and {{they want to have}} the wedding as soon as I am better; and they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> settlements and all that. I have never said I would, and I don't feel as if--as if I ought to let him do it; and if ever the thing is to be stopped at all, this is the only time." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} Jone {{said to me}} when I told him I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> what I saw and heard was that I must be careful of two things. In the first place, I must not write {{a lot of stuff}} that {{everybody}} ought to be expected to know, especially people who have travelled themselves; and in the second place, I must not send you my green opinions, but must wait until they were seasoned, so that I can see what they are good for before I send them.|$|E
60|$|Last winter Jone and I {{read all}} the books we could get about the rural parts of England, {{and we knew that}} the country must be very beautiful, but we had no proper idea of it until we came to Chedcombe. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> much <b>about</b> the scenery {{in this part of the}} country, because, perhaps, you have been here and seen it, and anyway my writing would not be half so good as what you could read in books, which don't amount to anything.|$|R
50|$|Harkness—Harkness {{establishes}} {{himself as}} unique early on, {{saying that when}} or if he wins he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a book <b>about</b> his experiences. He also wears glasses and sports a crew cut. He dies when his feet cramp up {{as a group of}} farm kids watch, and Garraty remarks sadly that he'll never get <b>to</b> <b>write</b> his book.|$|R
60|$|One day in {{the past}} month, as I was {{reclining}} on the bench of thought, with that ocean The Times newspaper spread before me, the ocean cast up on the shore at my feet two famous subjects for Roundabout Papers, and I picked up those waifs, and treasured them away until I could polish them {{and bring them to}} market. That scheme is not to be carried out. I can't <b>write</b> <b>about</b> those subjects. And though I cannot <b>write</b> <b>about</b> them, I may surely tell what are the subjects I am <b>going</b> NOT <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
60|$|We went outside, {{and walked}} {{on the banks of}} the Canal for an hour, eating and {{drinking}} what we had with us, until the moon rose. I know now exactly how a murderer feels. Finally, we forced ourselves back to the room with the lamp and the Other Thing in it, and began to take up the next piece of work. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> this. It was too horrible. We burned the bedstead and dropped the ashes into the Canal; we took up the matting of the room and treated that in the same way. I went off to a village and borrowed two big hoes--I did not want the villagers to help--while the Major arranged--the other matters. It took us four hours' hard work to make the grave. As we worked, we argued out whether it was right to say as much as we remembered of the Burial of the Dead.|$|E
60|$|But as I said {{in one of}} {{my first}} letters, I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> things and places that you can get much better {{description}} of in books, and so I won't take up any time in telling how we stand at the window of our room at the Royal Hotel, and look out at the Old Town standing like a forest of tall houses {{on the other side of}} the valley, with the great castle perched up high above them, and all the hills and towers and the streets all spread out below us, with Scott's monument right in front, with everybody he ever wrote about standing on brackets, which stick out everywhere from the bottom up to the very top of the monument, which is higher than the tallest house, and looks like a steeple without a church to it. It is the most beautiful thing of the kind I ever saw, and I have made out, or think I have, nearly every one of the figures that's carved on it.|$|E

We compromised things by saying the Lord's Prayer with a private unofficial prayer for the peace of the soul of The Boy. Then we filled in the grave and went into the verandah--not the house--to lie down to sleep. We were dead-tired.|$|E
2500|$|James Arness: An Autobiography was {{released}} in September 2001, with a foreword by Burt Reynolds (who had been a cast member of Gunsmoke for several years in the 1960s).

2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{response}} was not included: {{it came from}} George Orwell, and began:Will you please stop sending me this bloody rubbish. This is {{the second or third}} time I have had it. I am not one of your fashionable pansies like Auden or Spender, I was six months in Spain, most of the time fighting, I have a bullet hole in me at present and I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> blah <b>about</b> defending democracy or gallant little anybody...Several other writers also declined to contribute, including Virginia Woolf, Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster, and James Joyce.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘You are evidently <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a book <b>about</b> us, Mr. Jasper,’ quoth the Dean; ‘to <b>write</b> a book <b>about</b> us. Well! We {{are very}} ancient, {{and we ought}} to make a good book. We are not so richly endowed in {{possessions}} as in age; but perhaps you will put that in your book, among other things, and call attention to our wrongs.’ ...|$|R
60|$|You see now {{the scope}} of the claim I am making for the novel; it is to be the social mediator, the vehicle of understanding, the {{instrument}} of self-examination, the parade of morals and the exchange of manners, the factory of customs, the criticism of laws and institutions and of social dogmas and ideas. It is to be the home confessional, the initiator of knowledge, the seed of fruitful self-questioning. Let me be very clear here. I do not mean for a moment that the novelist is going to set up as a teacher, as a sort of priest with a pen, who will make men and women believe and do this and that. The novel is not a new sort of pulpit; humanity is passing out of the phase when men sit under preachers and dogmatic influences. But the novelist {{is going to be the}} most potent of artists, because he is going to present conduct, devise beautiful conduct, discuss conduct analyse conduct, suggest conduct, illuminate it through and through. He will not teach, but discuss, point out, plead, and display. And this being my view you will be prepared for the demand I am now about to make for an absolutely free hand for the novelist in his choice of topic and incident and in his method of treatment; or rather, if I may presume to speak for other novelists, I would say it is not so much a demand we make as an intention we proclaim. We are going to write, subject only to our limitations, about the whole of human life. We are going to deal with political questions and religious questions and social questions. We cannot present people unless we have this free hand, this unrestricted field. What is the good of telling stories about people's lives if one may not deal freely with the religious beliefs and organisations that have controlled or failed to control them? What is the good of pretending to write about love, and the loyalties and treacheries and quarrels of men and women, if one must not glance at those varieties of physical temperament and organic quality, those deeply passionate needs and distresses from which half the storms of human life are brewed? We mean to deal with all these things, and it will need very much more than the disapproval of provincial librarians, the hostility of a few influential people in London, the scurrility of one paper, and the deep and obstinate silences of another, to stop the incoming tide of aggressive novel-writing. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> it all. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> business and finance and politics and precedence and pretentiousness and decorum and indecorum, until a thousand pretences and ten thousand impostures shrivel in the cold, clear air of our elucidations. We are going to write of wasted opportunities and latent beauties until a thousand new ways of living open to men and women. We are going to appeal to the young and the hopeful and the curious, against the established, the dignified, and defensive. Before we have done, we will have all life within {{the scope of}} the novel.|$|E
5000|$|He wrote 25 books, {{translated}} into 7 languages and depicting mainly his travels. He doesn't specialize neither in economics nor in politics, looking always for [...] "the human {{side of the}} story" [...] and trying to see for himself the things he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about.</b> All his books are illustrated by pictures he shoots himself.|$|E

50|$|John Wilcock was {{introduced}} to Andy Warhol through filmmaker Jonas Mekas, assisting on some of Warhol's early films, hanging out at his parties and quickly becoming a regular at The Factory. “About six months after I started {{hanging out at the}} old, silvery Factory on West 47th Street,” Wilcock later reflected, “Gerard Malanga {{came up to me and}} asked, ‘When are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> something <b>about</b> us?'” The book's title, originally suggested to Wilcock by Paul Morrissey, is misleading; the book is neither an autobiography nor a sexual exposé. Despite its small initial printing, the book was sold for upwards of $75 at some of the world's top art museums.|$|R

5000|$|... "I should {{warn you}} that the book’s a bit academic. Striphas teaches American Studies and Cultural Studies at Indiana University and he quotes Heidegger and Marx within the first few pages. He also has an {{annoying}} habit of telling you what he’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> rather than just writing it (as well as summarizing everything at the end). These are academic protocols, I realize, {{but you have to}} expect your readers to be smart enough to get it the first round." ...|$|E
