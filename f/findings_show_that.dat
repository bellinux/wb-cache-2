5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the study of}} bilingualism in children, similar research is being conducted in adults. Research <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> although bilingual benefits are muted in middle adulthood, they are more profound in older age when those who develop dementia experience onset about 4.5 years later in bilingual subjects. The increased attentional control, inhibition, and conflict resolution developed from bilingualism may be accountable for the later onset of dementia.|$|E

25|$|Another example {{would be}} a left neglect patient failing to {{describe}} left turns while describing a familiar route. This shows that the failure to describe things in the contralesional side can also affect verbal items. These <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> space representation is more topological than symbolic. Patients show a contralesional loss of space representation with a deviation of spatial reference to the ipsilesional side. In these cases we see a left-right dissimilarity of representation rather than a decline of representational competence.|$|E
25|$|Water {{resources}} that span international boundaries {{are more likely}} to be a source of collaboration and cooperation than war. Scientists working at the International Water Management Institute have been investigating the evidence behind water war predictions. Their <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that,</b> while it is true there has been conflict related to water in a handful of international basins, in the rest of the world’s approximately 300 shared basins the record has been largely positive. This is exemplified by the hundreds of treaties in place guiding equitable water use between nations sharing water resources. The institutions created by these agreements can, in fact, be one of the most important factors in ensuring cooperation rather than conflict.|$|E
25|$|Within the Cardamone et al. paper, {{comparisons}} {{are made with}} other compact galaxies, namely Blue Compact Dwarfs Galaxies and UV-luminous Galaxies, at local and much higher distances. The <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> GPs form a different class of galaxies than Ultra Blue Compact Dwarfs, but may {{be similar to the}} most luminous members of the Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy category. The GPs are also similar to UV-luminous high redshift galaxies such as Lyman-break Galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitter. It is concluded that if the underlying processes occurring in the GPs are similar to that found in the UV-luminous high redshift galaxies, the GPs may be the last remnants of a mode of star formation common in the early Universe.|$|E
30|$|The study <b>findings</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that,</b> first, {{participants}} experienced greater {{heart rate}} deceleration during exposure to messages about an apparel firm’s malevolent business practices than benevolent practices. Indeed, consumers {{seemed to get}} disheartened by the firm’s malevolent activities. Second, if an apparel firm {{is perceived to be}} malevolent, the study <b>finding</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> consumers may see the firm as untrustworthy even if it may be a credible firm. In addition, when consumers were exposed to messages about the firm’s malevolent business practices, perceived trust made a greater impact on the participant’s overall purchase intention than when consumers were exposed to benevolent messages. This finding was consistent with heart rate deceleration patterns.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{the changes in}} the financial statements and dividends can together provide a better information transmittal system to deliver missing private information on the firm using Indonesian firms as the sample. In doing so, this study consider three components in evaluating the dividend signaling theory: the expected content favorableness, the sign of dividend change, and the role of dividend signal. The <b>finding</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> in Indonesia, the market reactions to the dividend announcements depend on the role of dividend signals, whether it is confirmatory, clarificatory, or unclear. The other <b>finding</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> this market is more concern to the content expected favorableness rather than to the dividend sign...|$|R
25|$|As {{almost any}} cereal {{containing}} certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air, {{it is possible}} that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced about 3,500 BC in what is today Iran, {{and was one of the}} first-known biological engineering tasks where the biological process of fermentation is used. Also, archaeological <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Chinese villagers were brewing fermented alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scale, with the production process and methods similar to that of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E
25|$|Their <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{the three}} GPs display {{relatively}} low Extinction (astronomy), low oxygen abundances and high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. Also reported are the clear signatures of Wolf–Rayet stars, {{of which a}} population are found (between ~800 and ~1200). A combination of population and evolutionary synthesis models strongly suggest a formation history dominated by starbursts. These models show that these three GPs currently undergo a major starburst producing between ~4% and ~20% of their stellar mass. However, as these models imply, they are old galaxies having formed most of their stellar mass several billion years ago. The presence of old stars has been spectroscopically verified {{in one of the}} three galaxies by the detection of Magnesium. Surface photometry, using data from the Hubble Space Telescope archive, indicates that the three GPs possess an exponential low surface brightness envelope (see Low-surface-brightness galaxy). This suggests that GPs are identifiable with major episodes in the assembly history of local Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies.|$|E
25|$|Analyzing {{chromosome}} 21 of the Altai (Siberia), El Sidrón (Spain), and Vindija (Croatia) Neanderthals, it {{is determined}} that—of these three lineages—only the El Sidrón and Vindija Neanderthals display significant rates of gene flow (0.3–2.6%) into modern humans, {{suggesting that the}} El Sidrón and Vindija Neanderthals are more closely related than the Altai Neanderthal to the Neanderthals that interbred with modern humans about 47,000–65,000 years ago. Conversely, it is also determined that significant rates of modern human gene flow into Neanderthals occurred—of the three examined lineages—for only the Altai Neanderthal (0.1–2.1%), suggesting that modern human gene flow into Neanderthals mainly took place after {{the separation of the}} Altai Neanderthals from the El Sidrón and Vindija Neanderthals that occurred roughly 110,000 years ago. The <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the source of modern human gene flow into Neanderthals originated from a population of early modern humans from about 100,000 years ago, predating the out-of-Africa migration of the modern human ancestors of present-day non-Africans.|$|E

25|$|The {{specialized}} {{structures of}} the plant reveal a very interesting coevolution and symbiosis between these two species. A recent study performed by Céline Leroy et al. (2008) revealed many characteristics that the plant has adapted to support the ants. First, the domatia are located next to the stems that the ants use for hunting. Second, they contain extrafloral nectaries and food bodies to feed the ants {{if they do not}} have other sources of food. Third, there are less chloroplasts found inside of the domatia, which means that it has a lower photosynthetic capacity. Fourth, stomata were found inside of the domatia, although at a lower density, possibly to capture the carbon dioxide from the ants’ respiration taking place inside. Finally, there was a greater deposit of cellulose found in the domatia, which would result in a thicker cell wall and a more rigid surface to support the weight of the ants. These <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the areas destined to become domatia are inherited and a result of coevolution; they were solely produced to support this specific species of ant.|$|E
25|$|It was {{recently}} thought that self-recognition {{was restricted to}} mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition, but absent from animals without a neocortex. However, in 2008, an investigation of self-recognition in corvids was conducted revealing the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common ancestor nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror test showed that although magpies {{do not have a}} neocortex, they are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The <b>findings</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> magpies respond in the mirror test {{in a manner similar to}} apes, dolphins, killer whales, pigs and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence, it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.|$|E
