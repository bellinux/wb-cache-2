40|$|The {{effects of}} using palm kernel, honey and {{chemical}} waxes on some chemical properties, minerals and antinutrients compositions of pawpaw fruits stored {{for a period}} of weeks were investigated. Pawpaw fruits used for this study were obtained from a local farm at Aagba, in Boripe Local Government Area of Osun State, Nigeria. The fruits were grouped into four. Three of them were differently treated with each of the three waxes (palm kernel honey and chemical) using cold or <b>dipping</b> <b>wax</b> method while the fourth group served as control sample. The four samples were then stored under the same conditions of storage {{for a period of}} four weeks {{at the end of which}} they were evaluated for their chemical properties, mineral composition and antinutrients using the standard methods. The chemical analysis gives the pH (5. 380. 02 - 5. 910. 02), Reducing sugar (5. 320. 02 - 6. 400. 03) and vitamin C (22. 600. 05 - 27. 800. 05). The mineral analysis gives potassium (171. 600. 4 - 198. 700. 6), Phosphorus (148. 700. 3 - 161. 700. 4) and Iron (0. 450. 004 - 0. 640. 005). The antinutrients composition gives tannin (0. 1180. 002 - 0. 1240. 002), Saponin (0. 5000. 005 - 0. 5300. 005) and morphine alkaloid (1. 4000. 005 - 1. 5400. 006). The three waxes (palm kernel, honey and chemical) brought about decrease in the chemical properties, minerals and antinutrients compositions of pawpaw fruits.

P‑selectin has been associated with AS. The present study aimed to identify the role of Fg in AS and to examine the possible mechanisms behind the effects of fibrinogen on AS using Sprague‑Dawley (SD) rats as a model system. Diet‑induced atherosclerotic SD rats were adopted as the experimental models. Fg was trans-fused into these rats and the degree of atherosclerotic lesion development was compared with that of control rats. Blood was obtained from the common abdominal aorta and then the biochemical characteristics were measured and ELISA assays performed. The aortas were then carefully separated, removed and placed in 10 % (w/v) neutral formalin for use at a later stage. The root of the aorta was cut and samples were washed, dehydrated, cleared, <b>dipped</b> in <b>wax,</b> embedded, sliced, coated, grilled and stained with HE. Pathological HE‑stained sections were examined by light microscopic analysis and immunohistochemistry was performed for Fg and P‑selectin on representative tissue sections. The Fg‑transfused, high‑fat diet‑fed group developed atheroscle-rotic lesions more readily compared with the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Fg expression was higher in the endarterium of the Fg‑transfused, high‑fat diet‑fed rats. P‑selectin expression was also found to be corre-lated with Fg expression. Fg actively promotes atherosclerotic lesion development; one possible mechanism behind this is the ability of Fg to enhance P‑selectin expression, which is also able to facilitate the development of atherosclerotic lesions...|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{history of}} cleft lip {{is based on}} a combination of religion, superstition, invention and charlatanism. While Greeks ignored their existence, Spartans and Romans would kill these children as they were considered to harbour evil spirits. When saner senses prevailed Fabricius ab Aquapendente (1537 - 1619) was the first to suggest the embryological basis of these clefts. The knowledge of cleft lip and the surgical correction received a big boost during the period between the Renaissance and the 19 th century with the publication of Pierre Franco&#x 2032;s Petit Traite and Traite des Hernies in which he described the condition as "lievre fendu de nativite" (cleft lip present from birth). The first documented Cleft lip surgery is from China in 390 BC in an 18 year old would be soldier, Wey Young-Chi. Albucasis of Arabia and his fellow surgeons used the cautery instead of the scalpel and Yperman in 1854 recommended scarifying the margins with a scalpel before suturing them with a triangular needle <b>dipped</b> in <b>wax.</b> The repair was reinforced by passing a long needle through {{the two sides of the}} lip and fixing the shaft of the needle with a figure-of-eight thread over the lip.

In the late 50 s, Ralph Millard gave us his legendary &#x 2032;cut as you go&#x 2032; technique.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} morphology {{and surface}} area of organisms such as reef-building corals is central to their biology. Consequently, being able to detect and measure this aspect of corals is critical to understanding their interactions with the surrounding environment. This study explores six different methods of three-dimensional shape and surface area measurements using the range of morphology associated with the Scleractinian corals: Goniopora tenuidens, Acropora intermedia, and Porites cylindrica. Wax dipping; foil wrapping; multi-station convergent photogrammetry that used the naturally occurring optical texture for conjugate point matching; stereo photogrammetry that used projected light to provide optical texture; a handheld laser scanner that employed two cameras and a structured light source; and X-ray computer tomography (CT) scanning were applied to each coral skeleton to determine the spatial resolution of surface detection {{as well as the}} accuracy of surface area estimate of each method.

Treatments were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing the numbers of artificially inoculated rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium strain NVSL 95 - 1776 on the skin surface of bone-in chicken breasts. General model procedures were used to find statistical differences (P 2 log reductions) were also observed in validation trials in both pre- and post-chilled samples when compared to non-treated pre- and post-chilled controls. Only for psychrotrophic counts, chilled and post-chill interventions did not have a significant effect (P> 0. 05).

40|$|A working {{dental model}} is a model made from the mold taken from an {{intervention}} in the mouth (in the fixed prostheticsthat is preparation of the teeth) and on which it is directly modeled and a fixed prosthetic construction is made. We pour a hard or super hard plaster. The mold is made first by mixing the super hard plaster, a small quantity is poured on the protruding part of the mold (distal part of the palate) by tapping in slowly it slides in the lumen of all the molded teeth. In this way the water and air are squeezed outso there aren’t any defects or porosity on the molded movable dental nog. Today the dental model making is imperative, and the whole laboratory making of the artificial dental crowns taken from the working models (knows as “master” models) are mobile nogs {{that can be taken}} out {{of the rest of the}} mold mutable times and again put back in the completely same position. The reason is that, the removed nogs very easy to approach, model and control the precision of the gingival edge of the artificial crown, especially from the mesial and distal side where there is a chance of a small gap. The second reason is that some particular widely accepted models for making an envelope as the first phase of the modeling of the crown (for example: making an envelope by wrapping it in plastic foil also known as the Adapta-system or a model made by <b>dipping</b> in molted <b>wax)</b> they can be made only if the working nog is not mobile. In a working dental model is made with a mobile nog, there are a number of ways of making that: with Ney metal stakes, Trey- model- system with tray leading grooves and with separation, with root continuance from plaster or peg, with galvanization, with a mobile periodontium (his regards the surrounding gingival, and not directly on the movable working log.) The goal of the study is to explore methods and apparatus for making models with movable dental nogs and their use in today’s modern practice. For realization of the set goal a research was made and information was gathered from different manufacturers of apparatus and methods for making models with movable dental nogs. By using the Pindex apparatus we can drill channels in the plaster for placing double (Duplex) stakes, by using the Top Spin (automatic laser drill) a laser drill is make and placement of the stakes for making movable dental nogs in the dental practice.

40|$|Light {{fields in}} shallow water control the {{development}} of coral reefs. In fact, the morphology of reef-building corals defines the three-dimensional surface where photosynthesis occurs. However, little detailed information is available about the optical properties of waters over coral reefs and the consequent penetration of solar radiation. An understanding of these physical processes is particularly important in assessing how coral reefs are likely to respond to global climate change. This thesis pursues this understanding {{through a combination of}} experimental and field measurements as well as modelling and related computational approaches to integrate many separate fields of research to define the shallow water light field around coral reefs. The principal research objective of this thesis was to develop a greater understanding of the behaviour of light within shallow coastal waters by acquiring the physical information needed to model solar irradiance fields in a realistic coral reef environment using high-resolution, fine-scale methodologies. The second objective was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} contribution of light to the stress phenomenon of mass coral bleaching with a view to informing a better design of satellite-based sensors and analytical algorithms. In order to address these overarching objectives, the thesis addressed 3 key questions: (1) What are the optical properties of waters surrounding coral reef regions of the world and how accurately can they be measured from remote sensing platforms? (2) What are the most important optical and photophysiological processes {{in shallow water}} coral reefs? (3) How are light fields incident on coral colonies controlled by shape and morphology, and how can these shapes be better captured at the scale of centimetres to millimetres to increase the understanding of photon interactions? The optical water quality of a region was found to strongly affect the spectral and absolute irradiance field incident on a coral reef, with the waters and coral reefs of the Mexican Meso-American Barrier Reef System being significantly different to those of the Australian Great Barrier Reef and the Israeli Gulf of Aqaba. These differences were driven by: distance of the coral reefs from land, the extent of human disturbance of associated coastal areas, and the subsequent amount of optically-sensitive dissolved components and suspended sediment in the water column. The significant focussing of light energy by small waves in shallow water coral reefs, despite producing irradiance intensities in excess of 2. 5 times surface irradiance conditions at depth on the most light-exposed coral reef in the world (Northern Red Sea), did not result in altered or depressed photosynthetic productivity under either wave lensing or static illumination conditions. The light field experienced by shallow water coral reefs is primarily linked to the skeletal shape and complexity with most coral physiological studies normalising parameters to the surface area of the primary surface of the coral skeleton. The accuracy of surface area detection is critical to this normalisation process, which revealed that, compared to surface area detection using the highly accurate X-Ray Computer Tomography technique, single <b>wax</b> <b>dipping</b> will permit highly accurate surface area estimates of most coral skeletons. If surface area models or three-dimensional shapes are required, instead of just surface area, the X-Ray CT provides the most realistic coral surface. Such a realistic coral morphology was subsequently used to investigate light fields over a shallow water coral reef with a three-dimensional radiative transfer light model. The preliminary results of the model indicated that skeletal morphology, photosynthetic tissue albedo and location and substrate albedo contributed to the total photon yield at any point on a coral surface. The results and analysis associated with this thesis illustrate the highly complex nature of shallow water light fields in coral reefs and indicate the need to increase the accuracy and resolution of light monitoring currently being undertaken in coastal waters globally. Focusing on this issue is critically important to improving the predictive products that are available for coral reefs. Given the central role that light plays in the biology of corals and coral reefs, understanding the complexities of solar radiation, optical properties and tropical coastal environments is vital, especially given the importance of coral reef ecosystems to millions of people worldwide...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} potential for cassava a crop crucial for food security, especially in Africa remains largely untapped, despite constant growth in output. Nevertheless, {{a range of}} markets, including consumer, industrial, local and international, are important as this tuber strives to become competitive. Which crop grown in Africa produces {{twice as much as}} maize and three times as much as millet or sorghum? And which crop has seen Africa emerge as overall leader, accounting {{for more than half of}} the world output, with Nigeria as the biggest producer? Which same crop has seen production levels triple on the continent over the past 50 years? And now covers one-third of the dietary needs of its population? The answer is cassava. In the past few decades, this tuber has quietly taken over thousands of hectares and become the staple food of over 200 million Africans, or more than one-quarter of the continent s population. According to FAO figures, Africa produced 103 mt of cassava tubers on 18 million ha of land in 2004. This shrub, with its long stems and parasol-shaped leaves is now as common in Sahelian countries as it is in the more humid climes of Central Africa and the Gulf of Guinea, where it has traditionally thrived. Output varies greatly between regions, ranging from 1. 8 t/ha in Sudan to an average of 10. 6 t in Nigeria (which still falls way behind the yields achieved in the Caribbean: 16. 6 t in Barbados alone). Well established in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which for a long time was Africa s leading producer, the crop has now spread to southern Africa (Malawi, Zambia) at the expense of maize. Here, where HIV/AIDs is killing many farmers, families are turning to crops which require less labour. Insuring against famine A number of other factors explain this rapid expansion, especially on smallholdings run by poor farmers, where cassava is often grown together with other crops. Cassava has the advantage of being relatively undemanding, and will thrive on poor and even tired soils, where few other crops will grow. In places where land is scarce, it also serves as food security for many villagers vulnerable to malnutrition. With cassava, they can be more confident of having a low-cost, plentiful supply of calories than they would have had they grown cereals. For farmers living close to towns, it is a valuable cash crop, with a flourishing market. In West Africa, its development has been further helped by the rapid expansion of towns and by an initiative launched by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), which has distributed new, more productive varieties that are resistant to a number of diseases as well as to drought. Cassava, fuel of the future? At a time when oil prices are soaring and global reserves dwindling, the spotlight is turning to ethanol made from fermented cassava starch, a particularly promising resource. Similar to other types of ethanol obtained from agricultural products, it can be used to substitute between 10 % and 25 % of petrol in vehicles with standard engines, and up to 100 % in vehicles whose engines have been adapted. Brazil, the world s leading producer of these substitute fuels or biofuels, makes more than 120 million hl per year from sugarcane and cassava. In Thailand and China, several projects for manufacturing cassava-based biofuel on an industrial scale are under way. In Africa, Nigeria is following suit and in early 2006, a law is expected to approve the use of 10 % biofuel in petrol, thereby cutting both the country s oil bill and pollution levels. In the short term, the fuel will be imported from Brazil, but in the longer term it will be manufactured locally. The flip side of the coin is that when this crop vitally important to a number of regions is hit by disease, the result is famine. That was seen all too clearly when the cassava mosaic virus devastated production in Uganda during the 1990 s. Burundi, DRC and Rwanda are currently grappling with the same disease and programmes to distribute resistant varieties are attempting to curtail the epidemic before it takes hold. This plant has long been neglected by research in favour of cereals, but its recent rapid success and its key role in feeding a number of regions go a long way towards explaining the renewed attention it is enjoying today. In partnership with the IITA, The New Partnership for Africa s Development (NEPAD) has launched the Pan-African Cassava Initiative to encourage projects based on the use of cassava as a food security crop and as a weapon against poverty. However, the economic importance of cassava is still disproportionately low given the major role it plays in agriculture and food supply. Once the hydrocyanic acid has been removed from the bitter varieties, the edible leaves are rich in protein and the tubers lend themselves to a wide range of preparations: chips, flour, semolina and cassava meal (gari, attiéké, foufou, chikwangue) to name a few. According to the IITA, close to one-third of all cassava is eaten fresh. The remainder needs to be processed quickly, as the tubers keep for barely 2 days under normal storage conditions. The Collaborative Study of Cassava in Africa (COSCA), conducted in the 1990 s, found that only 20 % of cassava-producing villages can be reached by motorised transport. Generally, farmers have to travel more than 10 km to take their heavy loads to market. In DRC, Africa s second largest producer, that is the case for seven out of ten villages. Long preparations Before cassava can be conserved and sold, it must first be processed. This task generally falls to women, who soak and grate it, then dry the roots. It is a long and tedious job, especially in rural areas where there are no machines, and the high input in terms of labour is not reflected in the often low price fetched by the finished product. Small businesses equipped with machinery are springing up in some towns, especially in countries around the Gulf of Guinea, and this encourages a steady flow of production from farmers in the outlying areas. COSCA has estimated that a mechanical grater cuts the processing time by half and therefore increases profits. In West Africa, the IITA has developed and distributed a number of machines, but they are still not sufficient, especially in the villages, to increase the commercial viability of a sector which in any case suffers from poor organisation. Beyond production Between 1996 and 2003, cassava production doubled to reach a total output of 3. 9 mt in Benin, while the per-ha yield increased by 25 %. This strong performance was largely the result of the government scheme a billion for cassava which offered credits, fertiliser and cuttings of improved varieties to producers in a bid to encourage them to increase production. But nothing was done to improve marketing at the same time. Poorly organised and lacking in processing equipment, the cassava sector proved unable to absorb the extra tonnes of cassava, and farmers found themselves forced to sell their crops off cheaply in some cases, they were unable to sell them at all. Exports of cassava chips to Europe for livestock fodder, have also been falling since 2002 as European farmers have turned to less costly cereal-based feed. In 2004, cassava production suddenly fell by half, with the result that the ethanol factory built by a Chinese group was unable to find enough raw material. Farmers say they are now ready to restart production if they can be assured of sales for their crop. But markets exist in the increasingly populated urban areas, as do technologies offering consumers cassava-based products that are easy to use. Good examples can be found in the Caribbean, the Pacific and South America, above all in Brazil, which has long been the world s leading cassava producer. Here, cassava is prepared in a host of different ways, often on an industrial scale, and the products chips, cakes, frozen dishes are sold in shops. In Brazil, one chain of stores sells cassava cheese bread. Cassava flour is used as a partial substitute for wheat flour to make traditional bread. In 2002, the Brazilian Congress even passed a law making it mandatory for bread to contain at least 20 % cassava flour and 40 % in the case of pizza. The idea was to reduce costly wheat imports and develop the commercial potential of local crops. Africa still lags way behind in this respect, though Nigerian bakers are now required to use 10 % of cassava flour in their bread (see Spore 117). A number of techniques developed in Latin America could be used in Africa. Colombian researchers have managed to extend the shelf-life of fresh cassava roots to 3 or 4 weeks by <b>dipping</b> them in <b>wax</b> or paraffin. Livestock fodder also offers interesting potential. In Africa, less than 2 % of cassava is used to feed animals, compared with 30 % in Latin America. In Cameroon, researchers estimate that poultry farmers could cut production costs by 40 % if they used cassava as part of their chickens diet. On a global scale, animal feed represents the main outlet for cassava. Thailand exports an annual 4 to 5 mt of it, mostly to the European Union. Finally, there are the many industrial uses to which this tuber lends itself. Starch, the main product to be made from cassava, is used in the food and textile industries as well as in the pharmaceutical and rubber sectors. In Africa, few companies make starch, and production does not even supply domestic needs. With the rise in oil prices, the manufacture of cassava-based ethanol, already widely used in Brazil to replace additives in petrol or as a biofuel, could constitute another interesting outlet. Multiple markets Market prospects for cassava have increased. But these have yet to be accessed by African farmers, some of whom have difficulty in selling their crops, as is the case in Benin where production has increased significantly. Large-scale production of food or industrial products requires a steady supply of good quality raw material. That is the first pre-condition, and Africa has yet to fulfil it since most of its cassava output is sold by large numbers of small-scale producers with no quality control whatsoever. The second requirement is that production costs be sufficiently attractive, for local as well as for international markets. Improving processing technologies is crucial if production costs are to fall significantly and both producers and processors are to earn enough income. On the world market, cassava starch faces competition from less costly maize starch. In 2002 for example, maize starch imported from Europe to Nigeria cost three times less than local cassava starch. While small groups of fairly well organised processors do exist, they are not always big enough to take advantage of economies of scale. What is more, cultivation and harvesting are still done entirely by hand. According to COSCA, this is partly explained by the considerable variation in size between one cassava plant and another, and between the size of their roots, which makes it difficult to mechanise crop cultivation. Major developments in both technologies and in organising markets are therefore essential if African cassava is to become competitive on local and international markets. When these conditions are met cassava will not only play a role in ensuring food security; it will also become a force for rural development. A just reward for producers who have worked so hard to expand production.
