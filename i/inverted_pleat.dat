50|$|Wrap blouses {{and dresses}} {{did away with}} a need for zippers, buttons and belts. Halter tops did away with collars. Flared and gored skirts {{provided}} fullness and ease of movement while avoiding the stiffness and puffiness of a gathered waistline. Judicious draping on dresses and jackets, <b>inverted</b> <b>pleats</b> on pants, set-in panels; all continued this body-conscious philosophy. Waistbands and cuffs became ribbed and elasticized, offering more comfort and a sleeker line, as well as protection against the elements. Scarves were built into blouses or jackets, or looped through a belt. Short sleeved jackets provided both polish and practicality. Pockets freed up a womanâ€™s hands, as did chains and clips, which held a clip-on cigarette case, a visor, or a pair of gloves. Collars disappeared from coats and jackets, or were shrunk down to a simple stand-up style. Kimono cut coats closed with sashes or one or two oversized buttons. A slim ribbed turtleneck pullover became one with the body and removed {{the need for a}} scarf to keep the wearerâ€™s throat warm. Thin ribbed pullovers were layered, making them ideal for cool temperatures or outdoor sports, but also easy to peel off once inside for maximum comfort.|$|R
