Such OPS technology however raises significant transport and Quality of Service (QoS) challenges due to technological limitations. To circumvent OPS limitations, we {{have proposed a}} new Optical Coarse Packet Switching (OCPS) paradigm, which uses in-band-controlled per-burst switching and advocates traffic control enforcement to achieve high packet-loss performance and differentiated services. Based on OCPS, we have constructed an experimental IP-over-WDM network, referred to as OPSINET. OPSINET consists of two major types of nodes- <b>edge</b> <b>routers,</b> <b>and</b> Optical Label Switched <b>Routers</b> (OLSRs), <b>and</b> is facilitated with an out-of-band Generalized Multi-protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control network.

Besides, using the buffering technique during the MN movement prevents the packet loss and leads to extra overhead on the network entities. The buffered packets should be tunneled to the MN through the new point of attachment. This tunneling process leads to increase in the power expenditure and signaling cost due to using a lot of control information by the MN [86]. These protocols also do not consider the duty cycle when the MN state in the hibernation mode to leverage the power. Furthermore, the network-based protocols do not consider the multi-hop communication between the <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> <b>and</b> its node, and thus the MN consumes high power to send the packets to the edge router, especially when the router is so far from its node.|$|E

DFM assumes that each node in a local network may change its IP address, and the MAC filtering is enabled in the edge router. Moreover, the attacker may change its MAC address. However, in these cases, if the attacker changes his MAC address, DFM is still able to trace three levels up to the attacker node.

We first propose and demonstrate optical-label switching core router architecture with multicast function. The multicast switching architecture provides reduced complexity and effective multicast contention resolution compared to conventional multicast-capable switch-ing fabric. A proof-of-principle experiment successfully showed packet multicast forwarding with contention resolution. The all-optical TTL monitors the healthiness of the packet, and prevents degraded packets from traveling or looping further in the network. The experiment demonstrated successful packet discards based on optical signal-to-noise ratio degradation.
