Independent label Epitaph Records was considered, but the band wanted a company that would guarantee a wide release.

J had approached Pearl Jam as early as 2001, and had its first experiments with the band issuing the live album Live at Benaroya Hall in 2004. Vedder said J was picked as they searched for [...] "somebody who'll allow us to be who we are and respects <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> things" [...] and contributed with the [...] "facilitation of getting the music out there". Gossard added the label did not input any time or creative constraints upon the band - [...] " [...] We didn't play them much music until it was basically done, and they were pleased.

Referring specifically to that year's Los Angeles riots, {{in the first}} single, [...] "Wicked", he rapped [...] "April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel". The Predator debuted at number one on both the pop and R charts, the first album in history to do so.

The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after The Predator, Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album Lethal Injection, which was released {{at the end of}} 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the G-Funk sound of Dr. Dre's The Chronic, was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from Lethal Injection, including [...] "Really Doe", [...] "Bop Gun (One Nation)", [...] "You Know <b>How</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> It" [...] & [...] "What Can I Do?". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, Mack 10, Mr. Short Khop, Kausion, and Da Lench Mob.|$|E
