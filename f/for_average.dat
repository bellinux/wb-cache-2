40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{relation}} between the Ahronov-Bohm effect and traditional postulates of electrodynamics, which claim that only electric and magnetic fields are observable, is resolved by denial of the statement about validity of the Maxwell equations for microscopic fields. We proceed from the idea that the Maxwell equations, as the generalization of experimental data, are valid only <b>for</b> <b>averaged</b> values. We show that microscopic electrodynamics should be based on postulation of the d'Alembert equations for four-vector of the electromagnetic field potential. The Lorentz condition is valid only <b>for</b> the <b>averages</b> and provides the implementation of the Maxwell equations <b>for</b> <b>averages.</b> This concept eliminates the problem of electromagnetic field quantization and provides the correctness of all known results of quantum electrodynamics. Therefore, the "virtuality" of the longitudinal and scalar photons has a formal mathematical character, conditioned by the Maxwell equations <b>for</b> <b>averaged</b> fields. The longitudinal and scalar photons provide not only the Coulomb interaction of charged particles, but also allow the electrical Aharonov-Bohm effect. Comment: 9 pages, 0 figure...|$|R
