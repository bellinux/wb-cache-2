40|$|To fully {{understand}} processes {{of knowing and}} knowledge acquisition, {{it is necessary to}} examine people’s understanding of their own know-ing. Individual and developmental differences in what it means to know something, and hence in the criteria for justifying knowledge claims, have potentially wide-ranging implications. In providing sup-port for a claim, young children have difficulty differentiating expla-nation of why a <b>claim</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> and evidence that the claim is true. Epistemic understanding progresses developmentally, but substantial variation remains among adults, with few adults achieving under-standing of the complementary strengths and weaknesses of evidence and explanation in argument. Epistemic understanding shapes intel-lectual values and hence the disposition (as opposed to competence) to exercise intellectual skills. Only its most advanced levels support a disposition to engage in the intellectual effort that reasoned argument entails. The sample case of juror reasoning illustrates how epistemi...|$|R

40|$|Together {{they are}} {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} Halliburton doing work for the United States in Iraq. Cheney, as one of Bush’s most trusted advisors, convinces the President that invading Iraq is necessary; Halliburton is the only company capable of helping us to properly reconstruct the nation once it is occupied, and allowing other companies to bid on such work would hinder our efforts in Iraq because it would inhibit military stealth. All of these <b>claims</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to the President, and he goes along with what Cheney and Lesar suggest. However, Cheney’s real reason for encouraging Bush to give a $ 7 billion no-bid contract to Halliburton is a corrupt agreement he has made with former colleagues. The Vice President, who served as CEO of Halliburton from 1995 through 2000, still has stock in and receives deferred compensation payments from the company, and could theoretically go back and work for it again after his term ends. Cheney is getting work in Iraq for Halliburton and allowing the company to overcharge for this work because Lesar promises to make these corrupt acts “worth his while ” after he leaves office. Essentially, the second most powerful elected official in the United States is putting his...|$|R
40|$|The Bible is a plain book, ” {{declared}} the early fundamentalist preacher Charles Hodge in 1857. “It is intelligible by the people. And {{they have the}} right and are bound to read and interpret it for themselves; so that their faith may rest on the testimony of the Scriptures, and not that of the Church ” (Boone 17). Here is a central image of fundamentalism – as true today as 150 years ago. The simple uneducated reader, unchurched and untutored, opens the Biblical text, reads, and finds salvation. For Hodge, the text, read by a reader illuminated by the Holy Spirit, is sufficient. The Text itself instructs the reader, and the Church is an obstacle to the true reading of the text. My aim tonight is to show why Hodge’s <b>claim</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> within the rules of Fundamentalism, but cannot <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to any body who {{is not part of the}} form of life which allows those rules to exist. And I want to argue that this is because Fundamentalism is what the French philosopher Michel Foucault would call “a discourse ” and that the Fundamentalist simply reading his Bible is immersed in a whole mass of texts that belong to a single discursive formation – Fundamentalism – written by “so many authors who know or do not know one another, criticise one another, invalidate one another, pillage one another, meet without knowing it and obstinately intersect their unique discourses in a web of which they cannot see the whole, and of whose breadth the...|$|R

40|$|Raanan Gillon is a noted {{defender of}} the four {{principles}} approach to healthcare ethics. His general position {{has always been that}} these principles are to be considered to be both universal and prima facie in nature. In recent work, however, he has made two claims that seem to present difficulties for this view. <b>His</b> first <b>claim</b> is that one of these four principles, respect for autonomy, has a special position in relation to the others: he holds that it is first among equals. We argue that this <b>claim</b> <b>makes</b> little <b>sense</b> if the principles are to retain their prima facie nature. <b>His</b> second <b>claim</b> is that cultural variation can play an independent normative role in the construction of our moral judgments. This, he argues, enables us to occupy a middle ground between what he sees as the twin pitfalls of moral relativism and (what he calls) moral imperialism. We argue {{that there is no such}} middle ground, and while Gillon ultimately seems committed to relativism, it is some form of moral imperialism (in the form of moral objectivism) that will provide the only satisfactory construal of the four principles as prima facie universal moral principles...|$|R
40|$|Readings of Derrida’s work on law {{and justice}} have tended to stress the {{distinction}} between them. This stress is complicated by Derrida’s own claim {{that it is not}} ‘a true distinction’. In this essay I argue that ordinary experiences of the inadequacy of existing laws do indeed imply a claim about what would be more just, but that this <b>claim</b> only <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> insofar as one can appeal to another more adequate law (whether the projection of a new law or an existing ‘higher’ law). Exploring how Derrida negotiates a subtle path between classical Platonism and classical conventionalism about justice, the attempt is made to take seriously Derrida’s aim to affirm the idea of a ‘mystical’ foundation of the authority of laws by taking ‘the use of the word “mystical” in what I venture to call a rather Wittgensteinian direction’...|$|R

When labour demand is depressed, they <b>claim</b> it <b>makes</b> little <b>sense</b> to activate job seekers since all it will achieve is to reshuffle the queue of the unemployed.|$|R
40|$|We {{sometimes}} say {{our moral}} claims are ‘‘objectively true,’’ or are ‘‘right, even if nobody believes it. ’’ These additional claims are often {{taken to be}} staking out metaethical positions, representative {{of a certain kind}} of theorizing about morality that ‘‘steps outside’’ the practice in order to comment on its status. Ronald Dworkin has argued that skepticism about these claims so understood is not tenable because it is impossible to step outside such practices. I show that externally skeptical metaethical theory can withstand his attacks, thereby defending the possibility of this kind of metatheoretical method and showing that the additional objectivity <b>claims</b> still <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> as external <b>claims.</b> Four interpretations of the additional objectivity claims can still be understood externally: as secondary properties, as arguing for some form of causal correspondence, as explaining error, and under Blackburn’s expressivism.

5000|$|Angered by {{the lack}} of {{interest}} by mainstream Unionism and the police investigation McCord carried out his own investigation. Promising to his family to act within the law he used his contacts with loyalism to uncover that Mark Haddock was a police informer. McCord claims he met with UVF Chief of Staff John [...] "Bunter" [...] Graham and other leading members of the organisation in the Maze prison, where they were waiting to visit an inmate, soon after his son's killing and that they agreed to conduct the internal investigation that uncovered the information about Haddock. However he further claimed that the inquiry did not target Haddock as some of those involved in it were themselves police informers. McCord discovered that Haddock's status as an informer meant he wasn't questioned or linked to the killing of his son. Telling anyone who would listen to <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> McCord <b>make</b> a decisive breakthrough in 2002 when he met Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan. O'Loan conducted an investigation and the results were published in 2007. The investigation was named Operation Ballast, and focused on alleged collusion between the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the UVF. The report stated the police colluded with loyalists in over a dozen murders in North Belfast. O'Loan had established that a leading loyalist who was also a police informer had been involved in the killing and in 2005 it was announced in the Dáil by Irish Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte using parliamentary privilege that the loyalist in question was Mark Haddock.|$|R
