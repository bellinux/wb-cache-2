5000|$|The first beta of phpBB3 was {{released}} in June 2006, and the first release candidate {{was released}} in May 2007. The phpBB3 codebase received an <b>external</b> <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> in September, which was done by SektionEins.

5000|$|The {{encryption}} process used by Threema {{is based}} on the open source library NaCl library. Threema uses asymmetric ECC-based encryption, with 256-bit strength. Threema offers a [...] "Validation Logging" [...] feature that makes it possible to confirm that messages are end-to-end encrypted using the NaCl Networking and Cryptography library. In August 2015, Threema was subjected to an <b>external</b> <b>security</b> <b>audit.</b> Researchers from cnlab confirmed that Threema allows secure end-to-end encryption, and claimed that they were unable to identify any weaknesses in the implementation. Cnlab researchers also confirmed that Threema provides anonymity to its users and handles contacts and other user data as advertised.|$|E
5000|$|On November 4, 2014, Viber scored 1 out of 7 {{points on}} the Electronic Frontier Foundation's [...] "Secure Messaging Scorecard". Viber {{received}} a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications were not encrypted with keys that the provider didn't have access to (i.e. the communications were not end-to-end encrypted), users could not verify contacts' identities, past messages were not secure if the encryption keys were stolen (i.e. the service did not provide forward secrecy), the code was not open to independent review (i.e. the code was not open-source), the security design was not properly documented, and {{there had not been}} a recent independent security audit. On November 14, 2014, the EFF changed Viber's score to 2 out of 7 after it had received an <b>external</b> <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> from Ernst & Young's Advanced Security Centre.|$|E
30|$|A low {{score in}} Table 5 {{suggests}} {{that many of the}} sub-controls have not been addressed, which suggests there is relevant information that has not been collected. It is unsurprising that Control 10, which relates to cryptography, scores well because there is only one sub-control and most of the forms mention cryptographic protocols. Similarly, Section 18 scores highly; this is because the first control relates to compliance and the second to <b>external</b> <b>security</b> <b>audits,</b> each of these sub-controls is well-represented in the proposal forms. This analysis reveals Control 12 : Operations Management has much room for improvement, despite the sub-controls relating to malware control, backups and patching scoring highly. Control 12 contains some sub-controls which were entirely ignored such as 12.5 Control of operational software and 14.1 Security requirements of information systems.|$|R

50|$|In December 2004, a {{large number}} of Web sites were defaced by the Santy worm, which used {{vulnerabilities}} in outdated versions of phpBB2 to overwrite PHP and HTML pages. Although these were the result of outdated versions of PHP and phpBB, incidents like these have caused the security of phpBB to be disputed. There have also been a few times where new releases of phpBB have come out a few days apart, although the last occurrence of this was in early 2005. However, the phpBB Team usually responds to security reports as soon as possible, and releases a new version quickly. The phpBB Group, attempting to learn from previous failures, performed a codebase security audit before the release of 2.0.18. The phpBB3 codebase received an <b>external</b> <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> in September 2007, which was done by SektionEins. The sixth release candidate of phpBB3 was published following the results of the security audit.|$|E

Potential cloud computing consumers like to know whether the controls in cloud environments can adequately protect critical assets migrated into the cloud. We present a cloud <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> approach to enable users' evaluate cloud service provider offerings before migration, as well as monitoring of events after migration. Our approach entails a set of concepts such as actor, goals, monitoring, conditions, evidence and assurance to support <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> activities. These concepts are considered as a language for describing the properties necessary for cloud <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> both before and after migration. Finally, a real cloud migration use case is given to demonstrate the applicability of the <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> approach...|$|R

Furthermore, some criteria, that each process and technological <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> should meet, are set so that {{the result of an}} audit is of sufficient quality. Part of this thesis contains a procedure that states activities that are done before, during and after such audit. The main benefit of this thesis is an evaluation whether procedures and outcomes of the process and technological <b>security</b> <b>audit</b> based on an open source MetDK methodology achieve sufficient quality that is defined for this area.

40|$|Information <b>security</b> <b>auditing</b> plays {{key role}} in {{providing}} any organizationâs good security level. Because of the high cost, time and human resource intensiveness, audit expenses optimization becomes an actual issue.

We suggest that fuzzy expert systems techniques can offer significant benefits when applied to this area.
