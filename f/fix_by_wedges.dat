40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to study the results of ankle arthrodesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The long-term results of treatment were analyzed and studied in 9 RA patients with synovitis. These were assessed using the Luboshitz-Mathis procedure: 6 (66. 7 %) patients achieved a good result; 1 (11. 1 %) and 2 (22. 2 %) had satisfactory and poor results, respectively. It was found that synovectomy should be performed during arthrodesis and the latter should itself be attended by minimal shortening. The paper describes the authorXs procedure of osteoplastic ankle arthrodesis that minimizes limb shortening. The essence of the operation is to cut out two autografts from the ankle and shin bones with cylindrical hollow milling cutters. The grafts are turned through a certain angle to block the ankle joint area and are <b>fixed</b> <b>by</b> spirally <b>wedging.</b> The proposed procedure {{makes it possible to}} perform arthrodesis rapidly and with minimum blood loss and to have bony ankylosis within 2 - 3 months ahead...|$|R

So long as these remain fixed, there is no fear of any general {{movement}} but, if they went, the whole mass might come down. This passage is less than three feet wide, and the bamboos are twelve feet long; so that each would make four, {{the width of the}} passage. I propose to drive them tightly in, and fix them firmly with wedges. They must be put in so that they will actually touch the stones, so as to prevent their making the slightest downward movement. If they began to slide, no doubt they would carry away the bamboos; but if these were <b>fixed</b> firmly, <b>by</b> <b>wedges,</b> they ought to be sufficient to prevent any movement from taking place--especially as there would be enough of them almost to touch each other, extending from this lowest step, on which the rocks rest, some five feet upwards--that is, to within some two feet of the roof, which would be sufficient for us to crawl through, and the bamboos would serve as a ladder. Then I propose that we should work our way along the top, passing the small stones and rubbish backwards, after filling up all the cracks and crevices below us.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundPossibility of {{curative}} resection by lobectomy for non–small cell {{lung cancer}} is often denied patients with compromised pulmonary reserve. Analysis of survival of such patients treated <b>by</b> <b>wedge</b> resection was {{compared with that}} of patients treated by standard resection, with both groups followed for 10 years. DesignA prospective 5 -year cohort study. MethodsFrom 1988 to 1992, an observational cohort of 127 consecutive resected patients at Memphis VA Medical Center was divided into those receiving lobectomy in 81 cases and pneumonectomy in 15 cases (group I) versus 31 patients with compromised pulmonary reserve (group II), who had complete tumor excision <b>by</b> <b>wedge</b> resection. Preoperative clinical staging was corrected to surgical–pathological staging after demonstration of its superiority. Survival estimates were obtained by Kaplan–Meier method with curves compared by log rank tests, with all-cause mortality calculated from date of surgery. ResultsExtent of disease in group I was 58 % stage I, 19 % stage II, and 23 % stage III. In group II, extent of disease was 84 % stage I, 3 % stage II, and 14 % stage III. Group I median survival was 26 months with 30 % 5 -year survival; for group II, median survival was 30 months and 32 %. Kaplan–Meier survival plots showed similar curves in groups I and II. Realizing less extent of disease in group II, another Kaplan–Meier plot restricted to stage I and II patients showed overlapping survival curves for groups I and II. ConclusionSurvival during 10 -year observation was similar for patients with pulmonary insufficiency treated <b>by</b> <b>wedge</b> resection to that of patients receiving standard resection in this single-institution consecutive cohort...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel phase-shifting vectorial-shearing {{interferometer}} with a wedge plate phase-shifter. The interferometer {{is based on}} a modified Mach-Zehnder configuration; the common-path nature makes it capable of testing the wavefront of a short coherence-length light source, such as a laser diode. Vectorial shear (shearing in the x and y directions simultaneously) in an arbitrary direction is introduced <b>by</b> inserting two <b>wedge</b> plates orthogonally in two arms, respectively. One of the wedge plates is split into two parts (parallel part and wedge part); phase shift is produced <b>by</b> moving the <b>wedge</b> part in contact along the parallel part. The moving distance for a 2 pi phase shift is a few millimetres in specific conditions. The wedge plate phase-shifter increases the moving distance for phase shift and makes the control of phase shift relatively easy. We also discuss the lateral shear error and phase shift errors induced <b>by</b> <b>wedge</b> plates. The lateral shear error is small enough to be ignored; the phase shift error is determined mainly <b>by</b> the <b>wedge</b> angle error. Lastly, we give the experimental results of phase-shifting interference fringes in vectorial shear mode...|$|R
