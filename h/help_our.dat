In September 1944, Rosenberg {{suggested}} to Feklisov that he should consider recruiting his brother-in-law, David Greenglass, and his wife. On September 21, 1944, Feklisov reported to Moscow: [...] "They are young, intelligent, capable, and politically developed people, strongly believing {{in the cause of}} communism and wishing to do their best to <b>help</b> <b>our</b> country as much as possible.

Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1941, {{in towns}} and villages {{invasion}} committees were formed {{to cooperate with the}} military and plan for the worst should their communities be isolated or occupied. The members of committees typically included representatives of the local council, the Air Raid Precautions service, the fire service, the police, the Women's Voluntary Service and the Home Guard, as well as officers for medicine, sanitation and food. Plans of these committees were kept in secret War Books although few remain. Detailed inventories of anything useful were kept: vehicles, animals and basic tools, and lists were made of contact details for key personnel. Plans were made {{for a wide range of}} emergencies, including improvised mortuaries and places to bury the dead. Instructions to the Invasion Committees stated: [...] "...every citizen will regard it as his duty to hinder and frustrate the enemy and <b>help</b> <b>our</b> own forces by every means that ingenuity can devise and common sense suggest." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the galactic}} plane does not pass through {{this part of}} Serpens, a view to many galaxies beyond it is possible. However, a few {{structures}} of the Milky Way Galaxy are present in Serpens Caput, such as Messier 5, a globular cluster positioned approximately 8° southwest of α Serpentis, next to the star 5 Serpentis. Barely {{visible to the naked}} eye under good conditions, and is located approximately 25,000ly distant. Messier 5 contains a large number of known RR Lyrae variable stars, and is receding from us at over 50km/s. The cluster contains two millisecond pulsars, one of which is in a binary, allowing the proper motion of the cluster to be measured. The binary could <b>help</b> <b>our</b> understanding of neutron degenerate matter; the current median mass, if confirmed, would exclude any [...] "soft" [...] equation of state for such matter. The cluster has been used to test for magnetic dipole moments in neutrinos, which could shed light on some hypothetical particles such as the axion. Another globular cluster is Palomar 5, found just south of Messier 5. Many stars are leaving this globular cluster due to the Milky Way's gravity, forming a tidal tail over 30000 light-years long.|$|E
500|$|On release, Billboard {{magazine}} described [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as [...] "a musical {{appeal to}} <b>help</b> <b>our</b> fellow-man" [...] that [...] "should find immediate and heavy chart action". In his contemporary review for the NME, Derek Johnson considered the song to be [...] "ot so strong melodically as 'My Sweet Lord', but still nagging and insistent", and added: [...] "one can immediately detect the despair and pity in [...] {{voice as he}} sings of the appalling plight of the East Pakistanis... his lyric is bound to cause some heart-searching." [...] A wave of public goodwill accompanied the single's release in 1971, {{as was the case}} with the two benefit concerts, the subsequent live album, and the 1972 concert film. Simon Leng has identified genuine friendship as being key to the success of Harrison and Shankar's relief project: the friendship between the two of them that saw the ex-Beatle become involved, and the friendships Harrison had cultivated with Dylan, Clapton and Starr that ensured their participation. Leng notes that the opening lyrics to [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] ("My friend came to me...") could equally have applied to Harrison's efforts to enlist the reluctant Dylan and heroin-sidelined Clapton.|$|E
500|$|In September 1939, Britain {{entered the}} Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's {{children}} were evacuated {{to avoid the}} frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, [...] "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." [...] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived {{for most of the}} next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: [...] "We are trying to do all we can to <b>help</b> <b>our</b> gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, Wilding joined the Royal Marines on advice of Winston Churchill who was then First Lord of the Admiralty. He was gazetted a second lieutenant in early October 1914. Wilding remained in the Marines {{for just a few}} days and was then attached to the Intelligence Corps due to his intimate knowledge of the continent and his skills as a motorist. At the end of October he joined the Royal Naval Armoured Car Division in the battlefields of northern France where he had thirty men, three guns and armoured cars under his command. After a week's leave in London in February 1915 he returned to France on 16 March 1915 and was posted to a new squadron made up of armoured Rolls Royce cars under the command of the Duke of Westminster. He was ranked a lieutenant. Before long the squadron was moved near the front and on 2 May Wilding received notice of his promotion to captain. In his last letter dated 8 May he wrote [...] "For really the first time in seven and a half months I have a job on hand which is likely to end in gun, I, and the whole outfit being blown to hell. However if we succeed we will <b>help</b> <b>our</b> infantery no end.". [...] The next day, 9 May, he was killed in action at 4:45 in the afternoon during the Battle of Aubers Ridge at Neuve-Chapelle, France when a shell exploded {{on the roof of the}} dug-out he was sheltering in.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. [...] Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. [...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to <b>help</b> <b>our</b> guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back." [...] From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had sevenplayers taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school.|$|E
