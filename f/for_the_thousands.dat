5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in {{certain areas of the}} major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.|$|E

5|$|Following the cyclone's passage, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began {{dispatching}} relief teams, food, {{and other}} supplies to impacted areas. The Bangladesh Army and non-governmental organizations participated in both air- and water-borne relief operations, though inclement weather initially forced the suspension of several planned helicopter flights. Both the Bangladesh Navy and Indian Navy convened in the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal to search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of fishermen and islanders that went missing during the tropical cyclone's landfall. Due to the wide scope of the disaster, the Bangladeshi government appealed for international aid, particularly from Japan and Canada as those countries had played large roles in the relief efforts of past Bangladeshi disasters. The Government of the Netherlands donated US$370,000for use in the relief efforts following the storm. Lord Glenarthur, then British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, toured effected areas in Bangladesh for three days before announcing a ₤200,000grant (US$370,000) to voluntary relief agencies assisting in cyclone relief operations. Then-Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad also visited the worst impacted districts, including Khulna and Bagerhat. Following these visits, Ershad's administration established a national disaster committee composed of relief specialists to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts.|$|E

25|$|After gaining some {{knowledge}} of the language, Dyer faced the challenge of producing movable metallic types <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of Chinese characters.

At first, using wood reliefs to create the clay moulds from which type could be cast, he soon moved to steel punches and copper matrixes. Dyer's linguistic abilities, meticulous planning, and painstaking attention to detail resulted in Chinese fonts of high quality. They were later passed on to the American Presbyterian Mission Press in China and played a significant part in its development.|$|E

25|$|After President Sinibaldi Castro resignation, the Guatemalan Assembly {{named the}} second presidential {{designate}} as interim President. This person was general Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, who arrived to Guatemala City when general Barrios was {{being put to}} rest and demanded to general Barrundia —Secretary of War and main candidate to get the presidency after Sinibaldi's resignation— to be appointed president, and that he needed room and board <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of troops that he had brought along and were waiting {{on the outskirts of}} the city.

The survivors fled to British regions in Canada and the Niagara Falls and Buffalo areas. The devastation created great hardships <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of Iroquois refugees who fled the region to shelter under British military protection outside Fort Niagara that winter, and many starved or froze to death, despite strenuous attempts by the British authorities to import food and provide shelter via their limited resources.|$|E
25|$|Transportation {{around the}} Los Angeles area was {{severely}} afflicted with roadway failures and the partial collapse of several major freeway interchanges. The near total {{failure of the}} Lower Van Norman Dam resulted in the evacuation {{of tens of thousands}} of downstream residents, though an earlier decision to maintain the water at a lower level may have contributed to saving the dam from being overtopped. Schools were affected, as they had been during the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, but this time amended construction styles improved the outcome <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> of school buildings in the Los Angeles area. Another aspect of the event were the hundreds of various types of landslides that were documented in the San Gabriel mountains. As had happened following other earthquakes in California, legislation related to building codes was once again revised, with laws that specifically addressed the construction of homes or businesses near known active fault zones.|$|E
