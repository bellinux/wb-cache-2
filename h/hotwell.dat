2500|$|The main {{condenser}} {{is a large}} cross-flow tube-and-shell {{heat exchanger}} that takes wet vapor, a mixture of liquid water and steam at saturation conditions, from the turbine-generator exhaust and condenses it back into subcooled liquid water {{so it can be}} pumped back to the reactor by the condensate and feedwater pumps. [...] This condensing process is accomplished by allowing the wet vapor turbine exhaust to come into contact with thousands of tubes that have much colder water flowing through them on the other side. [...] The cooling water will typically come from a natural body of water such as a river or lake. [...] Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, located in the desert about 60 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona, is the only nuclear facility that does not use a natural body of water for cooling, instead using treated sewage from the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. [...] The cross-flow aspect of a typical main condenser means the two fluids that are exchanging heat, turbine exhaust and the cold water from a river or other water source, are flowing in perpendicular directions. [...] This is extremely effective at allowing for phase separation, that is, the heavier, condensed water falls off of the condenser tubes into the condenser <b>hotwell</b> found {{at the bottom of the}} heat exchanger and awaits its turn to be pumped. [...] The water coming from the cooling body of water is either pumped back to the water source at a warmer temperature or returns to a cooling tower where it either cools for more uses or evaporates into water vapor that rises out the top of the tower.|$|E

50|$|By 1910 Avonmouth was {{no longer}} a resort, but instead a workplace, and so Sunday service was reduced to two trains each way, taking 19 minutes each.

50|$|<b>Hotwells</b> railway station, was {{a railway}} station {{situated}} in the suburb of <b>Hotwells</b> in Bristol, England. It was the original southern terminus of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier which ran to a station and pier at Avonmouth. The station opened in 1865, originally named Clifton station, and was {{situated in the}} Avon Gorge almost underneath the Clifton Suspension Bridge, adjacent to the Clifton Rocks Railway, the <b>Hotwells</b> terminus of Bristol Tramways, the Rownham ferry and landing stages used by passenger steamers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hotwells</b> Halt {{was built}} {{alongside}} the River Avon, {{just north of}} Portnalls Number One Railway Tunnel, {{a few hundred yards}} from the main terminus at [...] The station had a single 700 ft timber platform, a run-around loop and a siding, all controlled by a signal box at the northern end of the platform. It was constructed in 1917 by the government-controlled Great Western and Midland railways as a wartime expedient, since workmen's trains were too long for the platform at the [...] terminus. Some 2,000 dockworkers each day would travel by tram to the terminus, then walk along the riverside to reach <b>Hotwells</b> Halt, where they would buy tickets for Avonmouth. There were two ticket booths, a small one just for Avonmouth tickets, and a larger one for other destinations. Return tickets were valid to <b>Hotwells</b> or , and so after the morning rush few passengers used the halt. The first two services of the day would start at <b>Hotwells</b> Halt, with one return terminating there.From September 1921, the Halt was the terminus of the BPRP line, as the <b>Hotwells</b> terminus was closed to allow construction of the A4 Portway. <b>Hotwells</b> Halt, and the line to Sneyd Park Junction, closed on 3 July 1922, with the final train running on 1 July.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{service from}} March 1865 was six trains {{per day in}} each direction, with four down (<b>Hotwells</b> to Avonmouth) and five up (Avonmouth to <b>Hotwells)</b> on Sundays, taking around 30 minutes for the 5.75 miles km trip. On weekdays the quickest was 26 minutes, and 20 minutes on Sundays as Shirehampton was closed due to {{objections}} from the local church, although this concession was reversed by May that year. The fare for a single between <b>Hotwells</b> and Avonmouth was 1s 0d, 9d and 6d for first, second and third class respectively, with returns 6d more.|$|R
50|$|A surface {{condenser}} {{is an example}} of such a heat-exchange system. It is a shell and tube heat exchanger installed at the outlet of every steam turbine in thermal power stations. Commonly, the cooling water flows through the tube side and the steam enters the shell side where the condensation occurs {{on the outside of the}} heat transfer tubes. The condensate drips down and collects at the bottom, often in a built-in pan called a <b>hotwell.</b> The shell side often operates at a vacuum or partial vacuum, produced by the difference in specific volume between the steam and condensate. Conversely, the vapor can be fed through the tubes with the coolant water or air flowing around the outside.|$|E
50|$|In a {{steam power}} plant, {{particularly}} shipboard ones, the condensate pump is normally located {{adjacent to the}} main condenser <b>hotwell</b> often directly below it. This pump sends the water to a make-up tank closer to the steam generator or boiler. If the tank is also designed to remove dissolved oxygen from the condensate, it {{is known as a}} deaereating feed tank (DFT). The output of the DFT supplies the feed booster pump which, in turn, supplies the feedwater pump which returns the feedwater to the boiler so the cycle can start over. Two pumps in succession are used to provide sufficient net positive suction head to prevent cavitation and the subsequent damage associated with it.|$|E
50|$|The {{end of the}} by-pass {{coincides with}} the {{junction}} of the Bristol Outer Ring Road, the A4174. The route goes though the suburb of Brislington, going past Arnos Court Park and Arnos Vale Cemetery. The road runs over a bridge over the New Cut and into Temple Gate where Bristol Temple Meads railway station is located. The route turns into Redcliffe Way where it loses trunk road classification at the roundabout junction with the A38. Redcliffe Way crosses the River Avon again before turning right along Welsh Back and left on Baldwin Street to the Centre. From there it turns back towards Bristol Harbour via Anchor Road past the @Bristol science museum. After another roundabout the A4 follows along <b>Hotwell</b> Road and around a one-way system that merges the A4 with the A3029.|$|E

40|$|The {{inadvertent}} {{opening of}} a pressure relief valve results in a reactor coolant inventory decrease {{and a decrease in}} reactor coolant system pressure. A pressure relief valve, as defined in ANSI B 95. 1 - 1972 (Ref. 1), is a pressure relief device which is designed to reclose and prevent further fluid flow after normal condi-tions have been restored. The effect of the pressure decrease is to decrease the neutron flux (via moderator density feedback). In a pressurized water reactor (PWR), a reactor trip occurs due to low reactor coolant system (RCS) pressure. In a boiling water reactor (BWR), the pressure relief valve discharges into the suppression pool. Normally there is no reactor trip in a BWR. The pressure regulator senses the RCS pressure decrease and partially closes the turbine control valves (TCV) to stabilize the reactor at a lower pressure. The reactor power settles out at nearly the initial power level. The coolant inventory is maintained by the feedwater control system using water from the condensate storage tank via the condenser <b>hotwell.</b> The review of these transients should consider the sequence of events, th...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a dynamic simulation model {{that has been}} developed to represent the behaviour of an A frame air cooled condenser, installed in a {{combined cycle power plant}}, in transient operating conditions. The study described by the present paper has been developed during a national research program focused on innovative methods to control and manage combined cycle power plants operating in the liberalized electricity market of today. The paper describes the main equations used to model the most important components of the air cooled condenser: the steam adduction system, the heat exchange between the condensing steam and the ambient air, the <b>hotwell,</b> the fans and the control system. The model considers the storage of thermal energy in the metal parts and so it evaluates both a steam side and an air side heat flux; then the presence of non-condensable gases inside the steam, flowing into the finned tubes, has been taken into consideration. The paper reports some simulation results and describes the simulation model validation phase. The simulation model of the air cooled condenser has been integrated with the dynamic simulator of the whole combined cycle power plant {{and it is going to}} be used by power plant management systems...|$|E
