5000|$|The example on {{the left}} (6/8) {{represents}} the correct count and <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> pattern. <b>The</b> four dotted quarter-notes across the two bottom measures are the main beats. All key patterns are built upon four main beats. The bottom measures on the other two examples (3/2 and 6/4) show cross-beats. Observing the dancer’s steps almost always reveals <b>the</b> main beats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music. Because the main beats are usually emphasized in the steps and not the music, {{it is often difficult}} for an [...] "outsider" [...] to feel the proper metric structure without seeing the dance component. Kubik states: [...] "In order to understand <b>the</b> motional structure <b>of</b> any music in Africa, one has to look at the dancers as well and see how they relate to the instrumental background" [...] (2010: 78). For cultural insiders, identifying the [...] [...] [...] ‘dance feet’ occurs instinctively and spontaneously. Those not familiar with the choreographic supplement, however, sometimes have trouble locating the main beats and expressing them in movement. Hearing African music on recordings alone without prior grounding in its dance-based rhythms may not convey the choreographic supplement. Not surprisingly, many misinterpretations of African rhythm and meter stem from a failure to observe the dance—Agawu (2003).|$|R

5000|$|Vyborgski {{district}} has preserved a certain tangible memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation's {{success in the}} Great Northern War. <b>The</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decisive Battle <b>of</b> Poltava in <b>the</b> south (in what is now Ukraine), on which Russians had their first major success in the war, fell on <b>the</b> feast day <b>of</b> Saint Sampson <b>the</b> Hospitable (June 27, 1709), and a grand cathedral in his honour {{was built on the}} road to Vyborg. Completed during <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> Anna of Russia, Sampsoniyevskiy Sobor (Saint Sampson's Cathedral) is now a museum - a branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>of</b> four museum churches with the head office at Saint Isaac's Cathedral. Saint Sampson's Cathedral features among the few church buildings preserved from <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century - from the city's first decades of existence. It replaced an earlier wooden church, whose construction started in 1709 on the Tsar's order, and which was consecrated the following year. The cathedral is interesting architecturally for its admixture of Old Russian (pre-Peter) forms with then-current elements of West European trends, forming together [...] "Anna's baroque" [...] and is also known for its unique carved wooden iconostasis from that time. For <b>the</b> bicentennial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Poltava <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> tower was decorated by memorial plaques citing Peter's selfless encouraging words to his army on the day. Opposite the building was placed Peter the Great's statue by Mark Antokolsky, taken away during the Soviet years and restored on its place in the early 21st century.|$|R
50|$|The local church, {{dedicated}} to <b>the</b> Assumption <b>of</b> Mary, was a 16th-century chapel of ease that survived the Second World War, but was demolished in the 1950s. The church belonged to <b>the</b> Parish <b>of</b> Kočevska Reka. It {{stood on a}} hill at <b>the</b> southern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, with the altar facing the southeast. It had a long rectangular nave, a chancel of equal width, and a <b>bell</b> tower against <b>the</b> southwest wall. The church was listed in a list of ecclesiastic property dating to 1526 and in {{a report by the}} apostolic visitor Paulus Bisantius in 1581. The church was likely built at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 15th century or beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, originally with a shorter nave and a wooden belfry on the roof. <b>The</b> stone <b>bell</b> tower was probably built in the mid-18th century and the nave extended to the northwest no more than a century later. At this time new windows were built into the church and a tall pointed roof added to <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> tower. <b>The</b> church had a rectangular stone door casing with a window above it. The side entrance to the church also had a door casing built from parts of an older ogival door casing. The groin-vaulted sacristy was in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> tower, and <b>the</b> church had a shingled gabled roof. The walls and vaulting were decorated with 17th-century frescoes. The art historian Marijan Zadnikar (1921-2005) wrote a complete description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> still intact church in 1947. The church was destroyed in 1953 or 1954 and only its foundations are visible today.|$|R

Laris Borić discusses two sculptural works built in to <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> niche in <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. In a lion bust a part of an architectural decoration of a window is identified; in a long-since known document, this was ordered from Niccolò di Giovanni by Deodato Venier, abbot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Benedictine Abbey. A damaged and incomplete relief of St Sebastian is a unique depiction of this saint in the Zadar quattrocento. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incomplete state and <b>the</b> awkwardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> execution, in <b>the</b> posing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body it shows a similarity with <b>the</b> free-standing sculpture <b>of</b> St Sebastian by Niccolò di Giovanni on an altar from a church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same name in Trogir, and indirectly with some Tuscan ideas about the way this saint should be depicted, which via the di Giovanni circle appeared in Dalmatia as well...|$|R
