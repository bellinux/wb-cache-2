40|$|Since almost 150 years, Luxembourg {{depends on}} {{two kinds of}} migration, {{qualified}} and non-qualified, {{in order to deal}} with the workforce needs of its economy. Compared to the other EU Member States, Luxembourg is the country with the largest proportion of foreigners; however, this foreign population is mainly composed of EU citizens. Due to its size and geographic position, Luxembourg was able to have access to a very particular form of economic migration: cross-border workers. Globalisation has also played a decisive role in the development of economic migration for the Luxembourgish labour market. The financial centre was obliged to become highly specialised in order to remain competitive in regards to other financial centres and to maintain its volume of business. In order to maintain its competitive advantage, Luxembourg needs highly skilled personnel, which the country has found, up until now, within the Greater Region. This reality is even more pronounced with regards to the labour market: the number of actives (salaried and non-salaried) on 31 March 2014 shows that Luxembourgish nationals represented only 31 %, EU citizens 65 % and third-country nationals only 4 %. Cross-border workers from Belgium, France and Germany represented 42 % of the workforce and the resident migrant population (EU citizens and third-country nationals) 28 %. Cross-border workers, which consist of skilled and highly skilled labour are substantially attracted for two reasons: 1) more competitive salaries on the Luxemburgish labour market; and 2) a geographical location which allows the commuting of cross-border workers. The attitude of the successive governments was to adapt immigration to the economic needs of the country. The government policy intends to focus on attracting highly added value activities focussed on new technologies (biomedicine and information as well as communication technologies – focusing on IT security), logistics and research. However, being one of the smallest countries in the European Union, Luxembourg has limited human resources to guarantee the growth not only of the financial sector but also of the new technologies sectors. The government introduced the <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>worker</b> residence permit in the bill on free movement of persons and immigration approved by law of 29 August 2008 almost a year before of the enactment of the Blue Card Directive to facilitate the entry of third-country national highly qualified workers. However, this reform was isolated and incomplete and took place without making a real evaluation of the workforce demand of the different sectors of the economy. Even though until now Luxembourg has been relying on the workforce from the Greater Region, for some socio-economic and political stakeholders, highly qualified workforces began to become scarce in the Greater region. In addition to the cross-border workers, the lifting of restrictions to access all the sectors of the labour market for citizens of the new Member States (EU- 8) can be considered as a mitigating factor for the need to make an evaluation of the workforce demand, because the high salaries paid in Luxembourg became a real pull factor for the highly qualified workers. As a consequence, the political authorities did not foresee a systematic plan on how to address labour shortages in specific sectors of the economy, because there has not been a significant need for doing so...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents research carried out {{as part of a}} project undertaken in fulfilment {{of the requirements}} of Loughborough University for the award of Philosophical Doctorate. The main focus of this research is to investigate and develop an appropriate level of automation to the existing manual finishing operations of small metallic components to achieve required surface quality and to remove superficial defects. In the manufacturing industries, polishing processes {{play a vital role in}} the development of high precision products, to give a desired surface finish, remove defects, break sharp edges, extend the working life cycle, and meet mechanical specification. The polishing operation is generally done at the final stage of the manufacturing process and can represent up to a third of the production time. Despite the growth automated technology in industry, polishing processes are still mainly carried out manually, due to the complexity and constraints of the process. Manual polishing involves a <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>worker</b> polishing the workpiece by hand. These processes are very labour intensive, highly skill dependent, costly, error-prone, environmentally hazardous due to abrasive dust, and - in some cases - inefficient with long process times. In addition, the quality of the finishing is dependent on the training, experience, fatigue, physical ability, and expertise of the operator. Therefore, industries are seeking alternative solutions to be implemented within their current processes. These solutions are mainly aimed at replacing the human operator to improve the health and safety of their workforce and improve their competitiveness. Some automated solutions have already been proposed to assist or replace manual polishing processes. These solutions provide limited capabilities for specific processes or components, and a lack of flexibility and dexterity. One of the reasons for their lack of success is identified as neglecting the study and implementing the manual operations. This research initially hypothesised that for an effective development, an automated polishing system should be designed based on the manual polishing operations. Therefore, a successful implementation of an automated polishing system requires a thorough understanding of the polishing process and their operational parameters. This study began by collaborating with an industrial polishing company. The research was focused on polishing complex small components, similar to the parts typically used in the aerospace industry. The high level business processes of the polishing company were capture through several visits to the site. The low level operational parameters and the understanding of the manual operations were also captured through development of a devices that was used by the expert operators. A number of sensors were embedded to the device to facilitate recording the manual operations. For instance, the device captured the force applied by the operator (avg. 10 N) and the cycle time (e. g. 1 pass every 5 sec.). The capture data was then interpreted to manual techniques and polishing approaches that were used in developing a proof-of-concept Integrated Robotic Polishing System (IRPS). The IRPS was tested successfully through several laboratory based experiments by expert operators. The experiment results proved the capability of the proposed system in polishing a variety of part profiles, without pre-existing geometrical information about the parts. One of the main contributions made by this research is to propose a novel approach for automated polishing operations. The development of an integrated robotic polishing system, based on the research findings, uses a set of smart sensors and a force-position-by-increment control algorithm, and transpose the way that skilled workers carry out polishing processes...|$|E

An analysis by sector reveals that human capital externalities are more pronounced in manufacturing than in the service sector.

Using two samples of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>workers</b> in Germany we find that an increase in the regional share of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>workers</b> by one standard deviation is associated with between-job wage growth of about three percent and an increase in the annual probability of a job change of up to four percent. Wage gains are incurred only by workers changing jobs within industries. Consistently, workers in skilled regions are about fifty percent more likely to change jobs within rather than between industries.

Evidence on regional differences in job change behavior suggests that human capital networks enable young workers to change jobs more easily and to thereby increase matching efficiency, which in turn reduces the overall number of job changes needed until an efficient match is reached. Benefits from improved matching opportunities predominantly arise from human capital networks enabling workers in skilled regions to change jobs within an industry and, thus, to capitalize on their industry-specific human capital.

40|$|The {{migration}} of skilled individuals – or brain drain – is often considered a negative phenomenon {{for the economy}} of the country left behind. Only in the recent past theorists have started to analyze spillovers of the brain drain in the left economy and defined models of long-distance cooperation amongst scientists. Complexity theory has been brought into the analysis of the brain drain and into the building of international scientific networks which are aimed at reducing its negative impact. While scholarly research is moving on, policy-makers are lagging behind; Europe needs ideas and interventions to reduce the drain and to exploit the knowledge and experience of those European scientists working overseas.

40|$|An {{adequate}} {{supply of}} <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>workers</b> {{is a central}} pre-requisite for the ability of peripheral, structurally weak regions to develop.

Taking as an example the Weser-Ems-region, which is situated in north-western Germany, the strategies used by local enterprises to attempt to motivate managerial staff to move from other regions are shown and the level of success achieved in this is described. As is shown, the regional labour market has lost significance for the upper segment in the course of structural changes in the economy, which has led to an increase in the necessity for cross-regional searches in order to fill managerial posts adequately. As enterprises in peripheral locations have poor starting conditions in the cross-regional competition for <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>workers,</b> this development demands that more and more enterprises mobilise considerable resources for the recruitment of staff. Although the findings indicate that the potential of workers willing to migrate is greater and more diverse than is often assumed, they also show that certain types of enterprise have great difficulty in overcoming independently the personnel-related disadvantages resulting from the location, and require support through the regional structural policy.

If jobseekers have trouble finding a well-qualified job, they face the choice of accepting a more poorly qualified job or a prolongation of unemployment. Albrecht and Vroman (2002) developed a theoretical model that shows that the likelihood of well <b>qualified</b> <b>workers</b> rejecting less <b>qualified</b> jobs in favour of unemployment depends both on the productivity differential (and hence the wage differential) between qualified and unqualified jobs and on the supply of <b>qualified</b> <b>workers.</b> According to this model, {{in the presence of}} a large wage differential, good unemployment benefits and a relative scarcity of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>workers,</b> well <b>qualified</b> individuals are more likely to be unemployed than poorly qualified individuals with identical formal qualifications. Failing to address the fact that a person can choose to refuse a job they would be overqualified for would result in a biased estimation of the factors that influence overeducation in such a case.|$|R
