5|$|Tianchi Basins: As {{precipitation}} was {{for important}} agriculture and food production, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao developed a precipitation gauge that was {{widely used in}} 1247 during the Southern Song dynasty to gather meteorological data. Qin Jiushao later records application of rainfall measurements in the mathematical treatise Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. The book also discusses problems using large snow gauges made from bamboo situated <b>in</b> <b>mountain</b> passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement. Tianchi Basins were installed at provincial and district capitals and bamboo snow gauges were situated <b>in</b> <b>mountain</b> passes. The rain gauges were conical or barrel-shaped with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages. These averages were important as they postulated indicators of natural disasters such as flooding, since river flooding {{has always been a}} problem in China.|$|E

More modern recreations of the game for computers have been made as well. An emulated version of the original game, based on the original source code made publicly available by Martin Graetz and running in a JavaScript PDP-1 emulator, was made available to play on the internet in 2012. The only working PDP-1s that are known to exist are kept in the Computer History Museum <b>in</b> <b>Mountain</b> View, California, where demonstrations of the machine are held, which include playing Spacewar.|$|E

After the battle the last New Zealanders, two officers and approximately 46 men, were withdrawn from the LRDG and returned to their division.|$|E
