5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the <b>growing</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E

Here he was given command of a special Kommando subordinate to II./NJG11, set up on 11 November 1944 at Erprobungsstelle Rechlin's southern Lärz airbase (2 November 1944 – 28 January 1945), and dedicated to performing nocturnal interception with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter of RAF Mosquitos attacking the Berlin area. According to some sources, Oberleutnant Welter added a Lancaster to his <b>growing</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> Mosquitos {{on the night of}} 12 December 1944, the first night victory by a jet fighter. Other sources state that his first aerial victory flying the Me 262 was claimed either on the night of 2 January 1945 or 5 January 1945. On 28 January 1945, the unit initially known as Sonderkommando Stamp, named after its founder Major Gerhard Stamp and then Sonderkommando Welter, was re-designated 10. Staffel/NJG11 and transferred to the airfield at Burg near Magdeburg (28 January 1945 – 12 April 1945). The unit was equipped with Me 262 jet fighters, and tasked with intercepting Mosquito bomber aircraft of No. 8 Group RAF in the Berlin area. The Me 262 were not fitted with radar and used the aid of ground control and the searchlight defences, partially a Wilde Sau form of night combat. Welter had claimed three aerial victories while flying the Me 262 by early February 1945.|$|E

The reality of more and more governments interfering with civic spaces, however, is a dangerous global trend. In China, the 2016 Charity Law went into effect and the National People’s Congress passed new legislation on the regulation of international NGOs. Both have already had a great impact on Chinese and European civil society organizations in China and Europe and at the same time a marginalization of certain topics.

40|$|The {{success of}} modern methods in {{analytical}} chemistry sometimes obscures {{the problem that}} the ever increasing amount of analytical data does not necessarily give more insight of practical relevance. As alternative approaches, toxicity- and bioactivity-based assays can deliver valuable information about biological effects of complex materials in humans, other species or even ecosystems. However, the observed effects often cannot be clearly assigned to specific chemical compounds. In these cases, {{the establishment of an}} unambiguous cause-effect relationship is not possible. Effect-directed analysis tries to interconnect instrumental analytical techniques with a biological/biochemical entity, which identifies or isolates substances of biological relevance. Successful application has been demonstrated in many fields, either as proof-of-principle studies or even for complex samples. This review discusses the different approaches, advantages and limitations and finally shows some practical examples. The broad emergence of effect-directed analytical concepts might lead to a true paradigm shift in analytical chemistry, away from ever <b>growing</b> <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> chemical compounds. The connection of biological effects with the identification and quantification of molecular entities leads to relevant answers to many real life questions...|$|R

25|$|The Stems {{formed in}} late 1983 when vocalist/guitarist Dom Mariani, {{formerly}} in The Go-Starts, {{was introduced to}} Richard Lane. Lane had seen Mariani in the final few gigs of The Go-Starts and had asked him for guitar lessons which developed into jams, and then writing songs. Finally, {{the decision was made}} to form The Stems. A friend, Gary Chambers, was recruited to join on drums, and bass guitarist John Shuttleworth was poached from the Pink Armadillos. In March 1984, the band had their debut gig at the Old Civic Theater in Perth, which was in support of The Saints and The Triffids. Their sound was influenced by 1960s garage acts ranging from the Electric Prunes, The Standells, and The Chocolate Watch Band to The Easybeats. A local Saturday night residency at the Wizbah venue saw throwback covers with a <b>growing</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> original songs which developed a cult following for the band. Shuttleworth decided to leave, so a final gig for the band was arranged which drew a large crowd.

25|$|These {{resources}} were of immense importance to Hitler and the German war effort. Of the three {{million tons of}} oil Germany consumed per year, 85 percent was imported, mainly from the United States, Venezuela, and Iran. When war broke out in September 1939, the British naval blockade cut Germany off from the Americas and the Middle East, leaving the country reliant on oil-rich European countries such as Romania to supply the resource. An indication of German reliance on Romania is evident from its oil consumption; in 1938, just one-third of the 7,500,000 tons consumed by Germany came from domestic stocks. Oil had always been Germany's Achilles heel, {{and by the end}} of 1941, Hitler had nearly exhausted Germany's reserves, which left him with only two significant sources of oil, the country's own synthetic production and the Romanian oilfields, with the latter supplying 75% of Germany's oil imports in 1941. Aware of his declining oil resources, and fearful of enemy air attacks on Romania (Germany's main source of crude oil), Hitler's strategy was increasingly driven by the need to protect Romania and acquire new resources, essential if he wanted to continue waging a prolonged war against a <b>growing</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> enemies. In late 1941, the Romanians warned Hitler that their stocks were exhausted and they were unable to meet German demands. For these reasons, the Soviet oilfields were extremely important to Germany's industry and armed forces as the war became global, the power of the Allies grew, and shortages started to occur in Axis resources.|$|E

25|$|By the Second World War and the Labour {{government}} of Clement Attlee, trade union membership was well established and collective agreements covered over 80 per {{cent of the}} workforce. With the British Empire in rapid dissolution, immigration from Commonwealth countries, and record levels of female workplace participation the character of Britain's workforce was changing fast. Though the common law was sometimes comparatively progressive, sometimes not, the first statutes to prohibit discrimination focused on gender and race emerged in the 1960s as the Civil Rights Act was passed in the United States. Discrimination in employment (as in consumer or public service access) was formally prohibited on grounds of race in 1965, gender in 1975, disability in 1995, sexual orientation and religion in 2003 and age in 2006. A complicated and inconsistent jamboree of Acts and statutory instruments was placed into a comprehensive code in the Equality Act 2010. Much discrimination law is now applicable throughout the European Union, to which the UK acceded in 1972. Although labour laws in the early European Treaties and case law were scant, the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty brought employment rights squarely into the EU's jurisprudence. Meanwhile, starting from the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, workers gained a <b>growing</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> minimum statutory rights, such {{as the right to}} reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and a redundancy payment. Labour governments through the 1960s and 1970s were troubled by reform of the unwieldy trade union system.

40|$|Microlayer {{samples were}} {{collected}} to assess the temporal and spatial variability of their dissolved organic materials (DOM). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was often enriched in microlayers but concentration differences between niicrolayers and bulkwaters were gener-ally small. Ranges of DOC enrichments were large in oceanic samples. Enrichments dimin-ished with increasing bulkwater DOC concentrations in coastal waters and were not influ-enced by wave states from Beaufort 0 to 4. Microlayer depletions of DOC occurred, but the removal processes responsible for them are unknown. UV-absorbing phenolic fractions of microlayer DOM were consistently enriched, with the enrichments described by a partition-ing relationship, and showed evidence of decreasing enrichment with increasing wave states. In general, over the temporal and spatial scales considered, microlayer DOM variabilities in clean surfaces were not greater than equivalent bulkwater variabilities. Studies of the organic chemistry of sur-face microlayers are evolving from an in-ventory of the materials present to con-sideration of the processes by which those materials arrive in the microlayers, their reactions while there, and their eventual fates. Two factors are important to inves-tigations of microlayer process and reac-tions: {{the first is that}} such inventories should represent both types and concen-trations of organic materials, including assessment of possible temporal and spa-tial variations; the second is the avail-ability of some natural organic material which represents significant fractions of microlayer dissolved materials and offers quantitative and predictive possibilities.
