25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant <b>inverter</b> <b>circuit.</b> After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite. A few manufacturers use positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors to disable instant starting and give some time to preheat the filaments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Common R or R-L load do {{not need}} special <b>inverter</b> <b>circuits,</b> however {{piezoelectric}} load {{can be considered as}} R-C load and its voltage does not become 0 even though the applied voltage is 0. Therefore it needs some special <b>inverter</b> with <b>circuit</b> that can discharge the capacitive energy. Especially for unidirectional square-wave voltage driving, it becomes more serious problem. In this paper, an energy recovery circuit for unidirectional square-wave voltage driving for piezoelectric load is proposed. With the circuit, the peak load current and the power supply capacity can be reduced because the energy in the load capacitor is saved to a capacitor for energy recovery and recharged from the capacitor. The appropriateness is proved from the simulation of the proposed circuit...|$|R
