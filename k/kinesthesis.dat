Sonic dimension is still undervalued considered as an accessory or as a second dimension of the space. Till now, the sonic quality doesn't have its legitimacy in the architectural and urban thinking except in specific situations where designer should solve certain problems of noise and propagation. Therefore, we should find the appropriate qualitative criteria of the architectural elements that don't only integrate the perceptive aspects but also the action. In this sense, we shall present an experimentation that has been elaborated to clarify the relationship between sound and movement or sound and action in order to design spatial architectural elements. How can we identify the sonic role during the spatial experiment and explore the different corporal and movement modalities that emerge by hearing? We postulate that the actions potentials that emerge in a sonic context must be considered as an alternative that can modulate the environment in space and time...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the role of <b>kinesthesis</b> in motor learning. It starts with a definition that <b>kinesthesis</b> is generally regarded as “a feeling or awareness” of body position and body movement. But there are four factors seemingly quite common in definitions of kinesthesis: positioning of body segments, precision of movement, balance, and spatial orientation. Any appropriate reference explaining the reception and tramsmission of kinesthetic information during movement {{has not yet been}} determined to the satisfaction of all those working in this area. Traditionally, it has been assumed that the proprioceptor in the muscles represents the source of <b>kinesthesis.</b> The possibility of improving the capability of the kinesthetic organ of sense has been a subject of considerable interest in discussions among instructors of physical education. But there is, as yet, no convincing evidence that <b>kinesthesis</b> can be improved. It is generally stated, though, that the more one practices in repeating a certain movement, the more skillful one becomes in making that movement. One can feel, however, that “feeling” and “balance”, as main elements of <b>kinesthesis,</b> can be improved through increased practice frequency and or creation of a conducive condition.

40|$|Coordination in {{biological}} systems requires a continuous updating of the perception-action cycle. How the different sources of sensory information contribute uniquely to performance is still debated. Here, we directly compared {{the role of}} vision and <b>kinesthesis</b> {{by means of a}} tracking task in which the left wrist mimicked the passive motions imposed on the right wrist with a torque motor. The passive movements were perceived visually (alien hand) or kinesthetically (own hand), or a combination thereof (own hand, feel and see). Tracking occurred according to the same (isodirectional) or opposite (mirror-image) directions. Findings revealed that visual tracking was performed most successfully in the isodirectional and kinesthetic tracking in the mirror-image mode. Tracking was most successful when both sources of sensory information were present. These results suggest that vision and proprioception obey direction-dependent constraints that are consistent with extrinsic and intrinsic reference frames within which the perception-action cycle resides. Thus, each sensory modality contributes uniquely {{as a function of the}} spatial requirements of the tracking task, rather than one being superior over the other. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Movement and, more particularly, kinesthesia as a {{modality}} and as {{a metaphor}} has become of interest {{at the intersection of}} phenomenology and cognitive science. In this paper I wish to combine three historically related strands, aisthêsis, <b>kinesthesis</b> and aesthetics, to advance an argument concerning the aesthetic value of certain somatic sensations. Firstly, by capitalizing on a recent regard for somatic or inner bodily senses, including kinesthesia, proprioception and the vestibular system by drawing lines of historical continuity from earlier philosophical investigations on bodily background experience, initially from aisthêsis, Aristotle’s concept of the sensory faculty. Secondly, concepts of the sensate body are advanced through discoveries in the nervous system and related discussions of the ‘inner’ senses such as Charles Bell’s ‘muscle sense’ (1826), and what Charles Sherrington later termed ‘proprio-ception’ (1906). Thirdly, we consider the possibility of aesthetic status for those inner senses, where recently aesthetic arguments by Montero (2006) and Cole and Montero (2007) seek to determine aesthetic criteria for proprioception, and similarly in dance theory the aesthetic status of kinesthesia has been questioned (e. g. Foster 2011). Finally we consider whether previous exposure to a ‘grammar’ of movement is a factor in determining the relative aesthetic value...|$|E
40|$|A {{kinesthetic}} {{and visual}} aftereffect in judgment of horizontality {{was found for}} 202 Ss in paired balanced trials using the method of adjustment. Adjustment times were also measured. The correlation between the 2 aftereffects was reduced but nevertheless significant after allowance {{had been made by}} partial correlation for adjustment times in the 2 tasks. This finding is contrary to that of earlier experiments in which allowance was not made for adjustment times. The cortical satiation theory of spatial aftereffects (Kohler & Wallach, 1944) has been extended by others to include a notion of differential satiability between normal and certain psychopathological conditions (Klein & Krech, 1952; Wertheimer, 1955) and between individuals with different personality characteristics (Eysenck, 1955). Spatial aftereffects following prolonged stimulation have been used, therefore, to compare cortical modifiability between these various behavioral states following prolonged stimulation. An implication of differential satiation is a positive correlation between the magnitude of spatial aftereffects in different sensory modalities. If, for example, a certain psychopathological condition is associated with restricted cortical satiability, then it would be expected that spatial aftereffects would be smaller in magnitude than for normal 5 s in both vision and <b>kinesthesis.</b> So far investigations have failed to confirm significant positive correlations between visual and kinesthetic aftereffect...|$|E

MM is a term identifying forms of exercise that use movement in conjunction with meditative attention to body sensations, including proprioception, interoception and <b>kinesthesis.</b> MM includes the traditional Chinese methods of Qigong (Chi Kung) and Taijiquan (Tai Chi), some forms of Yoga and other Asian practices, as well as Western Somatic practices; however this review focuses primarily on Qigong and Taijiquan. We clarify the differences between MM and conventional exercise, present descriptions of several of the key methodologies of MM, and suggest how research into these practices may be approached in a systematic way. We also present evidence for possible mechanisms of the effects of MM on affective states, including the roles of posture, rhythm, coherent breathing, and the involvement of specific cortical and subcortical structures. We survey research outcomes summarized in reviews published since 2007. Results suggest that MM may be at least as effective as conventional exercise or other interventions in ameliorating anxiety and depression; however, study quality is generally poor and there are many confounding factors. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions at this time. We suggest, however, that more research is warranted, and we offer specific suggestions for ensuring high-quality and productive future studies...|$|E
30|$|Accurate spatial {{representations}} of our surroundings {{are essential for}} successful orientation within the environment. Spatial representation entails information about the spatial arrangements of entities based on an egocentric or an allocentric frame of reference (FOR) [1, 2]. On the basis of allocentric or/and egocentric frame of reference, a cognitive map is constructed for any given environment entailing information on metric relationships such as distance and relative position of the landmarks (equivalent to survey knowledge acquisition) [3]. Construction of a map-like representation {{is based on an}} individual’s egocentric experience through the senses (vision, <b>kinesthesis,</b> and others) that has to be translated into an allocentric frame of reference [4]. This translation takes place at different time scales and to different degrees of accuracy but leads to the parallel existence and use of several egocentric and allocentric frames of reference [5, 6]. The individual choice of a specific spatial frame of reference can be influenced by variables such as the context of the task, experience, time, and the goal of the journey. Of particular relevance for the present study is to understand how retrieval of spatial information is influenced when the method of acquisition is the first-person perspective followed by an aerial perspective. Torok et al. [7] demonstrated a preference for an egocentric FOR when an environment was explored from a first-person perspective as compared to the preference to use an allocentric FOR when participants learnt an environment from an aerial perspective (map).|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{position}} {{sense in}} the tongue {{and the role of}} <b>kinesthesis</b> in organizing voluntary rhythmic human finger movements and the repetition of monosyllables. [...] Four experiments showed that a sense of the tongue's position inside and outside the mouth in horizontal and vertical planes exists, and is similarly accurate to that of the limbs (error: 2 °). Subjects misjudged the position of their tongue following loading of the tongue. Anesthesia of the mucosa did not reliably reduce the accuracy of lingual position sense. The sources of positional information that contribute to position {{sense in the}} tongue and limb are similar; muscle, tendon, skin and knowledge of efference. [...] Six experiments revealed that finger movements and monosyllable repetition entrained to an imposed, irrelevant kinesthetic rhythm in about 30 % of the data, although subjects were not instructed to entrain their finger movements or speech to the kinesthetic stimulus rhythms. As entrainment should not have arisen at all unless the organization of both finger movement and monosyllabic speech has the character of a system of non-linear oscillators, this is a powerful finding. [...] The entrainment commonly features a slight anticipation of antiphase of the kinesthetic stimulus using both finger movement and speech tasks. Subjects entrained their speech and finger movements to the stimulus rhythms equally often, upholding the thesis that, at a fundamental level, speech and finger movements are organized similarly. Kinesthetic information is used to organize voluntary limb and speech movements...|$|E

Dessoir (1892) meaning “the study of touch and tactile sensations, especially as a means of communication ” (Oxford English Dictionary). Nowadays the term has expanded in scientific use beyond touch, embracing the breadth of the earlier Greek meaning — having to do with contact forces generally. In this meaning haptics includes not only cutaneous senses of force, which are distributed in time and space on the skin surface, but also the aggregations of skin contact forces to form vector resultants applied to the muscles and tendons and joints, sensed by different receptors in these structures. Thus haptics has come to include <b>kinesthesis</b> (sense of limb motion), and also proprioception (awareness of self, or sense of limb position relative to the body and gravity forces). Some researchers have used the term tactual to embrace cutaneous as well as muscle, tendon and joint sensing, restricting tactile to mean skin senses only, for example see Loomis and Lederman (1986). Others employ both tactual andtactile to mean skin sensing. The lay public’s understanding of the term touch only adds to the confusion, since to many people it means only contact sensing on the skin, but to others it includes as well what they feel in and with their limbs.

40|$|I feel {{somewhat}} constrained {{in attempting}} {{to focus on the}} topic of theories of mathematical learning, for I am unable to separate matters of learning from matters of reasoning. I suppose this is for two reasons. First, in talking about learning, we immediately bump into the question “Learn what?”, and that brings us into the arena of concepts, methods, schemes, and so forth that learners always express within occasions of reasoning. Second, any cognitive theory I know of postulates that learning happens by way of action—some theories focus on habituation of overt behavior, some focus on assimilation and accommodation, others focus on compilation of propositions. These various theories ’ constructs all call for explicit attention to events that occasion learning; I tend to think of such events as necessarily entailing students ’ reasoning in the context of problems. So, in addressing the issue of mathematical learning I find it rewarding to orient the discussion toward the development of mathematical reasoning—purposeful inference, deduction, induction, and association in the areas of quantity and structure. The idea I put forward is this: Mathematical reasoning at all levels is firmly grounded in imagery. I ought to say something about what I mean by imagery and why I take interest in imagery. This will take a while. IMAGERY By “image ” I mean much more than a mental picture. Rather, I have in mind an image as being constituted by experiential fragments from <b>kinesthesis,</b> proprioception, smell, touch, taste, vision, or hearing. It seems essential also to include the possibility that images can entail fragments of past affective experiences, such as fearing, enjoying, or puzzling, and fragments of past cognitive experiences, such as judging, deciding...|$|E

A group of nine {{individuals who are}} unsuccessful using a CCTV were compared {{with a group of}} 15 individuals who have demonstrated the ability to use a CCTV independently for reading. The two neuropsychological tests used in the study are the Tactual Performance Test (TPT) and the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Both tests are easily administered to a person with visual impairment. Both tests also measure abilities which are necessary for a person to be able to successfully use a CCTV independently for reading. The Tactual Performance Test requires tactile form discrimination, problem solving, <b>kinesthesis,</b> coordination of the upper extremities, and manual dexterity. The California Verbal Learning Test measures immediate recall of verbal information as well as the amount of verbal information learned and later remembered. The unsuccessful CCTV user group was compared to the successful CCTV user group by using an independent samples t-test to compare group scores on the TPT. The successful CCTV users scored significantly lower on total time scores and significantly higher on number of correctly placed blocks. These results suggest that successful CCTV users are better able to utilize tactile memory, problem-solving skills, and to synthesize new learning than the unsuccessful CCTV users.

40|$|Aims: Contribution of the {{physical}} activity on {{the improvement of the}} quality of life of visually impaired people. Current knowledge: Physical activities and sports accessible to visually impaired people are numerous; motivations and aptitudes of individuals are also numerous. This heterogeneity has gendered classification scales as varied as the objectives: classification of the disability according to the laws, aptitudes in using the spare vision, pedagogical adaptations needed for learning, categories based on acuity or visual angle in sport in order to ensure the equal footing in games and competitions. Major difficulties in practicing a physical activity are the environment and motor perception of the most efficient movement. These elements determine the autonomy of the visually impaired persons and are based on the sensorial compensations and the mental integration of perceptions. The major supplying perceptions used in physical activity are: hearing: gives information on distance, direction, field and depth of perception ; touch: gives a perception of the objects close at hand by making a synthesis of fragmentary feelings and therefore a slowly making acquainted ; <b>kinesthesis</b> and proprioceptive memory: body segments perception in space plays in important role in motor programming. Learning of a sport movement needs an internal perception of body segments and a proprioceptive feedback. Several investigations have stressed the positive influence of sport practice in proprioceptive memory. On the other hand, research on plasticity of sensorial areas in the brain suggests a functional reorganisation in the brain of born blind subjects. The visual cortex which has been considered as "dead" in early blindness, should be used for processing the hearing, tactile and muscular information. This field of research genders investigations on pedagogical adaptations in order to use sensorial ways sometimes neglected in the psychomotor development of visually impaired children; many physical aptitudes are missing: fitness, malformations. Conclusion: Adapted physical activities and sports work towards several ends: psychomotor education, development or improvement of motor aptitudes, fitness, performance, victory over blindness. But first of all, adaptations will increase the use of sensorial supplies in order to build and create the images and ideas of the world. Sport practice has to improve the well-being, the perception of self-competence and self esteem and preserve from handicap. © 2006. SCOPUS: sh. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

A fixed, two-factor design with the second factor being repeated was analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance. Consequent to testing Null Hypothesis 1 (that there is no difference between the classification conditions), a check was made for the presence of a significant interaction between gender and classification condition (Null Hypothesis 2). Because Null Hypothesis 1 was rejected and there was no interaction present, the classification group means were tested using a post hoc multiple comparison procedure identified as Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test. Test statistics for the Tukey HSD contrasts found that significantly more VS letters were reported than DS, HS, and NS letters. Significantly more DS letters were reported than HS and NS letters. No difference in report accuracy was found between HS and NS letters. This is in sharp contrast to studies that count only responses reported in the same left-to-right order as the tachistoscopic presentation, i. e., order of report. Previous studies using an order of report method found vertically asymmetrical letters to be reported more accurately than vertically symmetrical ones. The present study disregarded order of from an order of report. It was emphasized that the subject maintain focus on the fixation dot and not attempt to scan the letter-array pattern in a left-to-right direction, as the lettersdid not have to be reported in their respective positions. A different explanation for the Harcum (1964) directionality and Bryden (1968) masking interpretations follows from an order of report method activating additional processing mechanisms such as working memory that are ordinarily not needed to process letter features.

40|$|Abstract Animals detect {{environmental}} changes through sensory neural mechanisms that {{enable them to}} differentiate the quality, intensity and temporal characteristics of stimuli. The 'doctrine of specific nervous energies' postulates that the different sensory modalities experienced by humans result of the activation of specific nervous pathways. Identification of functional classes of sensory receptors provided scientific support to the concept that somatosensory modalities (touch, pain, temperature, <b>kinesthesis)</b> are subserved by separate populations of sensory receptor neurons specialized in detecting innocuous and injurious stimuli of different quality (mechanical forces, temperature, chemical compounds). The identification of receptor proteins activated by different physicochemical stimuli, in particular ion channels of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) superfamily, has put forward the concept that specificity of peripheral sensory receptor neurons is determined by their expression of a particular "molecular sensor" that confers to each functional type its selectivity to respond with a discharge of nerve impulses to stimuli of a given quality. Nonetheless, recent experimental data suggest that the various molecular sensors proposed as specific transducer molecules for stimuli of different quality are not as neatly associated with the distinct functional types of sensory receptors as originally proposed. First, many ion channel molecules initially associated to the transduction of only one particular form of energy are also activated by stimuli of different quality, implying a limited degree of specificity in their transducing capacities. Second, molecular sensors associated with a stimulus quality and hence to a sensory receptor type and ultimately to a sensory modality may be concomitantly expressed in sensory receptor neurons functionally defined as specific for another stimulus quality. Finally, activation of voltage gated channels involved primarily in nerve impulse generation can also influence the gating of transducing channels, dramatically modifying their activation profile. Thus, we propose that the capacity exhibited by the different functional types of somatosensory receptor neurons to preferentially detect and encode specific stimuli into a discharge of nerve impulses, appears to result of a characteristic combinatorial expression of different ion channels in each neuronal type that finally determines their transduction and impulse firing properties. Transduction channels don't operate in isolation and their cellular context should also be taken into consideration to fully understand their function. Moreover, the inhomogeneous distribution of transduction and voltage-gated channels at soma, axonal branches and peripheral endings of primary sensory neurons influences the characteristics of the propagated impulse discharge that encodes the properties of the stimulus.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a number of}} psychophysical investigations into haptic space and haptic perception of shape. Haptic perception is understood to include the two subsystems of the cutaneous sense and <b>kinesthesis.</b> Chapter 2 provides an extensive quantitative study into haptic perception of curvature. I investigated bimanual curvature discrimination of cylindrically curved, hand-sized surfaces. I found that discrimination thresholds {{were in the same}} range as unimanual thresholds reported in previous studies. Moreover, the distance between the surfaces or the position of the setup with respect to the observer had no effect on thresholds. Finally, I found idiosyncratic biases: A number of observers judged two surfaces that had different radii as equally curved. Biases were of the same order of magnitude as thresholds. In Chapter 3, I investigated haptic space. Here, haptic space is understood to be (1) the set of observer’s judgments of spatial relations in physical space, and (2) a set of constraints by which these judgments are internally consistent. I asked blindfolded observers to construct straight lines {{in a number of different}} tasks. I show that the shape of the haptically straight line depends on the task used to produce it. I therefore conclude that there is no unique definition of the haptically straight line and that doubts are cast on the usefulness of the concept of haptic space. In Chapter 4, I present a new experiment into haptic length perception. I show that when observers trace curved pathways with their index finger and judge distance traversed, their distance estimates depend on the geometry of the paths: Lengths of convex, cylindrically curved pathways were overestimated and lengths of concave pathways were underestimated. In addition, I show that a kinematic mechanism must underlie this interaction: (1) the geometry of the path traced by the finger affects movement speed and consequently movement time, and (2) movement time is taken as a measure of traversed length. The study presented in Chapter 5 addresses the question of how kinematic properties of exploratory movements affect perceived shape. I identify a kinematic invariant for the case of a single finger moving across cylindrically curved strips under conditions of slip. I found that the rotation angle of the finger increased linearly with the curvature of the stimulus. In addition, I show that observers took rotation angle as their primary measure of perceived curvature: Observers rotated their finger less on a concave curvature by a constant amount, and consequently, they overestimated the radius of the concave strips compared to the convex ones. Finally, in Chapter 6, I investigated the haptic filled-space illusion for dynamic touch: Observers move their fingertip across an unfilled extent or an extent filled with intermediate stimulations. Previous researchers have reported lengths of filled extents to be overestimated, but the parameters affecting the strength of the illusion are still largely unknown. Factors investigated in this chapter include end point effects, filler density and overall average movement speed...|$|E
