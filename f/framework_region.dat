40|$|BackgroundChronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is {{associated}} with local immunoglobulin hyperproduction {{and the presence of}} IgE antibodies against Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins (SAEs). Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a severe form of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in which nearly all patients express anti-SAEs. ObjectivesWe aimed to understand antibodies reactive to SAEs and determine whether they recognize SAEs through their complementarity-determining <b>regions</b> (CDRs) or <b>framework</b> <b>regions.</b> MethodsLabeled staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) A, SED, and SEE were used to isolate single SAE-specific B cells from the nasal polyps of 3 patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Recombinant antibodies with “matched” heavy and light chains were cloned as IgG 1, and those of high affinity for specific SAEs, assayed by means of ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, were recloned as IgE and antigen-binding fragments. IgE activities were tested in basophil degranulation assays. ResultsThirty-seven SAE-specific, IgG- or IgA-expressing B cells were isolated and yielded 6 anti-SAE clones, 2 each for SEA, SED, and SEE. Competition binding assays revealed that the anti-SEE antibodies recognize nonoverlapping epitopes in SEE. Unexpectedly, each anti-SEE mediated SEE-induced basophil degranulation, and IgG 1 or antigen-binding fragments of each anti-SEE enhanced degranulation by the other anti-SEE. ConclusionsSEEs can activate basophils by simultaneously binding as antigens in the conventional manner to CDRs and as superantigens to <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> of anti-SEE IgE in anti-SEE IgE-FcεRI complexes.

40|$|Human anthrax {{infection}} cannot {{always be}} treated successfully by antibiotics, as highlighted by recent bioterrorist attacks; thus, adjunct therapies are clearly {{needed for the}} future. There is a particular need to further develop adjunct therapies that can neutralize secreted toxins, such as antibodies directed towards the 83 -kDa protective antigen (PA 83). In the absence of human donors, we immunized a macaque (Macaca fascicularis) with PA 83 to obtain such antibodies suitable as an adjunct therapy for human anthrax infection. By using bone marrow as a template, we PCR amplified specific Fab-encoding genes and cloned them as an immune library (107 clones). We isolated a high-affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant [KD], 3. 4 nM), highly neutralizing (50 % inhibitory concentration, 5. 6 ± 0. 13 nM) Fab (designated 35 PA 83) from this library by panning. Its epitope was localized by Pepscan analysis between residues 686 and 694 of PA 83 and {{is part of the}} region which directly interacts with the cell receptor. 35 PA 83 may thus neutralize the anthrax toxin by competing directly for its receptor. The genes encoding 35 PA 83 were similar to those of a human immunoglobulin germ line and were assigned to subgroups of human V, (D), or J genes by IMGT/V-QUEST analysis. The 35 PA 83 <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> were 92 % identical to a representative allele of each subgroup.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focusses on the sequence and structural analysis of antibodies and has fallen into three main areas. First I developed a method to assess how typical an antibody sequence is of the expressed human antibody repertoire. My hypothesis was that the more " an antibody sequence is (in other words how typical it is of the expressed human repertoire), the less likely it is to elicit an immune response when used in vivo in humans. In practice, I found that, while the most and least-human sequences generated the lowest and highest anti-antibody reponses in the small available dataset, there was little correlation in between these extremes. Second, I examined {{the distribution of the}} packing angles between VH and VL domains of antibodies and whether residues in the interface in uence the packing angle angle. This is an important factor which has essentially been ignored in modelling antibody structures since the packing angle can have a signicant eect on the topography of the combining site. Finding out which interface residues have the greatest in uence is also important in protocols for `humanizing' mouse antibodies to make them more suitable for use in therapy in humans. Third, I developed a method to apply standard Kabat or Chothia numbering schemes to an antibody sequence automatically. In brief, the method uses proles to identify the ends of the <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> and then lls in the numbers for each section. Benchmarking the performance of this algorithm against annotations in the Kabat database highlighted several errors in the manual annotations in the Kabat database. Based on structural analysis of insertions and deletions in the <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> of antibodies, I have extended the Chothia numbering scheme to identify the structurally correct positions of insertions and deletions in the <b>framework</b> <b>regions.</b> ...|$|R

In a replacement net analysis, in which each of the amino acids was replaced in turn with the 19 other residues, {{it was determined that}} mouse HMFG 1 and HuHMFG 1 reacted with this series of synthetic peptides in an equivalent manner, indicating retention of identical fine specificity in the HuHMFG 1 antibody. In contrast to other published reports, this was achieved without involvement of any framework residues in the binding site transfer.

40|$|The murine {{single-chain}} {{variable fragment}} F 8 (scFv(F 8)) is endowed with high intrinsic thermodynamic stability {{and can be}} functionally expressed in the reducing environment of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasm. The stability and intracellular functionality of this molecule can be ascribed mostly to its <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> and are essentially independent of the specific sequence {{and structure of the}} supported antigen-binding site. Therefore, the scFv(F 8) represents a suitable scaffold to construct stable scFv chimeric molecules against different antigens by in vitro evolution or antigen-binding site grafting. Thanks to the favourable pharmacokinetic properties associated to a high thermodynamic stability of antibody fragments, such scFv(F 8) variants may be exploited {{for a wide range of}} biomedical applications, from in vivo diagnosis to therapy, as well as to interfere with the function of intracellular proteins and pathogens, and for functional genomics studies. However, the potential immunogenicity of the murine <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> represents a limitation for their exploitation in therapeutic applications. To overcome this limitation, we humanized a derivative of the scFv(FS), the anti-lysozyme scFv(11 E), which is endowed with even higher thermodynamic stability than the parent antibody. The humanization was carried out by substituting the framework residues differing from closely related V-H and V-L domains of human origin with their human counterparts. Site-directed mutagenesis generated the fully humanized product and four intermediate scFvs, which were analyzed for protein expression and antigen binding. We found that the substitution Tyr 90 -> Phe in the V-H domain dramatically reduced the bacterial expression of all mutants. The back-mutation of Phe H 90 to Tyr led to the final humanized variant named scFv(H 5) H 90 Tyr. This molecule comprises humanized V-H and V-L <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> and is endowed with HEL-binding affinity, stability in human serum and functionality under reducing conditions comparable to the murine cognate antibody. Consequently, the humanized scFv(H 5) H 90 Tyr represents a suitable scaffold onto which new specificities towards antigens of therapeutic interest can be engineered for biomedical applications.

Other than in case of idiotype-vaccines, which must be designed as individual-specific vaccines for every patient, these epitopes {{could be used as}} the immune receptor family-specific vaccine antigens. The receptor family specificity makes such vaccines very attractive because they can be used for several individuals. They could be synthesized in advance and combined according to the family type of immune receptors of the lymphoma cells and the immunogenetics of patients. The approach of immune family-specific vaccines should have acceptable safety profiles. The identification of epitope has been achieved by use of bioinformatics plus experimental verification. This procedure was executed with this work as an example and can be extended successively for a wider immune genetics. The PSSM can be extended on new HLA allomorphs. The PSSM, designed initially for five HLA produced in parts better results than the widely used SYFPEITHI algorithm. So the principle of the used PSSM is a good basis for identifications of further epitopes. The epitopes were predicted for the <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> of the variable domains of the immune receptors and then tested with peripheral white blood cells in healthy subjects and patients with CL. The previous theoretical assessments that the conserved <b>framework</b> <b>regions</b> bear more common T cells epitopes as the hydrophilic sequence of the hypervariable regions have been confirmed. This work also reveals the limits of bioinformatics for both epitope prediction and proof of the natural processing. The results stree the importance of the immune competence of the patients for successful immunotherapy. The immune responses were measured here by ELISpot assays for IFN-γ, which, according to literature, is globally reduced in patients with CL.

The present report establishes the structural basis for the interaction of SPA and VH 3 Ig. We have studied a panel of 27 human monoclonal IgM that were derived from fetal B lymphocytes. As such, these IgM were expected to be encoded by unmutated germline genes. Binding to SPA in ELISA occurred with 15 of 15 VH 3 IgM, but none of 12 IgM from the VH 1, VH 4, VH 5, or VH 6 families.

Synagis is composed of two heavy chains and two light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148, 000 Daltons. Synagis is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free liquid solution at 100 mg/mL to be administered by intramuscular injection (IM). Thimerosal or other mercury containing salts are not used in the production of Synagis. The solution has a pH of 6. 0 and should appear clear or slightly opalescent. Each 100 mg single-dose vial of Synagis liquid solution contains 100 mg of Synagis, 3. 9 mg of histidine, 0. 1 mg of glycine, and 0. 5 mg of chloride in a volume of 1 mL. Each 50 mg single-dose vial of Synagis liquid solution contains 50 mg of Synagis, 1. 9 mg of histidine, 0. 06 mg of glycine, and 0. 2 mg of chloride in a volume of 0. 5 mL...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} immunoglobulin molecules comprising light chain (VL) chimeric variable domains, heavy chain (VH) chimeric variable domains, e. g., scFv antibodies that are expressed {{at high levels}} within a host cell, preferably within particular cellular compartments such as, e. g., cytosol or apoplast. The VL, VH and scFv antibody molecules comprise framework scaffolds of particularly preferred <b>framework</b> <b>regions.</b> This invention also relates to nucleic acid molecules encoding the immunoglobulin molecules of this invention, vectors expressing the immunoglobulin molecules, hosts transformed with the nucleic acid molecules and vectors, and methods of using the immunoglobulin molecules. Also described are immunoglobulin libraries as well as host cells, including transgenic plants, expressing the VL, VH or scFv antibody molecules of this invention. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|We have {{determined}} the entire nucleotide sequence {{of an active}} immunoglobulin V kappa gene of the human subgroup II. Comparison of the main coding sequence of this gene to another member of this subgroup reveals germline sequence differences that occur not only in complementarity determining regions but also in <b>framework</b> <b>regions.</b> We find {{that at least two}} regions commonly associated with active immunoglobulin genes [...] the TATAA box and the decanucleotide TGATT-TCAT [...] are represented in this gene. The gene was expressed by permanent and transient DNA-mediated transfection in various cell lines. We {{have determined}} the precise site of transcriptional initiation using S 1 analysis of gene transcripts and show that this site is the same in the transfected cell lines and in the cell line from which the gene was isolated...|$|R
