40|$|Abstract. Using {{patterned}} conductive and insulating collection devices, fibrous patterns from polyvinyl pyrrolidone were fabricated by electrospinning. Considering {{that the}} electrospun fibers tend to deposit along {{the direction of}} electric field line, when conductive patterned template is used as collector during electrospinning, the as-spun fibers tend to assemble onto the conductive grids, whereas the dropping fibers prefer to avoid insulation grid by concentrating toward {{the surface of the}} Al foil when an <b>insulating</b> <b>grid</b> based on Al foil is used as collector...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{original}} design for large area gaseous detectors {{based on the}} MICROMEGAS technology. This technology incorporates an <b>insulating</b> <b>grid,</b> sandwiched between the micro-mesh and the anode-pad plane, which provides an uniform 200 μm amplification gap. The uniformity of the amplification gap thickness has been verified under several experimental conditions. The gain performances of the detector are presented and compared to the values obtained with detectors using cylindrical micro spacers. The new design presents several technical and financial advantages. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, Letter to NIM Edito...|$|E

This newly developed solar cell design patent pending [1] consists of an electrically <b>insulated</b> contact <b>grid</b> buried within a rear side a Si H emitter layer and needs no structuring processes of the solar cell absorber or emitter.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the BiodiversityWorld project, concentrating {{particularly}} upon the architecture that we are adopting {{in order to achieve}} our aims. BiodiversityWorld is an e-Science project, in which we are seeking to make heterogeneous data sources and analytic tools of relevance to biodiversity available in a GRID setting. We are developing a problem-solving environment that will enable scientists to use these resources in complex scenarios to solve problems in biodiversity. Our architecture is designed to insulate the core BiodiversityWorld system from heterogeneity of resource implementation language, etc., by wrapping the resources to a defined standard, while retaining the flexibility to discover and use the various operations and data types supported by each resource. At the same time, these wrappers are <b>insulated</b> from the <b>GRID</b> in order to support migration to future GRID technology. In this {{paper we discuss}} the design of the BiodiversityWorld system, including its GRID interface, the use of metadata and ontologies, and the use of workflows within the system...|$|R
40|$|The {{injection}} duration {{has been}} extended beyond 100 s with a high-power hydrogen negative-ion source in a negative-ion-based neutral beam injector of the Large Helical Device superconducting fusion machine. The ion source is a cesium-seeded source with a thermally <b>insulated</b> plasma <b>grid</b> (PG), and optimized for a short-pulse operation of 2 ? 3 s. The negative-ion production efficiency {{is strongly dependent on}} the PG temperature, and in the long-pulse operation it exceeds an appropriate temperature range of 200 ? 300 °C, at which the optimum cesium coverage is formed on the PG surface. By making the PG temperature rise slower with a reduced arc power, the injection duration was extended to 110 s with an injection power of 110 kW. To extend the injection duration further with a higher injection power, stainless-steel cooling tubes have been mechanically attached to the PG for suppression of the PG temperature rise in the long-pulse operation. As a result, a long-pulse injection with an injection power of 200 kW was extended to 128 s until it was manually stopped due to the plasma collapse. However, the beam duration could be limited to around 3 min because the PG temperature rise was not saturated due to a low thermal conductivity with the thickness of the stainless-steel tube determined so that the short-pulse operation is also possible. On the other hand, the longitudinal beam distribution in a grid area of 25 × 125 cm^ 2 is observed to be more uniform than that with the uncooled PG. The temperature distribution of the individual grid parts becomes more uniform with the cooled PG, which should contribute to the improvement of the beam uniformity...|$|R
