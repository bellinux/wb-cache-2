The occupation of karst habitats by limestone langurs has been attributed to the refuge these rocky outcrops provide in a dramatically anthropogenically-altered landscape. Conversely, several ecological explanations have been proposed to account for their distribution, though the ecology of wild <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> had yet to be studied. In this dissertation, I quantified the foraging ecology of <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> living on Dong Quyen Mountain in Van Long Nature Reserve, Vietnam to address if these langurs show special adaptations to limestone karst or if they are exploiting a refuge habitat into which they have been pushed. I quantified their foraging ecology by systematically investigating their diet and feeding ecology, the chemisty of their eaten leaves, and the locomotions and substrates they utilized. From August 2007 through July 2008, I used instantaneous focal-animal sampling during all-day follows of <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> on Dong Quyen Mountain. I collected data on activity budget, diet, and positional behavior. I also collected samples of soils and eaten and uneaten leaves which were tested for phytochemical content. With nearly 79 % leaves in the diet, 60 % of which were young leaves, <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> are among the most folivorous of studied colobines, and- along with the closely related T. leucocephalus of southern China- the most folivorous of the Asian langurs. None of the plants that were important in the <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langur</b> diet were endemic limestone plants, and therefore feeding dependence alone cannot explain the current distribution of limestone langurs on karst habitat. Langurs ate leaves with high protein:fiber ratios, and despite a high percentage of carbon in the soil, young leaves were available throughout the year and plant defenses did not seem to have a large impact on eaten leaves. <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> spent nearly 80 % of their time on rocks. Quadrupedalism was their dominant locomotor style, more than double that of climbing. Terrestrialism, however, does not adequately describe the dangerous locomotion of these langurs; they are cliff-climbers. <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> leapt only 6 % of the time, much less than other African and Asian colobines, but their morphology (intermembral index) does not suggest terrestrialism or an evolutionary adaptation for limestone karst. <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> appear to be a flexible taxon occupying a refuge habitat into which they have pushed. However, this restricted limestone habitat does not appear limiting in resources. The population at Van Long Nature Reserve is increasing which means that- if protected- this local population can rebound. Persistent hunting for traditional medicine and the more recent emergence of quarrying limestone for cement, however, threatens their survival. Dissertatio...|$|R
50|$|The primate center houses {{specimens}} of langurs, loris, and gibbon species, include the critically endangered <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langur,</b> golden-headed langur, and black crested gibbon. The primate center {{was established in}} 1993 {{with the help of}} the Frankfurt Zoological Society and has grown to 180 animals in 50 cages, 4 houses, and two semi-wild enclosures.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langur,</b> or <b>Delacour's</b> lutung, (Trachypithecus delacouri) is a {{critically}} endangered species of lutung endemic to northern Vietnam. [...] It {{is considered to}} be one of the world's most endangered primate species. It is named for French-American ornithologist Jean Théodore Delacour.|$|R
50|$|<b>Delacour's</b> <b>langur</b> is {{somewhat}} larger than its two closest relatives, François' langur and the Laotian langur, {{but in other}} respects has a similar appearance. Adults measure from 57 to 62 cm in head-body length, with a tail 82 to 88 mm long. Males weigh between 7.5 and 10.5 kg, while the females are slightly smaller, weighing between 6.2 and 9.2 kg. Their fur is predominantly black, with white markings on the face and distinctive creamy-white fur over the rump and the outer thighs, while females also have a patch of pale fur in the pubic area. Like other closely related lutungs, <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langur</b> has a crest of long, upright, hair over the forehead and crown; this is, however, somewhat taller and narrower than in other species.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{living in}} forested habitats, <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> are {{primarily}} terrestrial, only occasionally venturing into the trees. They swing by their hands when travelling through trees, {{and use their}} tails for balance when scrambling over steep rocky terrain, which may allow them to move more rapidly than other related lutungs.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> has declined rapidly in recent years. As of 2006, only 19 populations were known, following a dramatic {{decline in the}} total {{population of}} approximately 20% between 1999 and 2004. Since that time, two of the populations have been extirpated, and only that in the Van Long Nature Reserve may still be large enough to remain viable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Delacour's</b> <b>langur</b> is {{endemic to}} Vietnam, {{where it is}} found only in an area around 6000 km2 in the provinces of Ninh Bình, Hà Nam, Hòa Bình, Thanh Hóa, and Hà Tây {{in the north of}} the country. The largest {{surviving}} population is believed to be in Van Long Nature Reserve in Ninh Bình, where the monkey inhabits open forest up to elevations of 328 m, in terrain dominated by limestone karst.|$|R
50|$|<b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> are diurnal, often {{spending}} the day sleeping in limestone caves, although they sleep on bare rocky surfaces if no caves are available. They are folivorous, with about 78% {{of the diet}} reportedly consisting of foliage, although they also eat fruit, seeds, and flowers. The monkeys {{have been reported to}} eat leaves {{from a wide range of}} different plant species, indicating that their apparent dependence on limestone habitats is not related to their diet.|$|R
5000|$|There are 21 {{critically}} endangered primates, 7 {{of which}} have remained on the IUCN's [...] "The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates" [...] list since the year 2000: the silky sifaka, <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langur,</b> the white-headed langur, the gray-shanked douc, the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey, the Cross River gorilla and the Sumatran orangutan. Miss Waldron's red colobus was recently declared extinct when {{no trace of the}} subspecies could be found from 1993 to 1999. A few hunters have found and killed individuals since then, but the subspecies' prospects remain bleak.|$|R
500|$|The 25species on the 2012–2014 {{list are}} {{distributed}} between 16countries. [...] The countries {{with the most}} species on the list are Madagascar (six species), Vietnam (five species), and Indonesia (three species). The list is broken into four distinct regions: the island of Madagascar, the continent of Africa, the continent of Asia including the islands of Indonesia, and the Neotropics (Central and South America). [...] Five species have been on all seven published lists: the silky sifaka (Propithecus candidus), <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langur</b> (Trachypithecus delacouri), golden-headed langur (Trachypithecus poliocephalus poliocephalus), grey-shanked douc (Pygathrix cinerea), and the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus avunculus).|$|R
50|$|In {{previous}} decades, <b>Delacour's</b> <b>langurs</b> {{were reported}} to live in troops of up to 30 individuals, often including a mix of males and females, although single-male groups are more common, and some small all-male groups have also been reported. In more recent years, the typical group size seems to be much smaller, with only about four to 16 members each. Males defend the troop's territory from outsiders, often standing watch on rocky outcrops. When potential rivals are spotted, the males in a troop initially try to intimidate them with loud hoots and visual displays, resorting to chasing and fighting if this fails. Within the group, social bonds are maintained by grooming and play.|$|R
