(In the more modern terminology of the minimal model program, a smooth projective surface X would be called minimal if its canonical line bundle KX is nef. A smooth projective surface has a minimal model in that stronger sense if and only if its Kodaira dimension is nonnegative.) ...|$|E
2500|$|For the {{definition}} of quantity of energy transferred as heat, it is customarily envisaged that an arbitrary state of interest [...] is reached from state [...] by a process with two components, one adiabatic and the other not adiabatic. For convenience one may say that the adiabatic component was the sum of work done by the body through volume change through movement of the walls while the non-adiabatic wall was temporarily rendered adiabatic, and of isochoric adiabatic work. Then the non-adiabatic component {{is a process of}} energy transfer through the wall that passes only heat, newly made accessible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> transfer, from the surroundings to the body. The change in internal energy to reach the state [...] from the state [...] is the difference of the two amounts of energy transferred.|$|E
