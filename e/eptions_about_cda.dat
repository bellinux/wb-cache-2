40|$|International audienceWe {{propose to}} combine two methodologies: {{experimental}} economics and agent-based simulation {{for the study}} of rational behavior of individuals in a market environment. The related market represents a competitive continuous double auction (CDA). Much of what we know <b>about</b> <b>CDA</b> is based on experimental research. We still do not understand sufficiently the choice processes observed during behavior experiments. Therefore, in this paper, we will build an artificial society, which allows us to analyze how perceptions of the market price impact on individual strategies and collective behavior. More precisely, using an analytical science approach, we studied learning (for example, number of transactions memorized) and use of global vs. local information. The result of our work mainly shows that the memory of past transactions is of little importance, and that the revision of prices models the memory of agents adequately to demonstrate how rapidly price converges on an equilibrium state of the market...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) {{is used to}} {{identify}} features of a Stanbic Bank advertisement in Botswana in order to uncover its representation of Africanness and gender, particularly, black African femininity. The main interest is to illustrate how CDA as an analytical tool {{can be used to}} unpack underlying assumptions in texts. In a society that is image saturated, the ability to read the word [image] critically becomes crucial for survival in contexts marked by unequal power relations and prejudice. A critical approach to reading and writing will draw attention to the relationship between language, ideology and power. CDA examines, not only forms of oppression, but is also interested in forms of empowerment through discourse. Drawing on Norman Fairclough’s (1989, 1995) three-dimensional conception of discourse, the paper problematizes the advertisement’s construction of the African woman, including its representation of Pan Africanism. Although there are questions <b>about</b> <b>CDA’s</b> theoretical validity and soundness by theorists such as Widdowson, 2004, CDA still remains useful for promoting critical awareness of discourse and public uses of language and in particular, how public discourse positions readers or viewers. ...|$|R

It is also the first empirical study, to our knowledge, to investigate associations between savings outcomes and incentives in an asset-building program for children. This study enhances knowledge <b>about</b> saving in <b>CDAs,</b> incentives in public policy in general, and incentives in savings policy in particular. Results can inform CDA policy design...|$|R
40|$|Modern aircrafts {{have the}} {{capability}} to perform fuel-efficient and noise-reduced continuous descent approaches (CDA). A major obstacle to use these capabilities for approaching an airport is the synchronization of CDA-traffic and conventional non CDA-traffic. By developing assistance systems to direct the attention towards relevant events, air traffic controllers are supported when merging both aircraft streams. This leads to a complexity reduction of the information gathering process. Visual, auditory and tactile assistance systems were implemented in a microworld simulation. 55 participants had to merge CDA and non CDA-traffic, shortly before landing. The participants controlled the non CDA-traffic via radio, while monitoring the CDA traffic at the same time. Whenever a CDA airplane passed a critical waypoint, a visual, auditory, or tactile feedback was given to the participant to maintain a sufficient level of situation awareness. Visual feedback was presented via aircraft label blinking; auditory feedback was given via radio and tactile feedback was given via a vibrotactile feedback device attached to the wrist. The results indeed indicate that additional feedback <b>about</b> the <b>CDA</b> traffic has a positive effect on the visual attention and the situation awareness...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{challenges}} that appear if Continuous Descent Approaches (CDA) with landing times negotiated in an air ground protocol have to be integrated into approaching traffic on heavily loaded airports using standard arrival profiles like Low Drag Low Power. The controller {{is not able to}} guide those flights and standard approaches simultaneously in an efficient and safe way because of unpredictable flight levels and speeds of CDAs over the timely progress of the landing procedure. Therefore controllers will need assistance by a ground system that is calculating suitable landing sequences and landing times. The support system will {{have to take into account}} data <b>about</b> the <b>CDA</b> flights it has got by the negotiation process and the results of its own trajectory prediction engine. This engine calculates possible profiles for the standard approaches. These profiles can be translated to timely precise controller commands to be displayed on a controller human-machine interface (HMI). As result of intensive human-in-the-loop investigations during the DLR project Future Air Ground Integration (FAGI) further controller aids were developed to support controllers to implement time-based arrival management by having the possibility to use their distance based procedures...|$|R

This {{research}} {{is about the}} analysis of Critical Discourse Analysis of the slogan used by the president candidates of Brawijaya University on general Election (PEMIRA) in 2011 by using Fairclough model of CDA. The researcher investigated two research problems, namely: (1). What are the lexical and structural meaning of construction in the slogans of president candidates in PEMIRA UB 2011 and (2). What are the social impacts of the slogans meaning of president candidates in PEMIRA UB 2011 toward the students at Universitas Brawijaya reflected on the image of perfect leader. This research used qualitative approach. The primary data were the slogans from two president candidates in General Election (PEMIRA) UB 2011. The supporting data were derived from articles on PEMIRA UB 2011. In addition, the researcher also used interviews with both of president candidates of Universitas Brawijaya in PEMIRA UB 2011 in order to complete this study. The {{results of this study}} showed that there were 7 slogans used in the general election (PEMIRA) UB 2011. Based on the text analysis on the slogans, the use of words such as commitment, aspirations have big impact towards the public opinion. It could influence public 2 ̆ 7 s view to the figure of president candidates that it does not come out as a "stereotypical" an ordinary general election. The role of social media is important as slogans can also serve as “boomerang” that can decrease the belief of the voters. This condition obviously influences the psychological felling of the voters that they can easily believe those issues and automaticlly choose other candidate. The social effect on the use of slogan president candidates for the winner can be seen in everyday life. The winner often gets many privileges in the society and their group. Furthermore, the slogan has a role that less than supporting role and organization background of the president candidates in terms of influencing the reader or voters. Finally, the use of the slogan of president candidates had influenced the supporters and student at the time. It can be seen when Fandi becomes the winner in general election (PEMIRA) UB 2011. The researcher suggests for the future researcher to enrich the field of this study by possibly exploring other numerous object with different theory for CDA. Moreover, it can be <b>about</b> <b>CDA</b> containing a critical thinking which in fact is very helpful for students to explore more about a subject given whether they will accept it or not...|$|R

This study uses qualitative approach. The writer conducted the study toward the construction meaning {{and the effect of}} the slogan Brain, Beauty, and Behavior according to the image of the winner of Puteri Indonesia beauty pageant produced in the articles. In analyzing the data found from the article, the researcher approached to several processes. Firstly, finding and selecting the articles related to Puteri Indonesia. Secondly, explaining textual analysis, discourse analysis, and also the social practice based on Norman Fairlough 2 ̆ 7 s theory (2001) of Critical Discourse Analysis which then brings into the direct analysis to the social effect on the use of slogan Brain, Beauty, and Behavior” reflected on the image of Puteri Indonesia. This present study reveals that based on the textual analysis on the slogan, {{the use of the word}} Brain as the starting point has big impact towards the public opinion. It could influence public 2 ̆ 7 s view to this pageant that it does not come out as a "stereotypical" pageant. The social effect on the using of slogan 3 Bs for the winner can be seen in everyday life. The winner often gets many privileges in the society. The most recent phenomenon can be seen in Angelina Sondakh 2 ̆ 7 s case. This former winner of Puteri Indonesia was accused in a graft case revolving around the high-profile SEA Games 2 ̆ 7 bribery case. However, a day before her court day she read a pledoi which contains all of her prestigious achievements. One of them is her title as the former winner of Puteri Indonesia that brought her to what she is now. In this case, her threat of punishment that used to be 20 years or life time sentence in prison becomes only 4. 5 years in prison with 250 million of fine causing public to criticize the judge 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Finally, writer suggests for the future researcher to enrich the field of this study, by possibly exploring other numerous object with different theory for CDA. Moreover, it can be <b>about</b> <b>CDA</b> containing a critical thinking which in fact is very helpful for students to explore more about a subject given whether they will accept it or not.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the life of}} James Stansfeld, (1820 - 1898), and in particular his contribution to the political reform of the Contagious Diseases Acts (CDAs) in England and in India. Stansfeld was a Liberal MP from a Unitarian (non-conformist) background who represented his native borough of Halifax during the Gladstone era. From the early 1870 s onwards, eschewing high cabinet office, Stansfeld was {{a major force in}} the Commons parliamentary debates <b>about</b> the <b>CDAs</b> and their Indian equivalent. His political strategies included the building up and sustaining of popular support for repeal whilst simultaneously supporting repeal in the political arena. The thesis maps Stansfeld’s complex and radical arguments about women’s rights, particularly those of prostitutes, and his advocacy of, and practical support for, repeal of the CDAs both in England and India. It presents new archival research on Stansfeld and other materials relating to the Contagious Diseases Acts and their rescindment. The archival materials are read alongside nineteenth-century published sources including memoirs, political writings and newspaper articles, and analysed in dialogue with scholarship on nineteenth-century sexual debates in England and India. By focusing on James Stansfeld’s advocacy of the repeal effort in England, and his role in the subsequent shift of the debate to British India, then, the thesis adds new research on the complex issues at stake in debates about the repeal of the CDAs and Indian CDAs, and it considers what these debates tell us about the role of female sexuality in nineteenth-century political debates in England and the Indian empire...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 and 2009 {{we tested}} 11 {{machines}} from {{three categories of}} herbicide application technology: weed wipers, controlled droplet applicators (CDA) and sensor sprayers. Machines were tested on amount of glyphosate use and efficacy of weed control on three types of pavements typical for weed control in urban area. Test plots were over 100 m 2; sufficiently large to do representative measurements. Weed wipers used {{the least amount of}} herbicide, less than 0. 05 L product ha- 1. Sensor sprayers applied between 0. 1 and 0. 4 L product ha- 1 depending on weed infestation level, and configuration of the machine. Double the amount of nozzles and sensors on the spray boom reduced herbicide use by <b>about</b> 50 %. <b>CDA</b> machines were set to 0. 9 to 1 L product ha- 1 with good efficacy. CDA combined with a sensor gave 40 % reduction in herbicide use in one trial. CDA machines had smaller ED 90 (effective dose 90 % control) values then the sensor sprayers. This confirms that glyphosate application in small and uniform droplets with less water are more effective. All machines tested complied with the dose cap of the SWEEP system, which is important for achieving sustainable weed control on pavements...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the number of worker co-operatives in the UK has grown rapidly. In the early 1970 s there were {{approximately}} 20 worker co-operatives, mainly consisting of long established cooperatives formed at the tum of the century, but by 1980 this number had increased to about 300, again to nearly 500 by 1982 and to 900 by 1984, (CDA, 1980, 1982, 1984 b). Initially this growth was stimulated by the promotional efforts of the Industrial Common Ownership Movement (ICOM) which produced model rules for worker co-operatives, and by {{the passing of the}} Industrial Common Ownership Act in 1976 which provided £ 250, 000 to promote co-operatives and establish a revolving loan fund. Further impetus was given when in 1978 the Government set up the national Cooperative Development Agency (CDA) to act as a national body for the co-operative movement. This was followed by a rapid growth in local Co-operative Development Agencies (CDAs) usually with the sole purpose of promoting and assisting worker co-operatives. The first local CDA was set up in Scotland in 1977, since when the number has increased to <b>about</b> 100 (<b>CDA,</b> 1984 a) of which approximately half employ full time development officers. Local Co-operative Development Agencies are of considerable interest to those concerned with the theory and practice of worker co-operation. It has been argued in the literature on worker co-operatives that a healthy worker co-operative sector is unlikely to develop without the establishment of secondary support organisations (Vanek 1975, Campbell et al. 1977, Horvat 1980). In the UK context local CDAs represent the major form of support and assistance available to the worker co-operative sector. However, to date there has been very little done to try to assess the theoretical or practical significance of these developments. This paper aims to contribute to that task. The paper presents some preliminary findings from research being undertaken by the Co-operatives Research Unit at the Open University which is examining the role of local CDAs in creating and sustaining worker co-operatives. It draws primarily upon the results of a pilot study of five local CDAs, (reported more fully in Comforth and Stott, 1984). Information on each CDA was gathered from written reports produced by the agencies, and from an in depth structured interview carried out with an officer of each agency. Further information about the wider population of CDAs was gathered through discussion and talks with other CDA workers, from the Newsletter of the Network of local CDAs, and from other secondary sources. The paper has three main aims: 1. To provide some basic descriptive information on the organisation and performance of CDAs that will be of use to both practitioners and academics. 2. To raise questions and issues that we feel require further consideration by policy workers and practitioners. 3. To relate the findings to existing literature on co-operative development and suggest future avenues for research...|$|R
