25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, purchased World Saga {{with the intention}} of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized drillships that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and dynamic positioning systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use artificial islands, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While caisson-retained islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea, relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new <b>drilling</b> <b>location.</b> The new drilling unit was intended to overcome these limitations.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} two seasons, it was found out that {{constructing}} a perfectly flat underwater gravel berm at every <b>drilling</b> <b>location</b> was very time-consuming. In August 1986, before being deployed in the American part of the Beaufort Sea, SSDC was mated with a submersible barge named MAT built by Hitachi Zosen. This removed the need to prepare the seafloor for drilling operations and made the unit capable of operating year-round in water depths between [...] and {{in a wide variety}} of soil conditions. Upon deployment, high density polyurethane foam was injected beneath the artificial steel berm to ensure an even contact with the seafloor. SSDC and MAT have not been separated since.|$|E

50|$|Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) is {{directional}} drilling of very long horizontal wells.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of facilities from which offshore drilling operations take place. These include bottom founded drilling rigs (jackup barges and swamp barges), combined drilling and production facilities either bottom founded or floating platforms, and deepwater mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including semi-submersibles and drillships. These are capable of operating in water depths up to 3000 m. In shallower waters the mobile units are anchored to the seabed, however in deeper water (more than 1500 m the semisubmersibles or drillships are maintained at the required <b>drilling</b> <b>location</b> using dynamic positioning.|$|E

50|$|Until the 1970s, most {{oil wells}} were vertical, {{although}} lithological and mechanical imperfections cause most wells to deviate at least slightly from true vertical. However, modern directional drilling technologies allow for strongly deviated wells which can, given sufficient depth {{and with the}} proper tools, actually become horizontal. This is of great value as the reservoir rocks which contain hydrocarbons are usually horizontal or nearly horizontal; a horizontal wellbore placed in a production zone has more surface area in the production zone than a vertical well, resulting in a higher production rate. The use of deviated and horizontal drilling has also {{made it possible to}} reach reservoirs several kilometers or miles away from the <b>drilling</b> <b>location</b> (extended reach drilling), allowing for the production of hydrocarbons located below locations that are either difficult to place a drilling rig on, environmentally sensitive, or populated.|$|E

Experts think that the USA could pass Saudi Arabia as the largest oil producer. Peak production was 10,044 barrels per day in November 1970.

40|$|Abstract. The oil {{industry}} uses geomagnetic field informa-tion to aid directional drilling operations when {{drilling for oil}} and gas offshore. These operations involve continuous monitoring of the azimuth and inclination of the well path to ensure the target is reached and, for safety reasons, to avoid collisions with existing wells. Although the most ac-curate method of achieving this is through a gyroscopic sur-vey, this can be time consuming and expensive. An alterna-tive method is a magnetic survey, where measurements while drilling (MWD) are made along the well by magnetometers housed in a tool within the drill string. These MWD mag-netic surveys require estimates of the Earth’s magnetic field at the <b>drilling</b> <b>location</b> to correct the downhole magnetome-ter readings.
