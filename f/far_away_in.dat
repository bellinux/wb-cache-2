5|$|Psychological {{studies found}} that {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as <b>far</b> <b>away)</b> <b>in</b> some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May {{the broken}} {{remains of the}} two bower anchors, which were {{threatening}} to capsize the ship, were hauled in. During the following days the pack ice thickened, and in increasingly turbulent weather the boilers were closed down, since attempting to manoeuvre under power in these conditions would merely waste coal. Replenishing the ship's supply of fresh water was a further difficulty. A large iceberg was in view, but too <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> the prevailing weather conditions to be accessible, so to obtain drinking water the crew had to gather snow. Food was less of a problem; {{they were able to}} augment Aurora's food supplies from the penguins and seals that gathered around the ship. To boost morale the crew were given a ration of rum to celebrate Empire Day on 24 May.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Momchil was {{approached}} by agents of Kantakouzenos' opponents, the Constantinopolitan regency, and persuaded to turn against him. Thinking that Kantakouzenos and his Turkish allies from the Emirate of Aydin were <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> eastern Thrace, he attacked a Turkish fleet of 15 ships near Portolagos and sank three of them. He then overcame another Turkish force that arrived to exact retribution near the fortress of Peritheorion (also known as Burugrad), and plundered several cities {{in the area that}} refused to surrender. Afterwards, Momchil along with 1,000 horsemen attacked Kantakouzenos, who had set camp near Komotini with only 60 horsemen to protect him. The Byzantines were thoroughly routed: Kantakouzenos' horse was killed and he received a powerful hit to the head, which he survived thanks to his helmet. Momchil captured many of Kantakouzenos' men, but the claimant to the throne himself managed to escape in the turmoil.|$|E

He was educated first in St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, and then Sherborne School in Dorset.

25|$|The siege {{diverted}} Axis {{troops from}} the frontier and the Tobruk garrison repulsed several Axis attacks. The port was frequently bombarded by artillery, dive-bombers and medium bombers, as the RAF flew defensive sorties from airfields <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> Egypt. Allied naval forces, such as the British Mediterranean Fleet (including the Inshore Squadron) ran the blockade, carrying reinforcements and supplies in and wounded and prisoners out. On 27 November, Tobruk was relieved by the Eighth Army (which controlled British and other Allied ground forces in the Western Desert from September 1941) in Operation Crusader.|$|E
25|$|The song {{cycle of}} 10 Biblical Songs, Op. 99, B. 185, {{was written in}} March 1894. Around that time Dvořák was {{informed}} {{of the death of}} the famous conductor, and his close personal friend, Hans von Bülow. Just a month earlier, he had been grieved to hear that his father was near death, <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> Bohemia. Dvořák consoled himself in the Psalms. The resulting work, considered the finest of his song cycles, is based on the text of the Czech Bible of Kralice. As fate would have it, his father expired 28 March 1894, two days after the completion of the work.|$|E

Attention has frequently been drawn to the resemblances in manner and even in some points of detail between the chants of the muezzin and of the reader of the Qur'an with much of the hazzanut, not alone of the Sephardim, who passed so many centuries in Arab lands, but also of the Ashkenazim, equally long located <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> northern Europe.|$|E

25|$|Wellington's {{offensive}} {{that ended}} at Vitoria began in late May. While his army {{was preparing to}} lunge forward, four French divisions under Clausel were <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> the Pyrenees trying to hunt down Francisco Espoz y Mina and his Spanish guerillas. On 12–13 May, Clausel attacked Mina's base at Roncal but the guerilla leader escaped its destruction and the subsequent French pursuit. Meanwhile, Clausel's troops were not available to help the main French army opposing Wellington. Joseph sent Clausel a note asking {{for the return of}} three borrowed divisions on 27 May, but Clausel's column only appeared in the neighborhood of Vitoria a day after the decisive battle. Belatedly realizing the situation, the French general immediately began to retreat. On 26 June, intelligence was received that Clausel's column was within reach, prompting Wellington to order a pursuit.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{both the}} Japanese and the Portuguese were {{left out of}} the {{tributary}} trade by {{the first decades of the}} 16th century. By the middle of the century though, Japan and Portugal became the premier suppliers of silver in East Asia by bringing in silver from mines like the Iwami Ginzan in Japan and the Cerro de Potosí in Bolivia. Silver was the lifeblood of the Ming Chinese economy, but the Ming government placed many restrictions on mining due to fears that the bullion would pool into private hands. Even without the restrictions, China's silver veins were too small and located too <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> the southwest from the commercialized coastal provinces to keep up with the huge demand. This situation made unofficial dealings with foreigners very profitable and enticing for Chinese merchants, despite the risks and illegality of their trade.|$|E
25|$|Black Ladies was {{situated}} within the manor of Brewood, {{which was held}} by the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and probably on land granted by a bishop This {{has led to the}} suggestion that it was founded by one of the bishops, and the one candidate seems to be Roger de Clinton, a powerful magnate who was a mainstay of King Stephen's regime during the Anarchy of the mid-12th century and who died in 1148. Clinton not only had the power and resources but is known to have founded Farewell Priory - not <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> Cannock Chase and also small house dedicated to St. Mary. Although there is no positive evidence for the founder, its existence is attested mid-century in a deed by which Ralph Bassett, a local landowner, grants the nuns small areas of land at Pattingham and Hardwick.|$|E

25|$|A {{discovery}} in gamma-ray astronomy {{came in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s from a constellation of military defense satellites. Detectors on board the Vela satellite series, designed to detect flashes of gamma rays from nuclear bomb blasts, began to record bursts of gamma rays from deep space rather than {{the vicinity of the}} Earth. Later detectors determined that these gamma-ray bursts are seen to last for fractions of a second to minutes, appearing suddenly from unexpected directions, flickering, and then fading after briefly dominating the gamma-ray sky. Studied since the mid-1980s with instruments on board a variety of satellites and space probes, including Soviet Venera spacecraft and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, the sources of these enigmatic high-energy flashes remain a mystery. They appear to come from <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> the Universe, and currently the most likely theory seems to be {{that at least some of}} them come from so-called hypernova explosionssupernovas creating black holes rather than neutron stars.|$|E
25|$|During in Huiyang, Holmes {{was under}} the command of Colonel (later Sir) Douglas Clague. He was {{assigned}} to deal with external affairs and to co-operate closely with the guerillas of the East River Column (東江縱隊). With the help from the guerillas, Holmes had organised a number of rescue plans trying to save the prisoners of war from the Japanese concentration camps and had conducted espionage in the Japanese-occupied region. According to the recollection of Paui Tsui, Holmes and his companions once secretly entered Hong Kong and reached the foot of Lion Rock. From the foot of the mountain, he used binoculars to spy the concentration camp <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>in</b> To Kwa Wan regardless the potential danger of being discovered by the Japanese. Fortunately, although Holmes was a Westerner, the Japanese had never recognised that the fluent Cantonese speaker was in fact a British. Tsui explained the reason was because Holmes was not huge physically and with the disguise of wearing bamboo hat and grey linen clothing, he just looked the same as a common Chinese farmer. His bravery was appreciated by the British government that he was awarded a Military Cross in early 1943 and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) of the Military Division a few months later. It was rare at that time to be decorated twice in a single year.|$|E
