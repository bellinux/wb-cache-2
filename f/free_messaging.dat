This is changing, as the widespread use of this handheld technology offers numerous opportunities to use functions that are ideal for exposing learners to communicative interaction on their language-learning journey.

40|$|Abstract. Internet-based mobile {{messaging}} applications {{have become a}} ubiquitous means of communication, and have quickly gained popularity over cellular short messages (SMS). Unfortunately, from a security point of view, <b>free</b> <b>messaging</b> services do not guarantee the privacy of users. For example, <b>free</b> <b>messaging</b> providers can record and store exchanged messages indefinitely to collect information about specific users. Moreover, these messages can be accessed by criminals who gain access to social media accounts. In this paper, we introduce BabelCrypt, a system that addresses the problem of automatically retrofitting arbitrary mobile chat applications with end-to-end encryption. Our system works by transparently interfacing with the original client applications supplied by the respective service providers. It does not require any modification to the individual applications, nor does it require any knowledge or customization for specific chat applications. BabelCrypt is able to automatically inject control messages in-band, using the underlying application’s message exchange mechanism, and thus supports running arbitrarily complex encryption protocols such as OTR. We successfully used BabelCrypt {{with a number of}} popular {{messaging applications}} including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Skype. Our evaluation shows that BabelCrypt provides end-to-end security for arbitrary messaging applications while satisfactorily preserving the original user experience of the messaging application...|$|E

The project team utilized surveys and observations to analyze the advantages and disadvantages from different perspectives and gain further insight into the nature of member participation, knowledge application and learning interests.

40|$|The {{number of}} cores of {{contemporary}} processors is constantly increasing and thus continues to deliver ever higher peak performance (following Moore’s transistor law).

On the TilePro platform, NoCMsg outperforms shared memory abstractions by up to 93 % as core counts and inter-process communication increase. Results for fully pipelined double precision numerical codes show speedups of up to 64 % for message passing over shared memory at 32 cores. Overall, we observe that shared memory scales up to about 16 cores on this platform while message passing performs well beyond that threshold. These results generalize to similar NoC-based platforms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we report {{findings}} generated {{during the early}} phase of a research project that aims to design and develop social media sharing systems to benefit marginalized communities. Studies of cell-phone network users {{in the developing world}} have shown that the relatively high tariffs for network access have resulted in new and innovate uses of technology to circumvent these costs. In this paper we describe a completely new form of service appropriation and how it is being used to overcome tariff costs in a remote rural area of South Africa. In this country, cell-phone providers offer a highly constrained form of <b>free</b> <b>messaging</b> to their subscribers called “callback”. These requests contain the caller’s cell-phone number and the recipient’s very short personalized message. Up to five free callback requests can be sent per day to any South African cell-phone network. This service is provided for emergencies when as pay-as-you-go customers do not have any airtime left. However, callback is used in rural areas in ways that go far beyond emergencies. As with SMS, the constraints on the callback have been appropriated by people to shape both a new language and cultural interactions. This paper reports the context of our study in communication practices in a remote rural area of South Africa, our methodology which we position within Ethnographic Action Research, and our findings and their implications for the design, development and deployment of social media sharing systems for this area...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Current {{processor}} {{design with}} ever more cores may ensure that theoretical compute performance still follows past increases (resting from Moore’s law), {{but they also}} increas-ingly present a challenge to hardware and software alike. As the core count increases, the network-on-chip (NoC) topology has changed from buses over rings and fully connected meshes to 2 D meshes. The question is which programming paradigm provides the scalability needed to ensure performance is close to theoretical peak, where 2 D meshes provide the most scalable design to date. This work contributes NoCMsg, a low-level message passing abstraction over NoCs. NoCMsg is specifically designed for large core counts in 2 D meshes. Its design ensures deadlock <b>free</b> <b>messaging</b> for wormhole Manhattan-path routing over the NoC. Experimental results on the TilePro hardware platform show that NoCMsg can significantly reduce communication times by up to 86 % for single packet messages and up to 40 % for larger messages compared to other NoC-based message approaches. Results further demonstrate the potential of NoC messaging to outperform shared memory abstractions by up to 93 % as core counts and inter-process communication increase, i. e., we observe that shared memory scales up to about 16 cores while message passing performs well beyond that threshold on this platform. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first head-on comparison of shared memory and advanced message passing specifically designed for NoCs on an actual hardware platform with larger core counts on a single socket.
