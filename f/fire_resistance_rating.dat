5000|$|Explicit {{adoption}} of the [...] "structural frame" [...] approach to fire resistance ratings that requires {{all members of the}} primary structural frame to have the higher <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>rating</b> commonly required for columns.

40|$|The {{potential}} of fire event after a strong earthquake is quite {{high and the}} damage caused by this fire could be significantly higher as compared to normal fire not accompanied by an earthquake. Thus {{it is important to know}} the behavior of structures under such circumstances. Modern buildings are designed to have adequate resistance against an expected level earthquake, and sufficient fire safety, considering these events to occur separately. However, fire following a seismic excitation is not uncommon. After an earthquake the structure may sustain a considerable damage and the <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> of the system will be significantly impaired. In this case, the fire performance of the structure will be significantly reduced, and such condition may pose a serious threat to structural integrity, which is detrimental to the life safety of the occupants and rescue workers. Thus, it is necessary to consider such scenarios in the design of a building constructed in a seismic zone. In this study the performance of two types of structures has been studied. Load bearing wood stud walls and moment resistant steel frames under such condition has been modeled and analyzed. The performance analysis of the wood stud wall in fire has been verified with the results from the NRC fire tests. For the steel frames, the results are validated with different finite element systems such as SAFIR and ANSYS. The analysis includes heat transfer analysis and thermal stress analysis by using numerical model for wood wall and finite element solver for steel frame. Existing numerical model for stability analysis of wood frame walls cannot be applied to cases with fire and earthquake induced fire. Modifications are proposed to the existing methods in order to account for the time dependent changes in strength, stiffness and geometry due to earthquake and fire in order to determine the <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> of the structures. Two analytical approaches have been proposed for modeling the damage in the steel structure after earthquake. <b>Fire</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>rates</b> are investigated for both normal and post earthquake fire scenarios. It is observed from the study that the fire followed by an earthquake reduces the <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> of a structure in both wood-frame and steel-frame structures. The study presented here forms a preliminary understanding of the PEF phenomenon and its effect on structures. Further studies are needed to enhance the understanding, quantify the parametric changes and formulate design guidelines to account for PEF hazard to structures in seismic zones.

These are usually short-term cost-cutting measures at the expense of fire safety and code compliance. Common mistakes include citing a listing for products that may be for other uses.

50|$|For some {{industrial}} uses in steel mills and similar hot environments, no organic material gives satisfactory service. Cables insulated with compressed mica flakes are sometimes used. Another form of high-temperature cable is a mineral insulated cable, with individual conductors placed within a copper tube {{and the space}} filled with magnesium oxide powder. The whole assembly is drawn down to smaller sizes, thereby compressing the powder. Such cables have a certified <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>rating</b> and are more costly than non-fire rated cable. They have little flexibility and behave more like rigid conduit rather than flexible cables.|$|E

50|$|Firestops in {{occupancy}} separations {{are also}} more likely to require an equal fire protection rating (a <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>rating</b> for closures). They also must provide a temperature rating ensuring that the components of the firestop systems, including the penetrants are not permitted to rise in temperature above 140°C (284°F) on average or 180°C (356°F) at any single point, to lower the likelihood of auto-ignition on the unexposed side. In this manner, occupancy separations are treated similarly to fire walls which are structurally stable in case of a fire, thus limiting the danger of fire-induced building collapse.|$|E
50|$|Fire dampers are passive fire {{protection}} products used in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts {{to prevent the spread}} of fire inside the ductwork through fire-resistance rated walls and floors. Fire/smoke dampers are similar to fire dampers in <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>rating,</b> and also prevent the spread of smoke inside the ducts. When a rise in temperature occurs, the fire damper closes, usually activated by a thermal element which melts at temperatures higher than ambient but low enough to indicate the presence of a fire, allowing springs to close the damper blades. Fire dampers can also close following receipt of an electrical signal from a fire alarm system utilising detectors remote from the damper, indicating the sensing of heat or smoke in the building occupied spaces or in the HVAC duct system.|$|E
50|$|Steel loses {{strength}} when heated sufficiently. The {{critical temperature}} of a steel member is the temperature {{at which it}} cannot safely support its load. Building codes and structural engineering standard practice defines different critical temperatures depending on the structural element type, configuration, orientation, and loading characteristics. The critical temperature is often considered the temperature at which its yield stress {{has been reduced to}} 60% of the room temperature yield stress. In order to determine the <b>fire</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>rating</b> of a steel member, accepted calculations practice can be used, or a fire test can be performed, the critical temperature of which is set by the standard accepted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, such as a building code. In Japan, this is below 400 °C. In China, Europe and North America (e.g., ASTM E-119), this is approximately 1000-1300 °F (530-810 °C). The time it takes for the steel element that is being tested to reach the temperature set by the test standard determines the duration of the fire-resistance rating.Heat transfer to the steel can be slowed by the use of fireproofing materials, thus limiting steel temperature. Common fireproofing methods for structural steel include intumescent, endothermic, and plaster coatings as well as drywall, calcium silicate cladding, and mineral wool insulating blankets.|$|E

5000|$|To prevent dust {{explosions and}} fires, {{employers}} must (among other things):Develop {{and implement a}} written housekeeping program with instructions to reduce dust accumulations on ledges, floors, equipment and other exposed surfaces.Identify [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas in grain elevators. The [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas include floor areas within 35 feet of inside bucket elevators, floors of enclosed areas containing grinding equipment and floors of enclosed areas containing grain dryers located inside the facility. Dust accumulations in these priority housekeeping areas shall not exceed 1/8th inch. Employers should {{make every effort to}} minimize dust accumulations on exposed surfaces since dust is the fuel for a fire or explosion, and it is recognized that a 1/8 inch dust accumulation is more than enough to fuel such occurrences.Inside bucket elevators can undergo primary explosions. OSHA's grain handling standard requires that belts for these bucket elevators purchased after March 30, 1988 are conductive and have a surface electrical resistance not exceeding 300 megohms. Bucket elevators must have an opening to the head pulley section and boot section to allow for inspection, maintenance, and cleaning. Bearings must be mounted externally to the leg casing or the employer must provide vibration, temperature, or other monitoring of the conditions of the bearings if the bearings are mounted inside or partially inside the leg casing. These bucket elevators must be equipped with a motion detection device which will shut-down the elevator when the belt speed is reduced by no more than 20% of the normal operating speed.Implement a preventative maintenance program with regularly scheduled inspections for mechanical and safety control equipment, which may include heat producing equipment such as motors, bearings, belts etc. Preventive maintenance is critical to controlling ignition sources. The use of vibration detection methods, heat sensitive tape or other heat detection methods can help in the implementation of the program.Minimize ignition sources through controlling hot work (electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar flame producing operations).Install wiring and electrical equipment suitable for hazardous locations.Design and properly locate dust collection systems to minimize explosion hazards.
