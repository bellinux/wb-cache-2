5000|$|Constructed of steel, Aberdeen was 180 ft {{long with}} {{a beam of}} 31 ft and a draught of 19 ft. The vessel had a tonnage of [...] Powered by a quadruple {{expansion}} steam engine that drove one screw, Aberdeen had a maximum speed of 13 kn. Originally flush-decked and able to set fore and aft sail, she was later rebuilt with a high forecastle and a <b>heavy</b> <b>derrick</b> forward.|$|E
50|$|The patent Stülcken derrick is {{used for}} very heavy cargo. It stems from the German {{shipyard}} HC Stülcken & Sohn which has been taken over later by neighboring yard Blohm & Voss. This derrick can handle up to 300 tonnes. The Stülcken can be made ready in few minutes, dramatically faster than a traditional <b>heavy</b> <b>derrick,</b> doesn't require lots of space and is operated by four winches. Between two v-shaped, unstayed Samson-posts is the Stülcken secured. This {{makes it possible to}} let the derrick swing through the posts to reach another hatch. For each post is a hoisting winch, a span winch and a lever that is run by one man only. Bearings, swivels, sheaves and the gooseneck can be unattended for up to four years and create only a friction of about 2%. The span tackles are independent and the halyard is endless. With the revolving suspension heads on the posts it takes ten minutes to swing all the way through. In the double-pendulum block type, half of the cargo tackle can be anchored {{to the base of the}} boom. In order to double the hook speed, the halyard passes through the purchases since one end is secured which reduces the SWL to its half. Typical dimensions of a 275 tonne Stülcken are: 25.5 m length, 0.97 m diameter, 1.5 m to 3.4 m diameter of posts, 18 m apart the posts (upper end) and 8.4 m apart the posts (lower end). The hook of a full-loaded 275 tonne Stülcken can move 2.3 m per minute. If only one purchase is secured and the derrick is loaded with 137 tonnes the hook gains velocity to 4.6 m per min. Even more speed can be gained when the winch ratios are reduced to 100 tonnes (triple speed) and 68 tonnes (quadruple speed). Detaching the union table the double-pendulum block type of Stülcken is able to swing through which allows the lower blocks to swing freely to each side of the boom. In this way the derrick reaches a vertical position. A bullrope easily pulls the derrick to the other side until the weight of the cargo tips the derrick over. The span tackles now have the weight on the other side. The union table is fixed again and the derrick can start its work on the other side. There are also Stülcken with single-pendulum blocks. At this type the cargo hook is detached and the lower and upper cargo block are hauled into the center of the Stülcken. To tip the derrick over the gravity is here used again. A derrick helps pump oil in most offshore rigs.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 <b>heavy</b> lift <b>{{derricks}}</b> 60.0 {{metric tons}} each. Like this derricks were operated by 2 persons due to 2 columns of control for each derrick were {{installed on the}} mast separately like for 2 persons.|$|R

500|$|Moving {{forward with}} his platoon, Derrick {{attacked}} a Japanese post {{that had been}} holding up the advance. He destroyed the position with grenades and ordered his second section around to the right flank. The section soon came under heavy machine gun and grenade fire from six Japanese posts. Clambering up the cliff face under <b>heavy</b> fire, <b>Derrick</b> held on {{with one hand while}} lobbing grenades into the weapon pits with the other, like [...] "a man... shooting for [...] goal at basketball". Climbing further up the cliff and {{in full view of the}} Japanese, Derrick continued to attack the posts with grenades before following up with accurate rifle fire. Within twenty minutes, he had reached the peak and cleared seven posts, while the demoralised Japanese defenders fled from their positions to the buildings of Sattelberg.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} three sister ships were the heavy lift {{vessels in the}} Safmarine fleet, also for carrying general cargo. The [...] "S.A.Van Der Stel", [...] "S.A. Weltevreden", and the [...] "S.A. Nederburg". were all built by a Dutch company, and entered service in the mid-1960s. The S.A. Van Der Stel could lift 250 tons with her own derricks {{and the other two}} could lift 125 tons. They were all powered by a six-cylinder M.A.N K6Z86/160 low-speed two-stroke diesel engine, developing approximately 14,000 BHP and a speed of 21 knots. For electrical power three M.A.N diesel engines drove AC alternators.These ships were modified in Japan in 1975/1976. An additional hold specially designed for containers approximately 100' long was added amidships. A new <b>heavy</b> lift <b>derrick</b> was added and loading points were added on deck for container mounting.|$|R
5|$|Promoted to {{sergeant}} on 28 July, Derrick led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German {{machine gun}} positions and strongholds; {{this information was}} to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein. The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, with the 9th Australian Division taking part. At one point during the engagement, Derrick jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense <b>heavy</b> fire, <b>Derrick</b> attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick's platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick's action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made.|$|R
5000|$|The Emblem of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic {{was adopted}} on 2 March 1937 by the {{government}} of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. The coat of arms is based on the coat of arms of the Soviet Union. It shows symbols of agriculture (cotton, wheat and grapes) and <b>heavy</b> industry (oil <b>derrick</b> and pipeline), as well {{as a symbol of the}} Turkmen people, a rug. The rising Sun stands for the future of the Turkmen nation, the red star as well as the hammer and sickle for the victory of Communism and the [...] "world-wide socialist community of states".|$|R
60|$|The Newberrys {{left them}} to themselves; not with any intent; {{it was merely}} that they were perpetually busy walking about the grounds of Castel Casteggio, blowing up things with dynamite, {{throwing}} steel bridges over gullies, and hoisting <b>heavy</b> timber with <b>derricks.</b> Nor were they to blame for it. For it had not always been theirs to command dynamite and control the forces of nature. There had been a time, now long ago, when the two Newberrys had lived, both of them, on twenty dollars a week, and Mrs. Newberry had made her own dresses, and Mr. Newberry had spent vigorous evenings in making hand-made shelves for their sitting-room. That was long ago, and since then Mr. Newberry, like many other people of those earlier days, had risen to wealth and Castel Casteggio, while others, like Norah's father, had stayed just where they were.|$|R
5000|$|Wright married Barbara, a lyricist and actress, in 1961. Their son, St.John, {{was born}} while Wright was {{on stage in}} Leeds with Donegan. Barbara died on 16 February 1989 after an eight-year battle with breast cancer. They had been married over 27 years. Wright, who was devastated by his wife's death, died on 8 February 1992 in London after a nine-year battle with bladder cancer, {{a direct result of}} his <b>heavy</b> smoking. Van <b>Derrick</b> and Wright's son, who had given up his career to become Wright's carer, were with him when he died. He was cremated at St. Marylebone Crematorium on 14 February 1992; at the service, his band, the Hot Club of London, played [...] "Days of Wine & Stephan" [...] - one of Wright's compositions. Donegan was not able to attend; instead, he sent a floral tribute {{in the shape of a}} guitar.|$|R
25|$|Tobruk {{is capable}} of embarking between 300 and 520 {{soldiers}} (extended duration versus short term), along with 1,300 tons of cargo or 330 lane metres of vehicles (equivalent to 18 Leopard 1 or M1 Abrams main battle tanks plus 40 M113 armored personnel carriers or Australian Light Armoured Vehicles). Vehicles and cargo can be embarked via bow or stern ramps, with the reinforced tank-deck running {{the length of the}} ship, and inter-deck transfer ramps fitted. The bow ramp is contained behind horizontal-opening bow doors, and can be extended and lowered for beach or harbour loading, while at the stern a combined door-ramp can be used conventionally when at suitable facilities, or for ramp-to-ramp loading of landing craft at sea. Additional cargo handling is provided by the 70-tonne Velle <b>heavy</b> lift <b>derrick</b> (a feature singled out for attention in Jane's Fighting Ships), supplemented by two 8.5-tonne Favco cranes. Two LCM-8 landing craft can be carried in cradles on the main deck, while two LCVP are carried in derricks on the superstructure. Two Naval Lighterage Equipment pontoons can be carried on the ship's flanks to extend the reach of the bow ramp when beaching, or as rafts to transport cargo ashore. The ship has an aft helicopter platform capable of handling aircraft up to Sea King size, while the main deck (once cleared of landing craft and cargo) {{can be used as a}} secondary flight deck for helicopters up to Chinook size. Both flight decks can be operated simultaneously, and both have capability for landed or at-hover refuelling.|$|R
