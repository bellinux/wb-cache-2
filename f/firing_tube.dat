50|$|Unless the {{autoclave}} uses steam injection, {{the circulation}} fan carries {{the burden of}} assuring temperature uniformity throughout the working chamber. Since the heat flows from the source, whether electric resistance, steam coil, or <b>firing</b> <b>tube,</b> into the circulating air stream {{and then into the}} workload, the greater the airflow turbulence, the better the heat transfer, particularly with workloads that are heavy and dense.|$|E
50|$|Panzerfaust 150: {{this was}} a major {{redesign}} of the weapon, and was deployed in limited numbers {{near the end of}} the war. The <b>firing</b> <b>tube</b> was reinforced and reusable for up to ten shots. A new pointed warhead with increased armour penetration and two-stage propellant ignition gave a higher velocity of 85 m per second. Production started in March 1945, two months before the end of the war.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler is a {{one type}} of boiler. It is {{developed}} as {{the second of the}} three major historical types of boilers which are low-pressure tank, <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler and high-pressure water <b>tube</b> boiler. Sometimes <b>fired</b> <b>tube</b> boiler is called as a smoke tube boiler or shell boiler. A <b>fired</b> <b>tube</b> boiler is use for production of steam. The efficiency of steam production {{is directly related to the}} temperature, residence time of water flow and the water turbulence inside the <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler. With the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this study presents the effort performed in modelling work on the water turbulence using design of <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler without baffles and <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler with baffles. The prediction of water flow inside the boiler based on k-s turbulence model is used since it is widely applied in industries and education sectors. Anyway, the purpose of this study is to investigate the water flow and the thermal characteristics in a <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler by using FLUENT. FLUENT is the software that used as a solver and post-processing in CFD. The comparison of the water flow and the thermal characteristics between <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler without baffles and <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler will also be discussed...|$|R

50|$|Package boilers are {{commonly}} called water or <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> Boilers. Water tube boilers use convection heating, which draws {{the heat from}} the fire source, and passes against the generating tubes of the boiler, causing water inside those tubes to boil off into steam. The <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler arrangement utilizes conduction heating which transfers heat from physical contact. <b>Fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers are not commonly used due to their method of conduction heating because pipes in direct contact with fire and cold water could damage the pipes. The package boiler is usually a two or three-pass fire-tube boiler with an internal furnace tube. This is similar to the much earlier Scotch boiler.|$|R

Like other SLBMs the initial launch was powered by a gas generator {{in the bottom of}} the <b>firing</b> <b>tube.</b> During the missiles passage through the water additional motors produce a gaseous wall around the missile, reducing hydrodynamic resistance. The launch system was designated [...] "D-19".|$|E
50|$|Panzerfaust 250: {{the last}} {{development}} of the Panzerfaust series was the Panzerfaust 250. It used a reloadable tube and now featured a pistol grip. With propellants in both the <b>firing</b> <b>tube</b> and on the projectile itself it was projected to reach a projectile speed of 150 m/s (490 feet/s). Serial production was scheduled to begin in September 1945. However, {{the development of this}} weapon was never completed and none were ever produced. The Soviet RPG-2 anti-tank rocket launcher partially was based on the design of the Panzerfaust 250.|$|E

This study was carried out in Texmaco package horizontal <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler at Travancore Titanium Products Ltd (TTPL), Trivandrum, Kerala. The boiler efficiency was measured by indirect method. Heat losses in dry flue gas and due to unburned fuel were found to be the major problems.

50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, when metallurgists {{were able to}} better {{understand}} what properties and processes made good iron, it was being displaced by steel. Also, the old cylindrical boilers with <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> were displaced by water tube boilers, which are inherently safer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers {{were the}} main type used for early {{high-pressure}} steam (typical steam locomotive practice), but they were {{to a large extent}} displaced by more economical water tube boilers in the late 19th century for marine propulsion and large stationary applications.|$|R

5000|$|Boiler explosions {{are of a}} {{particular}} danger in (locomotive-type) <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers because {{the top of the}} firebox (crown sheet) must be covered with some amount of water at all times; or the heat of the fire can weaken the crown sheet or crown stays to the point of failure, even at normal working pressure.|$|R
30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers are {{the least}} used boilers now-a-days. In this, {{combustion}} products and high temperature gases flow in the tubes and water to be vaporized flows around these tubes [6]. The capacity of these boilers is up to 12, 000  kg/h. They produce low to medium steam pressures up to 18  kg/cm 2 [7, 8].|$|R
50|$|Fire-tube boilers {{sometimes}} have water-tubes as well, {{to increase the}} heating surface. A Cornish boiler may have several water-tubes across {{the diameter of the}} flue (this is common in steam launches). A locomotive boiler with a wide firebox may have arch tubes or thermic syphons. As firebox technology developed, it was found that placing a baffle of firebricks (heat-resistant bricks) inside the firebox to direct the flow of hot flue gasses up into the top of the firebox before it flowed into the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> increased efficiency by equalizing the heat between upper and lower <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> To hold these in place, a metal bracket was used, but to prevent these brackets from burning and eroding away they were built as water tubes, with cool water {{from the bottom of the}} boiler moving upwards by convection as it heated, and carrying the heat away before the metal reached its failure temperature.|$|R
50|$|In 1830 {{he invented}} an early form of storage room heater. It {{comprised}} a small <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler with a detachable flue {{which could be}} heated either outside or indoors with the flue connected to a chimney. Once hot the hot water container could be wheeled to where heat was required and the issuing heat could be altered using adjustable doors.|$|R
50|$|In about 1812, Trevithick {{designed}} the ‘Cornish boiler’. These were horizontal, cylindrical boilers {{with a single}} internal <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> or flue passing horizontally through the middle. Hot exhaust gases from the fire passed through the flue thus increasing the surface area heating the water and improving efficiency. These types were installed in the Boulton and Watt pumping engines at Dolcoath and more than doubled their efficiency.|$|R
50|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that it arose out {{of attempts to}} match the power of broad gauge locomotives within {{the limitations of the}} standard gauge of Stephenson railways. However, the patent originally arose from a problem which became apparent as trains travelled longer distances, specifically on the North Midland Railway in England around 1841, where <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> and smokeboxes were becoming destroyed by the heat.|$|R

50|$|Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted of Fredrikstad, Norway {{built the}} ship as the banana boat SS Honduras. She had two <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers with a {{combined}} heating surface of 3943 sq ft that supplied steam at 180 lbf/in2 to a three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine. There is some discrepancy over her nominal horsepower: a Norwegian source claims that her engine produced 258 NHP but Lloyds Register records it as 188 NHP.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of the Class 15, it was still early days for water {{treatment}} and enough trouble was experienced to result in their steel fireboxes being replaced with copper fireboxes. The locomotive's one flaw was excessively long <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> On later models like the Class 15A, Hendrie improved the boiler by adding a combustion chamber, which shortened the distance between tube plates from 21 ft to 19 ft.|$|R
50|$|The Franco-Crosti boiler is a {{modification}} of the conventional <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler design used on most steam locomotives. Unlike conventional boilers the heat remaining in the exhaust gases is used to preheat the water supply for the main boiler using a secondary heat exchange mechanism. This mechanism, known as the feedwater heater is essentially a secondary boiler. The preheated feedwater is fed at full boiler pressure into the main boiler via clack valves.|$|R
50|$|When the {{evacuation}} started, some people left via rear exits. The vast intake of oxygen turned the club's hall {{into a large}} <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> and boosted the spread of fire. As fumes and smoke overtook the air, panic erupted and patrons stampeded toward the exit. According to witnesses, one leaf of the club's double doors was sealed shut, and the public {{was unaware of the}} backdoor exit behind the stage not shown by emergency lighting.|$|R
50|$|The second {{locomotive}} of the class, No.2002 Earl Marischal {{was completed}} by 1935, also at Doncaster, and was fitted with Walschaerts valve gear, as used on Gresley Pacifics, and had a greater superheater heating area of 776.5 sq ft, obtained by using larger diameter <b>fire</b> <b>tubes.</b> At low cutoffs smoke clearance on No.2002 was unsatisfactory: wind tunnel experiments led to an additional second pair of smoke deflectors being fitted inward of the first.|$|R
5000|$|The sealed ultra-high-pressure circuit ran {{at between}} , {{depending}} on the rate of firing. The HP boiler worked at approx , and the low-pressure boiler at [...] The UHP and HP boilers were of a water tube design, while the LP boiler was a <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler typical for steam locomotives. The LP cylinders were driven {{with a mixture of}} the HP cylinder exhaust and the LP boiler output. Both HP and LP boilers had superheaters.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{pressurized}} container {{such as the}} waterside of a steam boiler ruptures, it is always followed by some degree of steam explosion. A common operating temperature and pressure for a marine boiler is around 950 P.S.I. (6.55 MPa) and 850 °F (454 °C) at the outlet of the superheater. A steam boiler has an interface of steam and water in the steam drum, {{which is where the}} water is finally evaporating due to the heat input, usually oil-fired burners. When a water tube fails due to any of a variety of reasons, it causes the water in the boiler to expand out of the opening into the furnace area that is only a few P.S.I. above atmospheric pressure. This will likely extinguish all fires and expands over the large surface area {{on the sides of the}} boiler. To decrease the likelihood of a devastating explosion, boilers have gone from the [...] "fire-tube" [...] designs, where the heat was added by passing hot gases through tubes in a body of water, to [...] "water-tube" [...] boilers that have the water inside of the tubes and the furnace area is around the tubes. Old [...] "fire-tube" [...] boilers often failed due to poor build quality or lack of maintenance (such as corrosion of the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes,</b> or fatigue of the boiler shell due to constant expansion and contraction). A failure of <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> forces large volumes of high pressure, high temperature steam back down the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> in a fraction of a second and often blows the burners off the front of the boiler, whereas a failure of the pressure vessel surrounding the water would lead to a full and entire evacuation of the boiler's contents in a large steam explosion. On a marine boiler, this would certainly destroy the ship's propulsion plant and possibly the corresponding end of the ship.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} power of the steam blast was {{discovered}} it became apparent that a smokebox was needed beneath the chimney, to provide a space in which the exhaust gases emerging from the boiler tubes can mix with the steam. This had the added advantage of allowing access to collect the ash drawn through the <b>fire</b> <b>tubes</b> by the draught. The blastpipe, from which steam is emitted, was mounted directly beneath the chimney {{at the bottom of the}} smokebox.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{the thermal}} energy demand in the {{industrial}} sector is usually satisfied by means of <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boilers while electricity is supplied from the grid. Alternatively cogeneration units could be adopted for thermal and electrical energy self-production, whilst installing boilers only as back-up units. However, even when cogeneration is profitable, it is not widespread because industries are usually unwilling to accept cogeneration plants for reliability and high investment costs issues. In this work a system aimed at overcoming the above mentioned market difficulties is proposed. It consists of an innovative coupling of a {{combined heat and power}} unit with a modified <b>fire</b> <b>tube</b> boiler. In particular, a CFD analysis was carried out by the authors in order to address the most critical aspects related with the coupling of the two systems. More precisely, the following aspects were evaluated in detail: (i) pressure losses of the exhausts going from the prime mover to the boiler due to the sudden cross-section area variations; (ii) thermal power recoverable from the exhausts in the tubes of the boiler; (iii) dependence of the system on the final users' specification...|$|R
