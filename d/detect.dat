5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very {{difficult}} to <b>detect</b> from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to <b>detect</b> them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to <b>detect</b> ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned to <b>detect</b> volcanic ash. This system can <b>detect</b> ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The camera is currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to <b>detect</b> {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could <b>detect</b> anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to <b>detect</b> a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E

3000|$|The error {{modeling}} and its related parameters {{are shown in}} Fig.  5. The instant when the maper is observed depends {{on the number of}} tags being simultaneously <b>detected.</b> If two tags are never <b>detected</b> simultaneously then MCid is identical to Cid and so it is the occurrence of the maper. If at least two tags may be <b>detected</b> at the same time then four possibilities arise: first, no tag is being <b>detected</b> when a distinct tag is detected; second, no more tags are <b>detected</b> when the reader ceases from <b>detecting</b> the last <b>detected</b> tag; third, one tag is being <b>detected</b> at a time when another tag is detected; fourth, two or more tags are being <b>detected</b> at the same time when the reader ceases from <b>detecting</b> one of them. In the first two cases, MCid is equivalent to Cid; thus, the locus of points in which the maper is observed is the one described on the beginning of [...] "Appendix 2 " [...] for Cid technique. In the third and fourth cases, if two or more tags are being <b>detected</b> at the same time then the maper occurs in one of the following instants: at the very instant when the user’s RFID reader ceases from <b>detecting</b> one of the last two tags detected; at the very instant immediately before it ceased from <b>detecting</b> one of the last two tags <b>detected.</b> Otherwise, the maper occurs in one of the following instants: at the very instant when the user’s RFID reader turns to two tags being simultaneously detected; at the very instant immediately before it turned to two tags being simultaneously <b>detected.</b>|$|R
