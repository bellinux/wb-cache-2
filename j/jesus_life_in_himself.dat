5000|$|Unlike {{the four}} {{canonical}} gospels, which employ narrative {{accounts of the}} last year of <b>Jesus's</b> <b>life</b> (<b>in</b> the case of John, three years) and of his birth (in the case of Luke and Matthew), the Judas gospel takes the form of dialogues between Jesus and Judas, and Jesus and the twelve disciples, without being embedded in any narrative or worked into any overt philosophical or rhetorical context. Such [...] "dialogue gospels" [...] were popular during the early decades of Christianity, and indeed the four canonical gospels are distinguished from the others as the only surviving gospels in narrative form. The New Testament apocrypha contains several examples of the dialogue form, an example being the Gospel of Mary.|$|R

Judas believes that he can persuade Barabbas to embrace Christ as a liberator and that he can influence Christ to take up arms against Rome, but Barabbas becomes disillusioned after listening to the Sermon on the Mount. It is then that Judas decides to betray Christ to the Romans. When Lucius frees Barabbas, Lucius pointedly commands Barabbas to go look at Christ as he carries his cross.|$|R

Bruno Bauer (1809-1882) was the first academic theologian to affirm the non-historicity of Jesus.

As a researcher believer and follower asked many questions myself, why Jesus was helped to poor and help less people.

60|$|All men, the Father has appointed, are to honour the Son, {{even as they}} honour the Father. Because, as the Athanasian Creed says, 'such as the Father is, such is the Son.' But, if that be true, we are to honour the Father even as we honour the Son; {{because such}} as the Son is, such is the Father. Both are true, and we must believe both; and {{therefore}} we must not give to Christ the honour which we should to a loving friend, and give to the Father the honour which we should to an awful judge. We must give them both the same honour. If we have a godly fear of the Father, {{we ought to have}} a godly fear of Christ; and if we trust Christ, we ought to trust the Father also. We must believe that Jesus Christ, the Son, is the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person; and therefore we must believe that because Jesus is love, therefore the Father is love; because Jesus is long-suffering, therefore the Father is long-suffering; because Jesus came to save the world, therefore the Father must have sent him to save the world, or he would never have come; for he does nothing, he says, of himself. Because we can trust Jesus utterly, therefore we can trust the Father utterly. Because we believe that the Son has <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>himself,</b> to give to whomsoever he will, we must believe that the Father has <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>himself</b> likewise, and not, as some seem to fancy, only the power of death and destruction.

60|$|For who is Christ, but the {{likeness}} of God, and the glory of God? And what is {{the likeness}} of God, but goodness; {{and what is the}} glory of God, but goodness? Therefore Christ is goodness itself, as it is written, 'Now the Lord is that Spirit.'

From Christ, and not from any created being, comes all goodness in man or angel. Comes from Christ?

6000|$|I {{wish that}} some of those who now write so many {{excellent}} books for young people, would write one made up entirely of stories of good sons who have obeyed, and worked for, and suffered for their parents. Sure I am that such a book, wisely and well written, would teach young people much of the meaning of the blessed name of God, much of their duty to God. And yet, after all, my friends, is not such a book written already? Have we not the four Gospels, which tell us of Jesus Christ, the perfect Son, who came to do the will of a perfect Father? Read that; read your Bibles. Read the history of the Lord Jesus Christ, keeping in mind always that it is the history of the Son of God, and of His obedience to His Father. And when in St. John's most wonderful Gospel you meet with deep texts, like the one which I have chosen, read them too as carefully, if possible more carefully, than the rest; for they are meant for all parents and for all children upon earth. Read how The Father loves The Son, and gives all things into His hand, and commits all judgment to The Son, and gives Him power to have <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>Himself,</b> even as The Father has <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>Himself,</b> and shows Him all things that Himself doeth, that all men may honour The Son even as they honour The Father. Read how The Son came only to show forth His Father's glory; to be the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person: to establish His Father's kingdom; to declare the goodness of His Father's Name, which is The Father. How He does nothing of Himself, but only what He sees His Father do; how He seeks not His own will, but the will of the Father who sent Him; how He sacrificed all, yea even His most precious body and soul upon the cross, to finish the work which His Father gave Him to do. How, being in the form of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equal with God, He could boldly say, 'As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father. I and my Father are one:' and still, in the fulness of His filial love and obedience, declared that He had no will, no wish, no work, no glory, but His Father's; and in the hour of His agony cried out, 'Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not my will but thine be done.' ...|$|R

In 2 Corinthians 12 he tells his readers of [...] "a man in Christ who ... was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know - God knows;" [...] Combined with references elsewhere in the Epistles to [...] "glory" [...] and [...] "light" [...] and the [...] "face of Jesus Christ;" [...] while language is obscure, it is plausible that Paul saw Jesus exalted as Christ, enthroned in heaven at the right hand of God. He has little interest in Jesus' resurrected body, except {{to say that it is}} not a this-worldly one: in his Letter to the Philippians he describes how the resurrected Christ is exalted in a new body utterly different to one he had when he wore [...] "the appearance of a man," [...] and holds out a similar glorified state, when Christ [...] "will transform our lowly body," [...] as the goal of the Christian life.|$|R
