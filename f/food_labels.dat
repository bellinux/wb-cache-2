According to Chip Wood, co-founder of the Northeast Foundation for Children, fourth through sixth grade children will typically be between the ages of 9 and 12 years old. The program is provided at no cost to the children and their families. To date, over 15,000 children have participated in the educational program. Pure Food Kids is taught in classrooms, after-school events, and at Parent-Teacher Association events, with all supplies and materials provided by Beecher's, although there is explicitly no promotion or use of any products from any of Dammeier's businesses.|$|E

40|$|In the United States, {{there has}} been fierce debate over state, federal and {{international}} efforts to engage in genetically modified <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> (GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling).</b> A grassroots coalition of consumers, environmentalists, organic farmers, and the food movement has pushed for law reform in respect of GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> The Just Label It campaign has encouraged United States consumers to send comments to the United States Food and Drug Administration to <b>label</b> genetically modified <b>foods.</b> This Chapter explores the various justifications made in respect of genetically modified <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> There has been a considerable effort to portray the issue of GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> as one of consumer rights as part of ‘the right to know’. There {{has been a significant}} battle amongst farmers over GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> – with organic farmers and biotechnology companies, fighting for precedence. There has also been a significant discussion about the use of GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> as a form of environmental legislation. The prescriptions in GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> regulations may serve to promote eco-labelling, and deter greenwashing. There has been a significant debate over whether GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> may serve to regulate corporations – particularly from the food, agriculture, and biotechnology industries. There are significant issues about the interaction between intellectual property laws – particularly in respect of trade mark law and consumer protection – and regulatory proposals focused upon biotechnology. There has been a lack of international harmonization in respect of GM <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> As such, {{there has been}} a major use of comparative arguments about regulator models in respect of <b>food</b> <b>labelling.</b> There has also been a discussion about international law, particularly with the emergence of sweeping regional trade proposals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. This Chapter considers the United States debates over genetically modified <b>food</b> <b>labelling</b> – at state, federal, and international levels. The battles often involved the use of citizen-initiated referenda. The policy conflicts have been policy-centric disputes – pitting organic farmers, consumers, and environmentalists against the food industry and biotechnology industry. Such battles have raised questions about consumer rights, public health, freedom of speech, and corporate rights. The disputes highlighted larger issues about lobbying, fund-raising, and political influence. The role of money in United States has been a prominent concern of Lawrence Lessig in his recent academic and policy work with the group, Rootstrikers.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} {{positive}} associations between <b>food</b> <b>label</b> use, nutrition knowledge, and self-efficacy, and dietary quality. However, very {{little has been}} published in this area among Latino groups. Based on findings from previous national surveys and community research studies, a randomized community trial was conducted to measure the impact of an experimental nutrition education intervention on the declarative and procedural <b>food</b> <b>label</b> knowledge, <b>food</b> <b>label</b> self-efficacy, and <b>food</b> <b>label</b> stage of change of Latino caretakers living in inner-city Hartford, Connecticut. Ninety-six caretakers {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three groups: Intervention (n = 32) —receiving <b>food</b> <b>label</b> and <b>food</b> guide pyramid information; Control (n = 33) —food guide pyramid and dental health information; or Reference (n = 31) —non-nutrition related information. This dissertation is based on comparing results from intervention and control groups. Intervention and control group participants were taken to the grocery store, at pre/post intervention, to assess procedural <b>food</b> <b>label</b> knowledge. One month after the intervention, all participants completed a telephone follow-up survey to assess maintenance of <b>food</b> <b>label</b> knowledge and self-efficacy. Pre/post <b>food</b> <b>label</b> knowledge tests were used to assess the effects of the intervention. All instruments were tested, prior to data collection, for face validity and content validity; also construct validity was assessed through principal component analysis with varimax rotation. After adjusting for baseline pretest scores and past receipt of AFDC benefits, results of intervention vs. control group comparisons (N = 65) revealed that participants in the intervention group had significantly higher mean post declarative (8. 56 ± 1. 99 vs. 5. 06 ± 2. 03, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) and procedural <b>food</b> <b>label</b> knowledge (5. 72 ± 1. 63 vs. 3. 85 ± 1. 12, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) scores than those in the control group. Similarly, <b>food</b> <b>label</b> self-efficacy was significantly higher in the intervention group at post declarative, post procedural, and follow-up than in the control group (. 814 ±. 310 vs.. 404 ±. 309, p 3 ̆c 0. 001;. 868 ±. 272 vs.. 433 ±. 363, p 3 ̆c 0. 001;. 814 ±. 331 vs.. 492 ±. 409, p = 0. 003, respectively). There was also an increase in <b>food</b> <b>label</b> use in both intervention and the control groups at follow-up.

One of the significant actions in this regard is raising public awareness on <b>food</b> <b>labeling</b> there is a significant progress in terms of food safety and nutrition policy in Georgia. However, the country still faces some serious challenges in this field. The majority of the consumers are not satisfied with the <b>food</b> <b>labeling</b> in the local market.

Argumentative cross-overs are not only of theoretical interest.
