40|$|In genetic {{association}} studies, {{linkage disequilibrium}} (LD) within a region can be exploited {{to select a}} subset of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to genotype with minimal loss of information. A novel entropy-based method for selecting SNPs is proposed and compared to an existing method based on the coefficient of determination (R 2) using simulated data from Genetic Analysis Workshop 14. The effect {{of the size of}} the sample used to investigate LD (by estimating haplotype frequencies) and hence select the SNPs is also investigated for both measures. It is found that the novel method and the established method select SNP subsets that do not differ greatly. The entropy-based measure may thus have value because it is easier to compute than R 2. Increasing the sample size used to estimate haplotype frequencies improves the predictive power of the subset of SNPs selected. A smaller subset of SNPs chosen using a large <b>initial</b> <b>sample</b> to estimate LD can in some instances be more informative than a larger subset chosen based on poor estimates of LD (using a small <b>initial</b> <b>sample).</b> An <b>initial</b> <b>sample</b> size of 50 individuals is sufficient in most situations investigated, which involved selection from a set of 7 SNPs, although to select a larger number of SNPs, a larger <b>initial</b> <b>sample</b> size may be required...|$|R

40|$|Let $M_{l,n}$ be {{the number}} of blocks with {{frequency}} $l$ in the exchangeable random partition induced by a sample of size $n$ from the Ewens-Pitman sampling model. We show that, as $n$ tends to infinity, $n^{- 1 }M_{l,n}$ satisfies a large deviation principle and we characterize the corresponding rate function. A conditional counterpart of this large deviation principle is also presented. Specifically, given an <b>initial</b> <b>sample</b> of size $n$ from the Ewens-Pitman sampling model, we consider an additional sample of size $m$. For any fixed $n$ and as $m$ tends to infinity, we establish a large deviation principle for the conditional number of blocks with frequency $l$ in the enlarged <b>sample,</b> given the <b>initial</b> <b>sample.</b> Interestingly, the conditional and unconditional large deviation principles coincide, namely there is no long lasting impact of the given <b>initial</b> <b>sample.</b> Potential applications of our results {{are discussed in the}} context of Bayesian nonparametric inference for discovery probabilities.

It involves several steps, including <b>initial</b> <b>sampling,</b> regression and adaptive sampling. This study evaluates an adaptive surrogate modeling based optimization (ASMO) method on two benchmark problems: the Hartman function and calibration of the SAC-SMA hydrologic model. Our results show that: 1) Gaussian Processes are the best surrogate model construction method. A minimum Interpolation Surface method is the best adaptive sampling method. Low discrepancy Quasi Monte Carlo methods are the most suitable <b>initial</b> <b>sampling</b> designs. Some 15 – 20 times the dimension of the problem may be the proper <b>initial</b> <b>sample</b> size; 2) The ASMO method is much more efficient than the widely used Shuffled Complex Evolution global optimization method. However, ASMO can provide only approximate optimal solutions, whose precision is limited by surrogate modeling methods and problem-specific features; and 3) The identifiability of model parameters is correlated with parameter sensitivity...|$|R

5000|$|Early neolithic finds {{included}} {{a large number}} of fragments of limestone White Ware or [...] "Vassille Blanche", along with later pottery called dark faced burnished ware or DFBW. Only one vessel was reconstructed from the initial excavations; a bowl with combed finishing. Other shards included jars and bowls of a black, brown or red colour, one showed a straw wiped finish normally found in sites further South in the Jordan Valley. Others showed decorations such as chevrons, incised patterns and corded impressions. Flints were similar to those found at Tell Ramad and included Byblos points, hooks, scrapers, borers and burins. Burials were found within two houses, which were excavated and found to be similar to those in earlier PPNB and PPNA sites. A range of sickle blades were found in the [...] deposits and higher levels showing the evolution of denticulated and segmented cutting edges with similarities to those found at the oldest neolithic Byblos.
