5|$|Financial data of Lexus {{operations}} are not disclosed publicly. However, automotive analysts {{estimate that the}} Lexus division contributes a <b>disproportionate</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> Toyota's profits, relative to its limited production and sales volume. Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on sales volume, vehicle product development cycles, and exchange rates, Lexus sales have accounted {{for as much as}} half of Toyota's annual U.S. profit in certain years. Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume, with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands. In 2006, Lexus entered Interbrand's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time, with an estimated brand value of approximately $3 billion annually.

Furthermore, a <b>disproportionate</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the Irish Lumper. The expansion of the economy between 1760 and 1815 saw the potato make inroads into the diet of the people and become a staple food year round for farmers. The large dependency on this single crop, and the lack of genetic variability among the potato plants in Ireland, were two of the reasons why the emergence of Phytophthora infestans had such devastating effects in Ireland and less severe effects elsewhere in Europe.|$|E

OBJECTIVES: To compare Medicare and Medicaid expenditures {{of elderly}} dual eligible beneficiaries with non-dual eligible beneficiaries {{based on their}} long-term care (LTC) use. RESEARCH DESIGN: Secondary analysis of linked MAX and Medicare data in seven states. SUBJECTS: Dual eligible adults (65 +) receiving LTC in institutions, in the community, or not at all; and Medicare non-dual eligibles. MEASURES: Medicaid acute medical and LTC expenditures per beneficiary year, Medicare expenditures. RESULTS: Among dual eligibles and non-dual eligibles, {{the average number of}} diseases and case mix scores are higher for LTC users. Adjusting for case mix virtually eliminates the difference for medical costs, but not for LTC expenditures.

40|$|Abstract—Prior {{work has}} shown that {{uncontrolled}} messaging in ad-hoc opportunistic networks results in a <b>disproportionate</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>of</b> network capacity. Solutions based on publicly verifiable sender authentication mechanisms, {{such as those in}} [1], require complete message transmission for proper verification. However, introducing message fragmentation, e. g., to optimize limited transmission opportunities, could negatively impact resource management. Unverifiable message fragments that are assigned lower priorities are discarded sooner and reduce delivery ratios. This paper investigates the extent of this impact and shows that publicly verifiable fragment authentication mechanisms are needed to retain the benefits of fragmentation as well as resource management. We take this a step further and show through simulations that strong authenticity guarantees for intermediaries are unnecessary in our specific scenario. Best-effort authentication schemes, where the probability of false positives is much higher than in typical authentication schemes, are sufficient. This suggests the existence of other scenarios where this approach is also applicable. We describe various best-effort authentication techniques and analyze their computation and space savings.

40|$|It {{has long}} been assumed that human {{development}} depends on economic growth, that national economic expansion in turn requires greater energy use and, therefore, increased greenhouse-gas emissions. These interdependences are the topic of current research. Scarcely explored, however, {{is the impact of}} international trade: although some nations develop socio-economically and import high-embodied-carbon products, it is likely that carbon-exporting countries gain significantly fewer benefits. Here, we use new consumption-based measures of national carbon emissions 1 to explore how the relationship between human development and carbon changes when we adjust national emission rates for trade. Without such adjustment of emissions, some nations seem to be getting far better development ‘bang’ for the carbon ‘buck’ than others, who are showing scant gains for <b>disproportionate</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> global emissions. Adjusting for the transfer of emissions through trade explains many of these outliers, but shows that further socio-economic benefits are accruing to carbon-importing rather than carbon-exporting countries. We also find that high life expectancies are compatible with low carbon emissions but high incomes are not. Finally, we see that, despite strong international trends, there is no deterministic industrial development trajectory: there is great diversity in pathways, and national histories do not necessarily follow the global trends...|$|R
40|$|As we {{move into}} the global century, several aspects of social and {{economic}} life are changing and post-industrial shifts are unparalleled by virtue of the interconnectedness that brings together the corners of the globe. New technologies, new economic relationships, new social processes, and new political developments are all characteristics of globalization (Hudson and Lowe, 2004 : 22) in a post-industrial age featured by information, innovation, finance and services. As the world has contracted, people’s quality of life has changed regardless of where they live. In fact, the propagation of free market mindsets in emerging economies has created collective network connections with considerable good but pervasive inequalities as well. A fundamental aim of this book is to argue that these changes are part of a economic transition to post-industrialism associated with risks and inequalities that shape human experience {{in the midst of a}} formidable global financial climate. There is an obvious tension with this. On the one hand, life expectancy, health statuses and per capital incomes are at an all-time high and many feudal practices have been relegated to the past (Phillipson, 2006). On the other hand, vast numbers of people struggle with poverty and significant pockets of poverty portend more than lack of income.

40|$|In {{evaluating}} {{risks from}} air pollution, health impact assessments often {{focus on the}} magnitude of the impacts without explicitly considering the distribution of impacts across subpopulations. In this study, we constructed a model to estimate the magnitude and distribution of health benefits associated with emission controls at five older power plants in the Washington, DC, area. We used the CALPUFF atmospheric dispersion model to determine the primary and secondary fine-particulate-matter (< 2. 5 micro m in aerodynamic diameter) concentration reductions associated with the hypothetical application of "Best Available Control Technology" to the selected power plants. We combined these concentration reductions with concentration-response functions for mortality and selected morbidity outcomes, using a conventional approach as well as considering susceptible subpopulations. Incorporating susceptibility had a minimal effect on total benefits, with central estimates of approximately 240 fewer premature deaths, 60 fewer cardiovascular hospital admissions (CHA), and 160 fewer pediatric asthma emergency room visits (ERV) per year. However, because individuals with lower education appear to have both higher background mortality rates and higher relative risks for air-pollution-related mortality, stratifying by educational attainment implies that 51 % of the mortality benefits accrue among the 25 % of the population with less than high school education. Similarly, diabetics and African Americans bear <b>disproportionate</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> the CHA and ERV benefits, respectively. Although our ability to characterize subpopulations is constrained by the available information, our analysis demonstrates that incorporation of susceptibility information significantly affects demographic and geographic patterns of health benefits and enhances our understanding of individuals likely to benefit from emission controls...|$|R

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{are concerned with}} why the U. S. and Canada have been so much more successful over time than other New World economies. Since all New World societies enjoyed high levels of product per capita early in their histories, the divergence in paths {{can be traced back}} to the achievement of sustained economic growth by the U. S. and Canada during the 18 th to early 19 th centuries. This paper highlights the relevance of differences in the degree of inequality in wealth, human capital, and political power in accounting for the variation in the records of growth, and suggest that the roots of inequality lay in differences in the initial factor endowments of the respective colonies The large concentration of Native Americans, and the suitability of cultiva- ting sugar and other crops were key in generating extreme inequality. This encouraged the evolution of societies where small elites of European descent held highly <b>disproportionate</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> the wealth, human capital and political power, and dominated the population economically and politically. Absent from the nearly all-inclusive list of New World colonies with these conditions were the British settlements in the northern part of the North American continent. Next, we discuss the tendencies of government policies to maintain these conditions along the respective economy's path of development. Finally, we explore the effects of inequality on the evolution of institutions conducive to participation in the commercial economy, markets and technological change during this specific era, and suggest that their greater equality in wealth, human capital, and political capital and power may have predisposed the U. S. and Canada toward earlier realization of sustained economic growth. ...|$|R

40|$|I advance an {{explanation}} for durable dominance—dominants’ enduring control <b>of</b> vastly <b>disproportionate</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> contested resources {{in the face of}} mass entrepreneurial entry and increased competitive parity. I argue that increased, more potent competitive entry and more level rules of competition can benefit dominants. More and stronger new entrants disproportionately disadvantage non-dominants compared to dominants, and weaken near-dominants’ ability to challenge dominants. Durable dominance is observed in many settings, for example, in the increased gap between the wealthiest in the U. S. and everyone else, and in industries where dominant companies maintain their dominance in open, competitive markets. I test the predictions of this theory in two settings. First, I investigate the implications of this theory with thirty years of data on competition among U. S. mutual funds. As predicted by the theory, the effects of increased competitive entry on incumbents were nonlinear: deleterious for incumbent funds on average, but beneficial for dominant funds. New entry of similar competitors depressed future annual flows of investor money into 96. 5 % of mutual funds, but the top 1. 3 % of mutual funds gained on average almost $ 70 million of assets under management from the entry of a similar competitor. Increased competitive entry also increased dominant funds’ probability of remaining dominant for longer than three years. Second, I examine the process of board seat accumulation for directors on the boards of S&P 1500 companies. Those with many board seats (dominant directors) compared to those with only one were about twice as likely to gain another seat in 2000, but no more likely by 2010. The theory predicts that such a leveled playing field should prevent non-dominants from rising to dominance, and the data support this prediction. A Monte Carlo simulation supports the causal relationship between the changed micro-dynamics of hiring and the observed non-appearance of new dominant directors. The proposed theory suggests policy implications for dominants, non-dominants, and policy-makers. I close by suggesting future investigations that could test the general applicability of the theory. I argue that the study of most-often-true “social laws” is a useful complement to the current focus on social mechanisms in organization theory...|$|R
