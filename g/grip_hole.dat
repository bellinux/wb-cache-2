25|$|It {{is common}} for bowlers, {{particularly}} those with fingertip style drillings, to place inserts into the <b>holes</b> rather than <b>grip</b> the <b>holes</b> directly. This {{can be done to}} vary the texture and shape of each hole to match a bowler's preferences.|$|R
5000|$|Billy was a Full Roller. A Full Roller rolls {{the ball}} over the full {{circumference}} of the ball with the ball track going through the palm of the bowling ball at an angle between the <b>gripping</b> <b>holes.</b> Billy was unique in that he rolled a very straight ball with little side turn or hook. Billy also rolled the ball much slower than most other players. With his straighter, slower, Full Roller roll and his pin point accuracy (Billy rarely missed a spare and often converted most of the splits he was faced with), Billy was able to lay the ball tightly into the pocket {{again and again and}} consistently carry the strike.|$|R

50|$|A grip {{consists}} of a wide strip of leather joined to a wrist strap. The leather strip, which covers and protects the palm of the hand, is approximately five centimeters wide and has finger holes at one end. On properly fitted <b>grips,</b> the finger <b>holes</b> will be positioned at the first knuckles of the inserted fingers.|$|R
50|$|Most {{competitive}} gymnasts wear dowel grips. On {{the high}} bar, men use grips that have three finger holes {{and a small}} dowel, whereas grips used on the still rings have a larger dowel and two finger <b>holes.</b> <b>Grips</b> used on the parallel bars have two finger holes and a small dowel. Women's grips have two finger holes and resemble men's ring grips.|$|R

50|$|The body {{is solid}} {{aluminium}} with a textured plastic coating {{made in the}} same form as the live grenade, the textured coating ensuring a good <b>gripping</b> surface. A <b>hole</b> drilled {{up from the bottom}} indicates an empty store as well as ensuring the drill grenade is of the same weight as a live grenade. A bushing on top of the grenade has a dummy fuze mechanism permanently attached with a slot for the pull ring to clip into to prevent it being accidentally pulled. The fuze mechanism, under the plastic cover is very similar in appearance to the American fuze mechanisms. Internally there is an extension on the striker to allow it to be re-cocked during training and there is a leaf spring safety that clips around the safety lever and neck of the grenade preventing the lever from rotating even if the safety pin is pulled.|$|R
5000|$|Holes {{are allowed}} to be drilled into a bowling ball {{for a variety of}} reasons, and bowlers must be able to {{demonstrate}} that such holes can be used as claimed. Up to five holes may be drilled for the bowler's fingers for one hand, and each finger hole may have a small additional hole that intersects for ventilation. A [...] "balance hole" [...] may be added to alter the mass distribution. The USBC recently changed their rules that affect no-thumb bowlers more than those using a conventional <b>grip.</b> Now any <b>hole</b> not used explicitly for gripping during the approach is to be considered a balance hole and only one balance hole is allowed. This means that no-thumb bowlers would have to take out their thumb hole or their balance hole if they have both. This is because it may give them the advantage of special weighting, which can help give the ball a higher spin rate. [...] A [...] "mill hole" [...] may also be used for inspection purposes.|$|R
40|$|A well {{constructed}} horizontal {{production well}} can assure the most advantageous flowing conditions when the fluid {{content of the}} yield gas is not separated to a considerable extent in {{the environment of the}} bore bottom. However, in case of wells producing a high gas-fluid ratio, the intensive separation of fluid and gas in the horizontal section may cause failures of the well structure. For the time being, there is a serious uncertainty concerning <b>hole</b> <b>gripping,</b> system pressure and the effect of well structure influencing flow conditions. The clarification of effects influencing the flow conditions in a horizontal well section could be an important step in preventing the expected production problems, {{as well as from the}} point of view of the construction of a suitable well structure. The present study reports on a series of tests for investigating the mixed flow of gas and fluid in a horizontal well section. Conditions of the design and development of the investigation equipment are presented. In the following, the analysis of horizontal well sections is proposed to be a factor to be considered in well design. During the investigation, flow diagrams have been made to analyze the impact of the casing liner-producing pipe on the flow chart. PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE SEPARATION OF FLUID AND GA...|$|R
40|$|Though automata {{have come}} to rank high on col-lector price lists, such {{is not always the}} case. Inparticular, the French company, Roullet & Decamps, {{manufacturers}} {{of a wide range of}} major automata after 1865, also turned out large numbers of less-sophisticated, far less costly pieces that most modern collectors would love to include in their dis-plays. A reproduced Roullet & Decamps cata-log from 1878 shows a staggering array of animated cats, bears, rabbits and other ani-mals, some with music, some without 1 Here are some specific examples. Photo 1 shows a white rabbit in a silk lettuce, 7 ” high. His fur is in fact rabbit (as is the fur on most of these smaller R&D animals); his eyes are glass. At rest, only his ears and the top of his head are visible. To musical accompani-ment, he rises from hiding, flips his ears forward, and inclines his head to nibble a leaf. Then he abruptly drops back inside the lettuce. The key in this picture is a replacement; Roullet & Decamps keys have either round brass <b>grips</b> with cen-tral <b>holes,</b> or are of steel with oval, hollow grips. The automaton in Photo 2 operates in a simi-lar manner: as the small, sin-gle-tune musical mecha-nism plays, a white-furred cat with green glass eyes rises from his place of hiding inside a cream jug and sticks out his tongue-whether in pleasure over the taste of the cream or in satisfaction at getting away with his naughty deed. Then, having expressed himself, he drops back t...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{episode in}} Northern Europe {{happened}} about 8200  years ago {{was known for}} a relatively long time, mainly due to paleobotanical (palynological) data obtained from analysis of lake and peat sediments. Detailed analysis of ice cores from the Greenland <b>holes</b> <b>GRIP,</b> GISP 2, and NGRIP with a time resolution of about 10  years made possible to refine the duration and characteristics of the time structure of this cold period. This cooling lasted for approximately 160  yr. Spore-pollen analysis of lake sediments in Northern Europe (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, the North and North-West of Russia) and deep-sea cores of the North Atlantic showed that the mean annual air temperature during the maximum stage of the cooling was reduced by 1 – 2  °C, and in some areas by more than 3  °C. The cold spread from {{the coast of the}} North Atlantic into the European continent and manifested itself mostly in Sweden, Finland, the Baltic States, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the North-West and West of the Russian Federation. In the central Russia and North of 70 °N the cooling was weak or absent. The question about a nature of this cold event and other cold spells in Late Glaciation, known as the cold of the early, middle and late Dryas, is widely discussed in the scientific literature. Most of scientists accept a hypothesis proposed more than 20  years ago, that the reduction of air temperatures in regions immediately adjacent to the North Atlantic was caused by the large volume of melt water discharged into the ocean as a result of disintegration and melting of ice-sheets. Climate models that take into account these effects allow estimating a decrease in the air and sea surface temperature due to freshening (desalination) of the upper ocean layer, and this confirms that the greatest decrease in temperature should be observed in the regions directly adjacent to the ocean. The increase in global temperature over the last 30  years is estimated to be 0. 8  ±  0. 2  °C, which is already reflected in a noticeable increase in precipitation in high latitudes. In addition, the melting of mountain glaciers and sea ice in the Arctic basin promotes freshening of the upper ocean, and as a result of these processes one can expect a certain decrease in the air temperature in the high latitudes if the present-day climate warming will continue. On the basis of paleoclimatic data, it can be assumed that such a decrease in air temperature can be relatively small and occur only in areas directly adjacent to the North Atlantic...|$|R
