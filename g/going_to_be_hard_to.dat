[...] "I looked at the different opportunities that I had {{and this was a}} team that won 83 games last year while they were banged up. Cleveland lost four good players from last year's team, and that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> replace. This was an easy decision", Lofton said on signing with the White Sox. White Sox general manager Kenny Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was {{during the second half of}} the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game winning streak and at 111, had the best record in the majors. The White Sox ended the streak and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs scored. [...] "You can't say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. He's been simply amazing", said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel. Lofton appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit [...]259 with 42 RBIs and 22 stolen bases. On July 28 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants of the National League for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and Félix Díaz.|$|E
