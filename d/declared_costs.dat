The owner of a link wishes to be compensated for relaying messages. As the sender of a message on the network, one wants to find the least cost path. There are efficient methods for doing so, even in large networks. However, there is one problem: the costs for each link are unknown. A naive approach would be to ask the owner of each link the cost, use these <b>declared</b> <b>costs</b> to find the least cost path, and pay all links on the path their <b>declared</b> <b>costs.</b> However, it can be shown that this payment scheme is not SP, that is, the owners of some links can benefit by lying about the cost.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the success and continuing relevance of the universal service obligation (USO) in delivering voice telephony, basic digital data capability and broadband services to all Australians. The paper outlines the background to the National Broadband Plan being implemented by the Labor Government elected in November 2007. The costs of this plan and other funding programs implemented since 1996 are annualized and compared to the cost of the USO. The paper reveals that the USO has been eclipsed as a policy tool for making basic telecommunications services universally available in Australia, at least for the time being. It survives as a policy mechanism, but is contained to fixed line telephony, payphones and basic digital data capability. Its <b>declared</b> <b>costs</b> have fallen. The proposed national broadband network continues the trend towards using government funding to achieve telecommunications policy goals. This trend was initiated by the previous government with some of the proceeds from privatizing the former government monopoly, Telstra. The national broadband network also supplements this trend with a reversion to a degree of state participation in a facility (a fibre-to-the-node network serving 98 percent of the population) likely to have strong natural monopoly characteristics. The paper considers the USO as just one of many tools available to ensure basic telecommunication services are universally available and the debates about it in Australia less as arguments about where an old concept should go in the future, and more about what a very young concept really means...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing mechanisms for hiring a matroid base without money. In our model, {{the elements of a}} given matroid correspond to agents who might misreport their actual costs that are incurred if they are hired. The goal is to hire a matroid base of minimum total cost. There are no monetary transfers involved. We assume that the reports are binding in the sense that an agent’s cost is equal to the maximum of his declared and actual costs. Our model encompasses a variety of problems as special cases, such as computing a minimum cost spanning tree or finding minimum cost allocation of jobs to machines. We derive a polynomial-time randomized mechanism that is truthful in expectation and achieves an approximation ratio of (m − r) / 2 + 1, where m and r refer to the number of elements and the rank of the matroid, respectively. We also prove that this is best possible by showing that no mechanism that is truthful in expectation can achieve a better approximation ratio in general. If the <b>declared</b> <b>costs</b> of the agents are bounded by the cost of a socially optimal solution, we are able derive an improved approximation ratio of 3 m. For example, this condition is satisfied if the costs constitute a metric in the graphical matroid. Our mechanism iteratively extends a partial solution by adding feasible elements at random. As it turns out, this algorithm achieves the best possible approximation ratio if it is equipped with a distribution that is optimal for the allocation of a single task to multiple machines. This seems surprising given that matroids allow for much richer combinatorial structures than the assignment of a single job...|$|E

40|$|The {{institution}} of property rights, {{as an important}} category of constraints or restrictions on human behaviour, provides rules of competition, and delineates the social and legal relationship between a resource owner and the others throughout the world. Forms of ownership rights to resources affect the efficiency of their use. The consensus {{is that in a}} real world with significant transactions costs and scarce resources, private property right systems lead to more efficient resource allocation than the others do. Previous studies about economic implications of non-exclusive resources have focused on the problems of resource misallocations. A few studies also worked on the effects that alternate property rights structures have on the prices and variations in prices of non-exclusive resources. However, the economic analysis of property rights attribute of natural resources used as building materials, such as natural sand and wood, is still an unexplored research area. The objective of the whole research is to empirically verify Angello and Donnelley's (1975) property rights thesis, as reinterpreted by Lai (1993 a) and Lai and Yu (1995), that the variations in prices of non-exclusive resources are much greater than those under more exclusive ownership; and to identify, alternatively, the factors that might have affected ownership rights, inferred from changes in the variations in prices of the resources. In this thesis, published historical data of natural sand, Total <b>declared</b> <b>costs</b> of new buildings completed, Gross & Usable floor area, Gross value of construction work, and published government data of prices for selected buildings materials, namely Portland cement, sand, hardwood, and plywood, were used. The prices of captured and cultured shrimps, which are collected from super market and street market by the author, were also checked and used. These resources are subject to different degrees of access restrictions and, hence, are good candidates for testing the hypotheses. Basically, the hypotheses formulated in this research are strongly supported. The main findings are that the variations in prices of non-exclusive resources are greater than those of exclusive resources; for the same resource, the price ratios of exclusive resource and non-exclusive resource would fall over time. This is an original contribution to the theory of property rights. The originality of this dissertation lies in its exploration of the economic relationship between property rights ownership and selected building materials, {{as well as in the}} application of variances to the research of building materials.

40|$|Background: Opioid {{substitution}} therapy (OST) programs involve the dispensing of OST medicines to patients {{to address their}} dependence on heroin and/or other opioid substances. OST medicines are subsidised by the Australian government but patients need to pay the dispensing fees. This study explored opinions from OST patients and stakeholders about {{the potential impact of}} dispensing fees on compliance and OST program retention. Current and past experiences and the potential impact of OST dispensing fees were evaluated. Methods: Mixed methodology was used to obtain data from OST patients and stakeholders. This involved 1) interviews with OST stakeholders, 2) a focus group of OST patients and 3) surveys of OST patients in Perth, Australia, between June and August 2013. Results: The majority of the eight stakeholders <b>declared</b> <b>cost</b> as the factor mostly impacting on OST compliance. Almost all of the stakeholders commented that there was a positive correlation between time on the OST program and success in terms of relapse. Most stakeholders advocated for OST fees to contribute towards the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Safety Net, and for fee subsidy. Focus group themes supported stakeholder interview findings. A total of 138 surveys were completed. Survey analysis illustrated a strong correlation between patient debt and impacted lifestyle: 82. 4 % (p < 0. 001, Chi-square test) of the 138 survey participants stated that dispensing fees impacted significantly on patients’ finances and lifestyle, specifically those patients with major debt. The cost of dispensing fees was identified by 46. 3 % (64 / 138) of survey participants as the biggest impacting factor on patient success. Logistic regression models showed that the cost of dispensing fees was also found to significantly influence both the occurrence of debt (57. 7 %, p < 0. 0001) and lifestyle difficulties (80. 0 %, p = 0. 0004). Conclusion: Findings provided insight into OST patients’ financial difficulties with data suggesting that dispensing fees are likely to {{have a negative impact on}} OST patients’ compliance with therapy, retention in the OST program and lifestyle. Government sponsorship of the OST dispensing fees should be considered as sponsorship would potentially increase the retention rates of income-poor OST program recipients. Full Tex...|$|R
