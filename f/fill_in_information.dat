50|$|McLuhan {{developed}} an idea called {{hot and cold}} media. Hot media refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. Cool media describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>information</b> by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.|$|E

50|$|Neurologically {{the signs}} of {{interrupted}} or stopped speech can be suppressed in the thalamus and auditory cortex. It is currently thought to be done during top-down processing of the auditory system. Most speech {{is thought to be}} done through bottom-up processing which relies on using the data provided to process information. The typical route for a speech signal from the ear is to the auditory complex, where it is then processed through Wernicke's area to determine what is being said. Much is unknown about where in this process the brain is filling in the missing phoneme, but it is understood to {{be at the top of}} the language processing system. Phonemic restoration is one of several phenomenons proving that existing knowledge in the brain is able to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>information</b> that is not there, similar to an optical illusion. It is believed that humans evolved to be able to fill in phonemes that were absent in order to be able to communicate with other humans in noisy situations. It is not fully known at what point in the top-bottom processing the phonemic restoration effect occurs.|$|E

40|$|Comprehending {{language}} in context requires inferencing, {{particularly for the}} establishment of local coherence. In the neurolinguistic literature, an inference deficit after right hemisphere brain damage has been postulated, but clinical observation and imaging data suggest that left-frontal lesions might also result in inference deficits. In the present experiment, 25 nonaphasic patients performed a coherence judgment task requiring them to indicate a pragmatic connection between 2 successively presented sentences. Patients with left-temporal or right-frontal lesions performed the task well. In contrast, patients with left- and bifrontal lesions exhibited the most severe deficit. Both error rates and response times were elevated for coherent trials as compared with incoherent trials. These results confirm that the left-frontal lobe contributes to inference processes. Efficient communication is dependent on the listeners ’ or readers ’ ability to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>information</b> left implicit by the speaker or writer.

40|$|Robot assistants need to {{interact}} with people in a natural way {{in order to be}} accepted into people’s day-to-day lives. We have been researching robot assistants with capabilities that include visually tracking humans in the environment, identifying the context in which humans carry out their activities, understanding spoken language (with a fixed vocabulary), participating in spoken dialogs to resolve ambiguities, and learning task procedures. In this paper, we describe a robot task learning algorithm in which the human explicitly and interactively instructs a series of steps to the robot through spoken language. The training algorithm fuses the robot’s perception of the human with the understood speech data, maps the spoken language to robotic actions, and follows the human to gather the action applicability state information. The robot represents the acquired task as a conditional procedure and engages the human in a spoken-language dialog to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>information</b> that the human may have omitted. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to establish and analyze color Doppler and magnetic resonance fusion images of the heart, an approach for simultaneous testing of cardiac pathological alterations, performance, and hemodynamics. Ten volunteers were tested in this study. The echocardiographic images were produced by Philips IE 33 system and the magnetic resonance images were generated from Philips 3. 0 -T system. The fusion application was implemented on MATLAB platform utilizing image processing technology. The fusion image was generated from the following steps: (1) color Doppler blood flow segmentation, (2) image registration of color Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging, and (3) image fusion of different image types. The fusion images of color Doppler blood flow and magnetic resonance images were implemented by MATLAB programming in our laboratory. Images and videos were displayed and saved as AVI and JPG. The present study shows that the method we have developed can be used to fuse color flow Doppler and magnetic resonance images of the heart. We believe that the method has the potential to: <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>information</b> missing from the ultrasound or MRI alone, show structures outside the field of view of the ultrasound through MR imaging, and obtain complementary information through the fusion of the two imaging methods (structure from MRI and function from ultrasound) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the tectonic history of the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains is essential {{in order to develop}} better fault models for the two active faults bounding the range. In order to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the formation of the southern Sierra Nevada over the last 100 million years, I am using zircon fission track thermochronometry to constrain the exhumational history of the mountain range. Zircon fission track thermochronometry is used to constrain the time of rock cooling through ~ 250 ?C, which is equivalent to when the rocks were exhumed to a depth of ~ 8 km (at a geothermal gradient of ~ 30 ?C/km depth). Nine bedrock samples were collected from a NNW transect across the southern Sierra Nevadas. At 100 million years ago the Sierra Nevada Mountains were a string of volcanoes whose interior was filled with magma at 690 - 790 ? C. I hypothesize that by ~ 85 million years ago these rocks had cooled rapidly to less than 250 ? C (at mid-crustal levels) {{as a result of the}} shallow subduction of the Farallon plate. Previous studies in the area analyzed either the shallow crust, and therefore a more recent history, or the deep crust and therefore an older history. The new zircon fission track data will <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>information</b> for mid-crustal depths and help to better constrain the timing of major tectonic events...|$|E
