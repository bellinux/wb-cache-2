60|$|Further, I had no {{knowledge}} of evolution until I was at college, whereas in my childhood and youth I had already lived in my dreams all the details of that other, long-ago life. I will say, however, that these details were mixed and incoherent until I came to know the science of <b>evolution.</b> <b>Evolution</b> was the key. It gave the explanation, gave sanity to the pranks of this atavistic brain of mine that, modern and normal, harked back to a past so remote as to be contemporaneous with the raw beginnings of mankind.|$|E
50|$|While {{the term}} {{primarily}} refers to biological <b>evolution,</b> {{there are various}} types of chemical <b>evolution</b> {{and it is also}} found in economics, historical linguistics, and many other technical fields where systems develop or change gradually over time, e.g. stellar <b>evolution,</b> cultural <b>evolution,</b> the <b>evolution</b> of an idea, metaphysical <b>evolution,</b> spiritual <b>evolution,</b> etc.|$|R

50|$|The term is {{sometimes}} also colloquially {{used to refer}} to acceptance of the modern evolutionary synthesis, a scientific theory that describes how biological <b>evolution</b> occurs. In addition, the term is used in a broader sense to cover a world-view {{on a wide variety of}} topics, including chemical <b>evolution</b> as an alternative term for abiogenesis or for nucleosynthesis of chemical elements, galaxy formation and <b>evolution,</b> stellar <b>evolution,</b> spiritual <b>evolution,</b> technological <b>evolution</b> and universal <b>evolution,</b> which seeks to explain every aspect of the world in which we live.|$|R
60|$|The real {{safeguard}} {{against this}} is the dogma of Toleration. I need not here repeat the compact treatise on it which I prepared for the Joint Committee on the Censorship of Stage Plays, and prefixed to The Shewing Up of Blanco Posnet. It must suffice now {{to say that the}} present must not attempt to schoolmaster the future by pretending to know good from evil in tendency, or protect citizens against shocks to their opinions and convictions, moral, political or religious: in other words it must not persecute doctrines of any kind, or what is called bad taste, and must insist on all persons facing such shocks as they face frosty weather {{or any of the other}} disagreeable, dangerous, or bracing incidents of freedom. The expediency of Toleration has been forced on us by the fact that progressive enlightenment depends on a fair hearing for doctrines which at first appear seditious, blasphemous, and immoral, and which deeply shock people who never think originally, thought being with them merely a habit and an echo. The deeper ground for Toleration is the nature of creation, which, as we now know, proceeds by <b>evolution.</b> <b>Evolution</b> finds its way by experiment; and this finding of the way varies according to the stage of development reached, from the blindest groping along the line of least resistance to intellectual speculation, with its practical sequel of hypothesis and experimental verification; or to observation, induction, and deduction; or even into so rapid and intuitive an integration of all these processes in a single brain that we get the inspired guess of the man of genius and the desperate resolution of the teacher of new truths who is first slain as a blasphemous apostate and then worshipped as a prophet.|$|E
60|$|The reason was, I think, that Circumstantial Selection {{is easier}} to understand, more visible and concrete, than Lamarckian <b>evolution.</b> <b>Evolution</b> as a {{philosophy}} and physiology of the will is a mystical process, which can be apprehended only by a trained, apt, and comprehensive thinker. Though the phenomena of use and disuse, of wanting and trying, of the manufacture of weight lifters and wrestlers from men of ordinary strength, are familiar enough as facts, they are extremely puzzling as subjects of thought, and lead you into metaphysics the moment you try to account for them. But pigeon fanciers, dog fanciers, gardeners, stock breeders, or stud grooms, can understand Circumstantial Selection, because it is their business to produce transformation by imposing on flowers and animals a Selection From Without. All that Darwin had {{to say to them}} was that the mere chapter of accidents is always doing on a huge scale what they themselves are doing on a very small scale. There is hardly a laborer attached to an English country house who has not taken a litter of kittens or puppies to the bucket, and drowned all of them except the one he thinks the most promising. Such a man has nothing to learn about the survival of the fittest except that it acts in more ways than he has yet noticed; for he knows quite well, as you will find if you are not too proud to talk to him, that this sort of selection occurs naturally (in Darwin's sense) too: that, for instance, a hard winter will kill off a weakly child as the bucket kills off a weakly puppy. Then there is the farm laborer. Shakespear's Touchstone, a court-bred fool, was shocked to find in the shepherd a natural philosopher, and opined that he would be damned for the part he took in the sexual selection of sheep. As to the production of new species by the selection of variations, that is no news to your gardener. Now if you are familiar with these three processes: the survival of the fittest, sexual selection, and variation leading to new kinds, there is nothing to puzzle you in Darwinism.|$|E

50|$|Religious beliefs may prompt an {{individual}} to deny {{the validity of the}} scientific theory of <b>evolution.</b> <b>Evolution</b> is still considered an undisputed fact within the scientific community and in academia, where the level of support for evolution is essentially universal, yet this view is often met with opposition by biblical literalists. The alternative view is often presented as a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis's creation myth. Many fundamentalist Christians teach creationism as if it were fact under the banners of creation science and intelligent design. Beliefs that typically coincide with creationism include the belief in the global flood myth, geocentrism, and the belief that the Earth is only 6,000-10,000 years old. These beliefs are viewed as pseudoscience in the scientific community and are widely regarded as erroneous.|$|E

5000|$|He {{distinguished}} {{two major}} ways of understanding evolution. The {{first is the}} [...] "naturalistic" [...] way of understanding evolution as [...] "explicable entirely in terms of natural law without reference to a divine intention or intervention." [...] But a [...] "theistic" [...] understanding of evolution holds that [...] "there was a divine teleology in this process, a divine direction at each crucial stage in accordance with divine plan or intention." [...] In other words, a theistic understanding of evolution holds that although evolution occurred, God still directed <b>evolution.</b> <b>Evolution</b> is merely the tool of God's design. Evolution, and even the great struggle for existence that [...] "selects" [...] some animals to survive and others to die, is the instrument with which God designs human beings and other animals. On this view, Darwinian evolution {{is consistent with the}} belief that God, through evolution, produced human beings for a purpose. Other philosophers, such as Henri Bergson and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, have also argued that the process of evolution is not blind and random, but directed and purposeful.|$|E
