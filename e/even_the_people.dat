500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Elizabeth Smithgall Watts {{who taught}} {{anthropology}} at Tulane University {{said that the}} question of American Indians being a separate race from [...] "Asiatic Mongoloids" [...] is a question of how much genetic difference a population needs from another population to be considered a [...] "major race". She said that <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who consider American Indians to be a separate race acknowledge that they are genetically closest to [...] "Asians".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2003, labor {{historian}} Mel Dubofsky accused Philip Foner {{of having}} [...] "borrowed wholesale from my then unpublished dissertation" [...] on the Industrial Workers of the World {{for use in}} Volume 4 of his History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Dubofsky said that Foner extracted large chunks of this dissertation [...] "without attribution or inverted commas." [...] Dubofsky alleged that Foner had similarly used unpublished work of other young scholars [...] "too numerous to mention." [...] But Dubofsky also noted that many young labor historians in the 1970s felt that Foner had suffered enough in being blacklisted and were reluctant to take any official action against him. He said, [...] "So <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> whose work he had borrowed from freely {{did not want to}} say anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{story is}} about a student named , who discovers he is an immortal [...] "Ajin" [...] when he is hit by a truck. He is wanted by the {{government}} because the Ajin are considered dangerous inhuman beings and {{the only person who}} is there to support him is his childhood friend, Kaito. While the government claims to help Ajin live in a safe environment, they are actually using them as subjects for cruel and inhumane experimentation. [...] As a result, Ajins that have escaped are bent on revenge with the exception of Kei who wants no part in the Ajin conflict. [...] Kei is initially shown to lack empathy for others, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> closest to him, but as Sato's actions become even more extreme, he eventually joins the fight to stop Sato's violent campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of the Teach the Controversy {{movement}} and strategy {{can also be}} found outside of the scientific community. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, described the approach of the movement's proponents as [...] "a disarming subterfuge designed to undermine solid evidence that all living things share a common ancestry." [...] "The movement is a veneer over a certain theological message. Every one of these groups is now actively engaged in trying to undercut sound science education by criticizing evolution," [...] said Lynn. [...] "It is all based on their religious ideology. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who don't specifically mention religion are hard-pressed with a straight face to say who the intelligent designer is if it's not God." [...] Bill Maher said of Teach the Controversy, [...] "You don't have to teach both sides of a debate if one side is a load of crap." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arrows {{episode of}} the {{crossover}} is also the series' 100th. Guggenheim felt Berlanti [...] "came {{up with an idea}} that really does allow us to have our cake and eat it too" [...] in terms of respecting Arrow as a whole, while incorporating it into the crossover, adding [...] "It is a love letter to the show. It draws on all previous 99 episodes, pretty much. Everyone who we could have in the episode from a scheduling point of view is in the episode. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who we couldn't have because of conflicting schedules are represented." [...] At the end of The Flash episode, Oliver, Thea, Sara, Diggle, and Ray are captured by the Dominators and are held in a stasis, with their minds occupied in a [...] "shared hallucination", which allowed the writers [...] "to revisit footage from the previous 99 episodes" [...] in the memory flashes the characters experience.|$|E

2500|$|In Artemis Fowl, {{which is}} set two years after those events, the 12-year-old Artemis decides to regain the Fowl fortune by {{following}} leads on the Internet that refer to an underground world of fairies collectively called the People. Artemis manages to blackmail {{a member of the}} People into giving him what they call [...] "the Book" [...] which is like their Bible, holding all their secrets, customs, rules, and history. This leads him to ransom Lower Elements Police (LEP) Captain Holly Short for a portion of the People's gold. Artemis and Holly agree a deal whereby Holly retains half the ransom fee, while Artemis gets one wish from Holly and gets to keep {{the other half of the}} gold. After recovering Holly, the LEP attempt to permanently eliminate Artemis by setting off a biological weapon, but are thwarted when Artemis discovers a way around their attack (something not <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> had been able to develop).|$|E

60|$|Slowly the {{realisation}} came of {{the full}} meaning of these things to him, {{the perception of the}} swift change in his position.

60|$|And if I antagonize {{myself in}} this way to the philanthropic Socialism of kindly prosperous people {{on the one hand}} and to the fierce class-hatred Socialism on the other, still more am I opposed to that furtive Socialism of the {{specialist}} which one meets most typically in the Fabian Society. It arises very naturally out of what I may perhaps call specialist fatigue and impatience. It is very easy for writers like myself to deal in the broad generalities of Socialism and urge their adoption as general principles; it is altogether another affair with a man who sets himself to work out the riddle of the complications of actuality in order to modify them in the direction of Socialism. He finds himself in a jungle of difficulties that strain his intellectual power to the utmost. He emerges at last with conclusions, and they are rarely the obvious conclusions, as to what needs to be done. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of his own side he finds do not see as he sees; they are, he perceives, crude and ignorant.|$|E
6000|$|How Miss Sharp lay awake, thinking, will he come or not to-morrow? {{need not}} be told here. To-morrow came, and, as sure as fate, Mr. Joseph Sedley made his {{appearance}} before luncheon. He had never been known before to confer such an honour on Russell Square. George Osborne was somehow there already (sadly [...] "putting out" [...] Amelia, who was writing to her twelve dearest friends at Chiswick Mall), and Rebecca was employed upon her yesterday's work. As Joe's buggy drove up, and while, after his usual thundering knock and pompous bustle at the door, the ex-Collector of Boggley Wollah laboured up stairs to the drawing-room, knowing glances were telegraphed between Osborne and Miss Sedley, and the pair, smiling archly, looked at Rebecca, who actually blushed as she bent her fair ringlets over her knitting. How her heart beat as Joseph appeared--Joseph, puffing from the staircase in shining creaking boots--Joseph, in a new waistcoat, red with heat and nervousness, and blushing behind his wadded neckcloth. It was a nervous moment for all; and as for Amelia, I think she was more frightened than <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> most concerned.|$|E
60|$|The voyage from Panama to, {{the pearl}} islands {{was a long}} one, but far from unpleasant. Sixty days after leaving port the adventurers were safely landed, with all their effects.

With the natives of the pearl island, Bob, already known to them and a favourite, had no difficulty in negotiating. He had brought them suitable and ample presents, and soon effected an arrangement, by which they agreed to transport him and all his stores, the animals included, to Betto's Islands, a distance of fully three hundred miles. The horses and cows were taken on a species of catamaran, or large raft, that is much used in those mild seas, and which sail reasonably well a little off the wind, and not very badly on. At Betto's Islands a new bargain was struck, and the whole party proceeded to Rancocus Island, Bob making his land-fall without any difficulty, from having observed the course steered in coming from it.|$|E
