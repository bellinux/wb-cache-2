40|$|Abridged] We {{study the}} properties, {{evolution}} and formation mechanisms of isolated field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> We create a mock catalogue of isolated field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> from the Millennium Simulation Galaxy Catalogue, and trace their merging histories. The formation, identity and assembly redshifts of simulated isolated and non-isolated <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> are studied and compared. Observational and numerical data {{are used to}} compare age, mass, and the colour-magnitude relation. Our results, based on simulation data, show that almost seven per cent of all <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> brighter than - 19 mag in B-band can be classified as isolated field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Isolated field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> show bluer colours than non-isolated <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> and they appear younger, in a statistical sense, according to their mass weighted age. Isolated field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> also form and assemble at lower redshifts compared to non-isolated <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> About 46 per cent of isolated field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> have undergone {{at least one major}} merging event in their formation history, while the same fraction is only about 33 per cent for non-isolated ellipticals. The mean time of the last major merging is z = 0. 6 or 6 Gyrs ago for isolated ellipticals, while non-isolated ellipticals experience their last major merging significantly earlier at z = 1. 1 or 8 Gyrs ago. After inspecting merger trees of simulated isolated field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies,</b> we conclude that three different, yet typical formation mechanisms can be identified: solitude, coupling and cannibalism. Our results also predict a previously unobserved population of blue, dim and light galaxies that fulfill observational criteria to be classified as isolated field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> This separate population comprises about 26 per cent of all IfEs.

50|$|Dwarf <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> have blue {{absolute}} magnitudes {{within the}} range −18 mag < M < −14 mag, fainter than giant <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> While the surface brightness profiles of giant <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> are well described by de Vaucouleur's law, dEs have exponentially declining surface brightness profiles. However, both types can be well fit by the same more general law, Sersic's law, {{and there is a}} continuity of Sersic index as a function of luminosity, suggesting that dwarf and giant <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> belong to a single sequence. Still fainter elliptical-like galaxies, called dwarf spheroidal galaxies, appear to be genuinely distinct.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> outside dense {{clusters}} {{are observed}} to contain small amounts (relative to spiral galaxies) of cold interstellar gas. This review discusses the atomic gas, the molecular gas, {{and the dust}} in <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Field <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> contain about 0. 01 to 0. 1 of the cold interstellar matter content of spiral galaxies of similar luminosity, and support {{a low level of}} star formation. The surface densities of cold gas clouds in the centers of some <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> are comparable to those in the densest regions of the Galactic disk. These observations suggest that <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> in the field, like spiral galaxies, have a long-lived interstellar medium which evolves with the galaxy. The timescale for star formation, however, appears to be much shorter, leaving these systems with little gas at the present epoch. 1...|$|R
5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy</b> has the {{cross-sectional}} {{shape of an}} ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found {{at the core of}} galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Corvus {{contains}} no Messier objects. It has several galaxies and a planetary nebula observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus {{is home to}} a planetary nebula, NGC 4361.

5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy.</b> The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy.</b> However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} view of <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{has been}} that they formed in a single, rapid burst of star formation at high redshift, and have evolved quiescently since that time. In opposition to this traditional view is evidence {{that at least some}} <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> have formed from the merger of two disk galaxies. What has not been clear is which process is the dominant formation mechanism for the large majority of <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> This question has significant implications for cosmological models, as different models make different predictions for the formation mechanism and epoch of <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> 1. Here I use deep optical 2 and near-infrared 3 − 6 images to show that there are fewer galaxies with very red optical and near-infrared colors than predicted by models in which typical <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> have completed their star formation by z> ∼ 5. These observations require that <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> have significant star formation at z < 5. This requirement, combined with constraints on lower redshift starbursts from the modest ultraviolet luminosities of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field 7, 8 and the properties of galaxies from 0 < z < 1 (refs 9 - 13), suggests that <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> form at moderate redshift in dusty starbursts and/o...|$|R

50|$|Dwarf <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies,</b> or dEs, are <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{that are}} much smaller than others. They are {{classified}} as dE, and are quite common in galaxy groups and clusters, and are usually companions to other galaxies.|$|R
5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy</b> where the stars in the galaxy's halo are {{arranged}} in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy.</b> During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy.</b> This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{modified}} Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. The E0 designation {{is used for}} an <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy</b> that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A 'p' suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity denotes {{the presence of the}} jet emerging from the core. M87 is considered a type-cD galaxy, which is a supergiant D class galaxy. The latter category, first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958, is a galaxy that has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope.|$|E
50|$|The {{dynamical}} {{properties of}} <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> and the bulges of disk galaxies are similar,  suggesting {{that they may}} be formed by the same physical processes, although this remains controversial.

40|$|Using Chandra X-ray {{observations}} of young, post-merger <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies,</b> we present X-ray characteristics of age-related observational results, by comparing with typical old <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{in terms of}} metal abundances in the hot interstellar matter (ISM). While the absolute element abundances may be uncertain because of unknown systematic errors {{and partly because of}} the smaller amount of hot gas in young ellipticals, the relative abundance ratios (e. g., the alpha-element to Fe ratio, most importantly Si/Fe ratio) can be relatively well constrained. We find that in two young <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> (NGC 720 and NGC 3923) the Si to Fe abundance ratio is super-solar (at a 99 % significance level), in contrast to typical old <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> where the Si to Fe abundance ratio is close to solar. Also the O/Mg ratio is close to solar in the two young <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies,</b> as opposed to the sub-solar O/Mg ratio reported in old <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Both features appear to be less significant outside the effective radius (roughly 30 " for the galaxies under study), consistent with the observations that confine to the centermost regions the signatures of recent star formation in <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Observed differences between young and old <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{can be explained by the}} additional contribution from SNe II ejecta in the former. In young <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies,</b> the later star formation associated with recent mergers would have a dual effect, resulting both in galaxy scale winds - and therefore smaller observed amounts of hot ISM - because of the additional SNII heating, and in different metal abundances, because of the additional SNII yields.

It occurred {{at the center of}} a small <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy</b> at redshift z = 0.3534. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the explosion was the result of stellar collapse or a tidal disruption event accompanied by a relativistic jet, although the latter explanation has become widely favoured.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{determine}} relative stellar {{ages and}} metallicities mainly for about 80 <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> in {{low and high}} density environments via the latest binary stellar population (BSP) synthesis model and test a latest hierarchical formation model of <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> which adopted the new ΛCDM cosmology for the first time.

40|$|Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{observations}} {{reveal that}} the density of stars in most <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> rises toward the center in a power-law cusp. Many of these galaxies also contain central dark objects, possibly supermassive black holes. The gravitational force from a steep cusp or black hole will destroy most of the box orbits that constitute the “backbone ” of a triaxial stellar system. Detailed modelling demonstrates that the resulting chaos can preclude a self-consistent, strongly triaxial equilibrium. Most <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> may therefore be nearly axisymmetric, either oblate or prolate. Information about the three-dimensional shape of a galaxy is lost when the galaxy is projected onto {{the plane of the}} sky.

5|$|At {{the extreme}} of {{interactions}} are galactic mergers. In {{this case the}} relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, {{as compared to the}} original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart.

IC 4808 is a galaxy of apparent magnitude 12.9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3.9 degrees west-southwest of Beta Sagittarii. However, amateur telescopes will only show a suggestion of its spiral structure. It is 1.9 arcminutes by 0.8 arcminutes.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{a large number}} of <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> and found a {{correlation}} between their dark matter content and the ellipticity of their visible shape. The galaxies were strictly selected so that only typical medium-size <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> were considered. Galaxies with unusual characteristics were rejected to minimize point-to-point data scatter and avoid systematic biases. Data from six different techniques of extracting the galactic dark matter content were used to avoid methodological biases. A thorough investigation of the interrelation between attributes of <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> was carried out to assess whether the correlation originates from an observational bias, but no such origin could be identified. At face value, the correlation found implies that at equal luminosities, rounder medium-size <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> appear to contain less dark matter than flatter <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies,</b> e. g. the rounder galaxies are on average four times less massive than the flatter ones.

First thought to be a single overluminous radio galaxy with a redshift of z=1.206, it was found in 1987 to actually be two galaxies, with the radio galaxy at the aforementioned redshift being lensed by another galaxy at redshift z=0.845. The first example of a multiply-imaged radio galaxy discovered, the source appears to be an <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy</b> with a dust lane obscuring our view of the visual and ultraviolet emission from the nucleus. In even shorter wavelengths, the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 is a heavy emitter of gamma rays. This object is the most distant found to emit photons with energies in the TeV range as of 2007. The spectrum is unique, with hard emission in some ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum in stark contrast to soft emission in others.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} galaxies that lie near it. M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf spheroidal galaxy or simply a generic <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy.</b> It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|The Coma Supercluster, itself {{part of the}} Coma Filament, {{contains}} the Coma and Leo Cluster of galaxies. The Coma Cluster (Abell 1656) is 230 to 300 million light-years away. It {{is one of the}} largest known clusters, with at least 10,000 galaxies (mainly elliptical, with a few spiral galaxies). Due to its distance from Earth, most of the galaxies are visible only through large telescopes. Its brightest members are NGC 4874 and NGC 4889, both with a magnitude of 13; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer. NGC 4889 is a giant <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxy</b> with one of the largest known black holes (21 billion solar masses), and NGC 4921 is the cluster's brightest spiral galaxy. After observing the Coma Cluster, astronomer Fritz Zwicky first postulated the existence of dark matter during the 1930s. The massive galaxy Dragonfly 44 discovered in 2015 was found to consist almost entirely of dark matter. Its mass is very similar to that of the Milky Way, but it emits only 1% of the light emitted by the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Lenticular galaxies share {{kinematic}} properties {{with both}} spiral and <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b> This {{is due to}} the significant bulge and disk nature of lenticulars. The bulge component is similar to <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> in that it is pressure supported by a central velocity dispersion. This situation is analogous to a balloon, where the motions of the air particles (stars in a bulge's case) are dominated by random motions. However, the kinematics of lenticular galaxies are dominated by the rotationally supported disk. Rotation support implies the average circular motion of stars in the disk is responsible for the stability of the galaxy. Thus kinematics are often used to distinguish lenticular <b>galaxies</b> from <b>elliptical</b> or spiral <b>galaxies.</b> The distinction between spiral galaxies and lenticular galaxies is often simpler to analyze as the dividing line is often set at a particular bulge-to-disk ratio. Determining the distinction between <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> and lenticular galaxies often relies on the measurements of velocity dispersion (σ), rotational velocity (v), and ellipticity (ε). In order to differentiate between lenticulars and ellipticals, one typically looks at the v/σ ratio for a fixed ε. For example, a rough criterion for distinguishing between lenticular and <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> is that <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> have v/σ < 0.5 for ε = 0.3. The motivation behind this criterion is that lenticular galaxies do have prominent bulge and disk components whereas <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies</b> have no disk structure. Thus, lenticulars have much larger v/σ ratios than ellipticals due to their non-negligible rotational velocities (due to the disk component) in addition to not having as prominent of a bulge component compared to <b>elliptical</b> <b>galaxies.</b>|$|R
