5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's {{high level of}} {{difficulty}} compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in <b>DIP</b> <b>switches.</b> One life is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E

50|$|<b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> {{were used}} {{extensively}} in ISA architecture of PC expansion cards to select IRQs and memory addresses. Before {{the advent of}} cheaper, battery-backed RAM, <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> were also often used on arcade games in the 1980s and early 1990s to enter game settings such as difficulty {{or the number of}} credits per coin. <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> were very commonly used to set security codes on garage door openers as well as on some early cordless phones. This design, which used up to 12 switches in a group, was used to avoid RF interference from other nearby door opener remotes or other devices. Current garage door openers use rolling code systems for better security.|$|E

50|$|<b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> {{are still}} {{used in some}} remote {{controls}} to prevent interference; for example, to control a ceiling fan (and its light fixture) that was retrofitted to a single-circuit junction box. The <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> set a different radio frequency for each transmitter/receiver pair, so that multiple units can be installed in different rooms of the same house, or different units of the same apartment building, without unintentionally controlling each other.|$|E

50|$|Recently (since {{the late}} 1990s), <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> have become less common in {{consumer}} electronics. Reasons include {{the trend toward}} smaller products, the demand for easier configuration through software menus, and the falling price of non-volatile memory. However, <b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> are still widely used in industrial equipment because they are inexpensive and easy to incorporate into circuit designs, and because they allow settings to be checked at a glance without powering the system on.|$|E
50|$|While Single-Player mode {{comprises}} {{between one}} and seven games, Two-Player mode consists of a single head-to-head game between two human players. While the length of Single-Player games is fixed by <b>dip</b> <b>switches,</b> the length of Two-Player games is determined by <b>dip</b> <b>switches</b> but also the number of credits the players buy. (Initial game time and time per extra credit are set independently through PCB <b>dip</b> <b>switches.)</b> Typical Two-Player game time is typically {{on the order of}} 5 minutes, but can be as little as 1-2 minutes. As the upper limit is based on pay-per-play, there is no upper limit although games longer than 30 minutes are uncommon. As with other games such as Gauntlet, upon reaching zero time the machine prompts players to insert additional credit(s), giving them the option of prolonging the current game.|$|E
50|$|<b>DIP</b> <b>switches</b> are an {{alternative}} to jumper blocks. Their main advantages are that they are quicker to change {{and there are no}} parts to lose.|$|E
50|$|The <b>DIP</b> <b>switch</b> with sliding levers {{was granted}} US Patent 4012608 in 1976. It {{was applied for}} 1974 and was used in 1977 in an ATARI Flipper game.|$|R

50|$|The SX was {{the first}} Tandy 1000 in which the {{built-in}} TGA video circuitry could be disabled via <b>DIP</b> <b>switch.</b> This was to permit the installation of an EGA or VGA video card in an expansion slot.|$|R
50|$|The Player 1 (red trackball) side {{contains}} two additional push-buttons for choosing between Single or Two-Player games. Although fixed via <b>dip</b> <b>switch</b> settings, Single-Player games typically cost one credit while Two-Player games cost {{two or more}} credits.|$|R
