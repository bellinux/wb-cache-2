25|$|The {{ornithology}} collection {{dates to}} the first collections in the Museu Paulista, with its first known specimens collected during the late 19th century. During this first phase, the collection was curated by zoologist Hermann von Ihering and expeditions were conducted which generated knowledge of the Brazilian avifauna's diversity. Traveling naturalists associated with the museum explored remote areas (including Juruá in 1902 and other regions of Brazil) and collected specimens. After Ihering's departure in 1916, <b>field</b> <b>activity</b> associated with the ornithological collection decreased. After 1929, under the curatorship of zoologist Olivério Pinto, activity increased; surveys were conducted in all biomes, {{in a number of}} locations. Benefiting from the activity of Ecuadorian collector A. Martins Olalla, the ornithology collection became the largest and most-complete Brazilian collection of its kind. Under Pinto's many scientific works were published, including Brazilian bird catalogs and the unfinished Ornithologia brasiliense.|$|E
40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>activities</b> are {{valuable}} geology teaching resources. However, their effective educational value {{depends on the}} way teachers use them which in turn depends on teachers’ conceptions. This research focused on comparing how 102 low secondary school teachers and 131 secondary school teachers deal with <b>field</b> <b>activities</b> in geology teaching. The results show that, opposite to {{what happens in the}} secondary school, the majority of low secondary school teachers do not use <b>field</b> <b>activities.</b> The majority of <b>field</b> <b>activities</b> users promote less than four activities per year and most of them do not seem to have an appropriate understanding of how <b>field</b> <b>activities</b> should be used to become a valuable educational resource. Besides, teachers do not trust too much students’ ability to play an active role as learners, as they argue for teacher centred activities, {{based on the idea that}} students are not able to carry out the activity or that it is teachers’ responsibility to undertake it. However, the majority of <b>field</b> <b>activities</b> users feel satisfied or even completely satisfied with the way they have been dealing with <b>field</b> <b>activities.</b> This means that teachers’ conceptions and practices need to be improved...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a model for}} improving the Operations and Maintenance Navy budget execution function at Naval <b>field</b> <b>activities</b> ashore. The model utilizes five techniques to encourage five concepts shown to be critical for effective budget execution. Following {{a description of the}} current extent to which <b>field</b> <b>activities</b> implement these concepts, the model is presented within the framework of its development and pre- testing in academia. Development of questionnaires for testing the model at five Naval <b>field</b> <b>activities</b> in California and the test results are also presented. Over 60 cost center managers from five test commands responded to the questionnaires and rated the model as yielding potential benefits over their current procedures. The respondents rated the model as having "moderate" acceptability and "good" applicability. Based on the test results, widespread promulgation of the model is recommended within the U. S.
