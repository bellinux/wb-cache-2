25|$|In Newtonian mechanics, two {{extreme cases}} {{of this problem}} may be {{distinguished}} yielding mathematics of minimum complexity: (1) The two bodies rebound {{from each other in}} a completely elastic collision. (2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision.</b> For both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision.</b> A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.|$|E

25|$|By itself, {{the law of}} {{conservation}} of momentum {{is not enough to}} determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, kinetic energy, must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an elastic collision; if not, it is an <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision.</b>|$|E
25|$|In an <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision,</b> {{some of the}} {{kinetic energy}} of the colliding bodies is {{converted}} into other forms of energy (such as heat or sound).

50|$|The {{distribution}} of neutron energies {{in a nuclear}} reactor differs from the fission neutron spectrum due to the slowing down of neutrons in elastic and <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions</b> with fuel, coolant and construction material.

25|$|In 1669, Christian Huygens {{published}} his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant {{before and after}} the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision</b> was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his Horologium Oscillatorium, he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the grid}} voltage reaches 4.9 V, {{electron}} collisions near the grid become inelastic, and the electrons are greatly slowed. The kinetic {{energy of a}} typical electron arriving at the grid is reduced {{so much that it}} cannot travel further to reach the anode, whose voltage is set to slightly repel electrons. The current of electrons reaching the anode falls, as seen in the graph. Further increases in the grid voltage restore enough energy to the electrons that suffered inelastic collisions that they can again reach the anode. The current rises again as the grid potential rises beyond 4.9 V. [...] At 9.8 V, the situation changes again. [...] Electrons that have traveled roughly halfway from the cathode to the grid have already acquired enough energy to suffer a first <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision.</b> As they continue slowly towards the grid from the midway point, their kinetic energy builds up again, but as they reach the grid they can suffer a second <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision.</b> Once again, the current to the anode drops. [...] At intervals of 4.9 volts this process will repeat; each time the electrons will undergo one additional <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractExistence, {{uniqueness}} {{and qualitative}} {{behavior of the}} solution to a spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for particles undergoing elastic, <b>inelastic</b> and coalescing <b>collisions</b> are studied. Under general assumptions on the collision rates, we prove existence and uniqueness of an L 1 solution. This shows in particular that the cooling effect (due to <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions)</b> does not occur in finite time. In the long time asymptotic, we prove that the solution converges to a mass-dependent Maxwellian function (when only elastic collisions are considered), to a velocity Dirac mass (when elastic and <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions</b> are considered) and to 0 (when elastic, <b>inelastic</b> and coalescing <b>collisions</b> are taken into account). We thus show {{in the latter case}} that the effect of coalescence is dominating in large time. Our proofs gather deterministic and stochastic arguments...|$|R

The four-momentum is, as expected, a conserved quantity.

2500|$|Conservation of {{momentum}} in the COM frame amounts to the requirement that p=0 {{both before and after}} collision. In the Newtonian analysis, conservation of mass dictates that [...] In the simplified, one-dimensional scenarios that we have been considering, only one additional constraint is necessary before the outgoing momenta of the particles can be determinedan energy condition. In the one-dimensional case of a completely elastic collision with no loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles in the COM frame will be precisely equal and opposite to their incoming velocities. In the case of a completely <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision</b> with total loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles will be zero.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recorded}} He diffraction experiment {{was completed in}} 1930 by Estermann and Stern [...] on the (100) crystal face of lithium fluoride. [...] This experimentally established the feasibility of atom diffraction when the de Broglie wavelength, λ, of the impinging atoms is {{on the order of}} the interatomic spacing of the material. [...] At the time, the major limit to the experimental resolution of this method was due to the large velocity spread of the helium beam. [...] It wasn't until the development of high pressure nozzle sources capable of producing intense and strongly monochromatic beams in the 1970s that HAS gained popularity for probing surface structure. [...] Interest in studying the collision of rarefied gases with solid surfaces was helped by a connection with aeronautics and space problems of the time. [...] Plenty of studies showing the fine structures in the diffraction pattern of materials using helium atom scattering were published in the 1970s. [...] However, it wasn't until a third generation of nozzle beam sources was developed, around 1980, that studies of surface phonons could be made by helium atom scattering. [...] These nozzle beam sources were capable of producing helium atom beams with an energy resolution of less than 1meV, making it possible to explicitly resolve the very small energy changes resulting from the <b>inelastic</b> <b>collision</b> of a helium atom with the vibrational modes of a solid surface, so HAS could now be used to probe lattice dynamics.

Number densities and rotational populations of uncondensed H 2 O+He jets have been measured by Raman spec-troscopy.

40|$|SUMMARY The Bethe-Bloch {{stopping}} power relations for <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions</b> {{have been used}} to determine the absorption of electron and proton energy for models of graphite, epoxy, and graphite/epoxy composites. Electron energies from 0. 2 to 4. 0 MeV and proton energies from 0. 3 to 1. 75 MeV, the energies that exist in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), were used. Absorption profiles due to <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions</b> for monoenergetic electrons were determined for cured neat epoxy resin, pure graphite, and graphite/epoxy composites. Electron energy losses due to bremsstrahlung were determined from these values. The absorption profiles due to <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions</b> for monoenergetic protons were determined only for the cured epoxy resin. Finally, the dose-depth profiles in a cured epoxy resin were determined for an environment of distributed electron and pro-ton energies that closely approximated the energy distribution in GEO. The absorption profiles for monoenergetic particles showed that the protons did not penetrate deeper than 0. 005 cm. They were absorbed at the surface o...|$|R
40|$|Some {{dynamical}} {{properties for}} a dissipative time-dependent oval-shaped billiard are studied. The system {{is described in}} terms of a four-dimensional nonlinear mapping. Dissipation is introduced via <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions</b> of the particle with the boundary, thus implying that the particle has a fractional loss of energy upon collision. The dissipation causes profound modifications in the dynamics of the particle {{as well as in the}} phase space of the non dissipative system. In particular, <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions</b> can be assumed as an efficient mechanism to suppress Fermi acceleration of the particle. The dissipation also creates attractors in the system, including chaotic. We show that a slightly modification of the intensity of the damping coefficient yields a drastic and sudden destruction of the chaotic attractor, thus leading the system to experience a boundary crisis. We have characterized such a boundary crisis via a collision of the chaotic attractor with its own basin of attraction and confirmed that <b>inelastic</b> <b>collisions</b> do indeed suppress Fermi acceleration in two-dimensional time dependent billiards...|$|R
