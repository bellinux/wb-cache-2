5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} forecast further intensification to 60mph (95km/h), {{although the}} agency {{also noted that}} the circulation could dissipate, due its <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> motion toward the east-northeast. Ultimately, wind shear prohibited significant strengthening, and Leslie attained peak winds of 45mph (70km/h). The storm interacted with an approaching cold front and became extratropical on October7, 375mi (600km) north of Bermuda. It accelerated to the northeast and passed over Newfoundland on October8. The remnants of Leslie turned to the east, then southeast, strengthening to near-hurricane-force winds before losing its identity near Ireland on October10.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} six hours, Urmil underwent explosive deepening {{as the main}} feeder band wrapped around the center of circulation. After the brief period of intensification, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 110km/h (70mph) according to both the RSMC Nadi and the JTWC, making it a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale. The highly favorable environment, {{in combination with the}} <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> motion of the storm, allowed Urmil to rapidly reach its peak intensity, despite wind shear reaching 35km/h (25mph). However, as quickly as the storm strengthened, it began to weaken as convection weakened. With both wind shear and forward motion increasing, the cyclone quickly became disorganized. Around 0000UTC on January15, the center of circulation was devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. About six hours later, Urmil transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was subsequently absorbed into the mid-latitude westerlies.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward,</b> by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Juan {{remained}} at peak intensity for over 24hours. After moving northwestward {{for an extended}} period of time, it turned and accelerated to the north. The eye became less distinct on September28, and the hurricane weakened slightly. Due to its <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> motion, Juan had little time to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect (near Halifax) on September29 with winds of 100mph (160km/h). It weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern Canadian Maritimes and crossing the Nova Scotia peninsula as a hurricane. Juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over Prince Edward Island by early September29. Later that afternoon, the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and <b>fast</b> <b>forward.</b> At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Bonnie {{was a small}} {{tropical}} storm that made landfall on Florida in August 2004. The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie developed from a tropical wave on August 3 {{to the east of}} the Lesser Antilles. After moving through the islands, its <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> motion caused it to dissipate. However, it later regenerated into a {{tropical storm}} near the Yucatán Peninsula. Bonnie attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) over the Gulf of Mexico, turned to the northeast, and hit Florida as a 45mph (75km/h) tropical storm. The storm accelerated to the northeast and became an extratropical cyclone to the east of New Jersey. Bonnie was the first of five tropical systems to make landfall on Florida in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second of a record eight disturbances to reach tropical storm strength during the month of August.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Cloud tops {{around the}} center warmed again early on September 15, and Isabel {{weakened}} to a Category 4 hurricane. Later that day, the inner core of deep convection began to deteriorate while the eye decayed in appearance. As a ridge to its northwest build southeastward, {{it resulted in}} Isabel decelerating as it turned to the north-northwest. Increasing vertical wind shear contributed in weakening the hurricane further, and Isabel weakened to a Category2 hurricane on September 16 while located 645miles (1035km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Convection remained minimal, though outflow retained excellent organization, and Isabel remained a Category2 hurricane for twodays, until it made landfall between Cape Lookout and Ocracoke Island on September 18, with winds of 105mph (165km/h). It weakened after it made landfall, though due to its <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> motion, Isabel remained a hurricane until it reached western Virginia, early on September 19. After passing through West Virginia as a tropical storm, Isabel became extratropical over Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The system crossed Lake Erie into Canada. Early on September 20, the extratropial remnant of Isabel was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm, over the Cochrane District of Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Despite the storm's {{intensification}} and well-organized satellite appearance, {{the circulation}} failed {{to become better}} defined. In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned {{the potential for the}} system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> speed. One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south. Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23mi (37km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October6. Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic, and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development. After Iris reached winds of 85mph (140km/h) early on October7, its intensity remained steady for about 24hours. During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low. By late on October7, the area of hurricaneforce winds associated with Iris extended only 25mi (35km) from its 16mi (22km) wide eye.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} to shipping in Halifax Harbour. A visiting recreational schooner named Larinda was sunk at the wharf beside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and a harbour tour ketch Mar was driven ashore in Eastern Passage {{on the opposite}} side of Halifax Harbour. Another harbour tour vessel, the tern schooner Silva, broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the Cable Wharf on the Halifax Waterfront. Dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm. Dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the South End Container Terminal. Wharves on the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the Dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the Bedford Basin near Millview. Coastal flooding was also reported around Halifax Harbour as a result of the storm surge, although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to Juan's <b>fast</b> <b>forward</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> {{is a task}} that, once completed, {{allows the}} team that completes it to bypass all {{remaining}} tasks in the leg and proceed directly to the Pit Stop. The <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> clue is given with another task clue (usually a Roadblock or Detour) and is a separate task from the others. Only one team may complete a <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> in any given leg, and a team may only complete one <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> in the entire Race. The exception to this rule is in seasons wherein the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> is offered {{in conjunction with the}} Intersection, in which case a team may win the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> both as an individual team and as a team working with another as part of the Intersection instructions. Teams that win the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> are not guaranteed a first-place finish for that leg and still face elimination if they arrive at the Pit Stop last. Multiple teams may undertake <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> tasks, but only the first team to complete the task gets credit. If a team fails to get the <b>Fast</b> <b>Forward</b> (either by quitting the task or being beaten to it), they must return and complete the leg as normal.

40|$|In {{the early}} days of quantum mechanics, it was {{believed}} that the time energy uncertainty principle (TEUP) bounds the efficiency of energy measurements, relating the duration (Δ t) of the measurement, and its accuracy error (Δ E) by Δ tΔ E > 1 / 2. In 1961 Y. Aharonov and Bohm gave a counterexample, whereas Aharonov, Massar and Popescu [2002] showed that under certain conditions the principle holds. Can we classify when and to what extent the TEUP is violated? Our main theorem asserts that such violations are in one to one correspondence with the ability to "fast forward" the associated Hamiltonian, namely, to simulate its evolution for time t using much less than t quantum gates. This intriguingly links precision measurements with quantum algorithms. Our theorem is stated in terms of a modified TEUP, which we call the computational TEUP (cTEUP). In this principle the time duration (Δ t) is replaced by the number of quantum gates required to perform the measurement, and we argue why this is more suitable to study if one is to understand the totality of physical resources required to perform an accurate measurement. The inspiration for this result is a family of Hamiltonians we construct, based on Shor's algorithm, which exponentially violate the cTEUP (and the TEUP), thus allowing exponential <b>fast</b> <b>forwarding.</b> We further show that commuting local Hamiltonians and quadratic Hamiltonians of fermions (e. g., Anderson localization model), can be <b>fast</b> <b>forwarded.</b> The work raises the question of finding a physical criterion for <b>fast</b> <b>forwarding,</b> in particular, can many body localization systems be <b>fast</b> <b>forwarded?</b> We rule out a general fast-forwarding method for all physically realizable Hamiltonians (unless BQP=PSPACE).
