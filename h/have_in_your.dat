Sport shooters load to make the shooting sports more affordable and hunters load to obtain greater accuracy. Powder and primers are strictly controlled by law and can not exceed for 2kg for powder and 2400 primers. The amount of ammunition you may <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> possession is also limited to 200 rounds per chambering. If you are a registered dedicated sportsman, the quantities are unlimited. Although the powder's quantity is unlimited if you are a dedicated sportsman, storage of excess amounts of powder is dangerous due to the potential of fire occurring from accidental ignition. A manual from a South African powder manufacturer Rheinmetall Denel Munition (previously Somchem) is available for reloaders with adequate information and guidelines.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} PR Newswire praised the album, {{describing}} it as [...] "showcasing" [...] Jackson's vocal talent and viewed The Stripped Mixes as shining a [...] "bright, fresh light" [...] on Jackson's early career {{as both a}} solo artist and with his brothers in The Jackson 5. Natalie Salvo of TheDwarf.com.au commented that the mix of [...] "Ain't No Sunshine" [...] made the album [...] "personally" [...] worth buying. She added that [...] "the music does what it's supposed to do", which was [...] "evoking the right mood but not being overly showy." [...] Despite the praise, she did state that the album could be clinically looked at as an [...] "element of bad taste" [...] from a [...] "greedy record company" [...] and noted that it was [...] "difficult" [...] to [...] "stop yourself being overcome with cynicism towards this album". Jeff Dorgay of Tone Publications described all of the album's tracks as being [...] "quite strong" [...] and added that [...] "regardless of your interest in Michael Jackson" [...] The Stripped Mixes is a disc [...] "you should <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> collection" [...] because it offers a [...] "rare look" [...] at [...] "classic" [...] material by Jackson {{when he was just}} beginning his career.|$|E
500|$|Stanaway {{said that}} it felt quite [...] "surreal" [...] that he had won in Monaco {{and that it was}} the ideal place to secure his first victory in the series. He stated that the series was still new to him and it was a [...] "fantastic feeling" [...] that he {{achieved}} success in his third race weekend. He hoped that he would improve as the season progressed. His team's managing director David Kennedy stated that it was [...] "the best result that you can <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> maiden GP2 season" [...] and praised Stanaway for demonstrating his speed and talent. Marciello said that his second-place result would serve to bring positive motivation for his team but that they needed reminding that the result came during the shorter sprint race and hoped that they would secure a podium finish in Austria's feature event. Sirotkin said that his sprint race went better than the previous day's longer feature event as he felt that he should have a secured a podium finish in that race. The driver stated that the first podium of his GP2 Series career in Monaco was [...] "a great feeling" [...] but stated he should have been battling for a podium position in the season's first two rounds.|$|E

500|$|Because Witherspoon's {{father worked}} for the U.S. {{military}} in Wiesbaden, Germany, she lived there for four years as a child. After returning to the U.S., she spent her childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. Witherspoon was raised as an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the [...] "definitive Southern upbringing" [...] which she received. She said that it gave her [...] "a sense of family and tradition" [...] and taught her about [...] "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what you <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life." [...] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected {{as a model for}} a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons. At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. Witherspoon received high grades in school, loved reading, and considered herself [...] "a big dork who read loads of books." [...] On mentioning her love for books, she said, [...] "I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything." [...] She {{has been described as a}} [...] "multi-achiever" [...] and was given the nickname [...] "Little Type A" [...] by her parents. Witherspoon attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader. She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major, [...] but left the school prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.|$|E
2500|$|... "The record {{contains}} {{a lot of}} story and beauty, and it does transcend some of the shame that gets attached {{to some of the}} music even during the season," [...] noted Amos. There's a side to the record when you listen to it that talks about what is the gold– what really is that? It's valuing whom you <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> life, the relationships you’ve built. It’s not just about success– or it just isn’t all your material possessions anymore– it’s how you live your life, and that’s all included in the music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya {{taught that}} the words of [...] "You shall do no unrighteousness in {{judgment}}," [...] apply to judgment in law. But a Midrash noted that [...] already mentioned judgment in law, and questioned why [...] would state the same proposition again and why [...] uses the words, [...] "in judgment, in measures." [...] The Midrash deduced that [...] teaches {{that a person who}} measures is called a judge, and one who falsifies measurements is called by the five names [...] "unrighteous," [...] "hated," [...] "repulsive," [...] "accursed," [...] and an [...] "abomination," [...] and is the cause of these five evils. Rabbi Banya said in the name of Rav Huna that the government comes and attacks that generation whose measures are false. The Midrash found support for this from [...] "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord," [...] which is followed by [...] "When presumption comes, then comes shame." [...] Reading [...] "Shall I be pure with wicked balances?" [...] Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Abba that it is impossible for a generation whose measures are false to be meritorious, for [...] continues, [...] "And with a bag of deceitful weights" [...] (showing that their holdings would be merely illusory). Rabbi Levi taught that Moses also hinted to Israel that a generation with false measures would be attacked. [...] warns, [...] "You shall not <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> bag diverse weights [...] [...] [...] you shall not <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> house diverse measures." [...] But if one does, one will be attacked, as [...] reports, [...] "For all who do such things, even all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to the Lord your God," [...] and then immediately following, [...] says, [...] "Remember what Amalek did to you (attacking Israel) by the way as you came forth out of Egypt." ...|$|E

That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is {{at the other end of}} that line. We used to do that with him so often.
