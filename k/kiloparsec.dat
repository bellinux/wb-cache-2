5|$|Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, {{is a large}} {{disk-shaped}} barred-spiral galaxy about 30kiloparsecs {{in diameter}} and a <b>kiloparsec</b> thick. It contains about two hundred billion (2×1011) stars and has a total mass of about six hundred billion (6×1011) times {{the mass of the}} Sun.|$|E
25|$|In {{the solar}} neighborhood, {{the rate of}} {{interstellar}} extinction in the Johnson-Cousins V-band is usually taken to be 0.7-1.0 mag/kpc−simply an average due to the clumpiness of interstellar dust. In general, however, this means that a star will have its brightness reduced by about a factor of 2 in the V-band for every <b>kiloparsec</b> it is farther away from us.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, {{extinction}} is {{the absorption}} and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by dust and gas between an emitting astronomical object and the observer. Interstellar extinction was first documented as such in 1930 by Robert Julius Trumpler. However, its effects had been noted in 1847 by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, {{and its effect}} on the colors of stars had been observed by a number of individuals who did not connect it with the general presence of galactic dust. For stars that lie near the plane of the Milky Way and are within a few thousand parsecs of the Earth, extinction in the visual band of frequencies (photometric system) is on the order of 1.8magnitudes per <b>kiloparsec.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} is uncertain, with estimates between 3.5 <b>kiloparsecs</b> (11,410 lightyears) and 6.9 <b>kiloparsecs</b> (22,500 light years). Assuming {{a distance of}} 4.8 <b>kiloparsecs</b> (15,600 light-years), this star is calculated to be 280,000 times brighter than our Sun, 16 times more massive, and 1.41 times larger with a surface temperature of 112,000 kelvins.|$|R

[...] The distance has been estimated at 2.5 <b>kiloparsecs</b> (8,200 light years) {{based on the assumption}} of an absolute magnitude of -8.9. However this distance is uncertain and values between 1.9 <b>kiloparsecs</b> and 3.5 <b>kiloparsecs</b> have been proposed.|$|R
50|$|Seen in the infrared, NGC 5746 {{also shows}} two pseudobulges, one nested within the other - that coincides with its central bar - {{as well as}} an inner ring with a radius of 9.1 <b>kiloparsecs</b> and a width of 1.6 <b>kiloparsecs.</b>|$|R
500|$|One {{important}} elemental {{ratio is}} that of , {{one of the factors}} determining the propensity of a region of the galaxy to produce terrestrial planets. The galactic bulge, the region of the galaxy closest to the galactic center, has an [...] distribution peaking at −0.2 decimal exponent units (dex) relative to the Sun's ratio; the thin disk, where the Sun is located, has an average metallicity of −0.02 dex at the orbital distance of the Sun around the galactic center, reducing by 0.07 dex for every additional <b>kiloparsec</b> of orbital distance. The extended thick disk has an average [...] of −0.6 dex, while the halo, the region farthest from the galactic center, has the lowest [...] distribution peak, at around −1.5 dex. In addition, ratios such as , , , and [...] may be relevant to the ability of a region of a galaxy to form habitable terrestrial planets, and of these [...] and [...] are slowly reducing over time, meaning that future terrestrial planets are more likely to possess larger iron cores.|$|E
2500|$|Distances {{expressed}} in parsecs (pc) include distances between nearby stars, {{such as those}} in the same spiral arm or globular cluster. A distance of 1000 parsecs (3262 light-years) is commonly denoted by the <b>kiloparsec</b> (kpc). Astronomers typically use kiloparsecs to express distances between parts of a galaxy, or within groups of galaxies. So, for example: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{explanation}} is that the interstellar medium is optically thin. Starlight traveling through a <b>kiloparsec</b> column undergoes about a magnitude of extinction, so that the optical depth ~ 1. An optical depth of 1 corresponds to a mean free path, which is the distance, on average that a photon travels before scattering from a dust grain. So on average, a starlight photon is scattered from a single interstellar grain; multiple scattering (which produces circular polarization) is much less likely. [...] Observationally, the linear polarization fraction p ~ 0.015 [...] from a single scattering; circular polarization from multiple scattering goes as , so we expect a circularly polarized fraction of [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{extinction}} {{value for}} HM 1 is calculated to be EB&minus;V = 1.85 magnitudes, and its distance was first {{estimated to be}} around 2.9 ± 0.4 <b>kiloparsecs</b> away. Later estimates put the cluster at around 3.3 <b>kiloparsecs</b> away; this {{is still one of}} the more closer massive star clusters.|$|R
50|$|Its {{distance}} {{is not very}} well known, but it {{is estimated to be}} of the order of 2 <b>kiloparsecs</b> on the basis its parallax and closeness of this star to the open clusters and star formation regions NGC 6604, Eagle Nebula, and the Omega Nebula (the three sharing a similar distance to the Sun, of around 2 <b>kiloparsecs</b> too); the studies of the water masers that surround it suggest a higher distance, up to around 3 <b>kiloparsecs.</b> However, the birthplace of this star is not clear and its kinematics and age show its unlikely it had formed in any of the previous three star-forming regions mentioned.|$|R
50|$|Its {{distance}} and association with that nebula and the mentioned star is dubious; while some authors think both stars are physically associated and {{belong to the}} stellar association Serpens OB1, at a distance to the Sun of 2.2 <b>kiloparsecs</b> (7.200 light years), others think HD 168625 is farther, at a distance estimated to be 2.8 <b>kiloparsecs</b> (9,100 light years) and unrelated to the former objects.|$|R

5000|$|According to a 2004 study, a GRB at a {{distance}} of about a <b>kiloparsec</b> could destroy up to half of Earth's ozone layer; the direct UV irradiation from the burst combined with additional solar UV radiation passing through the diminished ozone layer could then have potentially significant impacts on the food chain and potentially trigger a mass extinction.
