40|$|Reinforced-Concrete (R/C) <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> with {{unreinforced}} {{clay brick}} masonry (URM) infill walls {{are commonly used}} in developing countries with regions of high seismicity. The walls are usually treated as non-structural components, and their interaction with the bounding frames is often ignored in designing process. Field evidences after West Sumatera earthquake have shown that URM infill walls can help reduce {{the vulnerability of the}} R/C <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> against lateral load. In the present paper, it is an attempt to highlight the series laboratory experimental results of the R/C <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> with URM infill walls. Results of the experimental studies which have indicated URM infill walls can have a significant influence on the lateral resistance of the R/C <b>frame</b> <b>structures.</b> Increasing the lateral resistance is also observed on the R/C <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> uses larger size of the clay brick masonry and uses mortar on the infill walls’ surfaces...|$|R

Precent codes unfortunately, do not have adequate guidance for treating the modelling, analysis and design of in-filled <b>frame</b> <b>structures.</b> This paper addresses this need and first develops an appropriate technique for modelling the infill-frame interface and then uses it to study the seismic response of in-filled <b>frame</b> <b>structures.</b> Finite element time history analyses under different seismic records {{have been carried out}} and the influence of infill strength, opening and soft-storey phenomenon are investigated.

In the optimization program, quantitative seismic performance indicators of SRHPC <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> are determined according to the experimental results of SRHPC columns. Furthermore, by considering the fuzzy reliability of structures under each performance level, the life-cycle optimization model of SRHPC <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> can be established.

40|$|The dynamic {{responses}} and vibration suppression of <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> considering the shear deformation are investigated using the spectral element method (SEM).

The local dynamic stiffness matrices of the spectral elements for the Timoshenko beams and longitudinal vibration of the rods are obtained in the Fourier phase space and that for the axial-bending-shear coupled vibration of the piezoelectric rod is also gotten. From the transformation between the local and global coordinates, the global dynamic stiffness matrix for the whole <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> containing the piezoelectric rods is obtained. From the numerical simulation, the dynamic responses of the <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> can be effectively and exactly calculated by the SEM comparing with the finite element method.

ABSTRACT: Infilled steel <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> are known to perform better as compared to infilled concrete frames under seismic loading. In comparison with masonry infilled reinforced concrete (RC) <b>frame</b> <b>structures,</b> very {{little research has been}} done on masonry infilled steel <b>frames</b> <b>structures.</b> Contribution of masonry infill in the positive performance of the infilled structures is widely recognized but no codes provide the clear and detailed guidelines on the design of infilled <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> especially infilled steel <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> due to the complex and unpredictable behaviour of masonry during an earthquake event. This study aims to provide a detailed insight into the composite behaviour of steel <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> with unreinforced masonry infill under seismic loading. Time history analyses have been performed on masonry infilled steel moment resisting <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> and structural performance has been evaluated in terms of global structural performance parameters of fundamental time period, maximum roof displacement and base shear and local parameters of interstorey drift ratios, structural member forces and infill stresses. The effect of masonry infill on the performance of infilled steel moment resisting frames has been investigated by varying the number of bays, number of storeys, percentage opening in the infill wall, location of the opening, type of openings, number of openings, infill strength, outer frame strength and infill thickness. The results of this research will help to understand the complex behaviour of masonry infilled steel frames for different variation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results of dynamic responses and fire resistance of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> in fire conditions by using non-linear finite element method. Both strength and stability criteria are considered in the collapse analysis. The <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> are constructed with circular CFST columns and steel beams of I-sections. In order to validate the finite element solutions, the numerical results are compared with those from a fire resistance test on CFST columns. The finite element model is then adopted to simulate the behaviour of <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> in fire. The structural responses of the frames, including critical temperature and fire-resisting limit time, are obtained for the ISO- 834 standard fire. Parametric studies are carried out to show their influence on the load capacity of the <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> in fire. Suggestions and recommendations are presented for possible adoption in future construction and design of these structures...|$|R
