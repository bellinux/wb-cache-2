The placement of various species and sizes of fish within the hatchery system can be of major importance because of water quality demands, possible disease transmittal, and the volume of waste generated. All salmonids, large and small, require water that is high in oxygen, moder-ate in temperatures, and low in metabolic waste levels (Laio, 1971). Small fish and adult fish generally do not tax water quality as much as fish approaching release or market size because of the lower densities (in kilograms per cubic foot) involved. Among species, fish have different requirements for water quality. Brook trout cannot tolerate poor water conditions, rainbows are more tolerant and brown trout are the most tolerant. As fish size increases, so does their tolerance for “used ” water. However, attempts to rear broodstock in re-use...|$|R

50|$|Cold Stream Pond {{covers the}} eastern side of the town of Enfield. There is a public boat {{launching}} facility on Old Hatchery Road off Maine State Route 188. A ridge creates a narrow portion of the pond separating a smaller northern basin from the larger southern basin. Summer oxygen concentrations often become unfavorably low in the northern basin. The most significant tributary is Smelt Brook draining Upper Cold Stream Pond and Little Round Pond into the northern basin from Lincoln. The southwest corner of the pond overflows through Cold Stream 5 mi south to reach the Passadumkeag River 2 mi upstream of the Penobscot River. Cobb State Fish Hatchery is located beside the outlet using water from the pond to raise <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> <b>stocking</b> elsewhere.

Fisheries Management and Ecology, 20 (5), 434 - 444 The debate over Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., stocking in Britain centres on the trade-off between enhancing rod fisheries and harming wild populations. This article informs the debate by quantifying {{the relationship between}} stocking and angler catch statistics for 62 rivers over 15 years. After controlling for environmental factors affecting adult abundance, the 42 rivers with stocking had non-significantly lower mean catch statistics than the 20 rivers without stocking. This difference increased with the age of stocked fish. Among stocked rivers, weak relationships between mean stocking effort and catch statistics also became more negative with the age of <b>stocked</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>For</b> <b>stocked</b> rivers, {{there was no evidence}} for a generally positive relationship between annual stocking efforts and catch statistics. Those rivers <b>for</b> which <b>stocking</b> appeared to improve annual rod catches tended to have lower than expected mean rod catches. The results suggest the damage inflicted on wild salmon populations by stocking is not balanced by detectable benefits to rod fisheries. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Capoeta aculeata is a benthopelagic fresh-water {{fish that}} lives in {{subtropical}} climates and has a widely distribution in Iranian river basins. Hatchery production of <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> <b>stocking</b> is an important means of temporarily supplementing insufficient natural reproduction, thus help to maintain or restore eroded fish population. This study was done in May and June 2007 on captured brood fish from Zayandeh-Rood River, Iran {{in order to reach}} a suitable technique of artificial reproduction of C. aculeata. Caught brood fish were injected with carp pituitary extract at doses of 0. 75 and 1. 5 milligram per kilogram body weight of fish. Brood <b>fish</b> were tested <b>for</b> ovulation each 12 hours from final injection for 3 days, but no sing of readiness for spawning was observed. To gain confidence of experiment, the study was repeated after one month from the first try with new fish. The result, however, was the same and didn’t attain to any success. Inadequate information about reproduction biology of this species {{is one of the most}} important reasons of the negative result. Furthermore, unsuitable hormone and dosages as well as inappropriate injection time...|$|R

40|$|Fisheries {{management}} {{relies on}} the proper understanding the fish population dynamic. It includes determining the biological parameters, including size at maturity, duration of spawning season, mortality estimates, age and growth. Accurate information on age of fish is an important pre-requisite for extracting precise information on growth, mortality, recruitment and other fundamental population parameters of <b>fishes</b> <b>for</b> <b>stock</b> assessment. The outcome of conventional age estimates using length frequency data depends upon the sample quality, selectivity of the fishing gear etc. The stock assessment results may therefore be affected and sometimes give results which is having no bearing on reality. The hard parts of the fishes also grow with the fish and the growth process may left some inscription on such parts and if that can be interpreted properly, will get precise idea on growth. These inscriptions may result from either changes in the environment which the fish inhabits, or food availability, or physiological states of the fish. However, free swimming fishes always lives in ideal conditions and do not leave any environment related markings in their skeletal structures. So interpretation of hard part inscriptions need utmost care...|$|R

In models with stochastic variations of fish stocks, optimum fishing capacity is normally a decision variable separate from fishing effort.

Operating costs may also influence the optimum capacity through the effect of stock "thinning" on the cost per unit of fish caught and the level at which further depletion becomes unprofitable.
