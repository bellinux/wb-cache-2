25|$|Another album by Diesel Park West was {{released}} in March 2012. What <b>Kept</b> <b>You</b> {{is a collection of}} unreleased tracks from 1994–1996, recorded during the period that brought about FreakGene. The album proves what a fertile period this was for Butler and the band. It is available as a download on the Diesel Park West website.|$|E
500|$|... "Down Town" [...] was, after [...] "All You Need Is Love", {{the second}} of The JAMs' three 1987 singles to become NME [...] "single of the week". [...] The British music paper called it [...] "One massive hell-hating holler of a song", and concluded: [...] " [...] {{may not be the}} hippest, sanest or sweetest band to stalk the Earth this year but they're {{certainly}} the most imaginative... hey've fired a musical trail so shocking they couldn't have <b>kept</b> <b>you</b> more on your toes if they'd stuffed a handgrenade up your ass and sent you out to tap dance in a pair of stilettos".|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{song and}} third single [...] "Break the Ice" [...] opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's {{been a while}} / I know I shouldn't have <b>kept</b> <b>you</b> waiting / But I'm here now". The song {{features}} a choir and Keri Hilson singing background vocals sounding almost like a duet. Hilson explained the song is about [...] "two people, a girl and a guy, [...] and the girl is saying, 'You're a little cold. Let me warm things up and [...]'" [...] After the chorus, the bridge begins with Spears saying [...] "I like this part" [...] mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The album's fifth track, [...] "Heaven on Earth", is a Euro disco love song with new wave influences. It is inspired by Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] (1977), with three vocal lines taking place over the beat. Nicole Morier commented that the song was written from a very dark place, saying, [...] "I was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that I have all these imperfections. [...] I think what's touching {{about it is that}} it's from the perspective of someone who feels like they really need this person just to feel safe and feel good." [...] Spears named the song her favorite from Blackout. The sixth track, [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] is an uptempo R song about sex. It is a duet between Spears and Danja, who sings the chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan. Spears contributes a series of gasps, sighs and chants and her voice is also distorted.|$|E

60|$|Friend Rundle fell, with grievous bump, Upon his reverential rump. Poor rump! thou hadst {{been better}} sped, Hadst thou been join'd to Boulter's head; A head, so weighty and profound, Would needs have <b>kept</b> <b>thee</b> from the ground.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 October 2010, they {{announced}} the album title Gravity and trended worldwide on Twitter as #westlifegravity after the announcement. Band member Mark Feehily adopted the album title suggested by a fan and confirmed {{it on his}} Twitter account first. Redcorvette09 or Fiona Reynoldson, the chosen fan explains [...] "Gravity" [...] from the Safe lyrics. Maybe it's a dedication to your partners and how they've <b>kept</b> <b>you</b> grounded...or maybe about the music always drawing you back in for another album! Could have several meanings." [...] Egan said to the press people that the band will give something special to the chosen fan but it was yet undecided.|$|E
2500|$|Rubin Frazier had {{his left}} hand burned and part of his forearm amputated in a tractor {{accident}} the year his son was born. Rubin Frazier and his wife Dolly had been in their car when Arthur Smith, who was drunk, passed by and made a move for Dolly but was rebuffed. Stefan Gallucci, a local barkeep, recounted the experience. When the Fraziers drove away Smith fired at them several times, hitting Dolly in the foot and Rubin several times in his arm. Smith was convicted and sent to prison, but did not stay long. Dolly Frazier said, [...] "If you were a good workman, the white man took you out of jail and <b>kept</b> <b>you</b> busy on the farm." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Eh? What is it? Who is it? I deemed that yonder honourable dame had <b>kept</b> <b>thee</b> {{from all}} the frolics and foibles of the poor old profession. Fear not to tell me, little one. Remember thine own mother hath a heart for such matters. I guess already. C'etait un beau garcon, ce pauvre Antoine." ...|$|R

"Yes, I know that; but you who {{had fought}} before should have known well enough that, as long as <b>you</b> <b>kept</b> together, <b>you</b> could have beaten them off; {{and they would have}} been glad enough to have given up the pursuit, at last. No doubt they all wanted to have a share in the plunder of Ramoo." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "How do you know? Anyhow--having done that, {{you ought}} to have stood the {{consequences}} and thought of other people. You could have ended it at the first pause for reflection. You didn't. You blundered again. <b>You</b> <b>kept</b> on. <b>You</b> owed a certain secrecy to all of us! You didn't keep it. You were careless. You made things worse.

6000|$|Thy righteousness {{has added}} iniquity, {{because it has}} <b>kept</b> <b>thee</b> from a belief of thy need of repentance, and because it has emboldened thee to thrust thyself audaciously into the {{presence}} of God, and made thee even before his holy eyes, which are so pure, that they cannot look on iniquity (Hab. i. 13), to vaunt, boast, and brag of thyself; and of thy tottering, ragged, stinking uncleanness; for all our righteousnesses are as menstruous rags, because they flow from a thing, a heart, a man, that is unclean.
