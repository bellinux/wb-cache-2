The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said: [...] "There {{are any number of}} things that you think about when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. I have such admiration for doctors. I just don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{was a heavy}} smoker and drinker {{throughout}} his adult life, and suffered from heart disease. In 1961, aged 53, he {{suffered a heart attack}} and struggled to recuperate. On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in Canterbury, Fleming went to the Royal St George's Golf Club for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends. The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal. Fleming died at age 56 in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's twelfth birthday. His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them, saying [...] "I am sorry to trouble you chaps. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days." [...] Fleming was buried in the churchyard of Sevenhampton, near Swindon.|$|E
500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Whedon {{chose the}} most {{complicated}} scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song ("The Mustard") [...] "to {{get it out of}} the way" [...] for more personal numbers later in the episode. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considers this [...] "brilliant because it frees even people who hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre's conventions". The musical styles span from a jaunty 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya's hard-rock version of [...] "Bunnies". Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang in such a way to him on the set. Spike's [...] "Rest in Peace" [...] is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode's first song, Tara's [...] "Under Your Spell", a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya's duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from Ira Gershwin, a Charleston rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles' [...] "Standing" [...] is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles' distance from her. Buffy's not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, [...] "You can sing to someone in musicals and they can never <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel or how much you love them, even if they're standing right in front of you".|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Simon Price of The Independent, [...] "It Ain't Easy" [...] is {{reminiscent}} of [...] "Rock Is Dead" [...] by Marilyn Manson. Alex Roginski of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song [...] "utilises electro clash for a grinding foray into R" [...] K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic noted that the song [...] "pits a menacingly swung, twangy guitar riff", which according to him is [...] "lifted so blatantly" [...] from Depeche Mode's song, [...] "Personal Jesus". Buchanan spoke of the song's lyrical content and meaning, saying: [...] "It's basically about us as people. It's not easy being where we are now, {{trying to keep a}} balance between normality and doing this. When you're content within yourself, you should <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> are, and people around us know what we're like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 1993, Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{linguistics}} {{professor and}} political commentator Noam Chomsky praised the film {{because of the}} way people were portrayed doing the real work of unions. According to Chomsky: [...] "he real work is being done by people who are not known, that's always been true in every popular movement in history...I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> get that across in a film. Actually, come to think of it, there are some films that have done it. I mean, I don't see a lot of visual stuff, so I'm not the best commentator, but I thought Salt of the Earth really did it. It was a long time ago, but at the time I thought {{that it was one of}} the really great movies—and of course it was killed, I think it was almost never shown." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, 2009, the IAEA {{reported}} that samples {{taken from the}} site revealed new traces of processed uranium. A senior UN official said additional analysis of the June find had found 40 more uranium particles, {{for a total of}} 80 particles, and described it as significant. He added that experts were analyzing minute traces of graphite and stainless steel found at and near the site, but said that it was too early to relate them to nuclear activity. The report noted Syria's refusal to allow agency inspectors to make follow-up visits to sites suspected of harboring a secret nuclear program despite repeated requests from top agency officials. Syria disputed these claims. According to Syria's IAEA representative Othman, {{there would have been a}} large amount of graphite had the building been a nuclear reactor. Othman continued, [...] "They found 80 particles in half a million tonnes of soil.

[...] "What I saw of him– particularly in that dressing room– was {{that he was about to}} die," [...] Stephenson said. [...] "He was very suicidal.

With hype {{building}} around the band's upcoming album Superunknown, Soundgarden released the single {{a month before}} the album's release. The song was released as a single in 1994 with a previously unreleased B-side titled [...] "Exit Stonehenge". On the choice of [...] "Spoonman" [...] as the album's first single, Shepherd called it a [...] "great first choice," [...] adding that [...] "it just jumps out at you instantly."

[...] She said that the album features songs about her own personal relationships, explaining that writing about them is her favourite activity [...] "'cause it's the only thing I can really comment on {{with any kind of}} conviction or authority." [...] The album incorporates themes involving both personal and political conflict, and Morissette explained that [...] "Our emotions align themselves with larger symptomatic things in the world. We face a large war out there, but [...] more closely reflects the war in people's living rooms... the icy silence at home, versus the big cold war." [...] Morissette summarized the track [...] "Moratorium" [...] as being [...] "essentially a song about my readiness to stop repeating bad patterns. I've kicked some of those in my life."

Following the award show, Howard Stern asked Dirty about the incident with Diddy's bodyguards on his radio show, but Dirty wouldn't play up the incident as he didn't want to shine a bad light on hip hop because of one minor altercation.|$|E
