Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. The attackers used at least three SIM cards purchased on the Indian side of the border with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Intelligence</b> from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the SIM cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E

He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000.

Allegations of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were made by some U.S. Government officials who asserted that a highly secretive relationship existed between Saddam and the radical Islamist militant organization al-Qaeda from 1992 to 2003, specifically through a series of meetings reportedly involving the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Service (IIS).

2500|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the September 11 attacks, officials at the Czech Interior Ministry asserted that Atta made a trip to Prague on April 8, 2001 to meet with an <b>Iraqi</b> <b>intelligence</b> agent named Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani.

A Pakistani businessman named Mohammed Atta had come to Prague from Saudi Arabia on May 31, 2000, with this second Atta possibly contributing to confusion. The Egyptian Mohamed Atta arrived at the Florenc bus terminal in Prague, from Germany, on June 2, 2000. He left Prague the next day, flying on Czech Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, U.S. In the Czech Republic, some intelligence officials say the source of the purported meeting was an Arab informant who approached the Czech intelligence service with his sighting of Atta only after Atta's photograph had appeared in newspapers all over the world. United States and Czech intelligence officials have since concluded that the person seen with Ani was mistakenly identified as Atta, and the consensus of investigators has concluded that Atta never attended a meeting in Prague.|$|E

2500|$|Iranian leaders, {{including}} Khomeini and {{his successor}} Ali Khamenei, have long espoused {{a belief that the}} U.S. gave Saddam Hussein a [...] "green light" [...] to launch the invasion of Iran—something U.S. officials [...] "have unanimously and vociferously denied." [...] Joost Hiltermann observed that a U.S. [...] "green light" [...] is also [...] "the conventional wisdom in the Arab world." [...] In fact, Iranian suspicions that the U.S. would use Iraq to retaliate for the hostage-taking predated the invasion, as Carter noted in his diary on April 10, 1980: [...] "The Iranian terrorists are making all kinds of crazy threats to kill the American hostages if they are invaded by Iraq—whom they identify as an American puppet." [...] There are several reasons for this perception, including some circumstantial evidence. First, although the Carter administration had long been interested in rapprochement with Iraq, prior to the hostage crisis the administration's preference for Iran as the [...] "strategic choice" [...] effectively rendered this impossible. After the dramatic break in Iran–United States relations, however, both American and Iraqi officials made a number of positive gestures towards one another, including [...] "a speech by Saddam denouncing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan," [...] and culminating in an April 10 statement by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David D. Newsom that [...] "The United States is prepared... to resume diplomatic relations with Iraq at any time." [...] Saddam later acknowledged that Iraq had accepted Newsom's offer [...] "during the two months prior to the war between us and Iran" [...] but [...] "when the war started, and to avoid misinterpretation, we postponed the establishment of relations." [...] Moreover, the CIA—desperate for intelligence on Iran—maintained contacts with Iranian opposition figures including [...] "the Shah's last Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar" [...] and Gholam Ali Oveisi, who were themselves in touch with Iraqi officials and had encouraged Saddam to invade. Even though declassified documents state the U.S. [...] "would not fund, assist, or guide [...] movement, but [...] providing the channel as a means by which he could provide us information on his intentions and capabilities," [...] and there is no evidence either Bakhtiar or Oveisi were acting {{at the behest of the}} U.S., [...] "the Iranian militants occupying the embassy found dozens of documents detailing these contacts"—which began [...] "even before the hostage crisis"—and [...] "read them extremely selectively." [...] What ultimately convinced the Iranian leadership of [...] "American complicity in any Iraqi attack" [...] was the July 9 Nojeh coup plot, a failed military coup d'état against Khomeini funded by <b>Iraqi</b> <b>intelligence</b> through Bakhtiar (the Iraqis may have notified the Iranian authorities in advance, as they understood [...] "the damage the subsequent purge would inflict on the Iranian military"). Bakhtiar told the plotters the U.S. [...] "had given [...] its blessing," [...] but [...] "he was lying" [...] as the U.S. [...] "knew nothing about the Nojeh operation and would likely have opposed it on the grounds that it would endanger the lives of the hostages." [...] In August, Saddam made a trip to Saudi Arabia in which King Khalid [...] "reportedly gave his personal blessing to the invasion and promised Saudi backing," [...] which Bryan R. Gibson commented was [...] "a very significant gesture, especially in light of the closeness of American–Saudi relations." [...] United States Secretary of State Alexander Haig told Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, that it was during this visit that [...] "President Carter gave the Iraqis a green light to launch the war against Iran through [...] Fahd," [...] as related to Haig by Fahd himself, but at a 2008 conference several academics and former U.S. officials questioned the veracity of this assertion as well as the motives of both Haig and Fahd in promulgating it. As described by Malcolm Byrne: [...] "The American veterans were unanimous that no 'green light' was ever given, and that the Haig document, while intriguing on its face, leaves far too much room for interpretation to be definitive. In any event the Saudi comments did not address the various policy arguments that militated against an invasion—chiefly, the potential danger posed to the American hostages in Tehran—which the participants said held sway with most American officials." ...|$|E
