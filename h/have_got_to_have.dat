[...] The supporters responded with chants of [...] "We're Hull City, we'll die when we want" [...] during that day's home match against Liverpool. Manager Steve Bruce credited the controversy for creating [...] " [...] a fantastic atmosphere" [...] but added, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a conversation with him because I don't think he quite understands what it means in terms of history and tradition." [...] However, Bruce also said that, because of the money Allam had invested in the club, [...] "If he thinks Hull Tigers is his way forward then we have to respect it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On anarchism, Orwell {{wrote in}} The Road to Wigan Pier: [...] "I worked out an anarchistic theory that all {{government}} is evil, that the punishment always does {{more harm than}} the crime and the people can be trusted to behave decently if you will only let them alone." [...] He continued and argued that [...] "it is always necessary to protect peaceful people from violence. In any state of society where crime can be profitable you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a harsh criminal law and administer it ruthlessly." ...|$|E

If you want my husband to go you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> me too, {{and if you have}} me you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> your wife, and if——" ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{and again}} the {{illustrator}} of the artistic room will permit a young girl to come and sit there. But she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be a very carefully selected girl. <b>To</b> begin with, she <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> look and dress {{as though she had}} been born at least three hundred years ago. She <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that sort of clothes, and she <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her hair done just that way.|$|R
60|$|Unc' Billy nodded that he did. But {{just the}} same he couldn't think of {{anything}} else. He knew that old Mrs. Possum was right, and that it wasn't safe to go fooling around Farmer Brown's hen-house and leaving his tracks for everybody who came along to see. Just the same, Unc' Billy felt that he <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a nice fresh egg. He <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it. That is all there was about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe you!" [...] {{burst out}} Tom. [...] "Pop's a first-rate fellow, {{and the captain}} <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more proof against him before I'll believe him guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't you sit down? We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a talk," [...] said Acton. [...] "I'll {{come right}} to the point. You have have been buying land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can hold}} on comfortably, Aunt; besides, I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a change and a wash. That is of more {{importance}} than tea just at present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said frankly, [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the truth, though I {{guess it}} will cost me my job. Rain Bluff will never pay its shareholders." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} set in Manly in the mid-sixties. According to Buzo, [...] "I've been told Rooted hasn't dated, but with a telemovie it <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more {{definite}} time and place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can do that. But I {{give you}} fair warning that you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> go slow {{in using the}} stuff. Otherwise {{we are going to}} part company. In such a game as we are trying to put over, a man <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his wits about him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{will take}} but {{a minute to}} pick up {{something}}, if it's around, Sam. Besides, we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something in our stomachs before we set off to hunt up Dick and Mr. Barrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'd {{hear you}} chopping," [...] {{said the man}} who had {{appeared}} first. [...] "The tent's just back there among the firs. We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that post shifted before they know we are about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jimmy," [...] he said quietly, [...] "that man had no pity on your father. The {{thing has}} to be done, and the Shasta Company stood by you. We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that salvage, and you're {{not going to go}} back on us now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} {{recognize}} the limit in this case," [...] he replied, [...] "but I don't intend to worry. Ben is all right, {{and the girl}} <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her tragedy sooner or later. If it isn't Ben, it will be somebody else. A wonder it wasn't with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "maybe it's all for the best. If you weren't full of gall {{probably}} you wouldn't have come here at all; and whoever takes on this job of mine <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gall if he has nothing else. I think we shall suit each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, mister, I reckon {{you better}} get ready and pull out. I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> you for a son-in-law, not this season. The man that marries my Fan <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sabe enough <b>to</b> round up a flock of goats--and wit enough {{to get up in}} the morning. So you better vamoose to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I won't bring Pinney in, then," [...] said Maxwell. [...] "I prefer you to Pinney--in a play. But I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in an interviewer. It will be splendid on the stage, and I'll be {{the first}} to have him." [...] He went and sat down at his table.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care who}} hears me," [...] the woman replied in a still louder voice, [...] "and {{as soon as}} you can won't do for I. I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it on Saturday, so that's flat. I will come up to the field, and you'll best have it ready for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this out, Julia," [...] he was saying. [...] "If anybody or {{anything}} has come between us, there's {{going to be}} trouble. If that's the great Maraton, with his swagger evening clothes and big house, well, he's not the man for our job, and I shan't mind being {{the first to tell}} him so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bosh," [...] he said, laughing. [...] "As far as {{personal}} gifts are concerned, one fellow is pretty {{nearly the same}} as another. A girl <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be good-looking. A man <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something <b>to</b> buy bread and cheese with. After that it is all a mere matter of liking and disliking--unless, indeed, people are dishonest, which they very often are." ...|$|R
60|$|For the Doctor Watsons of this world, {{as opposed}} to the Sherlock Holmeses, success in the {{province}} of detective work must always be, to a very large extent, the result of luck. Sherlock Holmes can extract a clue from a wisp of straw or a flake of cigar-ash. But Doctor Watson <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it taken out for him, and dusted, and exhibited clearly, with a label attached.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Major Selby!" [...] {{cried the}} radiant and vivacious hostess. [...] "I couldn't think where you <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to.</b> I <b>have</b> {{been looking for}} you everywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'm {{the crater}} of a volcano,' says he. 'I'm all aflame and crammed inside with an {{assortment}} of words and phrases that <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an exodus. I can feel millions of synonyms and parts of speech rising in me,' says he, 'and I've got to make a speech of some sort. Drink,' says Andy, 'always drives me to oratory.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} {{to have some sort of}} love-business," [...] the actor returned, with an effect of leaving the right {{interpretation}} of Maxwell's peculiar humor for some other time. [...] "The public wants it. No play would go without it. You can have it subordinate if you like, but you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it. How old did you say Haxard was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{just that}} you can't do. You see, we shall be cut off from Tangier--maybe tomorrow, maybe a {{fortnight}} hence--but we shall be cut off. A ship may run in sometimes, at night, but you can't count upon that; and it is salt meat {{that we are going}} to live upon and, if you live on salt meat, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> vegetables or fruit to keep you in health.|$|E
2500|$|A {{neurologist}} {{who examined}} {{photos of the}} tissue samples, along with results of an EEG administered to Speck in the 1960s, stated, [...] "I {{have never heard of}} that [...] in the history of neurology. So any abnormality that exceptional <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an exceptional consequence." [...] He attributed Speck's homicidal nature to a combination of the brain abnormalities, the violence Speck suffered at the hands of his alcoholic stepfather, and his own drinking and violence in Texas.|$|R
5000|$|David Johnstone, {{chairman}} of Scottish Land and Estates, said the proposal {{could lead to}} land not being made available to let, and hurting the tenant farming sector. Johnstone said: “What you are doing is giving a tenant {{a stake in the}} capital value of the farm. If the landlord doesn’t <b>have</b> the ability <b>to</b> pay, then the farm never comes back... That <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a knock on effect in the confidence of anyone who might wish to come to let land or is letting land at the moment.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Examination of Speck's brain {{suggested}} that two areasthe hippocampus, which involves memory, and the amygdala, {{which deals with}} rage and other strong emotionsencroached upon each other, their boundaries blurred. The tissue samples were lost or stolen when sent to a Boston neurologist for further study.A neurologist who examined photos of the tissue samples, along with results of an EEG administered to Speck in the 1960s, stated, [...] "I {{have never heard of}} that of abnormality in the history of neurology.

"No. In those, {{most every}} flag {{represents}} a letter, or a word, or sentence; but {{to read the}} signal you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> either the international signal code-book, or else the United States Navy code-book. The navy code is locked up in the captain's cabin, and the book is weighted with lead, so that if anything happens, it can be heaved overboard and sunk, thus keeping {{it out of the}} enemy's hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you wait}} {{a bit and}} let me finish! Well, I might have come now and then, found out what I could, and given you a hint or two, until we saw how {{things were going to}} be. But that's not my way, and I reckon it's not yours. Very well. We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a talk and put the thing over. To begin with, I somehow feel I can trust you, and needn't be disturbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{you talk}} like that, Algie, I feel there's hope for you after all. That's how {{you used to}} talk in the dear old days when you'd come to me to borrow half-a-crown {{to put on a}} horse! Listen, now that at last you seem to be getting more reasonable; I wish I could make you {{understand}} that I don't keep Clarence for sheer love of him. He's a commercial asset. He's an advertisement. You must know that I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something to--' ...|$|E
60|$|Blacky kept {{right on}} flying. Somehow he didn't dare stop just then. He was too much excited by what he <b>had</b> {{discovered}} <b>to</b> think clearly. He <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> get his wits together. Whoever had laid those eggs was big and strong. He felt sure of that. It must be some one a great deal bigger than himself, and he was of no mind to get into trouble, even for a dinner of fresh eggs. He must first find out whose they were; then he would know better what to do. He felt sure {{that no one else}} knew about them, and he knew that they couldn't run away. So he {{kept right on}} flying until he reached a certain tall pine-tree where he could sit and think without being disturbed.|$|R
