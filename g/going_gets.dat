500|$|Plankton and Karen are {{the central}} antagonists in the Broadway {{production}} The SpongeBob Musical. In it they are portrayed by Nick Blaemire and Stephanie Hsu. In addition to wearing costumes {{inspired by the}} characters, Blaemire and Hsu sing a musical number (titled [...] "When the <b>Going</b> <b>Gets</b> Tough," [...] composed by T.I.) along with a Plankton puppet and a replica of Karen's mobile form. The plot features them attempting to hypnotize the residents of Bikini Bottom into liking the food they serve at the Chum Bucket. In 2009, actor Andy Peart portrayed Plankton in the musical adaptation of the third-season episode [...] "The Sponge Who Could Fly". Viv Hardwick of The Northern Echo positively reviewed the production and noted that Peart had very similar mannerisms to the cartoon Plankton.|$|E

Although he called AJ the [...] "family rebel", {{he said that the}} character is [...] "doing what he can to help out with the money problems [...] when the <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> tough, AJ will step in to help his loved ones—and while he will probably never take the conventional route, he'll always get something sorted out in the end." [...] He gets a job, and then helps to lift the family's spirits by organising a fireworks display, on which Sharma said, [...] "AJ is just trying to help out his family in his own, dysfunctional way." [...] In November 2012, Zainab makes a promise never to interfere in people's lives, so AJ decides to use the opportunity to test her. Sharma explained: [...] "He is ready to test her promise to the limits! AJ knows exactly how to push all of Zainab's buttons, and now he's going {{to take full advantage of}} the fact that she won't let herself be the control freak she normally likes to be!" [...] Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror said AJ is [...] "thoroughly enjoying" [...] testing Zainab's new policy.|$|E

500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not {{involved}} in top level football in 1972, Farmer {{returned to the}} VFL {{as coach of the}} Geelong Football Club from 1973 to 1975. Farmer and the club’s committee had an increasingly strained relationship, and Farmer quit in 1975. He returned to the WANFL, coaching East Perth from 1976 to 1977 with some success, and he coached the first Western Australian state of origin team in 1977. Farmer was sacked as coach of East Perth in 1977 due to conflict, and replaced by Barry Cable in 1978. Farmer said, “When the <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> tough a club should stick together and fight to beat it. But some people chip and chip at the ground underneath you in trying to find someone to blame. I do my best in football and I have no time to protect my back, so it's left wide open. Maybe that’s a lot of my trouble.” ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the war had}} {{finished}} and Sumich returned to Croatia he found a [...] "flourishing faith". [...] "They had broken free from communism and the church was free". [...] "Everyone had rosaries in their pockets." [...] Sumich found himself [...] "practising as a Catholic {{for the first time}} in my life, as distinct from just going to Sunday Mass. He wanted to know more about the Faith, because I'd just forgotten everything". His mother sent him a Catechism of the Catholic Church, which he [...] "sat down on a beach and read" [...] over one summer. [...] "It all made sense". He started going to frequent Confession and [...] "finding a sense of shame which probably hadn't existed before". At age 34, Sumich set aside a year, praying intensely, including the 15 prayers of St Bridget of Sweden and the Rosary. At this time, he was the coach of the Croatian rugby team. [...] "We would be playing at the Hong Kong Sevens and my rosary [...] would be in my pocket and I would finger it". [...] Sumich liked to challenge his players. [...] "I would say to them, 'strong moral life, strong character on the rugby field; weak moral life, and you are the first one to chuck the towel in when the <b>going</b> <b>gets</b> tough' [...] ". Returning to New Zealand, Sumich found local liturgies very different from what he had become used to in Croatia. But, in Auckland, he was introduced to the [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] Tridentine Mass celebrated by Denzil Meuli at Titirangi. Sumich [...] "felt God's call and sought an order using this rite". He was accepted by the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter and went to their formation house, [...] the International Seminary of St. Peter in Wigratzbad-Opfenbach, Bavaria, but he did most of his studies in Denton, Nebraska at Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary [...] where he was ordained deacon in [...] March 2008.|$|E
