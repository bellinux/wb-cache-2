5|$|The Forerunner Saga reveals Guilty Spark to <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> {{survived the}} events of Halo 3. His body barely {{functioning}} and his memory {{of the last few}} years erased from his fight with Chief, he was recovered by the UNSC ship Rubicon and interrogated by ONI for information about the Forerunners. During the interrogation, the barely functioning Spark had breached the Rubicon's firewalls and overpowered the onboard A.I. When the interrogation was over, his monitor body shut down and was launched into space, but his mind remained in the ship, informing the crew {{that he was going to}} search for the Librarian and restore his friends Riser and Vinnerva from his life as Chakas before placing the crew in cryostasis and taking the ship for his own to search for the Forerunner.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{name was}} English in origin, linking {{him to the}} Anglo-Saxon saint Edward the Confessor, and was chosen by his father instead of the more {{traditional}} Norman and Castilian names selected for Edward's brothers: Edward had three elder brothers: John and Henry who had died before Edward was born, and Alphonso, who died in August 1284, leaving Edward as {{the heir to the}} throne. Although Edward was a relatively healthy child, there were enduring concerns throughout his early years that he too might die and leave his father without a male heir. After his birth, Edward was looked after by a wet-nurse called Mariota or Mary Maunsel for a few months until she fell ill, when Alice de Leygrave became his foster mother. He would <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> known his natural mother Eleanor, who was in Gascony with his father during his earliest years. An official household complete with staff was created for the new baby, under the direction of a clerk, Giles of Oudenarde.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{ruled that}} Sullenberger made the correct {{decision}} in {{landing on the}} river instead of attempting return to LaGuardia because the normal procedures for engine loss are designed for cruising altitudes, not immediately after takeoff. Simulations showed that Flight 1549 could <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> {{made it back to}} LaGuardia had that maneuver begun immediately after the bird strike, but this scenario completely neglects the time needed to understand what had happened and assess the situation.|$|E
25|$|Floods Along the Amazon River {{there is}} a complex mosaic of fluvial forms, {{including}} channels, active sandbars, islands, levees, scroll-dominated plains, and abandoned belts highly prone to floods in the summer months. Hydrological variability and rapidly growing urban areas have caused new environmental problems in Brazilian cities, such as inundations in non-planned river basins. One {{of the causes of}} flood impacts is that public funds (national, state, or municipal) <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> introduced wise proactive polices to follow up rapidly growing urban areas.|$|E
25|$|Ashur-dan III {{ascended the}} throne in 772 BC. He {{proved to be}} a largely ineffectual ruler who was beset by {{internal}} rebellions in the cities of Ashur, Arrapkha, and Guzana. He failed to make further gains in Babylonia and Aram (Syria). His reign was also marred by Plague and an ominous Solar Eclipse. Ashur-nirari V became king in 754 BC, but his reign seems to have been one of permanent revolution, and he appears to <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> left his palace in Nineveh before he was deposed by Tiglath-Pileser III in 745 BC, bringing a resurgence to Assyria.|$|E

25|$|Russia has {{thousands}} of rivers and inland bodies of water, providing {{it with one}} of the world's largest surface-water resources. However, most of Russia's rivers and streams belong to the Arctic drainage basin, which lies mainly in Siberia but also includes part of European Russia. Altogether, 84 percent of Russia's surface water is located east of the Urals in rivers flowing through sparsely populated territory and into the Arctic and Pacific oceans. In contrast, areas with the highest concentrations of population, and therefore the highest demand for water supplies, tend to have the warmest climates and highest rates of evaporation. As a result, densely populated areas such as the Don and Kuban River basins north of the Caucasus <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> adequate (or in some cases inadequate) water resources.|$|E
500|$|For research, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh visited {{museums and}} art galleries, and also read Austen's letters and novels. She was {{interested}} in both the effects of continental fashions on English clothing and the differences between social classes. While she recognised that 1795 [...] "marked the beginning" [...] of the empire waistline trend, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> been introduced to Austen's circle in the country; rather, the film displayed many costume designs from the early 1790s. She explained, [...] "We wanted to show that transition especially for the women. The look in London {{is very different from}} the look in the countryside. For the country ball the fashion for the older women is more of the old style but for the younger women we show the introduction of the Empire line." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{a popular}} level, the First Crusade {{unleashed}} {{a wave of}} impassioned, pious Catholic furyexpressed in the massacres of Jews that accompanied the Crusades and the violent treatment of the [...] "schismatic" [...] Orthodox Christians of the east which occurred at Antioch. The Islamic world seems to <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> registered the Crusade; certainly there is limited written evidence before 1130. This may be {{in part due to}} a reluctance to relate Muslim failure, but it {{is more likely to be}} the result of cultural misunderstanding. Al-Afdal and the Muslim world mistook the Crusaders for the latest in a long line of Byzantine mercenaries rather than religiously motivated warriors intent on conquest and settlement. In any case, the Muslim world was divided between the Sunnis of Syria and Iraq and the Shia Fatimids of Egypt. Even the Turks were divided, with rival rulers in Damascus and Aleppo. In Baghdad the Seljuk sultan vied with an Abbasid caliph in a Mesopotamian struggle. This gave the Franks a crucial opportunity to consolidate without any pan-Islamic counterattack.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl {{evolves into}} a {{desensitized}} character and ultimately relinquishes his naïveté {{to the world}} around him. Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature with these kinds of situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of sound had driven costs higher: by 1930, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce. A {{broad range of}} motion pictures occupied the B category. The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as [...] "programmers" [...] (also known as [...] "in-betweeners" [...] or [...] "intermediates"). As Taves describes, [...] "Depending on {{the prestige of the}} theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee." [...] On Poverty Row, many Bs were made on budgets that would <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> covered petty cash on a major's A film, with costs {{at the bottom of the}} industry running as low as $5,000. By the mid-1930s, the double feature was the dominant U.S. exhibition model, and the majors responded. In 1935, B movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50 percent of studio output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known as the [...] "Keeper of the Bs". At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, Sol M. Wurtzel was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "If this is torture porn, it's {{as if it}} was {{designed}} to be enjoyed by Michael Moore." [...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want a guy with a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> bothered to come up with anything fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI gets back to Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{deviating}} {{from the}} subject of love, McCartney had it in mind to write a song with a melody backed by a single, static chord. [...] "John and I {{would like to do}} songs with just one note like 'Long Tall Sally.' We got near it in 'The Word.'" [...] McCartney claimed to <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> failed to achieve this goal with [...] "Paperback Writer", as the verse remains on G until the end, at which point it pauses on C.|$|E
2500|$|Because of her age and sex, Esther was {{probably}} adopted into a Wabanaki family, and {{was expected to}} assume the personality, duties and role of a Wabanaki daughter. As her adoptive family taught her to how to live as a Wabanaki girl and to pray as a Catholic, it's possible that they [...] "became attached to this child with an extraordinary affection." [...] After {{only a few months}} with the Wabanaki, Esther had probably shed so much of her former identity that she would <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> been recognized by her English family.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{versions}} of the Gaspar legend also claim that he was associated with various other pirates. The real alleged pirate Pierre Lafitte is sometimes {{said to have been}} a close associate of Gaspar's and to <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> escaped the battle in which Gaspar was killed. This is unlikely, as there is no record of Lafitte spending time on the southwest Florida coast, and he died in Mexico before Gaspar's supposed demise. Gaspar is sometimes mentioned to have been associated with Black Caesar and [...] "Old King John", other pirates for whom there is little to no historical evidence.|$|E
2500|$|A 2016 {{paper on}} [...] "Surgery in {{disorders}} of sex development (DSD) with a gender issue" [...] repeated {{many of the}} same claims, but without reference to human rights norms. A commentary to that article by Alice Dreger and Ellen Feder criticized that omission, stating that issues <b>have</b> <b>barely</b> changed in two decades, with [...] "lack of novel developments", while [...] "lack of evidence appears not to have had much impact on physicians’ confidence in a standard of care that has remained largely unchanged." [...] Another 2016 commentary stated {{that the purpose of the}} 2006 Consensus Statement was to validate existing practices, [...] "The authoritativeness and “consensus” in the Chicago statement lies not in comprehensive clinician input or meaningful community input, but in its utility to justify any and all forms of clinical intervention." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of sound had driven costs higher. In 1930, {{the beginning of}} the Golden Age's first full decade, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce. A broad range of Hollywood motion pictures occupied the B-movie category: The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as [...] "programmers" [...] (also [...] "in-betweeners" [...] or [...] "intermediates"). These were films that [...] "straddle the A-B boundary," [...] in Taves's description.

Loew's, the parent company of MGM, announced in 1935 that it would run double features at all of its subsequent-run theaters. A low-cost production unit was established at the studio under Lucien Hubbard, [...] "although the term B movie was strictly taboo at Metro."
