5|$|Both the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont {{disappear}} from the archaeological record of southwestern Utah by about 1300. Extended droughts in the 11th and 12th centuries, <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> catastrophic flooding, may have made horticulture impossible in this arid region.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow's {{chirping}} chup call is softer, less strident, {{and higher}} pitched {{than that of}} the house sparrow, and is easily distinguished. The song of breeding males includes chirrups <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> grating t-r-r-rt notes and short warbles or whistles.|$|E

5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is quite terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight {{consists}} of undulating bounds <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> glides.|$|E
5|$|As Christianity {{became the}} {{dominant}} religion, Attic {{began to be}} used in Christian writings in addition to and often <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> koine Greek. Nonetheless, from the 6th at least until the 12th century, Attic remained entrenched in the educational system; while further changes to the spoken language can be postulated for the early and middle Byzantine periods.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Ocean Press, in {{cooperation}} with the Che Guevara Publishing Project, released Che: The Diaries of Ernesto Che Guevara, with a movie tie-in cover. The book's aim was to compile all the original letters, diary excerpts, speeches and maps on which Soderbergh relied for the film.

50|$|Overall {{the book}} takes a soft {{approach}} to John's revelations, with the illuminations {{mainly in the}} soft style, and courtly, typically Gothic, scenes of domesticity <b>interspersing</b> <b>with</b> darker figures, but all painted in a manner influenced with Spanish art of the period.|$|R
25|$|Two {{cases of}} dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} {{have been studied}} involving a substitution of highly conserved amino acids belonging to the protein domains that bind and <b>intersperse</b> <b>with</b> the Z discs. This {{has led to the}} theory that the dilation is produced by a defect in the transmission of contractile force in the myocytes.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is finally}} {{completed}} and Barlow, Lloyd Webber and Malone meet The Queen to play her {{the final version}} of the song which she then describes as [...] "Splendid".

5|$|In {{the second}} part, David devotes {{chapters}} to recipes for {{various forms of}} baking. Bread comes first, followed by recipes for, among many other things, buns, yeast cakes, soda-bread, brioches, croissants, pain au chocolat, and pizza. As in her earlier books, the recipes are <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> excerpts from earlier authors, including Fernand Braudel, Auguste Escoffier, and the painter John Constable.|$|E
5|$|Pain is classed as acute (short term) {{or chronic}} (long term). Chronic pain may be {{continuous}} with occasional sharp rises in intensity (flares), or intermittent: periods of painlessness <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> periods of pain. Despite pain being well controlled by long-acting drugs or other treatment, flares may occasionally be felt; {{this is called}} breakthrough pain, and is treated with quick-acting analgesics.|$|E
5|$|The band {{returned}} in England on 3 January 1969 {{and went straight}} into De Lane Lea Studios to record new songs.

The first (above) {{features}} Clarkson performing the song (as presented in color), it <b>intersperses</b> <b>with</b> black-and-white scenes of her portraying a scientist {{in a research}} facility with the girl in full color (below). Pilliero utilized color as a rhetorical device to distinguish the antagonists (in monochrome) from the misfits or [...] "people like us" [...] (in color).|$|R
5000|$|Mountain films pose unusual {{difficulties}} for the filmmaking process; although parts can {{and have been}} shot in studios, filming on location is a longstanding tradition. Concerns include low temperatures, variable weather, and the objective dangers of the mountain environment. Directors may [...] "cheat" [...] by filming the actors in a less dangerous area, such as {{on the slopes of}} a ski resort, and <b>intersperse</b> <b>with</b> shots of the real location taken with a telephoto lens.|$|R
5|$|The {{existing}} bedrock includes very ancient Archean gneiss, metamorphic beds <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> granite intrusions {{created during}} the Caledonian mountain building period (the Caledonian orogeny), commercially important coal, oil and iron bearing carboniferous deposits and {{the remains of}} substantial Paleogene volcanoes. During their formation, tectonic movements created climatic conditions ranging from polar to desert to tropical and a resultant diversity of fossil remains.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{story is}} told {{in a series of}} flashbacks <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> discussions between Ann (Dockery), a patient in a sanatorium, and Dr Fisher (Stevens), a sceptical and atheistic psychiatrist.

50|$|Phaedrus' metre {{is simple}} and his fables tend toward the pithy. He reworks Greek stock {{examples}} (such as the frogs desiring a king from Jupiter), but <b>intersperses</b> <b>with</b> particularly Roman examples (Tiberius and the slave, Augustus and the accused wife, the piper Prince). Interest in his work inspired a modern imitator, la Fontaine, {{and a number of}} serious scholarly studies have arisen {{since the turn of the}} century. He is mentioned by Martial and by Avianus; Prudentius must have read him, for he imitates one of his lines (Prud. Cath. VII 115; cf. Phaedrus, IV 6, 10).|$|R

5|$|As long {{as winter}} food is available, both {{the male and}} female will remain in the {{territory}} throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes <b>interspersed</b> <b>with</b> cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
