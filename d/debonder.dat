40|$|This {{study was}} aimed {{to compare the}} {{positive}} effects of a Dry Strength Resin (DSR) addition to the negative effects of a surfactant (<b>debonder)</b> addition on the paper properties which were made from pulps with different freeness levels. Unbleached intercontinental pulps beaten to different degrees were used to make a variety of handsheets. Pulps used were analysed by Kajaani FS- 200 to reveal the detailed properties of stock such as fine, fibre length and coarseness. Handsheets were tested for some key physical properties and also analysed under a scanning electron microscopy. It was found that DSR addition increased the retention and produced a denser sheet whereas <b>debonder</b> addition gave very fluffy sheets with lower retention. When completely opposite effects of DSR and the <b>debonder</b> were compared, DSR was found to be more effective on its job especially on the beaten pulps. Tensile index values of surfactant added paper were found to be reduced to some extent with the parallel reduction of fine retention which was assumed that fines do help paper strength in this experiment. No significant effects on the zero span tensile indexes were observed by any of the chemicals addition...|$|E
50|$|Acetone, {{commonly}} found in nail polish remover, is a widely available solvent capable of softening cured cyanoacrylate. Other solvents include nitromethane, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methylene chloride. gamma-Butyrolactone may {{also be used to}} remove cured cyanoacrylate. Commercial <b>debonders</b> are also available.|$|R
50|$|Fluff pulp is {{normally}} made rolls (reels) on a drying machine (a simplified Fourdrinier machine). The {{objective of the}} drying / sheeting operation is to produce a uniform sheet (paper density, moisture and strength) to the converting operation. The pulp may be impregnated with <b>debonders</b> before drying to ease defibration.|$|R
