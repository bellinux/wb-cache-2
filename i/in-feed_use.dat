40|$|The study {{objectives}} were to describe antimicrobial use (AMU) and Salmonella resistance on 90 Alberta swine farms. The {{vast majority of}} antimicrobials were used in-feed. In weaners, <b>in-feed</b> <b>use</b> did not vary among farms, suggesting heavy reliance on in-feed antimicrobials. For grow-to-finish production phases, most farms reported heavy reliance on in-feed antimicrobials, but 6 and 14 farms did not report any in-feed AMU in growers and finishers, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of in-feed chlortetracycline (CTC) as a measure of preventing or minimizing infectious problems of reproductive failure in gilts and sows. In a farm of 400 Large White x Landrace gilts and sows with a clinical history of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS) virus, the animals were treated with CTC. Treatment consisted of 10 g CTC sow/day for 15 days every 3 months. It improved the health status of sows by decreasing post-farrowing clinical mastitis and vaginal discharges, abortions, return-to-oestrus and irregular return-to-oestrus rates. These beneficial effects had a positive impact on the performance of the litter. More piglets were born live and weaned. These positive effects improved with repeated use of CTC. The serological evidence of PRRS virus, Leptospira spp. and Chlamydia spp. and the subsequent beneficial use of the antimicrobial agent indicate that reproductive failure, possibly resulting from the bacterial agents can be controlled with <b>in-feed</b> <b>use</b> of broad spectrum antimicrobials...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of diclazuril in growing rabbits was investigated under experimental and field conditions. In a first experimental trial, the susceptibility of recent isolated French Eimeria field strains to <b>in-feed</b> <b>use</b> of diclazuril, salinomycin and robenidine was studied in fattening rabbits. Rabbits were challenged {{at the age}} of 31 d with a mixed inoculum of Eimeria magna, E. media and E. perforans. Production data and oocyst excretion were compared with an infected-untreated control group and an uninfected-untreated control group. Infection resulted in significantly lower production data and higher oocyst excretion in the infected-untreated control group. Salinomycin and diclazuril treated rabbits were able to control the infection, demonstrated also by comparable weight gain and final weight to those of the uninfected-untreated control rabbits and significantly higher than those of the infected-untreated control rabbits. Based on the production data and oocyst excretion, robenidine was not able to control the infection adequately. Economic performance (weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion) and oocyst excretion were significantly worse than in the uninfected-untreated controls. In a second trial, a 1 yr longitudinal study was carried out in Italy to evaluate the excretion of coccidia in growing rabbits from 8 meat farms applying a 2 -phase anticoccidial programme (diclazuril and robenidine). Parasitological parameters (oocyst counts and species identification) were measured monthly. Seven of the 11 known coccidial rabbit species were identified. Variable levels of oocysts per gram were detected in the farms, but on all farms lower oocyst per gram and a reduced number of Eimeria spp. in rabbit faeces were recorded in the 8 -mo treatment period with diclazuril. </p...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence and patterns of antimicrobial resistance in pigs on farms that medicated swine ration and those that did not. A total of 940 isolates of Escherichia coli from 188 pooled fecal samples obtained from weaner and finisher pigs on 47 farrow-to-finish swine farms (34 farms <b>used</b> <b>in-feed</b> medication and 13 did not) were tested for susceptibility to 21 antimicrobials using a breakpoint concentration method. The prevalence of resistance varied widely (0. 0 % to 81. 3 %) among the antimicrobials tested. Ninety percent of all the isolates tested were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. The most common multi-drug resistance patterns were to 2 to 6 antimicrobials. Resistance was significantly more frequent (P < 0. 01) on farms that <b>used</b> <b>in-feed</b> medication compared to those that did not, and significantly more frequent (P < 0. 01) in weaner pigs compared to finisher pigs. These findings indicate that resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials was prevalent among fecal E. coli isolates of pigs on study farms, and that this constitutes a potential reservoir for resistance genes that could spread to pathogens. The findings also provide further evidence that use of medication in swine rations provides selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance in E. coli in pigs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact on}} human health caused {{by the addition of}} antibiotics in the feed of food animals. We use the established transmission rule of resistant bacteria and combine it with a predator-prey system to determine a differential equations model. The equations have three steady equilibrium points corresponding to three population dynamics states under the influence of resistant bacteria. In order to quantitatively analyze the stability of the equilibrium points, we focused on the basic reproduction numbers. Then, both the local and global stability of the equilibrium points were quantitatively analyzed by using essential mathematical methods. Numerical results are provided to relate our model properties to some interesting biological cases. Finally, we discuss the effect of the two main parameters of the model, the proportion of antibiotics added to feed and the predation rate, and estimate the human health impacts related to the amount of feed antibiotics used. We further propose an approach for the prevention of the large-scale spread of resistant bacteria and illustrate the necessity of controlling the amount of <b>in-feed</b> antibiotics <b>used...</b>|$|R
40|$|Post-weaning {{diarrhoea}} (PWD) reduces {{production efficiency}} through increased {{morbidity and mortality}} and poorer efficiency of growth (Halas et al., 2007). Dietary proteins that are not digested and absorbed in the small intestine are fermented by the intestinal micro biota to produce a number of potentially toxic epithelial irritants such as ammonia, which are thought to increase the incidence of PWD. Limiting the amount of protein available for microbial fermentation has been proposed as a strategy {{to reduce the risk}} of PWD in weaner pigs without <b>using</b> <b>in-feed</b> antibiotics (Halas et al., 2007). In this experiment, we hypothesised that feeding a lower protein diet for a short period of time after weaning would reduce PWD by reducing the amount of protein entering the hindgut from the small intestine, thereby reducing protein fermentation in the colon...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} the ectoparasite, sea lice (L. salmonis), on farmed Atlantic salmon in Eastern Canada was {{complicated}} {{by the development of}} resistance to emamectin benzoate, the primary <b>in-feed</b> medication <b>used</b> since 2000. Field efficacy and bioassay assessments were initiated to address the emergency authorization of deltamethrin (Alpha Max®) used in limited circumstances in 2009 and again in 2010. Under farming conditions present in the Bay of Fundy, deltamethrin consistently reduced pre-adult (male and female) and male adult lice stages in the range of 88 - 98 % compared to pre-treatment levels. Cage-level reductions for both adult female and chalimus lice stages varied considerably with median reductions of around 50 % or less commonly observed for either stage. In vitro bioassays using field collected mobile stages of sea lice generated average effective concentration (EC 50) values that were lower for combined stages of pre-adult and adult male lice compared to either pre-adult female or adult female lice stages. Stage (p < 0. 001) and temporal (p < 0. 001) differences were observed for EC 50 values. Both field treatment observations and in vitro assessments of sea lice responses reflected greater reductions after deltamethrin exposure for pre-adult and adult male lice compared to adult female lice stages. Variable response occurring in different lice categories is likely to affect the successful field application of this treatment and is an important factor to consider when deciding how best to report efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic use was {{described}} using {{a convenience sample}} of 90 Alberta swine farms representing approximately 25 % of the Alberta market swine production. Data on the use of antibiotics were collected through an on-farm interview questionnaire. The vast majority of antibiotics were used in feed. The chlortetracycline/sulfamethazine/penicillin combination and tylosin were the most frequently <b>used</b> <b>in-feed</b> antibiotics in weaners and growers/finishers, respectively. The use of antibiotics through water was reported mostly occasionally in all categories. The use of injectable antibiotics was reported mostly in sick pigs. Penicillin was the most common in-water and injectable antibiotic in all categories. The apparent low frequency of critically important antimicrobials for use in humans (quinolones and 3 rd generation cephalosporins) is an encouraging finding from a public health perspective. The widespread and frequently reported use of penicillin and tetracycline are of public health concern considering that both antimicrobials are also used for therapeutic purposes in human medicine...|$|R
40|$|Diseases (1), {{salmonellae}} in broiler {{chickens and}} pigs significantly decreased after routine <b>in-feed</b> antimicrobial drug <b>use</b> for growth promotion was terminated in Denmark. Avoparcin was a frequently used growth promoter in poultry until its ban in Denmark in 1995 {{because of its}} association with the development and spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. On examining Evans and Wegener’s data, I noticed that a precipitous drop in salmonellae in broiler chickens appeared to have occurred in early 1996. Do the authors think this drop {{was due to the}} withdrawal of avoparcin? As the authors note, avoparcin has been associated with increased shedding of salmonellae (including a dose-response effect) in a number of studies (2, 3). If the large drop (from approximately 25 % positive samples in 1995 to approximately 10 % in 1996) is not due to withdrawal of avoparcin, what do the authors suggest could have caused it?

40|$|Macrolides and {{lincosamides}} {{are important}} antibacterials {{for the treatment}} of many common infections in cattle and pigs. Products for in-feed medication with these compounds in combination with other antimicrobials are commonly used in Europe. Most recently approved injectable macrolides have very long elimination half-lives in both pigs and cattle, which allows once-only dosing regimens. Both <b>in-feed</b> medication and <b>use</b> of long-acting injections result in low concentrations of the active substance for prolonged periods, which causes concerns related to development of antimicrobial resistance. Acquired resistance to macrolides and lincosamides among food animal pathogens, including some zoonotic bacteria, has now emerged. A comparison of studies on the prevalence of resistance is difficult, since for many micro-organisms no agreed standards for susceptibility testing are available. With animal pathogens, the most dramatic increase in resistance has been seen in the genus Brachyspira. Resistance towards macrolides and lincosamides has also been detected in staphylococci isolated from pigs and streptococci from cattle. This article reviews the use of macrolides and lincosamides in cattle and pigs, as well as the development of resistance in target and some zoonotic pathogens. The focus of the review is on European conditions...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobials {{have been}} widely used in {{veterinary}} medicine for disease treatment, disease prevention, and growth promotion. Although, the mechanisms about <b>in-feed</b> additives <b>use</b> are still not completely understood, it is accepted that its use improves feed efficiency by reducing the microbial load in the intestinal tract, thereby reducing the pressure on the immune system and increasing energy availability for the animal. However, disruption to commensal bacterial communities by antibiotics in some cases can increase the gut colonization by pathogenic bacteria. In this sense, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the Escherichia coli antibiotic resistance and the gut microbiota profile from pigs raised in Brazilian farms with different in-feed antimicrobials protocols. Pigs from four farms with distinct antibiotic usage, including one farm that used no antibiotics, were followed from weaning to finishing, and the frequency of antimicrobial resistance and gut bacterial profile by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing were evaluated. The gut microbial community structure was the same among all groups of pigs despite different antibiotic use on the farms; however, the antimicrobial resistance profiles of E. coli isolates were different between groups. One farm administered seven antibiotics at different times, and E. coli isolates from these pigs showed higher frequency of resistance and multidrug resistance as compared with samples from the farm that did not administer in-feed antimicrobials. The phenotypes included resistance to drugs considered critically important antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine (ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, florfenicol, sulfonamide and tetracycline) as well as one highly important antibiotic in human medicine (colistin). Resistant E. coli strains were screened for the presence of the mcr- 1 gene by PCR. The colistin-resistant strains were positive for the presence of the mcr- 1 gene. These results suggest that although different antibiotic uses on-farm might not impact microbial community structure, it does impact bacterial functions, namely antibiotic resistance. Our results show that prudent use of antimicrobials is important for decreasing selective pressure for antibiotic resistance gene evolution...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobials are {{extensively}} used as {{growth promoters}} in animal feeds worldwide, but reliable estimates are lacking. We conducted an internet-based survey of commercial chicken and pig feed products officially approved {{for sale in}} Vietnam over the period March-June 2015. Information on the antimicrobial contents in feed products, alongside animal production data, was <b>used</b> to estimate <b>in-feed</b> antimicrobial consumption to produce one kilogram of live animal (chicken, pig), {{as well as to}} estimate country-wide antimicrobial consumption through animal feeds. A total of 1462 commercial feed formulations were examined. The survey-adjusted estimated antimicrobial contents were 25. 7 and 62. 3  mg/kg in chicken and pig feeds, respectively. Overall, it was estimated that 77. 4  mg [95 % CI 48. 1 - 106. 8] and 286. 6  mg [95 % CI 191. 6 - 418. 3] of <b>in-feed</b> antimicrobials were <b>used</b> to raise 1  kg of live chicken and pig, respectively. Bacitracin (15. 5 % feeds), chlortetracycline (11. 4 %), and enramycin (10. 8 %) were the most common antimicrobials present in chicken feed formulations, whereas bacitracin (24. 8 %), chlortetracycline (23. 9 %), and florfenicol (17. 4 %) were the most common in pig feed formulations. Overall, 57 % of the total quantitative usage consisted of antimicrobials regarded by WHO of importance for human medicine, including amoxicillin, colistin, tetracyclines, neomycin, lincomycin, and bacitracin. These figures confirm a very high magnitude of in-feed consumption of antimicrobials, especially in pig production. Results from this study should encourage further monitoring of antimicrobials used in animal production, and foster discussion about existing policies on inclusion of antimicrobials in animal feed rations...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the {{prolonged}} impact of weaning diet on ileal mucosa bacteria and {{during periods of}} reduced and improved growth was conducted using 454 pyrosequencing. Weaned pigs were fed HIGH or LOW complexity diets, with or without antibiotics, for 6 weeks, followed by a common grower diet. Pigs were killed at 2 (n = 4 or 5) and 8 (n = 6) weeks post-weaning (periods of reduced and improved growth, respectively). Mucosal bacteria were removed; DNA was extracted and amplified using the V 1 -V 3 region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Mucosal bacteria clustered more closely by week post-weaning than diet but 44 % of bacterial species did not change from week 2 to 8. There was no effect of diet complexity or antibiotic inclusion on indices of bacterial diversity. Firmicutes made up 91 and 96 % of total reads at week 2 and 8, respectively. The proportion of Clostridium paraputrificum increased (P = 0. 003) from week 2 to 8 in pigs fed LOW but didn't change in pigs fed HIGH; whereas Clostridium leptum decreased (P = 0. 02) from week 2 to 8 in pigs fed LOW but didn't change in pigs fed HIGH. The proportion of Sarcina genus was 3 -fold higher in pigs fed A+ compared to A- at week 2 and 5 -fold higher at week 8 {{despite the lack of}} in-feed antibiotics at that time. Shifts in mucosal bacteria populations may be related to dietary induced changes in growth performance during reduced and improved growth but further studies are required to confirm causative relationship. Weaning diet results in species specific prolonged alterations in mucosal bacteria, particularly where high levels of <b>in-feed</b> antibiotics are <b>used.</b> A considerable portion of ileal mucosal bacteria colonize early and remain stable over time despite changes in diet...|$|R
40|$|Feed {{additives}} are non-nutritive products used in swine diets {{to improve}} production efficiency and performance. If chosen carefully and used properly, feed additives {{can be effective}} and can help increase the profitability of pig production. Not all feed additives are the same or provide a beneficial response and, therefore, choosing a product {{will depend on the}} farm’s specific situation and needs. This series of fact sheets includes some of the major classifications of products used as feed additives. Every effort has been made to ensure that all the information in every fact sheet is current and based on the latest scientific publications available at the time of writing. The objective of these fact sheets is to discuss some of the basic concepts to help producers improve their understanding of these products. They also aim to promote more responsible and judicious use of feed additives. Beneficial claims from dietary inclusions of acidifiers include control of bacterial growth in feed, increased growth performance, improvement in nutrient digestibility, and control of harmful bacteria in the gut. Antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, have been used in pig production for over 50 years. Early studies indicated significant improvements in pig growth performance when antibiotics were fed. With the improvements in production practices and health status of pig herds, positive responses to in-feed antibiotics may not be as large in today’s modern facilities. Additionally, the magnitude of response differs with the stage of pig growth. Use of antibiotics as feed additives is subject to regulatory policies to prevent residues and enhance public health.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of removing prophylactic in-feed AB on pig health and welfare indicators. Every Monday for six weeks, a subset of 70 pigs were weaned, tagged and sorted into two groups of 35 pigs according to weight (9. 2 ± 0. 6 kg). AB were removed from the diet of one group (NO, n = 6) and maintained in the other group (AB, n = 6) for nine weeks. Ten focal pigs were chosen per group. After c. five weeks each group was split into two pens of c. 17 pigs for the following 4 weeks. Data were recorded weekly. Skin, tail, ear, flank and limb lesions of focal pigs were scored according to severity. The number of animals per group affected by health deviations was also recorded. The number of fights and harmful behaviours (ear, tail bites) per group was counted during 3 × 5 min observations once per week. Data were analysed using mixed model equations and binomial logistic regression. At group level, AB pigs were more likely to have tail (OR = 1. 70; P = 0. 05) but less likely to have ear lesions than NO pigs (OR = 0. 46; P< 0. 05). The number of ear bites (21. 4 ± 2. 15 vs. 17. 3 ± 1. 61; P< 0. 05) and fights (6. 91 ± 0. 91 vs. 5. 58 ± 0. 72; P = 0. 09) was higher in AB than in NO pigs.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the use of antibiotic in feed and medication programs and their effects on broilers Serum Cholesterol and Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT). The broilers were sampled randomly from four small-scale broiler producers (BP 1, BP 2, BP 3, BP 4) in Semarang region- Central Java, Indonesia. Observed data comprising medication programs {{and the types of}} feed ingredients in the commercial complete feed were obtained from medication program brochures and feed labels respectively. Four unsexed broilers from each poultry producer were randomly sampled at selling point in poultry slaughterhouse. Broilers market body weight and abdominal fat percentage were measured on the spot. Blood was taken to obtain the serum samples for determination of serum cholesterol and SGOT. An independent experimental study (E 1) was also carried out approximately {{the same time as the}} field study using the same feed as in BP- 4 and raised under similar condition as in the broiler producers. However, no medication program was employed. The results showed that all feeds from four different feed companies (FC 1, FC 2, FC 3, FC 4) used by the four BPs respectively contained antibiotics. Antibiotics were also administered in medication program via drinking water. The market age was found to be 34 - 35 days old and market weight was in average 1760. 38 ± 54. 14 g with no significant difference among producers. This market weight had no significant difference to E 1. There was no significant difference in broilers abdominal fat percentage and SGOT among BPs. However, these abdominal fat and SGOT were significantly higher than E 1. There is a significant difference in serum cholesterol of broilers among BPs, where BP- 4 had the highest (145. 2 ± 6. 59 mg dlG 1) and BP- 3 had the lowest serum cholesterol level (117. 53 ± 9. 76 mg dlG 1). These serum cholesterol and SGOT levels were significantly higher than those in E 1 or in those published results that <b>used</b> <b>in-feed</b> antibiotic and no-medication (E 2) or no antibiotic in feed nor medication (E 3).

40|$|Simple Summary: Pigs immunized against gonadotrophin {{releasing}} factor (immunocastrated (IC) males) have {{an increased}} feed intake, growth rate, back fat and fat deposition compared to entire males. It is desirable to develop management strategies to limit the increase in feed intake and fat deposition in IC males. This experiment <b>used</b> <b>in-feed</b> ingredients (Lupinus albus (albus lupins) {{or a combination of}} calcium chloride and sodium tri-polyphosphate (mineral salts)) to try to suppress the voluntary feed intake of IC male pigs and subsequently fat deposition. Mineral salts decreased feed intake with no effect on fat deposition while albus lupins reduced both feed intake and fat deposition in pigs. Abstract: Two hundred and ninety-four pigs were used to assess the effect of two ingredients (Lupinus albus (albus lupins) or a combination of calcium chloride and sodium tri-polyphosphate (mineral salts)) on growth performance, body composition and objective meat quality of pigs immunized against gonadotrophin releasing factor (immunocastrates) and entire male pigs in the late finishing phase. Pigs fed mineral salts ate less feed than those fed the control diet with no effect on growth rate (p > 0. 05), backfat (p > 0. 05) or fat deposition (p > 0. 05). Pigs fed albus lupins had a reduced feed intake (p < 0. 001 for all time periods), lower growth rate (p < 0. 001 for all time periods), lower backfat (p < 0. 005) and decreased fat deposition (p < 0. 001 for all time periods) compared to those fed the control diet or mineral salts. From day (d) 0 - 28 pigs fed mineral salts had a better feed conversion ratio (p = 0. 001) than those fed albus lupins who in turn had an improved feed conversion compared to the control diet. Immunocastrates had thicker backfat than entire males {{at the end of the}} experiment (p < 0. 001), however, feeding albus lupins to immunocastrated males reduced backfat thickness to similar to entire males fed the control diet (p = 0. 01). With the exception of the increased muscle pH at 45 min post-exsanguination in mineral salts and albus lupins compared with the control diet (p = 0. 03) there was no effect of diet on objective pork quality. Pork from IC males had a higher ultimate pH (p < 0. 001), was lighter (L*; p = 0. 003), more yellow (p = 0. 008) and had a higher drip loss (p < 0. 001) compared to entire males. Albus lupins show potential in reducing the increase in feed intake and backfat associated with immunocastration. Mineral salts may be useful in situations where a reduction in feed intake and an improvement in feed conversion is desired and reducing fat deposition is not the objective...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to set a {{benchmark}} for a monitoring and surveillance programme on the volumes of the eighteen classes of antimicrobials available and consumed by animals {{for the benefit of}} animal health in South Africa. In setting up such a programme, risk assessment and possible management and communication strategies of the potential health risks emanating from antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from animals and man were considered and the survey was compared with other overseas surveillance programmes established in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Australia. The aim {{of the study was to}} contribute to the establishment of future surveillance programmes that will provide direction for the prudent and rational use of antimicrobials, involving all the relevant stake-holders, in order to preserve the future efficacy of those antimicrobials that are currently available. Such programmes will harmonize with international initiatives and contribute to the provision of databases for policy recommendations in South Africa. There are several benefits to the implementation of such surveys and addressing topical and relevant issues of antimicrobial use in the domain of animal health and its possible impact on human health. Furthermore, policy decisions to address concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance may be reached in a more informed and judicious manner, with the aim that the efficacy of available antimicrobials may be preserved for use in future generations of humans and animals. The authorized antimicrobials available in South Africa were firstly reviewed and compared with the volumes of antimicrobials supplied by the veterinary pharmaceutical companies. The majority of antimicrobials were registered under the Stock Remedies Act 36 of 1947. It was found that the class of antimicrobial representing the most registered products was the tetracyclines, followed by the penicillins, the sulphonamides, macrolides, lincosamides and pleuromutilins. This correlated well with the volumes of antimicrobials supplied, as these classes of antimicrobials also represented the top four groups of antimicrobials consumed. Eight of the pool of twenty-five veterinary pharmaceutical companies approached provided more detailed information on the volumes of antimicrobials consumed for the years under review, namely 2002 to 2004. The potency of antimicrobials was also requested, in order to establish trends of increasing or decreasing potency of the active ingredients, versus the volumes of antimicrobials supplied. It was established within the scope of this study, that the majority of consumed antimicrobials was from the classes of macrolides, lincosamides, and pleuromutilins, followed by the tetracycline class, the sulphonamide group and fourthly the penicillins. The potency of the active ingredients supplied by the companies did not change and therefore had no impact on the interpretation of antimicrobials consumed. These results give cause for concern in terms of the possibility of cross-resistance between antimicrobials used in the domain of animal health, and those used in the human medical field. There is also another concern, namely the exposure of humans to veterinary drug residues in food, causing modifications in the bacterial ecology of the human gut, thereby leading to a possible perturbation in the protective human gut barrier with overgrowth and invasion of pathogenic bacteria. Although much has been written about the possibility of anaphylactic reactions occurring in sensitized human individuals from â-lactams and macrolides administered in food animals, this issue has been reviewed extensively and it has been concluded that allergies from antimicrobial residues in the diet are extremely rare. The macrolide tylosin was the most extensively sold antimicrobial of all. Tylosin is one of four antimicrobials that was banned by the EU in 1999 because of its structural relatedness to therapeutic antimicrobials used for the treatment of disease in human medicine. The other three classes mentioned above, the penicillins, tetracyclines and sulphonamides are also relevant because of well-documented evidence of the ability to select for resistance or because of their structural relatedness to human therapeutic antimicrobials and their use in humans. The value of sales of antimicrobials were provided by SAAHA (South Africa Animal Health Association) and also scrutinized within the context of this study in order to obtain meaningful data on the national consumption of antimicrobials. However, as discussed in Chapter 5, the data were not of any value within the context of this study because the sales data were provided in monitory terms only. Volumes of sales of feed were also obtained and companies that mix feed approached to ascertain the percentages of antimicrobial medicated feeds consumed. It was ascertained in this survey that 68, 5 % of the grand total of antimicrobials surveyed during 2002 to 2004, were administered as in-feed medications. Tylosin was the most extensively <b>used</b> <b>in-feed</b> antimicrobial, followed by oxytetracycline, zinc bacitracin and olaquindox. This result emphasizes the importance of establishing a monitoring programme for the volumes of antimicrobials used, as many growth promoters <b>used</b> <b>in-feed</b> are administered at sub-therapeutic levels over long periods of time that tend to select for antimicrobial resistance. Whereas 17, 5 % of the total volume of antimicrobials utilized were parenteral antimicrobials, antimicrobials for water medication constituted 12 % of the total. “Other” dosage forms such as the topical, aural, ophthalmic, and aerosol antimicrobials and intra-uterine pessaries and tablets constituted 1, 5 % of the total. Intramammary antimicrobials represented 0, 04 % of the total. In Chapters 1, 5 & 6 the surveillance systems for veterinary antimicrobials used by other countries are discussed and compared. It was concluded that a combination of the surveillance systems applied by Australia and the United Kingdom is the best model (with modifications) to apply to the animal health situation in South Africa. Such a surveillance system of the volumes of veterinary antimicrobials consumed should ideally be implemented in conjunction with a veterinary antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programme to generate meaningful data that will contribute to the rational use of antimicrobials in order to preserve the efficacy of the existing antimicrobials in South Africa. Possible trends of antimicrobial usage in animals may be uncovered over time from implementing a programme for the volumes of antimicrobials used and thereby lead to proactive application of rational policies for the veterinary use of antimicrobials. This information can also be compared with international data, in order to harmonize as much as possible with global monitoring programmes of veterinary antimicrobial usage.
