ISPs configure both mechanisms to provide interconnectivity in hybrid (IPv 4 /IPv 6) environment. This research document provides an ISP independent architecture to provide interconnectivity in hybrid network by deploying tunneling and translation mechanism through a <b>decision</b> <b>entity.</b> For the demonstration, NAT 64 /DNS 64 (translation) and Tunnel broker service (Hurricane electric with 6 in 4 tunneling) are used.

30|$|For small {{networks}} {{that do not}} show significant variations (due to node mobility or change in the channel availability), a suitable approach for channel assignment is to elect a node as the central <b>decision</b> <b>entity.</b> This central node receives the information about all the other nodes, uses a channel allocation function to obtain the minimum possible interference, and finally sends the determined channel assignment {{to all the other}} nodes. This, however, is unsuitable for networks with varying operation conditions.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} methodology to solve distributed optimization problems where quasi-autonomous decision entities directly {{interact with each}} other for partial information sharing. In the distributed system we study the quasi-autonomy arising from the assumption that each <b>decision</b> <b>entity</b> has complete and unique responsibility for a subset of decision variables. However, when solving a decision problem locally, consideration is given to how the local decisions affect overall system performance such that close-to-optimal solutions are obtained among all participating decision entities. Partial information sharing refers to the fact that no entity has the complete information access needed to solve the optimization problem globally. This condition hinders the direct application of traditional optimization solution methods. In this research, it is further assumed that direct interaction among the decision entities is allowed. This compensates for the lack of complete information access with the interactive exchange of non-private information. The methodology is tested in different application contexts: manufacturing capacity allocation, single machine scheduling, and jobshop scheduling. The experimental results show that the proposed method generates close-to optimal solutions in the tested problem settings...|$|E

To solve this complex problem, in this study first we propose {{the use of a}} general linear trilevel programming (LTLP) subsequently, we develop a trilevel Kth-best algorithm to solve LTLP problems. A user-friendly trilevel decision support tool is also developed. A case study further illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|The wide {{deployment}} of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) {{we are witnessing}} today increases connectivity opportunities for mobile terminal devices, such as smartphones. However, continuous scanning for WLAN points of attachment can be a power exhausting mechanism for such battery-powered devices. These mobile devices, besides being equipped with different wireless access interfaces, are also coupled with sensors such as accelerometer, GPS, luminance and magnetic compass. In fact, sensors are increasingly being coupled into different devices and environments {{and are able to}} convey sensing information through networks into <b>decision</b> <b>entities</b> able to optimize different processes. In this paper we propose a framework where media independent sensing information is used to enhance wireless link management towards energy-efficiency. This framework enables the dissemination of sensing information towards local and remote <b>decision</b> <b>entities,</b> enhancing other processes (e. g. mobility) with sensing information in order to provide true Ambient Intelligence scenarios.

40|$|In a trilevel {{hierarchical}} decision problem, {{the objectives}} and variables of each <b>decision</b> <b>entity</b> {{at one level}} are controlled, in part, by the decision entities at other levels. The choice of values for the decision variables at each level may influence the decisions made at other levels, and may thereby improve/reduce the objective for each level. When multiple decision entities are involved at the middle and bottom levels of a trilevel decision problem, the top-level entity's decision will be affected, not only by these followers' individual reactions, {{but also by the}} relationships between them. We call this problem a multifollower trilevel (MFTL) decision. This paper firstly defines and analyzes various kinds of relationships between decision entities in an MFTL decision problem. We then propose an MFTL decision making framework, in which 64 standard MFTL decision situations and their possible combinations are identified. To model these MFTL decision situations, we developed an innovative decision entity-relationship diagram (DERD) approach. We also established a general model for MFTL decision making and a set of standard MFTL decision models using trilevel programming. A trilevel decision support system (TLDSS) software has also been developed to transfer a DERD into a programming model. Finally, a case study illustrates typical MFTL decision making models and their development, using both DERD and programming approaches...|$|E
40|$|Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is {{experiencing}} a growing interest mainly due to the flexible support of traffic engineering and Quality of Service (QoS). The efficient routing of Label Switched Paths (LSP) is an active research field where Constraint-Based Routing (CBR) {{appears to be a}} major building block. CBR {{can be seen as the}} <b>decision</b> <b>entity</b> that calculates the explicit paths for LSPs. The path calculation process can be constrained by different criteria, such as QoS requirements and particularly bandwidth guarantees considered in this paper. Special attention has been given to on-line solutions for CBR that process LSP establishment demands on the fly without any information on future demands. Currently, many proposals are formulated for CBR algorithms for bandwidth guaranteed tunnels, often compared to prove the effectiveness of one method over another. Nevertheless, no coherent evaluation has been clearly established for the general CBR problem, pointing out the different trade-offs involved in many solutions. In this article, we investigate the different objectives of CBR algorithms. We establish clear and general criteria for these algorithms, namely: reducing blocking probability, minimizing network costs, and load balancing. An effort of classification is made in order to map existing proposals to the proposed criteria. The study, performed to evaluate the influence of these parameters with simulations, shows the drawbacks of partial considerations, and the need for a global solution. Finally, we propose an integrating solution that encompasses the different criteria presented in the paper...|$|E

We examine main issues of a decentralized coordination scheme {{in a setting}} observed at a major US semiconductor manufacturer: marketing managers reserve capacity from manufacturing based on product demands, while attempting to maximize profit; manufacturing managers allocate capacity to competing marketing managers so as to minimize operating costs while ensuring efficient resource utilization. This cross- functional planning problem has two important characteristics: (1) bothdemands and capacity are subject to uncertainty, and (2) all <b>decision</b> <b>entities</b> own private information while being self- interested.

30|$|In this section, {{we apply}} the {{proposed}} partially-shared PBLMF decision making model {{to a company}} making venture investments. Consider the investments with a CEO and the selected two departments of the company. All <b>decision</b> <b>entities</b> have individual objectives, constraints, and variables and do not cooperate with one another. The departments within the company are also in an uncooperative situation, {{but they need to}} use the same warehouse in this company. The CEO’s decision takes the responses of the selected departments into consideration and aims to maximize the company’s profit. At the same time, the departments fully consider the CEO’s decision, and make a rational response to maximize their own profit. Under incomplete and asymmetric information, the CEO cannot directly observe both departments’ effort and the inventory expense. Then it is difficult for the CEO to design an investment planning model that aims to maximize the company’s profit (or minimize the company’s cost). In this case, the CEO may want to create a safety margin to bound the damage resulting from undesirable selections of the two departments.|$|R

30|$|As is well known, most {{theoretical}} and algorithmic contributions to bilevel programming {{are limited to}} a specific situation with one leader and one follower. For the actual bilevel programming problems, however, the lower level problem often involves multiple decision makers. For example, in a university, the dean of a faculty is the leader, and aims to minimize the faculty annual budget. All the heads of departments in the faculty are the followers whose aims are maximizing their respective annual budget. The leader chooses an optimal strategy knowing how the followers will react. This is a typical bilevel multi-follower (BLMF) programming problem. Note that the research on BLMF has been concentrated in its optimistic formulation. For example, Calvete and Galé [20] discussed the linear BLMF with independent followers and transformed such a problem into a linear bilevel problem with one leader and one follower. Lu et al. [21] generalized a framework for {{a special kind of}} BLMF, and identified nine main types of relations among followers. Lu et al.

40|$|M. Com. (Computer Auditing) This {{dissertation}} aims {{to explore}} the entity characteristics associated {{with the implementation of}} the board-level stand-alone risk management committee (RMC) in South Africa. We developed a battery of econometric models based on triangulation of corporate governance theories which linked an <b>entity’s</b> <b>decision</b> to set up a separate risk management committee (RMC) in its board structures as a dependent variable and a host of entity-specific factors as independent variables. Data collected from audited annual reports of 181 JSE-listed non-financial entities was analysed using logistics regression estimation procedures. Our results show a strong positive relationship between the likelihood that an entity would establish a separate RMC, on the one hand, and board independence, board size, entity size, and industry type, on the other. Our study fails to find support for the hypothesis that an entity’s characteristics – such as the independence of the board chairman, the use of Big Four audit firms, financial reporting risks, and levels of financial leverage – do influence an <b>entity’s</b> <b>decision</b> to form a separate RMC. Our findings emphasize the role that information asymmetry between executive and non-executive directors, agency cost and potential damage to reputation capital of directors; diversity in background, expertise, and skills of directors; economies of scale in absorbing RMC costs; and industry-specific institutions and norms play in an <b>entity’s</b> <b>decision</b> to form a separate RMC.
