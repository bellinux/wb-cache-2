5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 <b>gallons)</b> <b>per</b> minute to over 350 litres (77 <b>gallons)</b> <b>per</b> minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage.

25|$|The San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park {{opened to}} the public on October 2, 1963, and the ship {{opened to the}} public as a museum ship on October 10, 1963. Within years of its opening, serious {{deterioration}} threatened the ship and became critical in August 1969 when a leak raised the rate at which it took on water to 600 <b>gallons</b> <b>per</b> hour and in strong winds to 1,000 <b>gallons</b> <b>per</b> hour. The ships two pumps were capable of handling this flow, but two weeks later the leak doubled to 2,000 <b>gallons</b> <b>per</b> hour. In a dive, the leak was found and staunched with oakum and burlap and it was later reinforced to be fixed at the next dry docking, in November 1970. In October 1972, the United States Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park was intentionally included in its range. In September 1977, the State of California donated the park and the collections to the federal government and it was reorganized as the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park.

40|$|Fuel price {{volatility}} {{is a major}} concern for airlines. An unexpected spike in fuel prices can keep an airline from profiting, and higher fares due to higher fuel prices can diminish customer demand. Airlines that hedge large portions of their future fuel needs at one time risk being fixed in their hedges if spot fuel prices drop. Airlines that do not hedge at all take an even greater risk as there is no 100 % assurance to forecast future fuel expenditures. Using market indicators, a model for selective fuel hedging might prove successful in offsetting fuel {{price volatility}}. Two models for selective fuel hedging based on trend lines, the fast stochastic oscillator, and two different stop-loss measures showed profitability in each year of a four year historical trading simulation. The simulation resulted with the 2 % stop-loss model potentially saving an airline or other aviation fuel users an average of $ 0. 47 <b>per</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>per</b> year (based on a 100, 000 <b>gallon</b> <b>per</b> year usage) from October 2007 through September 2011, and the 5 % stop-loss model saving an average of $ 0. 65 <b>per</b> <b>gallon</b> <b>per</b> year (based on a 100, 000 <b>gallon</b> <b>per</b> year usage) during the same time period.
