50|$|In Germany, {{there is}} a growing {{tendency}} to use the law on legal guardianship instead of mental health law for <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> involuntary <b>commitment</b> or treatment. The ward's legal guardian decides that he/she must go into mental hospital for treatment, and the police then acts on this decision. This is simpler for the government and family members than the formal process for commitment under mental health laws.|$|R

40|$|David Boonin has {{recently}} advanced several {{challenges to the}} self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment. Boonin argues that the self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment justifies punishing the innocent, justifies disproportionate punishment, cannot account for mitigating excuses, and does not justify intentionally harming offenders as we do when we punish them. In this paper, I argue that the self-defense justification, suitably understood, can avoid all of these problems. To help demonstrate the self-defense theory’s attraction, I also develop some contrasts between the self-defense justification, Warren Quinn’s better known ‘auto-retaliator’ argument, and desert-based <b>justifications</b> <b>of</b> punishment. In sum, I show that the self-defense <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment is more resilient than commonly supposed and deserves {{to be taken seriously}} as a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> punishment...|$|R

PCR attempts to work around the problem <b>of</b> ultimate <b>commitment</b> or infinite regress by decoupling criticism and justification. A pancritical rationalist holds all positions open to criticism, including PCR itself. Such a position in principle never resorts to appeal to authority for <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> stances, since all authorities are held to be intrinsically fallible.|$|R
