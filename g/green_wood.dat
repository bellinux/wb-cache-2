5|$|In the {{northeast}} of Museum Gardens there are {{remains of the}} west corner of the fortifications that surrounded the Roman fort of Eboracum. The original defences, consisting of turf ramparts on a <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> foundation, were built by the Ninth Legion between 71 and 74AD. Later those were replaced by a clay mound with a turf front on a new oak foundation, and eventually wooden battlements were added, which were then replaced by limestone walls and towers. These stone defences {{are some of the}} few Roman remains that are visible above ground in York.|$|E
5|$|Re d'Italia {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Italian fleet until moments before the Battle of Lissa on 20 July 1866; Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano's hasty transfer to another vessel deprived the fleet of central command, and in the ensuing melee, Re d'Italia was rammed and sunk. Re di Portogallo was also rammed, but was not seriously damaged and she survived the action. The ship remained in service until 1871, when she became a training ship; this service did not last long, as the <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> used to build her hull had badly deteriorated by 1875, so she was sold and broken up for scrap that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, as {{the allied}} Christian fleet resumed operations, it faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha. The Spanish contingent under Don John {{did not reach}} the Ionian Sea until September, meaning that the Ottomans enjoyed numerical superiority for a time, but the Ottoman commander {{was well aware of}} the inferiority of his fleet, constructed in haste of <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> and manned by inexperienced crews. He therefore actively avoided to engage the allied fleet in August, and eventually headed {{for the safety of the}} fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow, but friction among the Christian leaders and the reluctance of Don John squandered the opportunity.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} all this effort could only be judged after a complicated, {{three-phase}} firing process which generated the red color of the vase clay and the black of the applied slip. Specifically, the vessel was fired in a kiln at a temperature of about 800°C, with the resultant oxidization turning the vase a reddish-orange color. The temperature was then raised to about 950°C with the kiln's vents closed and <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> added to remove the oxygen. The vessel then turned an overall black. The final stage required the vents to be re-opened to allow oxygen into the kiln, which was allowed to cool down. The vessel then returned to its reddish-orange colour due to renewed oxidization, while the now-sintered painted layer remained the glossy black color which had been created in the second stage.|$|E

Hopefully this was an isolated example, however the system suffered from many faults due to bias, lack of legal training, etc., etc. As stated, a right of appeal to Regalities and sheriffdoms courts did exist. Details of the sometimes shocking excesses of baron bailies can make painful reading. As their power was great and generally abused, so many of them enriched themselves. They had many ways of making money for themselves, such as (1) the bailie's darak, as it was called, or a day's labour in the year from every tenant on the estate; (2) confiscations, as they generally seized on all the goods and effects of such as suffered capitally; (3) all fines for killing game, blackfish, or cutting <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> were laid on by themselves, and went into their own pockets. These fines amounted to what they pleased almost. (4) Another very lucrative perquisite they had was what was called the Herial Horse, which was the best horse, cow, ox, or other article which any tenant on the estate possessed {{at the time of his}} death. This was taken from the widow and children for the bailie, at the time they had most need of assistance. This amounted to a great deal of extra income for the baillie of a large barony.|$|E

500|$|The khagan then {{ordered his}} men to fill the moat with <b>green</b> <b>wood,</b> {{so that it would}} not burn, which the {{garrison}} countered by throwing in dry wood as well. After six days, when the moat was full, the Arabs set it afire; aided by a strong wind, the hard work of the Turgesh was put to nought. The Arab archers also proved effective, exacting a heavy toll among the Turgesh, including Bazaghari. The Turgesh then executed a hundred Arab captives {{in full view of the}} garrison. In response, the Arabs killed the 200 young locals they held as hostages, despite their desperate resistance. The narrative of the siege in al-Tabari, evidently drawing from eyewitness accounts, continues with isolated episodes: the determined Turgesh assault on the gate, with five of them managing to climb the wall before being repelled, the Soghdian prince of al-Taraband who with his companions assaulted a breach in the wall which led into a house only to be killed by the house's elderly and sick owner and his family, how the Arabs used the wooden boards lining the irrigation ditches to improve their earthworks, or the time when the khagan, coming to inspect the Arab fortifications, received an arrow-shot in the face but was saved by his helmet's nose-guard.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is not the}} {{original}} version of the legend, however, but rather {{appears to be a}} modification of an older legend in order to incorporate Protestant English representation into a flag originating within the Roman Catholic Irish community. [...] In 1900 historians Devine and O'Mara told that the concept of the flag was originated by Bishop Fleming in the mid-19th century as a symbolic gesture to quiet tensions between newly arriving Irish settlers and the existing Roman Catholic community in the St. John's area. [...] The Newfoundland 'Bush-borns' and 'Old Country' Irish were embroiled in rivalry to supply the biggest load of wood to the Roman Catholic Basilica during the big yearly wood haul. [...] There was argument over which group had the larger load and violence between them ensued. [...] Upon hearing of this, Fleming induced them to join their pink and <b>green</b> <b>wood</b> slide markers together with neutral white being placed in between, and thus was born the concept which eventually became the pink, white and green flag of the Star of the Sea fraternal association for Catholics. [...] In this version of the story, pink similarly represented Newfoundland-born Catholics, possibly members of a [...] "natives" [...] group, that were supplying wood to Fleming himself, with the Protestant English not included in the proceedings at all. [...] Devine and O'Mara conceded that this story was based on oral tradition with no actual historical evidence to support it.|$|E
