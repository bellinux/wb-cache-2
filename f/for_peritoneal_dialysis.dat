40|$|Despite general {{physicist}} principles {{applied in}} <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> and hemodialysis {{are the same}} ones, the rate of potassium removal is markedly slower in the former (1). <b>Peritoneal</b> clearance <b>for</b> potassium averages about 17 ml/minute <b>for</b> intermittent <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> (IPD), and approximately 7 ml/minute <b>for</b> continuous ambulatory <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> (CAPD).

The enhancement of the peritoneal perme-ability causes an under-dialysis and ultrafiltration failure, {{which is one}} of the grave factors which disrupt the homeostasis of body fluid. Hence, the monitoring of the peritoneal perme-ability is very important in order to give each patient some better prescriptions. In this study, we designed a novel crite-rion which can evaluate quantitatively the peritoneal perme-ability by applying a kinetic model <b>for</b> the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> Moreover clinical implementations of the novel criterion were validated with using the clinical data.

40|$|Tryptophan, an {{essential}} amino acid, follows important metabolic pathways for protein, niacin and serotonin synthesis. The kynurenine pathway {{is a major}} pathway for tryptophan degradation. Indications are that tryptophan metabolism is disturbed in chronic renal failure patients (CRF), with tryptophan depletion and accumulation of kynurenine metabolites. Assessment of tryptophan metabolism is generally hampered by the non availability of analytical techniques for these substances. Aim: to develop and validate a suitable method for the quantification of tryptophan, kynurenine and quinolinic acid in the blood. The second aim was to demonstrate the clinical application of this method by the quantification of the said metabolites {{in the blood of}} chronic renal failure patients. The levels of the substances in the blood of <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> patients, haemodialysis patients and controls were compared. Method: A sensitive, selective and repeatable method was developed that employed gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The gas chromatographer was a Hewlett Packard HP GC 6890 series instrument coupled to a MS 5973 series mass spectrometer. Separation of the analytes was achieved on a DB- 5 MS GC column with a nominal length of 30 metres, a diameter of 250. 0 ìm and film thickness of 0. 10 ìm. Results: Method validation results fell within the international acceptance criteria for a newly developed method. Tryptophan levels were 5. 34 SD 5. 04 ìM for the haemodialysis group, 6. 73 SD 3. 18 ìM <b>for</b> the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> group and 28. 4 SD 4. 31 ìM for the control group. Kynurenine levels were 4. 7 SD 1. 9 ìM for the haemodialysis group, 2. 9 SD 2. 0 ìM <b>for</b> the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> group and 2. 1 SD 0. 6 ìM for the control group. Quinolinic acid levels were 4. 9 SD 2. 0 ìM for the haemodialysis, 2. 8 SD 2. 0 ìM <b>for</b> the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> group and 0. 3 SD 0. 1 ìM for the control group. Tryptophan was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) and kynurenine and quinolinic acid levels were higher (p< 0. 05) in the patient groups. Conclusions: GC-MS is suitable for simultaneous assessment of tryptophan, kynurenine and quinolinic acid. Significant tryptophan depletion and accumulation of the metabolites kynurenine and quinolinic acid occurs in CRF patients on both haemodialysis and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> treatment.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{complications}} {{are common}} among patients on peritoneal dialysis. Risk factors {{for the development}} of gastrointestinal complications in this patient population include: toxic effects of uremic toxins, frequent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Helicobacter pylori infection, angiodysplasia, increased intra-abdominal pressure, use of bioincompatible solution <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis,</b> increased glucose in solutions <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis,</b> secondary hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia), a disorder of lipid metabolism (hypertriglyceridemia), and the duration of peritoneal dialysis treatment. The most important non-infectious gastrointestinal complications in patients on peritoneal dialysis are: gastrointestinal bleeding, herniation and leaking of the dialysate from the abdomen (increased intra-abdominal pressure), impaired lung function (intra-abdominal hypertension), acute pancreatitis, and encapsulating sclerosis of the peritoneum. Intra-abdominal hypertension is defined as IAP ≥ 12 mmHg. Pouring the peritoneal dialysis solution leads to increased intra-abdominal pressure, which results in the development of hernias, pleuro-peritoneal dialysate leakage (hydrothorax), and restrictive pulmonary dysfunction. Risk factors {{for the development of}} acute pancreatitis in this patient population include: uraemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, features of the peritoneal dialysis solution (osmolarity, acidity, glucose, chemical irritation, and calcium in the solution <b>for</b> <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> lead to “local hypercalcemia”), toxic substances from the dialysate, the bags and tubing, and peritonitis and treatment of peritonitis with antibiotics and anticoagulants. Encapsulating sclerosis of the peritoneum is rare and is the most serious complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis. It is characterized by thickening of the peritoneum, including cancer, and signs and symptoms of obstructive ileus. Diagnosis is based on clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters. Encapsulating sclerosis of the peritoneum can be indicated by an AR-CA- 125 concentration of less than 33 U/min and a concentration of AR-IL- 6 greater than 350 pg/min in the effluent of patients with ultrafiltration weakness.

40|$|Tryptophan is metabolised {{along the}} kynurenine pathway under the {{influence}} of tryptophan 2, 3 dioxygenase and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase. Quinolinic acid and kynurenine, two neuroactive metabolites of the kynurenine pathway are, in chronic renal failure patients, considered as uraemic toxins. Related research is generally hampered by the non-availability of relevant analytical techniques. The primary aim of this study was, therefore, to develop and validate suitable methods for the determination of tryptophan, kynurenine and quinolinic acid. The second aim was to quantify the levels of these substances in the blood of chronic renal failure patients on renal replacement therapies and to compare the levels of haemodialysis patients to those on <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis.</b> Patients’ quality of life was investigated relative to disturbances in tryptophan metabolism. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) gave the best results for the analysis of tryptophan, kynurenine and quinolinic acid. A Hewlett Packard HP GC 6890 series gas chromatographer was coupled to a MS 5973 series mass spectrometer. Analytes were separated on a DB- 5 MS column with a nominal length of 30 metres, a diameter of 250. 0 µm and film thickness of 0. 10 µm. Helium was used as carrier gas, and the chromatographic analysis run time 12. 5 minutes. The validation results were within the acceptance criteria for newly developed methods. The linear calibration curves constructed for all of the analytes gave r 2 correlation coefficients > 0. 99. Other validation data such as precision, bias, accuracy and stability all fell within acceptable validation limits. In the study on chronic renal failure patients significant differences were seen between patients and controls. Tryptophan levels were 5. 34 SD 5. 04 µM for the haemodialysis group, 6. 73 SD 3. 18 µM <b>for</b> the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> group and 28. 4 SD 4. 31 µM for the control group.

Tryptophan was lower for the total patient group than for controls with significantly lower levels for haemodialysis versus control (p< 0. 05) and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> versus control (p< 0. 05). Kynurenine levels were higher in the total patient group with significantly higher levels for the haemodialysis versus control group (p= 0. 0001). The patient groups had higher quinolinic acid levels with significantly higher levels for the haemodialysis versus control (p< 0. 05) and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> versus control (p< 0. 05) groups. This study was the first to determine the three substances simultaneously in both haemodialysis and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>dialysis</b> patients. The study showed significant tryptophan depletion, as well as kynurenine and quinolinic acid accumulation for both groups. No {{significant differences were found between}} the patient groups other than higher kynurenine levels in the haemodialysis group. The quality of life (SF- 36) was largely similar in the two patient groups. This decrease in the quality of life strongly correlated with the degree of tryptophan depletion.
