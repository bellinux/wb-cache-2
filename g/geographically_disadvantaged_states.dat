40|$|Prikaz knjigeBook review: This book {{is part of}} a three-volume manual {{prepared}} by the International Maritime Law Institute (IMLI) to serve as a guide to all aspects of international maritime law. The general editor of the entire series is Professor David Joseph Attard, IMLI Director, while editors of Volume I under review, dedicated to {{the law of the sea}} aspect, are Malgosia Fitzmaurice, professor of public international law at the University of London and Norman A Martínez Gutiérrez, assistant professor at IMLI. Koji Sekimizu, former IMO Secretary- General, wrote the foreword to the manual. This book provides a comprehensive analysis of a very complex field of international law – that of the law of the sea, by discussing traditional and contemporary issues from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In its analysis, it uses various sources, such as treaty and customary international law, ‘’soft law’’ instruments, and court and commercial practice. Reference is also made to the relevant legal framework contained in the regional and national legislation. The main discussion is centered around the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC). In this respect, the book contains an in-depth study of a number of the LOSC provisions and jurisprudence. The book includes an introduction and 24 chapters, all of which have been written and edited by the leading experts in their respective fields. The introduction provides an overview of the historical development of the law of the sea, offering thereby a good foundation for further discussion on the modern law of the sea and the post-LOSC developments. The 24 chapters cover different legal regimes for the seas and oceans, largely following the LOSC zonal approach and structure. The book thus covers territorial sea and contiguous zone, straits used for international navigation, the regime of islands and rocks, archipelagic states, the continental shelf, the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, the international seabed area, marine scientific research, landlocked and <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>states,</b> and the settlement of disputes. Particular consideration is given to international law concerning maritime boundary delimitation. Other chapters examine new trends and challenges that have emerged in the post-LOSC era – for example, the legal status of the generic resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. In this respect, reference is made to the current discussions taking place in an ad hoc working group established by the United Nations General Assembly. Attention is further given to the recent developments in the field of marine scientific research, which show an increasing use of the satellites. In this regard, the book points to the possible creation of a new, hybrid, area of law, with the potential of the law of the sea and space law being merged in an innovative way. As a result of increasing concerns relating to global warming and climate change, including the rapid melting of a substantive amount of the ice in the polar regions, particular consideration is given to the legal regimes applicable in the Arctic and the Antarctic. The book covers other contemporary issues as well, such as the protection of underwater cultural heritage, and the interaction between the law of the sea and human rights. Special consideration is given to the LOSC settlement of disputes mechanism and the respective contributions of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The book moreover examines the role of the various international organisations in the progressive development of the law of the sea such as the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the International Maritime Organization. This book represents a significant contribution to the current literature in the field. It is intended to serve as a guide on various aspects of international law of the sea for an extensive group of users ranging from students, researchers and academics to practitioners and governmental officials...|$|E

40|$|A major {{aspect of}} {{globalization}} is that capital moves {{faster and more}} easily across national borders. Countries, it is argued, therefore compete more intensively for investment and are driven to converge on the most capital-accommodating policy, regardless of local preferences or factor endowments. A simple model of local preferences and cross-border competition for capital, characterized by Cournot equilibria among national policies, leads us to more nuanced conclusions, namely: 1) while capital mobility always induces policy convergence, and convergence increases {{with the number of}} countries, among unequal countries convergence is less pronounced in (a) <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged,</b> (b) richer, and (c) ex ante less capital-friendly countries; 2) paradoxically, among similar countries capital mobility is normally welfare-diminishing for the average citizen (though beneficial for owners of capital), and hence would presumably not be chosen under fully democratic governance; but 3) among unequal countries capital mobility is often welfare-improving for the average citizen of countries that are (a) geographically advantaged, (b) poor, or (c) initially friendlier to capital...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causal {{influence}} of export concentration {{on measures of}} aggregate volatility. <b>Geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> coun- tries often have a concentrated export structure which makes them more vulnerable to external shocks. Identifying causal effects of export concen- tration on volatility faces severe problems of endogeneity, however. Based on a gravity approach, we suggest an inequality decomposition method which allows {{the construction of an}} aggregate measure of export concen- tration where all of its components are determined entirely by countries' geographic characteristics. Since this measure is plausibly uncorrelated with other determinants of volatility, it is used as an instrument for ex- port concentration to obtain instrumental variables estimates of the effect of export concentration on volatility. Results from two-stage least squares instrumental variables regressions reveal that export concentration has a particularly strong effect on volatility in terms of trade and on volatility in export growth rates but we cannot confirm a casual influence on the volatility of exchange rates. ...|$|R

During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic polices, strengthening ties with the Soviet Union and China, while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a Marxist insurrection, which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a republic named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status.

The policy of standardisation by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment, which was in essence an affirmative action to assist <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> students to obtain tertiary education, resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy.

The results show that Billie can train humans as well as a human teacher can and that both adults and children accept the IVA as a trainer. The advantages of IVAs are multiple. First, their teaching methods can be based on neuropsychological research findings concerning memory and learning practice. Second, virtual teachers can provide individualized training. Third, they coach users during training, are always supportive, and motivate learners to train. Fourth, agents will reside in the user’s mobile devices and thus be at the user’s disposal everywhere and anytime.

40|$|This paper explores intra-state {{disparity}} in access to electricity and examines {{the determinants of}} electrification at the village level in Bihar, one of the underdeveloped states in India. Our field survey of 80 villages in 5 districts conducted in 2008 - 09 found that 48 villages (60 %) are electrified when using the definition of electrification that a village is electrified if any one household in the village is connected to electricity. In the processes of electrification, approximately 40 % of villages have been electrified in recent years. The econometric analyses demonstrate that location {{is the most important}} determinant of a village's electricity connection. Another important finding is that with the rapid progress of rural electrification under the recent government program and the tendency to connect the villages that are easily accessible, the collective bargaining power of the village, which used to significantly affect the process of electrification, has lost influence. This adversely affects remote villages. In order to extend electricity supplies to remote and <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> villages, the government needs to consider other options for sustainable electricity supply, such as decentralized distribution of electricity rather than the conventional connection through the national/local grids.

40|$|The {{conclusion}} that foreign aid will promote economic growth only when allocated towards good policy regimes {{has been the}} subject of considerable debate. Aid effectiveness researchers have variously sought to falsify this result or to find other individual conditions of aid effectiveness. However, economic theory suggests that any factor which influences the expected returns to investment may influence the effect of aid on growth even when aid is partly diverted to consumption. To investigate this hypothesis, “all ” of the hypothesized conditions of aid effectiveness are individually tested in a cross-country growth specification. From these tests the most significant and robust individual interactions are simultaneously modeled, thereby deriving multiple conditions of aid effectiveness. The paper concludes that aid is more effective in economies experiencing economic shocks or recovering from war, and less effective in countries which are <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> or at war. We also find a previously unidentified condition of aid ineffectiveness: the inflow of foreign direct investment. This finding renews a justified interest in the policy-aid-growth nexus, insofar as domestic policy determines the distribution of aid and FDI flow, which appear to act as substitutes in the growth process...|$|R

The Malmquist is appropriate because prices do really exist for major inputs such as land and labour. The small size of the cross section is overcome by using the sequential version of the Malmquist, which accumulates the annual data, so increasing {{the stability of the}} frontier. The regional MFPs are the natural peer group for producing a national MFP, so the problem of choosing peers, in earlier work on international comparisons does not arise. The results show that the national MFP grew at an average rate 1. 57 % per annum. However, disaggregation by enterprise shows that the livestock MFP declined at a rate of 0. 34 % per annum while that for crops grew at 3. 37 % per annum. Decomposition of the Malmquist shows that there was positive technological change combined with decreasing efficiency. Comparisons of the regional results show a very clear pattern whereby the advantaged regions are able to exploit new technologies whereas the resource poor, <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> areas have been stagnant and have thereby fallen further and further behind the best practice frontier.

50|$|In the 1970 {{election}} the United Front (UF) led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike {{came into}} power. The new government adopted two new policies that were considered discriminatory by the Tamil people. First, the government introduced a discriminatory system regulating university admissions, specifically targeted at reducing the intake of overachieving Tamils {{and other minorities}} in the Sri Lankan educational system. The scheme allotted up to 40% of the university placement to rural youth (primarily from Sinhala areas). The government claimed {{that this was an}} affirmative action scheme to assist <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> students to gain tertiary education. According to K. M. de Silva, a historian, the system of standardisation of marks required the Tamil students to achieve higher marks than the Sinhalese students to get into university. A similar policy was adapted for employment in the public sector, leaving less than 10 percent of civil service jobs available to Tamil speakers. The Federal Party opposed these policies and Chelvanayakam resigned his parliamentary seat in October 1972. The new constitution in 1972 further exacerbated long standing grievances and sense of discrimination for the Sri Lankan Tamil people. This had emboldened younger Tamils to seek ways to form a Tamil homeland (nation) where the rights and freedoms of the Tamil people could be protected and nurtured.|$|R

This is a characteristic that succinctly describes many of the emerging markets of the region. With insufficient resources in government budgets there has been a need and an increasing tendency to rely more on the private sector to build, maintain and manage infrastructure projects. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) represent a flexible institutional arrangement that allows {{the public and private sectors}} to share responsibility in achieving social objectives with specific responsibilities entrusted to the entity that can accomplish it most effectively. However, as with any other institutional structure, the devil is in the details, and in many of the transition economies in the 1990 s the details were not appropriately designed. This paper analyses what is required for governments to be able to effectively use this financial model. Seven lessons are provided based upon an analysis of many PPPs that have been implemented in a number of different sectors and countries. In addition, it is emphasized that the effective use of PPPs, which properly considers developmental objectives, can help society not only achieve the cost-effective provision of services but can also increase accessibility of services to the poor and to <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> regions.

Wine producers are mostly small and micro enterprises: the sector “is composed by an overwhelming majority of small producers, and is therefore extremely atomised in comparison with other food and drinks industries” (DG Agriculture). Often, small and micro wineries deal also with the specific-sector difficulties, related to territory – e. g. small size vineyards not always contiguous, often in terraces, labor-intensive, various grape typologies in small quantity. It is widely recognised that small wineries achieve better performance when they are networked or clustered, but often firms located in areas that are <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged,</b> have difficulties also in establishing relationships that are crucial for their survival. Isolation, limited access to learning opportunities against the need of a range of competences different from production - as a small business is still a business, characterise the target group.

40|$|Open and {{distance}} learning {{is seen as}} a viable alternative to provide ‘Education for all’, particularly in the context of developing countries. The open learning is basically a philosophy while distance learning is a method of flexible education for the unreached –socially, economically, physically and <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> groups of the society. In a skill oriented discipline like library and information science, the circumstantial disadvantaged group is another group for opportunity for continuing education to enhance and upgrade their skills. Various models of distance education, based on the application of technology have been developed. In India, 5 open universities and 60 correspondence departments in other universities offer such education, the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) at the apex. The paper analyses the efforts of IGNOU to reach the unreached. The models to be selected should be based on learner’s requirement, their capability and infrastructure available to them. Development of multimedia and simulated courseware together with internship will be able to produce successful LIS professionals. Preamble The developing countries of the world are facing with the problem of providing education to all section of their people. The problem is multiplied for nations like India where rate of population growth is very high, resulting in growth of illiteracy rate. The reducing of the gap between illiterates and literates will eventually reduce the gap between two groups of people – rich and poor and ultimately two groups of nations – developed and developing. Many programmes like ‘Education for All’, ‘Universal Educations’ etc., have been undertaken to address the problem.

40|$|Background: Sugar-sweetened {{beverage}} (SSB) {{consumption is}} associated with the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States; however, little is known about how less-healthy eating behaviors influence high levels of SSB consumption among rural adults. Objective: We assessed the frequency of SSB consumption among rural and urban adults, examined the correlates of frequent SSB consumption, and determined difference in correlates between rural and urban adults in a large region of Texas. Design: A cross-sectional study using data on 1, 878 adult participants (urban&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 734 and rural&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 1, 144), who were recruited by random digit dialing to participate in the seven-county 2006 Brazos Valley Community Health Assessment. Data included demographic characteristics, eating behaviors (SSB consumption, frequency of fast-food meals, frequency of breakfast meals, and daily fruit and vegetable intake), and household food insecurity. Results: The prevalence of any consumption of SSB and the prevalence of high consumption of SSB were significantly higher among rural adults compared with urban counterparts. The multivariable logistic regression models indicated that a high level of SSB consumption (&#x 2265; 3 cans or glasses SSB/day) was associated with demographic characteristics (poverty-level income and children in the home), frequent consumption of fast-food meals, infrequent breakfast meals, low fruit and vegetable intake, and household food insecurity especially among rural adults. Conclusions: This study provides impetus for understanding associations among multiple eating behaviors, especially among economically and <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> adults. New strategies are needed for educating consumers, not only about how to moderate their SSB intake, but also how to simultaneously disrupt the co-occurrence of undesirable eating and promote healthful eating...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: The {{analysis}} shows the geographical accessibility of library {{services to the}} population of the Coastal-Karst region and identifies gaps i. e. areas that are not covered or not adequately covered by library services. Methodology/approach: The analysis of accessibility of library services was conducted by comparing geographical locations of local libraries, travelling library stations and movable book collections according to the statistical data on population distribution in settlements in the Coastal-Karst area on the 1 st of January 2011. Results: The {{analysis shows}} that library services are provided in all municipalities in the Coastal-Karst region. However, 53. 5 % or 229 of all Coastal-Karst settlements remain uncovered or inadequately covered by library services, mostly {{in the area of the}} Kosovel Library of Sežana (105), followed by the Library of Koper with 72 villages and the Maksa Samsa Library of Ilirska Bistrica with 45 uncovered villages. On the other side the fact that only 21. 5 % of inhabitants are left out of library services is encouraging. The establishment of local libraries in Dekani, Sv. Anton and Ankaran and the introduction of an additional mobile library would raise the percentage of population served by the library activity by 18 points (from current 78 % to 96 %). In areas without organized library activities only 4 % of {{the population of the}} Coastal-Karst region would be left out. Research limitation: Access to services for users with special needs who are not able to approach the library by themselves will be considered separately.

50|$|Sirimavo Bandaranaike, {{the widow}} of Bandaranaike, took office as prime {{minister}} in 1960, and withstood an attempted coup d'état in 1962. During her second term as prime minister, the government instituted socialist economic polices, strengthening ties with the Soviet Union and China, while promoting a policy of non-alignment. In 1971, Ceylon experienced a Marxist insurrection, which was quickly suppressed. In 1972, the country became a republic named Sri Lanka, repudiating its dominion status. Prolonged minority grievances {{and the use of}} communal emotionalism as an election campaign weapon by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders abetted a fledgling Tamil militancy in the north during the 1970s. The policy of standardisation by the Sirimavo government to rectify disparities created in university enrolment, which was in essence an affirmative action to assist <b>geographically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> students to obtain tertiary education, resulted in reducing the proportion of Tamil students at university level and acted as the immediate catalyst for the rise of militancy. The assassination of Jaffna Mayor Alfred Duraiyappah in 1975 by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) marked a crisis point. The government of J. R. Jayawardene swept to power in 1977, defeating the largely unpopular United Front government. Jayawardene introduced a new constitution, together with a free-market economy and a powerful executive presidency modelled after that of France. It made Sri Lanka the first South Asian country to liberalise its economy. Beginning in 1983, ethnic tensions were manifested in an on-and-off insurgency against the government by the LTTE. An LTTE attack on 13 soldiers resulted in the anti-Tamil race riots in July 1983, allegedly backed by Sinhalese hard-line ministers, which resulted in more than 150,000 Tamil civilians fleeing the island, seeking asylum in other countries.|$|R

In the majority of low and middle-income countries (LMICs), healthcare inequalities are further aggravated by Out of Pocket Expenditure (OOPE). This paper examines the pattern of health equity and regional disparities in healthcare spending among Indian states by applying Andersen 2 ̆ 019 s behavioural model of healthcare utilization. Methods The present study uses data from the 66 th quinquennial round of Consumer Expenditure Survey, of the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO), conducted in 20092 ̆ 01310 by Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), Government of India (GoI). To measure equity and regional disparities in healthcare expenditure, states have been categorized under three heads on the basis of monthly OOPE i. e., Category A (OOPE 2 ̆ 009 > 2 ̆ 009 =INR 100); Category B (OOPE between INR 50 to 99) and Category C (OOPE 2 ̆ 009 < 2 ̆ 009 INR 50). Multiple Generalised Linear Regression Model (GLRM) has been employed to explore the effect of various socio-economic covariates on the level of OOPE. Results The gap in the ratio of average healthcare spending between the poorest and richest households was maximum in Category A states (richest/poorest 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00914. 60), followed by Category B (richest/poorest 11. 70) and Category C (richest/poorest 11. 40). Results also indicate geographical concentration of lower level healthcare spending among Indian states (e. g., Odisha, Chhattisgarh and all the north-eastern states). Results from the multivariate analysis suggest that people residing in urban areas, having higher economic status, belonging to non-Muslim communities, non-Scheduled Tribes (STs), and non-poor households spend more on healthcare than their counterparts. Conclusions In spite of various efforts by the government to reduce the burden of healthcare spending, widespread inequalities in healthcare expenditure are prevalent. Households with high healthcare needs (SCs/STs, and the poor) are in a more disadvantaged position in terms of spending on health care. It has also been observed that spending on healthcare was comparatively lower among backward or isolated states. No doubt, the overall social security measures should be enhanced, but at the same time, looking at the regional differences, more priority should be assigned to the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>states</b> to reduce the burden of OOPE. It is proposed that there is need to increase government spending, especially for the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>states</b> and population, to minimise the burden of OOPE...|$|R
