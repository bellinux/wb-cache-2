500|$|In 2004, President Bush {{dismissed}} Arafat as {{a negotiating}} partner, {{saying he had}} [...] "failed as a leader" [...] and accused him of undercutting Abbas when he was prime minister (Abbas resigned the same year {{he was given the}} position). Arafat had a mixed relationship with the leaders of other Arab nations. His support from Arab leaders tended to increase whenever he was pressured by Israel; for example, when Israel declared in 2003 it had made the decision, in principle, to remove him from the Israeli-controlled West Bank. In an interview with the Arabic news network Al Jazeera, Arafat responded to Ariel Sharon's suggestion that he be exiled from the Palestinian territories permanently, by stating, [...] "Is it his [...] homeland or ours? We were planted here before the Prophet Abraham came, but <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> [...] don't understand history or geography." ...|$|E

[...] The other said, [...] "mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me."

Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the bodyhe stated that the girl was white when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.|$|E

When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances.
