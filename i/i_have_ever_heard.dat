5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
25|$|The {{audience}} {{broke into}} applause... John Philip Sousa : ', {{that is a}} band. This {{is the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> music with any soul to it produced by a mechanical talking machine'... The new instrument is a feat of mathematics and physics. It is not the result of innumerable experiments, but was worked out on paper in advance of being built in the laboratory... The new machine has a range of from 100 to 5,000 , or five and a half octaves... The 'phonograph tone' is eliminated by the new recording and reproducing process.|$|E

500|$|Critics reacted {{favorably to}} the Borg, {{describing}} them as akin to creatures from Hellraiser. Renzetti credited them with breathing [...] "new life" [...] into {{the crew of}} the Enterprise while simultaneously trying to kill them. The Borg Queen received special attention for her combination of horror and seduction; Ebert wrote that while the Queen [...] "looks like no notion of sexy <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of", he was inspired [...] "to keep an open mind". Carr said, [...] "She proves that women with filmy blue skin, lots of external tubing and bad teeth can be sleekly seductive." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Kelly {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} Australia's best singer-songwriters. His music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output comfortably straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture Australia's vastness both in culture and landscape; he has chronicled life about him for over 30 years and is described as the poet laureate of Australia. According to music writer Glenn A. Baker, his Australian-ness may be a reason Kelly has not achieved international success. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly [...] "one of the finest songwriters <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> Australian or otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Maurice Kelly [...] (born 13 January 1955) is an Australian {{rock music}} singer-songwriter, guitarist, and {{harmonica}} player. He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He {{has worked with}} other artists and groups, including associated projects Professor Ratbaggy and Stardust Five. Kelly's music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture {{the vastness of the}} culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly [...] "one of the finest songwriters <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> Australian or otherwise." [...] Kelly has said, [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet".|$|E
60|$|It was {{the longest}} speech <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> the man make, {{and it seemed to}} impress Bill. He was quite humble.|$|R
60|$|I {{was forced}} in truth {{to say that}} the only fears which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> {{expressed}} were lest he should not get across.|$|R

500|$|At the Old Bailey {{one of the}} {{principal}} crown witnesses was firearms expert Robert Churchill, who testified that the trigger of Mrs Barney's gun had a strong pull. When Hastings rose to cross-examine, he took up the gun, pointed it to the ceiling and repeatedly pulled the trigger over and over again. One crown witness had said that on another occasion she saw Elvira Barney firing the gun while holding it in her left hand; when he called his client Hastings had the gun placed in front of her. After a pause he shouted at her to pick up the gun and she spontaneously picked it up in her right hand. The Judge (Mr Justice Humphreys) described Hastings' final address as [...] "certainly one of the finest speeches <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> at the Bar" [...] and Elvira Barney was found not guilty both of murder and manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster {{who uses}} wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end {{disputes}} verbally instead of by force. He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's {{got to be the}} best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: [...] "Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{penetration of}} southern Florida offered {{the opportunity to}} map a poorly understood part of the country. As late as 1823, official reports doubted {{the existence of a}} large inland lake, until the military met the Seminoles at the Battle of Lake Okeechobee in 1837. To avenge repeated surprise attacks on himself and ammunition stores, Colonel William Harney led an expedition into the Everglades in 1840, to hunt for a chief named Chekika. With Harney were 90soldiers in 16canoes. One soldier's account of the trip in the St. Augustine News was the first printed description of the Everglades available to the general public. The anonymous writer described the hunt for Chekika and the terrain they were crossing: [...] "No country that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of bears any resemblance to it; it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees, and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally Indian, from which the white man would never seek to drive them".|$|E

6000|$|He {{turned his}} face to me, smiling; and inquired if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> the phrase, [...] "the eyelids of the dawn." [...] "There's Night, too," [...] he said.|$|R

500|$|Ryan {{signed a}} five-album record deal with SYCOmusic {{as part of}} Columbia Records on September 18, 2006. She was the first U.S. artist to sign with SYCOmusic; during the press conference, Simon Cowell called Ryan [...] "potentially {{one of the best}} singers <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> in my life." [...] The {{following}} month, Ryan was in Los Angeles to record her first CD. The self-titled debut was released on November 14, 2006, featuring cover versions of [...] "The Rose" [...] and [...] "I Believe I Can Fly", and original songs like [...] "I Wish That" [...] and [...] "Pray for a Better Day". Eight days later, the album debuted at No. 57 on the Billboard album charts, showcasing [...] "her gargantuan chops and sweet charm". Matt Collar of AllMusic added that the arrangements were [...] "grandiose" [...] for someone of Ryan's age, but they were [...] "more than matched by her truly impressive vocal talent." [...] Los Angeles Daily News reviewer Sandra Barrera wrote that Ryan handled the songs [...] "like the old pro that her big, powerful voice makes you think she is".|$|E
500|$|... "We're from America" [...] is {{the most}} overtly {{political}} song on the album, referencing various aspects of neoconservatism in its lyrics, such as pro-war and anti-abortion rhetoric. [...] "I Have to Look Up Just to See Hell" [...] was described by The Quietus as a [...] "maggot-infested ride into the trough of melancholy." [...] The penultimate track, [...] "Into the Fire", portrays the vocalists' mental state on Christmas Day—wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to contact Wood 158 times, and cut himself on the hands or face with a razorblade for each corresponding attempt. It was the original album closer, with Manson describing it as a [...] "glorious epic that I think will make Twiggy forever recognized as a guitar hero." [...] The album's final song, [...] "15", was completed on Manson's January 5 birthday. He called it [...] "the most important song that's been written by Marilyn Manson as an entity. It's the most unusual song <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> I thought that the album was done, [...] but {{what was happening in}} my life had not resolved itself. So on January 5, one five, I sang '15', and the lyrics tell the story of that day." ...|$|E

60|$|Was it sad or glad? I don't know, {{but it was}} {{the most}} {{beautiful}} sound <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> yet it seemed familiar and stirred me in the strangest way.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> Karl Marx's* {{doctrine}} of surplus value elaborated, and Ernest had done it so simply that I, too, sat puzzled and dumbfounded.|$|R

2500|$|Attack drew right {{alongside}} Aragon to take survivors aboard {{as quickly}} as possible, helped by lines cast between the two ships. The troop ship sank rapidly by the stern. More than one survivor stated that soldiers waiting on deck to be rescued started singing. One said [...] "I have heard the chorus 'Keep the Home Fires Burning' on many occasions but I don't think that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> it given with so much power".|$|E
2500|$|He {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{brilliant}} and unscrupulous orators <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> He presented a fine appearance, graceful in every action charming in rhetoric and utterly reckless in assertion. I have heard him both as a temperance and political orator, and I doubt whether during his day any person in either party of the State surpassed him on the hustings. He was elected by a good majority and was re-elected in 1846 and '48, thus serving six consecutive years as a representative from the city.|$|E
2500|$|Henry McBride (art {{critic for}} the New York Sun) did much for Stein's {{reputation}} in the United States, publicizing her art acquisitions and her importance as a cultural figure. Of the art collection at 27 Rue de Fleurus, McBride commented: [...] "n proportion to its size and quality... just about the most potent of any that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of in history." [...] McBride also made the observation that Gertrude [...] "collected geniuses rather than masterpieces. She recognized them a long way off." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sprang up}} at the same moment. All the suspicions <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> whispered against his sanity flashed over my mind in an instant, and I involuntarily stepped back a pace or two.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} <b>I</b> should {{certainly}} <b>have</b> decided on stopping my ears, if Rachel had not {{encouraged me to}} keep them open, by answering {{him in the first}} sensible words <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> fall from her lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "I redoubled my efforts. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not been}} brought up {{to this sort of}} thing; but I believe I eclipsed myself. Words that I did not know <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of seemed to come pouring out of my open mouth.|$|R
2500|$|Unknown to Custer, {{the group}} of Native Americans seen on his trail was {{actually}} leaving the encampment and did not alert {{the rest of the}} village. Custer's scouts warned him {{about the size of the}} village, with Mitch Bouyer reportedly saying, [...] "General, I have been with these Indians for 30 years, and this is the largest village <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of." [...] Custer's overriding concern was that the Native American group would break up and scatter. The command began its approach to the village at noon and prepared to attack in full daylight.|$|E
2500|$|David Lloyd George said of Gladstone in 1915: [...] "What {{a man he}} was! Head and {{shoulders}} above anyone else I have ever seen in the House of Commons. I did not like him much. He hated Nonconformists and Welsh Nonconformists in particular, {{and he had no}} real sympathy with the working-classes. But he was far and away the best Parliamentary speaker <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> He was not so good in exposition." [...] Asquithian Liberals continued to advocate traditional Gladstonian policies of sound finance, peaceful foreign relations and the better treatment of Ireland. They often compared Lloyd George unfavourably with Gladstone.|$|E
2500|$|Gaye had a three-octave vocal range. From {{his earlier}} {{recordings}} as {{member of the}} Marquees and Harvey and the New Moonglows, and in his first several recordings with Motown, Gaye recorded mainly in the baritone and tenor ranges. He changed his tone to a rasp for his gospel-inspired early hits such as [...] "Stubborn Kind of Fellow" [...] and [...] "Hitch Hike". As writer Eddie Holland explained, [...] "He was the only singer <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, and do {{whatever it took to}} sell that song." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{he told me}} {{amazed me}} beyond {{anything}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard,</b> even from himself, and {{what he told me}} he illustrated, flinging himself into the poises taught by Marozzo that I might appreciate the marvellous science of the thing.|$|R
60|$|This was {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> this {{political}} blarney with my own ears, though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> understood it was often used by those who wish to give to their own particular envy and covetousness a grand and sounding air.|$|R
60|$|A {{lamp and}} matches {{stood in the}} hall, and {{lighting}} the lamp, I whisked up stairs with suspicious rapidity, locked my door and retired to bed, firmly refusing to own even to myself that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> the name of Bezee Tucker.|$|R
