The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E

She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber or plastic. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them.
