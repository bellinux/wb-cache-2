5|$|Although English is {{the common}} {{language}} of Westeros, the producers charged linguist David J. Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the novels; Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English.

5|$|During the {{economic}} {{expansion of the}} 1830s, <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> German immigration to St. Louis increased substantially. In particular, the writings of Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration. Many Irish were motivated by the Irish potato famine of 1845–1846 and the failed Irish uprising of 1848.

5|$|Even as the {{building}} was under construction, the ethnic makeup of the church's neighborhood was rapidly changing; native-born Baptists were displaced by <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> German immigrants.

The departing Baptist congregation founded the Fifth Avenue Baptist church, then founded the Park Avenue Church, and finally built the Riverside Church.|$|E
