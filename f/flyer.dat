5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong <b>flyer,</b> and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong <b>flyer,</b> vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E

On 3 April, Braathens SAFE, Transwede and Finnair signed an agreement involving codesharing on Finnair's flights from Stockholm and Oslo to Helsinki, Bracard members would be granted points on Finnair flights, and Braathens SAFE took over Finnair's handling services in Oslo.|$|E

40|$|Attract-and-kill tactics {{for control}} of house <b>flies</b> (Musca domestica) often use {{foraging}} cues as attractants. To investigate foraging resources for indoor attraction of house <b>flies,</b> I tested the response of <b>flies</b> to various human foods and a floral resource. In two-choice laboratory bioassays, only dandelion flowers and dandelion honey attracted <b>flies.</b> Analytical attempts to capture the essential semiochemicals from these resources failed, highlighting {{the need to develop}} alternative approaches. Another potentially effective foraging cue is the “fly factor”, the phenomenon that food currently or previously fed on by <b>flies</b> attracts more <b>flies</b> than the same type of food kept inaccessible to <b>flies.</b> In two-choice laboratory bioassays, I demonstrate that the <b>fly</b> factor exists in house <b>flies.</b> Of the mechanisms tested potentially causing the <b>fly</b> factor, only <b>fly</b> feces and regurgitate attract <b>flies.</b> Attraction of <b>flies</b> to <b>fly</b> feces and regurgitate indicates that <b>flies</b> sense airborne semiochemicals emanating from these sources...|$|R

The <b>fly</b> man can also be a stage manager in a small theater.

The <b>fly</b> man supervises the loading and unloading of counterweights in a <b>fly</b> system.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Braathens signed {{agreements}} {{with many of}} the large companies in Norway as a prioritized airline.

5|$|On October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, {{the wife}} of the brothers' European {{business}} agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur—one of many passengers who rode with him that autumn. Wilbur also became acquainted with Léon Bollée and his family. Bollée was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the <b>Flyer</b> and where he would be provided with hired assistance. Bollée would fly that autumn with Wilbur. Madame Bollée had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in LeMans in June 1908 to assemble the <b>Flyer.</b> Wilbur promised her that he would make his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did, August 8, 1908.|$|E
5|$|The American kestrel is {{a common}} bird used in falconry, {{especially}} by beginners.

5|$|After the men {{hauled the}} <b>Flyer</b> back from its fourth flight, a {{powerful}} {{gust of wind}} flipped it over several times, despite the crew's attempt to hold it down. Severely damaged, the airplane never flew again. The brothers shipped it home, and years later Orville restored it, lending it to several U.S. locations for display, then to a British museum (see Smithsonian dispute below), before it was finally installed in 1948 in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., its current residence.|$|E
40|$|The face <b>fly</b> congregates {{about the}} eyes and nose of animals, causing {{annoyance}} and possible disease transmission. This NebGuide discusses face <b>fly</b> breeding and effective controls. The face <b>fly</b> closely resembles the house <b>fly</b> except it is slightly larger and darker. Other differentiating characteristics include: 1) the abdomen of the male face <b>fly</b> is orange and the female has an orange stripe; the abdomen of the house <b>fly</b> is white or light grey and 2) the compound eyes of male face <b>flies</b> nearly touch but are separated in the house <b>flies.</b> The persistence and habit of congregating about {{the eyes and}} nose of animals helps distinguish the face <b>fly</b> from the house <b>fly</b> in the field.
