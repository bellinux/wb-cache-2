5|$|The Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem, {{published}} in 1968, {{shows that in}} a given universe, if all freely falling observers measure the cosmic background radiation to have exactly the same properties in all directions (that is, they measure the background radiation to be isotropic), then that universe is an isotropic and homogeneous Friedmann–Lemaître spacetime. Cosmic <b>isotropy</b> and homogeneity are important as they are {{the basis of the}} modern standard model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed <b>isotropy</b> of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
5|$|The horizon problem {{results from}} the premise that {{information}} cannot travel faster than light. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the particle horizon—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in causal contact. The observed <b>isotropy</b> of the CMB is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions {{to have the same}} temperature.|$|E
5|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that empty space was filled with a {{background}} medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore {{it should be possible to}} measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the <b>isotropy</b> of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.|$|E
5|$|Second, all {{solutions}} {{suggest that}} there was a gravitational singularity in the past, when R went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because {{it is based on the}} questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and <b>isotropy</b> (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} <b>isotropy</b> of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and <b>isotropy</b> of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E
25|$|Stress {{birefringence}} {{results when}} isotropic materials are stressed or deformed (i.e., stretched or bent) causing {{a loss of}} physical <b>isotropy</b> and consequently a loss of <b>isotropy</b> in the material's permittivity tensor.|$|E
25|$|For {{non-linear}} media, E and D are not proportional. Materials {{can have}} varying extents of linearity, homogeneity and <b>isotropy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hughes–Drever {{experiments}} (also clock comparison-, clock anisotropy-, mass isotropy-, {{or energy}} <b>isotropy</b> experiments) are spectroscopic {{tests of the}} <b>isotropy</b> of mass and space. Although originally conceived of {{as a test of}} Mach's principle, it is now understood to be an important test of Lorentz invariance. As in Michelson–Morley experiments, the existence of a preferred frame of reference or other deviations from Lorentz invariance can be tested, which also affects the validity of the equivalence principle. Thus these experiments concern fundamental aspects of both special and general relativity. Unlike Michelson–Morley type experiments, Hughes–Drever experiments test the <b>isotropy</b> of the interactions of matter itself, that is, of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The accuracy achieved makes this kind of experiment one of the most accurate confirmations of relativity (see also Tests of special relativity).|$|E
25|$|When the {{universal}} covering orbihedron is non-positively curved the fundamental group is infinite and {{is generated by}} isomorphic copies of the <b>isotropy</b> groups. This follows from the corresponding result for orbispaces.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{mentioned}} {{variations of}} Michelson–Morley and Kennedy–Thorndike experiments, Hughes–Drever experiments {{are continuing to}} be conducted for <b>isotropy</b> tests in the proton and neutron sector. To detect possible deviations in the electron sector, spin-polarized torsion balances are used.|$|E
25|$|The {{derivation}} {{of special}} relativity depends {{not only on}} these two explicit postulates, but also on several tacit assumptions (made in almost all theories of physics), including the <b>isotropy</b> and homogeneity of space and the independence of measuring rods and clocks from their past history.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>isotropy</b> {{experiments}} are the Mössbauer rotor {{experiments in the}} 1960s, by which the anisotropy of the Doppler effect on a rotating disc can be observed by using the Mössbauer effect (those experiments {{can also be utilized}} to measure time dilation, see below).|$|E
25|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is generally}} considered the solution to all negative aether drift (or <b>isotropy</b> {{of the speed of}} light) measurements, including the Michelson–Morley null result. Many high precision measurements have been conducted as tests of special relativity and modern searches for Lorentz violation in the photon, electron, nucleon, or neutrino sector, all of them confirming relativity.|$|E
25|$|The main {{example of}} {{underlying}} space is a quotient {{space of a}} manifold under the properly discontinuous action of a possibly infinite group of diffeomorphisms with finite <b>isotropy</b> subgroups. In particular this applies to any action of a finite group; thus a manifold with boundary carries a natural orbifold structure, {{since it is the}} quotient of its double by an action of Z2.|$|E
25|$|Like a manifold, an orbifold is {{specified}} by local conditions; however, {{instead of being}} locally modelled on open subsets of Rn, an orbifold is locally modelled on quotients of open subsets of Rn by finite group actions. The structure of an orbifold encodes not only that of the underlying quotient space, which {{need not be a}} manifold, but also that of the <b>isotropy</b> subgroups.|$|E
25|$|Elliptic {{geometry}} is {{also like}} Euclidean geometry in that space is continuous, homogeneous, isotropic, and without boundaries. <b>Isotropy</b> is {{guaranteed by the}} fourth postulate, that all right angles are equal. For an example of homogeneity, note that Euclid's proposition I.1 implies that the same equilateral triangle can be constructed at any location, not just in locations that are special in some way. The lack of boundaries follows from the second postulate, extensibility of a line segment.|$|E
25|$|From the {{principle}} of relativity alone without assuming the constancy {{of the speed of}} light (i.e. using the <b>isotropy</b> of space and the symmetry implied by {{the principle}} of special relativity) one can show that the spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either Euclidean, Galilean, or Lorentzian. In the Lorentzian case, one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and a certain finite limiting speed. Experiments suggest that this speed is the speed of light in vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{variants}} of Michelson-Morley and Kennedy–Thorndike experiments {{have been conducted}} {{in order to test}} the <b>isotropy</b> of the speed of light. Contrary to Michelson-Morley, the Kennedy-Thorndike experiments employ different arm lengths, and the evaluations last several months. In that way, the influence of different velocities during Earth's orbit around the sun can be observed. Laser, maser and optical resonators are used, reducing the possibility of any anisotropy of the speed of light to the 10−17 level. In addition to terrestrial tests, Lunar Laser Ranging Experiments have also been conducted as a variation of the Kennedy-Thorndike-experiment.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{derivation}} of the Lorentz transformation, {{the combination}} of these experiments is also important because they can be interpreted in different ways when viewed individually. For example, <b>isotropy</b> experiments such as Michelson-Morley {{can be seen as a}} simple consequence of the relativity principle, according to which any inertially moving observer can consider himself as at rest. Therefore, by itself, the MM experiment is compatible to Galilean-invariant theories like emission theory or the complete aether drag hypothesis, which also contain some sort of relativity principle. However, when other experiments that exclude the Galilean-invariant theories are considered (i.e. the Ives–Stilwell experiment, various refutations of emission theories and refutations of complete aether dragging), Lorentz-invariant theories and thus special relativity are the only theories that remain viable.|$|E
25|$|For {{applications}} in geometric group theory, {{it is often}} convenient to have a slightly more general notion of orbifold, due to Haefliger. An orbispace is to topological spaces what an orbifold is to manifolds. An orbispace is a topological generalization of the orbifold concept. It is defined by replacing {{the model for the}} orbifold charts by a locally compact space with a rigid action of a finite group, i.e. one for which points with trivial <b>isotropy</b> are dense. (This condition is automatically satisfied by faithful linear actions, because the points fixed by any non-trivial group element form a proper linear subspace.) It is also useful to consider metric space structures on an orbispace, given by invariant metrics on the orbispace charts for which the gluing maps preserve distance. In this case each orbispace chart is usually required to be a length space with unique geodesics connecting any two points.|$|E
25|$|Many {{terrestrial}} {{experiments have}} been conducted, mostly with optical resonators or in particle accelerators, by which {{deviations from the}} <b>isotropy</b> {{of the speed of}} light are tested. Anisotropy parameters are given, for instance, by the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory (RMS). This allows for distinction between the relevant orientation and velocity dependent parameters. In modern variants of the Michelson–Morley experiment, the dependence of light speed on the orientation of the apparatus and the relation of longitudinal and transverse lengths of bodies in motion is analyzed. Also modern variants of the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment, by which the dependence of light speed on the velocity of the apparatus and the relation of time dilation and length contraction is analyzed, have been conducted. The current precision, by which an anisotropy of the speed of light can be excluded, is at the 10−17 level. This is related to the relative velocity between the solar system and the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background radiation of ∼368km/s (see also Resonator Michelson–Morley experiments).|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of other}} {{experiments}} {{not based on}} the Michelson–Morley principle, i.e. non-optical <b>isotropy</b> tests achieving an even higher level of precision, are Clock comparison or Hughes–Drever experiments. In Drever's 1961 experiment, 7Li nuclei in the ground state, which has total angular momentum J=3/2, were split into four equally spaced levels by a magnetic field. Each transition between a pair of adjacent levels should emit a photon of equal frequency, resulting in a single, sharp spectral line. However, since the nuclear wave functions for different MJ have different orientations in space relative to the magnetic field, any orientation dependence, whether from an aether wind or from a dependence on the large-scale distribution of mass in space (see Mach's principle), would perturb the energy spacings between the four levels, resulting in an anomalous broadening or splitting of the line. No such broadening was observed. Modern repeats {{of this kind of}} experiment have provided some of the most accurate confirmations of the principle of Lorentz invariance.|$|E
25|$|There {{were some}} {{attempts}} to derive the Lorentz transformation without the postulate of the constancy {{of the speed}} of light. Vladimir Ignatowski (1910) for example used for this purpose (a) the principle of relativity, (b) homogeneity and <b>isotropy</b> of space, and (c) the requirement of reciprocity. Philipp Frank and Hermann Rothe (1911) argued that this derivation is incomplete and needs additional assumptions. Their own calculation was based on the assumptions that: (a) the Lorentz transformation forms a homogeneous linear group, (b) when changing frames, only the sign of the relative speed changes, (c) length contraction solely depends on the relative speed. However, according to Pauli and Miller such models were insufficient to identify the invariant speed in their transformation with the speed of light— for example, Ignatowski was forced to seek recourse in electrodynamics to include the speed of light. So Pauli and others argued that both postulates are needed to derive the Lorentz transformation. However, until today, others continued the attempts to derive special relativity without the light postulate.|$|E
25|$|Tests {{of general}} {{relativity}} on the largest scales are not nearly so stringent as Solar System tests. The earliest such test was prediction and discovery of {{the expansion of the}} universe. In 1922, Alexander Friedmann found that Einstein equations have non-stationary solutions (even {{in the presence of the}} cosmological constant). In 1927, Georges Lemaître showed that static solutions of the Einstein equations, which are possible in the presence of the cosmological constant, are unstable, and therefore the static universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist (it must either expand or contract). Lemaître made an explicit prediction that the universe should expand. He also derived a redshift-distance relationship, which is now known as the Hubble Law. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with the results of Friedmann and Lemaître. The expansion of the universe discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929 was then considered by many (and continues to be considered by some now) as a direct confirmation {{of general relativity}}. In the 1930s, largely due to the work of E. A. Milne, it was realised that the linear relationship between redshift and distance derives from the general assumption of uniformity and <b>isotropy</b> rather than specifically from general relativity. However the prediction of a non-static universe was non-trivial, indeed dramatic, and primarily motivated by general relativity.|$|E
500|$|The Big Bang theory {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} explanation {{for a broad}} range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the CMB, large scale structure, and Hubble's Law. The framework for the Big Bang model relies on Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and <b>isotropy</b> of space. The governing equations were formulated by Alexander Friedmann, and similar solutions were worked on by Willem de Sitter. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its parametrization as the Lambda-CDM model serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current [...] "standard model" [...] of Big Bang cosmology, consensus is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and observations relevant to cosmology.|$|E
