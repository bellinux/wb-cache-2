40|$|The stone surface {{treatment}} with water jet is a recently introduced method. It {{is used to}} increase the roughness to improve its antislip properties while preserving esthetic appearance of the stone without having thermal shock, mechanical stress {{and the production of}} fumes and <b>dust.</b> <b>Nozzle</b> angle is one of the important parameters affecting treatment of surface. This study is an attempt to assess the effect of nozzle angle on {{surface treatment}} quality with water jet and to determine the most suitable nozzle angle value. For this purpose, surfaces of Sardinian Basalt samples are treated with pure water jet in six different nozzle angles (15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees and 90 degrees). The roughness is measured on all the treated surfaces by various roughness parameters. The experimental studies showed that treatment with nozzle angle between 30 degrees and 75 degrees gives the surfaces with similar regular variation...|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of scroll saws offer a small {{light on a}} flexible arm that illuminates the work area and a <b>dust</b> blower <b>nozzle</b> to keep the work space clear while working. Table-tilting enables angled cuts to be made precisely and easily. Variable-speed support allows even finer control over cuts when working with delicate materials or when making intricate cuts.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{standard}} <b>dust</b> dispersers, rebound <b>nozzle</b> and annular nozzle, in the 20 L explosion vessel on the particle integrity has been quantified. Dispersion testswere run and measurements of the particle size before and after dispersion and of the elastic recovery of the materialswere performed. The {{effect of the}} dispersion pressure was also studied. Different dustswere tested: lycopodium, nicotinic acid, ascorbic acid, anthraquinone, active carbon, and paracetamol. Results show that particle breakage occurs at any conditions for all the dusts investigated, except for lycopodium. It is also found that dispersion through the rebound nozzle generates a more significant variation in particle size than dispersion through the annular nozzle. Furthermore, higher fractional loss is observed with increasing dispersion pressure. All {{these results suggest that}} the measurement of the explosion and flammability parameters according to the standard procedure may lead to misleading results. Thus, a novel dust dispersion method should be proposed in order to avoid failure in measurement of dust explosion/flammability parameters...|$|R
