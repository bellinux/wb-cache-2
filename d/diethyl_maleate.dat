In these conditions it inhibits protein synthesis and it impairs the "L" system for amino acid transport. It has, however, {{no effect on the}} cytochrome P- 450 content or its dependent aldrin monooxygenase.

40|$|Formaldehyde can be {{oxidized}} {{primarily by}} two different enzymes, the low-Km mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase and the cytosolic GSH-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Experiments {{were carried out}} to evaluate the effects of <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> or phorone, agents that deplete GSH from the liver, on the oxidation of formaldehyde. The addition of <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> or phorone to intact mitochondria or to disrupted mitochondrial fractions produced inhibition of formaldehyde oxidation. The kinetics of inhibition of the low-Km mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase were mixed. Mitochondria isolated from rats treated in vivo with <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> or phorone had a decreased capacity to oxidize either formaldehyde or acetaldehyde. The activity of the low-Km, but not the high-Km, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase was also inhibited. The production of CO 2 plus formate from 0. 2 mM-[14 C]formaldehyde by isolated hepatocytes was only slightly inhibited (15 - 30 %) by incubation with <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> or addition of cyanamide, suggesting oxidation primarily via formaldehyde dehydrogenase. However, the production of CO 2 plus formate was increased 2. 5 -fold when the concentration of [14 C]formaldehyde was raised to 1 mM. This increase in product formation at higher formaldehyde concentrations was much more sensitive to inhibition by <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> or cyanamide, suggesting an important contribution by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase. Thus <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> and phorone, besides depleting GSH, can also serve as effective inhibitors in vivo or in vitro of the low-Km mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase.

40|$|Administration of allylisopropylacetamide to rats {{caused a}} marked {{decline in the}} {{concentrations}} of reduced and oxidized glutathione in the liver. However, this decrease occurred {{in the presence of}} uninhibited activities of γ-glutamylcysteine synthase and glutathione reductase, and unaltered activities of glutathione transferases A, B and C. The administration of cysteine, the rate-limiting precursor of glutathione formation, to rats treated with allylisopropylacetamide potentiated the inductive effects of the agent on 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase, and markedly decreased the extent of decrease in glutathione concentrations by the agent. Conversely, the administration of <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate,</b> which depletes the hepatic glutathione concentrations, to allylisopropylacetamide-pretreated rats (1 h) diminished the extent of 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase induction and the production of porphyrins by nearly 50 %, when measured at 16 h. This treatment did not alter the extent of non-enzymic degradation of liver haem by allylisopropylacetamide. When <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> was administered to the animals possessing high 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase activity (at 3, 7 and 15 h after allylisopropylacetamide), in 1 h the enzyme activity was markedly decreased. <b>Diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> had no effect on induction of 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase by 3, 5 -diethoxycarbonyl- 1, 4 -dihydrocollidine, also a potent porphyrinogenic agent. <b>Diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> alone neither inhibited 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase activity nor decreased the cellular content of porphyrins and haem. The data suggest that the decreases observed in the glutathione concentrations after allylisopropylacetamide administration are not the result of decreased production of the tripeptide. Rather, they most likely reflect the increased utilization of glutathione. The findings further suggest that the inhibition by <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> of allylisopropylacetamide-stimulated 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase involves the inhibition of induction processes...|$|E

In the present study, we searched for novel target genes associated with the zebrafish Nrf 2 to answer this question. A microarray analysis of zebrafish embryos that overexpressed Nrf 2 revealed that 115 candidate genes were targets of Nrf 2, including genes encoding proteasome subunits and enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. A real-time quantitative PCR suggested that the expression of 3 proteasome subunits (psma 3, psma 5, and psmb 7) and 2 enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (pgd and fbp 1 a) were regulated by zebrafish Nrf 2.

In mouse spermatocytes and spermatids, diffuse labeling of PRDX 2 was observed in the cytoplasm and residual bodies. After spermiation PRDX 2 localization became confined to the mitochondrial sheath of the sperm tail midpiece. Boar spermatozoa displayed similar PRDX 2 localization as in mouse spermatozoa.

40|$|Glutathione (γ-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine, GSH) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} low molecular weight, thiol-containing compound within the cells and has a primary role in the antioxidant defense and intracellular signaling. Here we demonstrated that nutrient deprivation led to a significant decrease of intracellular GSH levels in three different carcinoma cell lines. This phenomenon was dependent on ABCC 1 -mediated GSH extrusion, along with GCL inhibition and, to a minor extent, the formation of GSH-protein mixed disulfides that synergistically contributed to the modulation of autophagy by shifting the intracellular redox state toward more oxidizing conditions. Modulation of intracellular GSH by inhibiting its de novo synthesis through incubation with buthionine sulfoximine, or by maintaining its levels through GSH ethyl ester, affected the oxidation of protein thiols, such as PRDXs and consequently the kinetics of autophagy activation. We also demonstrated that thiol-oxidizing or -alkylating agents, such as diamide and <b>diethyl</b> <b>maleate</b> activated autophagy, corroborating the evidence that changes in thiol redox state contributed to the occurrence of autophagy...|$|E
