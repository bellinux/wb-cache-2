5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E
5|$|Norovirus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{gastroenteritis}} {{among adults}} in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when {{groups of people}} spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants.

5|$|TBI is {{a leading}} cause of death and {{disability}} around the globe and presents a major worldwide social, economic, and health problem. It is the number one cause of coma, it plays the leading role in disability due to trauma, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> brain damage in children and young adults. In Europe it is responsible for more years of disability than any other cause. It also plays a significant role in half of trauma deaths.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular disease <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death (30%) amongst {{women in}} the United States, and {{the leading cause of}} chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic {{by a lack of}} the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia {{was the most common}} reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of heart disease in women.

40|$|Background Our current {{understanding}} of Asian American mortality patterns has <b>been</b> distorted by <b>the</b> historical aggregation of diverse Asian subgroups on death certificates, masking important differences in <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> of death across subgroups. In this analysis, {{we aim to}} fill an important knowledge gap in Asian American health by reporting <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> of mor-tality by disaggregated Asian American subgroups. Methods and Findings We examined national mortality records for the six largest Asian subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese) and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) from 2003 - 2011, and ranked <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> of death. We calculated all-cause and cause-specific age-adjusted rates, temporal trends with annual percent changes, and rate ratios by race/ethnicity and sex. Rankings revealed that as an aggregated group, cancer <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of death for Asian Americans. When disaggregated, there was notable het-erogeneity. Among women, cancer <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of death for every group except Asian Indians.

This study uses forensic epidemiology to determine the relationship between unnatural deaths and the development in Shanghai, based on recently released forensic autopsy cases from the 2000 s at the Shanghai Public Security Bureau (SPSB). There were 5425 accidental deaths, 2696 homicides, 429 suicides, 186 natural deaths, and 1399 deaths of undetermined cause. There was a male-to-female ratio of 2. 02 : 1, and <b>the</b> average age <b>was</b> 40. 9 ± 18. 7 years. Traffic accidents (84. 2 %) <b>were</b> <b>the</b> number one cause of accidental deaths, which decreased during the study period. Sharp force injury (50. 6 %) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of homicides, different from Western countries, where firearms <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause.</b> Hanging (24. 5 %) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> of suicides, whereas drug and chemical intoxication <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> in <b>the</b> previous decade; pesticide ingestion decreased in the 2000 s.
