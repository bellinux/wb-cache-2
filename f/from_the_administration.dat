5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women had less means of public {{participation}} than men {{and that as}} a result piety and an active religious life may have been more important for women from the social elite.

Women were largely excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Robinson opposed both secession and abolition.

25|$|No Europeans {{are known}} to have set foot in the Ngorongoro Crater until 1892, when it was visited by Oscar Baumann. Two German {{brothers}} (Adolph and Friedrich Siedentopf) farmed in the crater until the outbreak of World War I, after leasing the land <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of German East Africa. The brothers regularly organized shooting parties to entertain their German friends. They also attempted to drive the wildebeest herds out of the crater.|$|E

25|$|When the Indian Association was {{established}} in 1876 {{he was one of}} the advisers.

25|$|Church going {{played an}} {{important}} part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of the Kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate. In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women. Women were disciplined in kirk sessions and civil courts for stereotypical offences including scolding and prostitution, which were seen as deviant, rather than criminal. These changing attitudes may partly explain the witch hunts that occurred after the Reformation and in which women were the largest group of victims.|$|E
25|$|On 3 October 1940, the Vichy {{government}} voluntarily promulgated {{the first}} Statute on Jews, which created a special underclass of French Jewish citizens, and enforced, {{for the first}} time in France, racial segregation. The October 1940 Statute excluded Jews <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration,</b> the armed forces, entertainment, arts, media, and certain professions, such as teaching, law, and medicine. A Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs (CGQJ, Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives) was created on 29 March 1941. It was directed by Xavier Vallat until May 1942, and then by Darquier de Pellepoix until February 1944. Mirroring the Reich Association of Jews, the Union Générale des Israélites de France was founded.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his first}} tasks in the United States was to bring his work to the {{attention}} of engineers. Then, he proceeded to do by writing a series of articles for the Engineering News Record, which were published in winter 1925, then as a small book in 1926. He found the facilities at MIT abominable and had to deal with obstruction <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> Brushing the obstacles aside, he once more set up a new laboratory geared towards making measurements on soils with instruments of his own devising. He entered a new phase of prolific publication and a rapidly growing and lucrative involvement as an engineering consultant on many large-scale projects.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the height}} of the {{constitutional}} crisis. A general election was due to be held in 1953; if the government refused to accept the rulings of the Appellate Division and conducted the election on the basis of separate representation for white and coloured voters, the system of government could be imperilled. The officials responsible for voter registration would be forced to follow either the government's instructions and risk an interdict from the courts, or to follow the court's ruling and risk sanctions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> There was the possibility that the courts could invalidate the entire election in the Cape Province and therefore the existence of the Parliament elected in 1953.|$|E
25|$|On {{assuming}} power, William {{kept the}} administration which had guided his father's rule for his final years. Only the Englishman Thomas Brun was removed, and the chancellor Maio of Bari was promoted. The real {{power in the}} kingdom was at first exercised by Maio, a man of low birth, whose title ammiratus ammiratorum was {{the highest in the}} realm. Maio continued Roger's policy of excluding the nobles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration,</b> and sought also to curtail the liberties of the towns. The barons, always chafing against the royal power, were encouraged to revolt by Pope Adrian IV, whose recognition William had not yet sought, by the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s {{and again}} in the 1960s, the United States Postal Service (USPS) sought land for a new post office site to serve as the central {{facility}} for the Bronx, replacing the Bronx Central Annex on 149th Street. In 1964, the building site (now planned as a Federal Building and post office) was placed at Washington Avenue and Fordham Road, with a final design plan created in 1967. It was to be named after Bronx House of Representatives member Charles A. Buckley, who oversaw the project, following Buckley's death in 1967. The project ultimately fell through due to federal opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of President Richard Nixon, in part due to the plan to name the site after Buckley.|$|E

25|$|Three {{chapters}} {{followed in}} 1850: Omicron (now Omicron Epsilon) at Princeton University, Sigma at the University of Pennsylvania, and Chi at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. The first two are still active, {{as was the}} Chi Chapter until 1988. In the early 1980s Colby College prohibited Fraternities on campus, despite the long and storied tradition they had enjoyed there. By 1988, ejected from campus and banned from any formal rush, the chapter quietly expired after over 130 years of existence. Problems beset other early chapters as well. The first Alpha chapter was founded in 1852 at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. But immediate resistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> slowly wore upon the brothers there, and that chapter became inactive in 1872, permitting its letter {{to be used for}} the later chapter founded at Columbia.|$|E
25|$|After {{an initial}} {{unsuccessful}} visit to leading doctors in Harley Street, Garrett decided to first spend six months as a surgery nurse at Middlesex Hospital, London in August 1860. On {{proving to be}} a good nurse, she was allowed to attend an outpatients' clinic, then her first operation. She unsuccessfully attempted to enroll in the hospital's Medical School but was allowed to attend private tuition in Latin, Greek and materia medica with the hospital's apothecary, while continuing her work as a nurse. She also employed a tutor to study anatomy and physiology three evenings a week. Eventually she was allowed into the dissecting room and the chemistry lectures. Gradually, Garrett became an unwelcome presence among the male students, who in 1861 presented a memorial to the school against her admittance as a fellow student, despite the support she enjoyed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration.</b> She was obliged to leave the Middlesex Hospital but she did so with an honours certificate in chemistry and materia medica. Garrett then applied to several medical schools, including Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews and the Royal College of Surgeons, all of which refused her admittance.|$|E
25|$|On November 21, 2016, the MTA {{requested}} that the Phase 2 project be entered into the Project Development phase under the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. On December 15, several elected officials for the area announced that they were seeking $6 billion of funding for Phase 2 of the line, including $2 billion from the federal government. These officials wished to secure funding from the presidential administration of Barack Obama before Obama's term ended on January 20, 2017. In their request for funding, they cited {{that they wanted to}} avoid an uncertain response <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of Donald Trump and start construction on Phase 2 as soon as possible. The FTA granted this request in late December 2016. Under the approved plan, the MTA would complete an environmental reevaluation by 2018, receive funding by 2020, and open Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029. On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board approved an amendment to the 2015–2019 Capital Program, and as part of it, the funding allocated to Phase 2 was increased by $700 million to a total of $1.735 billion. This would allow for a near-term 30 percent match per Full Funding Grant Agreement process.|$|E
