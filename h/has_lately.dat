25|$|Blas de Lezo y Olavarrieta (3 February 1689 – 7 September 1741) was a Spanish admiral {{best remembered}} for the Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1741) in modern-day Colombia, where Spanish {{imperial}} forces {{under his command}} resisted a siege by a large British invasion fleet under Admiral Edward Vernon.

25|$|Apart from cricket, {{the ground}} has {{played host to}} a number of {{programs}} arranged by the Government of Gujarat. The pitch once favoured the bowlers but <b>has</b> <b>lately</b> been host to competitive games. As of December 2011, the Motera stadium had played host to 23 ODI matches. In India, only Eden Gardens (26 ODI matches) has hosted more ODI matches than Motera Stadium. The stadium was one of the host venues for 2011 Cricket World Cup held in India. It hosted three matches, including a quarter final match between India and Australia.|$|E

25|$|Severe liver injury {{can result}} from hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Elevated levels of bilirubin, {{hepatomegaly}} and fluid retention are clinical hallmarks of this condition. There is now a greater appreciation of the generalized cellular injury and obstruction in hepatic vein sinuses, and hepatic VOD <b>has</b> <b>lately</b> {{been referred to as}} sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). Severe cases of SOS are associated with a high mortality rate. Anticoagulants or defibrotide may be effective in reducing the severity of VOD but may also increase bleeding complications. Ursodiol has been shown to help prevent VOD, presumably by facilitating the flow of bile.|$|E

Copyright for the booklet was obtained at the Worshipful Company of Stationers’ Hall at Ludgate Hill, London on 1 September 1835.

From the attendant flotilla rang notes of triumph and jubilee, instead of those yells of lamentation which <b>had</b> so <b>lately</b> disturbed the echoes of Loch Tay; and a thousand voices hailed the youthful chieftain as {{he stood on the}} poop, armed at all points, in the flower of early manhood, beauty, and activity, on the very spot where his father's corpse <b>had</b> so <b>lately</b> been extended, and surrounded by triumphant friends, as that had been by desolate mourners.|$|R

500|$|The three-year-old Lord Denbigh died {{suddenly}} on 19 July 1584 at Wanstead. His death shattered the dynastical hopes of the House of Dudley.

500|$|In English language, German, Russian and Scandinavian historiography, these {{conflicts}} were traditionally {{referred to as}} First Northern War. The term [...] "Second Northern War", coined in Polish historiography (Druga Wojna Północna), <b>has</b> <b>lately</b> been increasingly adopted by German and English language historiography. Another ambiguous term referring to the Second Northern War is the Little Northern War, which however might also refer to the 1741-43 war. In Poland, the term [...] "The Deluge" [...] is also ambiguous, as it is sometimes used for a broader series of wars against Sweden, Brandenburg, Russia, Transylvania and the Cossacks.|$|E
500|$|Early {{evolutionary}} ideas {{presented a}} new {{threat to the}} analogy between living organisms and designed object, as life differs in reproducing itself. In chapter XXIII Paley explicitly dismissed Buffon's concept of [...] "organic molecules", then turned to an unattributed concept: [...] "Another system, which <b>has</b> <b>lately</b> been brought forward, and with much ingenuity, is that of appetencies": the term and his description clearly refer to Erasmus Darwin's concept of transmutation of species, {{as set out in}} Zoonomia. Paley objected to it dispensing with [...] "the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent, designing mind", and to it lacking evidence or observations of the process. More specifically, Darwin had adopted the common idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics, and Paley raised objections including the persistence of unused male nipples, and (discreetly put in Latin) the effect of circumcision not being inherited by generations of Jews.|$|E
500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino <b>has</b> <b>lately</b> {{become the}} focus {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or LaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence? ...|$|E

500|$|Most of the 1873 {{production}} was exported to China, and in October of that year, the Tongzhi Emperor had an assay test {{conducted on the}} coins.

At the same time rogues, sharpers, and the like, are hereby strictly forbidden to fabricate spurious imitations of this new Eagle Dollar, with a view to their own profit.

500|$|The sketch {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Erin Fox of TV Guide wrote that Tina Fey [...] "nails [...] Palin's mannerisms and accent. [...] Poehler is amazing as Hillary her timing {{is better than}} ever. My favorite line was Tina saying 'I can see Russia from my house!'" [...] Fox added that [...] "this was a much anticipated and hoped-for pairing and we got it!" [...] Annie Wu of TV Squad thought that Fey's [...] "impression wasn't perfect {{but it was more}} accurate than Amy Poehler's Hillary Clinton, which [...] still find incredibly off." [...] Wu added that [...] "the mugging for the camera was absolutely hilarious." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine wrote that [...] "Fey's Palin was perfectly good enough" [...] and that [...] "the skit itself {{did a good job of}} what SNL—which <b>has</b> <b>lately</b> cultivated a strong set of female comics—tried hard to do through Hillary's campaign, which is try to address sexism without either simply going for the easy stereotypes or letting female candidates off the hook." [...] The Huffington Post's reviewer wrote that [...] "Fey bears a striking resemblance to Palin and nailed the candidate's distinctive accent." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} critic in the Monthly Magazine disparaged the [...] "writhings and twinings" [...] of the painting's subjects, describing them as [...] "as {{close to}} the unpardonable limits as anything that <b>has</b> <b>lately</b> appealed to the public eye". This same writer disapproved of the dark skin tones {{of some of the}} figures, arguing that [...] "the brown visage of the [...] gives but a dingy image of the roses and lilies that, from time immemorial, have made the charm of British beauty". The correspondent for The London Magazine felt that although the painting was [...] "in many respects worthy of admiration... is a spirit, a boldness, and a startling effect", the work was poorly executed overall. Its depiction of women drew particular ire: [...] "the expression of the faces is vapid; the features rather homely; the limbs, though not ill-drawn, have not that finish and play of the muscles, which alone give lightness and elasticity. They seem lifted up with difficulty, and ready to fall." [...] The review upbraided Etty as an artist who had [...] "advanced half way on his road to classic excellence; and there, when he should have proceeded with increased ardour and more careful exactness from being in view of his object, he has stopped short." [...] Etty's fellow artist John Constable privately described the work as [...] "a revel rout of Satyrs and lady bums as usual".|$|E
