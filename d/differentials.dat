5|$|The table {{shows that}} the pay <b>differentials</b> enyjoyed by the senior {{officers}} of a 4th-century regiment were much smaller than those of their 2nd-century counterparts, a position {{in line with the}} smaller remuneration enjoyed by 4th-century high administrative officials.|$|E
5|$|However, pay {{would have}} been much more {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The top of the pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There is little evidence about the pay <b>differentials</b> between grades. But that they were substantial is shown by the example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than his counterpart in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of X to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero <b>differentials,</b> which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero <b>differentials,</b> which give more information.|$|E

Hybrid systems, i. e., {{dynamical}} systems combining discrete {{and continuous}} dynamics, {{have a complete}} axiomatization in <b>differential</b> dynamic logic relative to <b>differential</b> equations. <b>Differential</b> invariants are a natural induction principle for proving properties of the remaining <b>differential</b> equations. We study the equational case of <b>differential</b> invariants using a <b>differential</b> operator view. We relate <b>differential</b> invariants to Lie’s seminal work and explain important structural properties resulting from this view. Finally, we study the connection of <b>differential</b> invariants with partial <b>differential</b> equations {{in the context of}} the inverse characteristic method for computing <b>differential</b> invariants. ...|$|R

5|$|There existed a {{hierarchy}} of pay between types of auxiliary, with cavalry higher paid than infantry. One recent estimate {{is that in the}} time of Augustus, the annual pay structure was: eques alaris (gregalis) 263 denarii, eques cohortalis 225, and cohors infantryman 188. The same <b>differentials</b> (of about 20% between grades) seem to have existed at the time of Domitian (r. 81-96). However, Goldsworthy points out that the common assumption that rates of pay were universal across provinces and units is unproven. Pay may have varied according to the origin of the unit.|$|E

25|$|Many <b>differentials</b> {{have no way}} of {{limiting}} the amount of engine power that gets sent to its attached output shafts. As a result, if a tire loses traction on acceleration, either because of a low-traction situation (e.g., - driving on gravel or ice) or the engine power overcomes available traction, the tire that is not slipping receives little or no power from the engine. In very low traction situations, this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all. To overcome this, there are several designs of <b>differentials</b> that can either limit the amount of slip (these are called 'limited-slip' <b>differentials)</b> or temporarily lock the two output shafts together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>differential</b> hybrid games, which combine <b>differential</b> {{games with}} hybrid games. In {{both kinds of}} games, two players interact with continuous dynamics. The difference is that hybrid games also provide all the features of hybrid systems and discrete games, but only deterministic <b>differential</b> equations. <b>Differential</b> games, instead, provide <b>differential</b> equations with input by both players, but not the luxury of hybrid games, such as mode switches and discrete or alternating interaction. This paper augments <b>differential</b> game logic with modalities for the combined dynamics of <b>differential</b> hybrid games.

25|$|The {{two most}} common {{factory-installed}} locking <b>differentials</b> use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous coupling unit {{to join the}} shafts, while other <b>differentials</b> more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling <b>differentials</b> the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.|$|E
