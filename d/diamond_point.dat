25|$|Although {{the region}} for Bolton and Bolton Landing is large, {{there is only one}} state-maintained route, Route 9N, and there is County Route 11 (Bolton-Riverbank Road), which is a {{connector}} to Exit 24 on the Northway. Only 2 county or higher maintained roads traverse the hamlet of <b>Diamond</b> <b>Point,</b> Route 9N and County Route 35 (<b>Diamond</b> <b>Point</b> Road), which connects 9N to the Northway (Exit 23) and U.S. Route 9 in Warrensburg. New York State Route 8 enters the county at Johnsburg, entering into the Town of Chester, where it merges with U.S. Route 9 for almost 4 miles, splitting off at the Landon Hill/Route 8/Route 9 intersection. New York State Route 8 terminates at an intersection with New York State Route 9N in the center of Hague. There are several state-maintained and county-maintained roads in the Warrensburg area. These include the termini of both New York State Route 28 and New York State Route 418 at US 9. There are also a few county routes including County Route 4 in Athol and County Route 10 (Horicon Road) in Warrensburg. Route 10 continues eastward, terminating in Bolton Landing.|$|E

Diamond says that these natural endowments began with the dawn of man, and favored Eurasian civilizations due to their location along similar latitudes, suitable farming climate, and early animal domestication.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the comparative efficacy of Polymer bur (Smartprep) and Conventional burs (Carbide bur & <b>Diamond</b> <b>Points)</b> in selective Dentin caries removal. Materials and method: 15 freshly extracted carious human premolars and molars {{were selected for}} this study. These teeth were split {{in the center of}} carious lesion, in order to obtain two corresponding half. Thus 30 samples were prepared in this way. These were randomly divided in to 3 groups of 10 samples each. Group 1 : The carious portion of these samples was excavated with the help of polymer bur Smartprep (SS White). Group 3 : Prepared with Tungsten carbide round bur (No. 018). Group 3 : Prepared with the help of <b>Diamond</b> <b>points</b> (No. 018). The period of time involved in this process is measured. After excavation of all carious lesions, a longitudinal section from mid most part of lesion was obtain with the help of diamond disc at slow speed. After staining with caries detector dye “Seek”, the sections were subjected to histological evaluation under stereomicro-scope. The thickness of remaining caries is measured in more or less than 1 mm. Results: The difference in grading of remaining carious dentin between Polymer bur and Conventional burs were statistically non- significant, but Polymer bur taken more time in comparison to Conventional burs. Conclusion: Smartprep bur is more conservative in selectively dentin caries removal than Conventional burs but same time it is more time consuming than Conventional burs...|$|R
