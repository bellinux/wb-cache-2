To support this complex task, the development of planning tools is important to support people during decision-making and problem-solving tasks. Nowadays, {{a large number of}} manual and electronic tools support this complex activity; manual and electronic planning tools aid people in creating strategies for effective work performance.

With efforts to automate the planning process, shortcomings are apparent due to the following reasons: (1) current plan representations or ontologies are too fine grained, and (2) current planning systems are often static. To address these issues, we introduce a planning system called Dynamic Personalized Planner (DP Planner) which consists of: (1) a suitably light-weight and <b>generic</b> <b>plan</b> representation, and (2) a constraint-based dynamic planning engine. The plan representation is based on existing plan ontologies, and developed in XML. With the available plans, the planning engine focuses on personalizing pre-existing (or generic) plans that can be dynamically changed as the condition of the patient changes over time. To illustrate our dynamic personalized planning approach, we present an example in renal disease management.

40|$|Kambhampati’s {{refinement}} {{planning framework}} provides a unifying view on planning algorithms. It shows how a planning {{problem can be}} solved by successively applying a refinement operator, which adds more and more detail to the plan. In this paper, we show how this framework can be extended to include plan repair capabilities. This extension relies on the inclusion of unrefinement operators, that remove obsolete or obstructing actions from the plan. Based on this general plan repair framework, we develop a <b>generic</b> <b>plan</b> repair heuristic. This heuristic consists of a new unrefinement strategy, and it can make use of existing planning heuristics as the refinement operator. The unrefinement strategy deteriorates a plan {{in a number of}} ways, by removing certain combinations of actions. The planning heuristic is then used to find the most promising candidate, which is then given to the planner as the initial partial plan to refine. The big advantage of the heuristic is that it allows to employ existing planning heuristics. This way, it can not only make use of advances in planning technology, {{but it can also be}} used to extend existing planners, giving them plan repair capabilities. The performance of the heuristic is demonstrated by adapting an existing planner, and comparing the results with planning from scratch and a plan adaptation system. Experiments are presented that show that the new heuristic is very competitive with the other systems. ...|$|E

40|$|The meta level notion {{has been}} applied to dierent contexts. In this paper we present its {{application}} to an interoperable system. The incorporated meta level mechanism permits to improve the management of the system by: 1. allowing to exploit the existing mapping information and, 2. enhancing the query processing task through the use of query patterns. Mapping information is the abstraction that provides the link between the terms that appear in the semantic view (class level) oered to the user of the interoperable system and the instances of these terms actually supported by stored data (instance level) in distributed and heterogeneous data sources. Our mechanism allows one to describe mapping expressions and reasoning with them. Query patterns are associated to already obtained generic plans. Our mechanism recognizes a user query (description in the class level) as an instance of a query pattern (description in the metaclass level). Then, a proper instantiation of the correspondent <b>generic</b> <b>plan</b> solves the plan generation step of the query processing task. Dealing with a meta level, one aspect that requires a particular attention is the kind of language selected to specify metaclasses. This paper presents a logic-based language that allows the specication of structural and semantic constraints of objects that belong to the class level. Our proposal is founded on the Description Logics (DL) technology. We have dened a DL with two combined languages: one to specify the schema part in the metaclass level, and another for the view part. The description of semantic constraints on class level objects is achieved by the integration of suitable predicates of Concrete domains into the DL language.

Some 160 accident reports have been consulted, and 31 internal and external emergency plan exercises were followed. This double analysis (a priori and a posteriori) has led to putting in place assessment checklists, structured via the systemic model for each of the plan's process. Each checklist provides an indicator of the level of accomplishment (performance indicator) for the respective function. The logical combination of the function performance indicators results in a comprehensive assessment of the robustness of the industrial emergency plan.
