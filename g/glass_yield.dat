40|$|A novel {{material}} for sensing cations in water via fluorescence spectroscopy is presented. The material {{consists of a}} glass substrate functionalized {{with a series of}} fluorescent self-assembled monolayers. Parallel modification with pairs of fluorophore-binding molecules of monolayers formed on <b>glass</b> <b>yield</b> a library of sensitive glass substrates. Measurements of the changes in fluorescence intensity of the layers upon addition of aqueous solutions of Cu 2 +, Co 2 +, Ca 2 + and Pb 2 + confirmed the ability of the monolayer library to produce a fingerprint response for separate analytes with a high reproducibility. This new protocol for fabrication of sensitive probes in glass is suitable for array fabrication in small size substrates. Additionally, the covalent attachment of the fluorophore moieties to the monolayer allows monitoring of the integrity of the monolayer in time in contact with solutions. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first example of sensing of cations in water by a self-assembled monolayer on glass...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} has been to {{demonstrate}} a new design approach for realizing heat-integrated ceramic microchannel networks for the autothermal production of hydrogen for potential application in portable power systems. The design strategy involves two unique routes to materials processing: (i) precision machining that allows the creation of complex flow distribution patterns and (ii) ceramic extrusion that enables cost-effective production of microchannel networks for thermal and/or mass integration of several unique chemical processes. ^ One-dimensional analysis demonstrated {{that the use of}} high thermal conductivity materials (e. g. silicon, stainless steel) significantly limits thermal efficiency owing to axial conduction losses, ultimately leading to isothermal-slab behavior. Low thermal conductivity materials (e. g. cordierite ceramics, <b>glass)</b> <b>yield</b> superior thermal efficiencies, resulting from development of temperatures gradients along the solid phase axial length. Therefore low thermal conductivity materials are necessary to achieve reasonable thermal efficiency. ^ Starting with an initial prototype for integrating combustion and steam reforming of methanol for autothermal production of hydrogen, the capability of this new device was demonstrated.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the laboratory-scale melter (LSM) as a quick and {{inexpensive}} method to determine the processing rate of various waste glass slurry feeds. The LSM uses a 3 or 4 in. diameter-fused quartz crucible with feed and off-gas ports on top. This LSM setup allows cold-cap formation above the molten glass to be directly monitored to obtain a steady-state melting rate of the waste glass feeds. The melting rate data from extensive scaled-melter tests with Hanford Site high-level wastes performed for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant have been compiled. Preliminary empirical model that expresses the melting rate as a function of bubbling rate and <b>glass</b> <b>yield</b> were developed from the compiled database. The two waste glass feeds with most melter run data were selected for detailed evaluation and model development and for the LSM tests so the melting rates obtained from LSM tests can be compared with those from scaled-melter tests.

40|$|The {{movement}} of cells in small groups, or clusters, was studied in vitro using epithelioid cells from Gordon-Kosswig melanomas (from poecelid fish) and time-lapse cinemicrography. Tumour explants cultured on <b>glass</b> <b>yield</b> cell sheets from which groups of cells separate and become independently motile clusters. These clusters typically contain 3 - 30 cells, but may {{have as many}} as 50. They propel themselves at speeds of 0 - 2 - 4 - 0 /tm/min by means of broad hyaline lamellae. The distribution of lamellae around the perimeter of each cluster correlates with both direction and speed of cluster movement, i. e. a cluster moves with its most lamellar region at its leading edge, and the greater the extent of the leading lamellar region the greater the speed. Also, a cluster tends to keep moving in the same direction. This persistence is due to a relatively constant distribution of lamellae. Cells on the trailing edge usually lack lamellae and most are very elongate and oriented perpendicular to the direction of cluster movement. In general, whenever a cell elongates, there is a loss of lamellar activity along its taut edges, parallel to the axis of elongation. Thus, any region with less lamellar activity would tend to be elongated by the outward pull of the more active regions to either side and would, in conse-quence, suffer a further reduction in lamellar activity. In this way, the distribution of regions of lamellar activity is self-reinforcing and the result is persistence of movement in a particular direction. This phenomenon could {{play an important role in}} giving directionality to certain morphogenetic movements, such as neural crest cell migration...|$|E

Our results unanimously show growing clusters of non-affine deformation percolating at yielding. In agreement with percolation theory, the spanning cluster is fractal with a fractal dimension d_f~ 2, and the correlation length diverges upon approaching the critical yield strain.

Stress relaxation {{is a technique}} to trace the evolution of stress {{in response to a}} fixed strain, which reflects the dynamic features phenomenologically described by the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) equation. The KWW equation describes a broad distribution of relaxation times with a small number of empirical parameters, but it does not arise from a particular physically motivated mechanistic picture. Here we report an anomalous two-stage stress relaxation behavior in a Cu 46 Zr 46 Al 8 metallic glass over a wide temperature range and generalize the findings in other compositions. Thermodynamic analysis identifies two categories of processes: a fast stress-driven event with large activation volume and a slow thermally activated event with small activation volume, which synthetically dominates the stress relaxation dynamics. Discrete analyses rationalize the transition mechanism induced by stress and explain the anomalous variation of the KWW characteristic time with temperature. Atomistic simulations reveal that the stress-driven event involves virtually instantaneous short-range atomic rearrangement, while the thermally activated event is the percolation of the fast event accommodated by the long-range atomic diffusion. The insights may clarify the underlying physical mechanisms behind the phenomenological description and shed light on correlating the hierarchical dynamics and structural heterogeneity of amorphous solids.

Finally, the cohesion and friction angle of the samples obtained are employed as input to find the shear strength of Kuantan soil. From the results, it is observed that the analysis of using fly ash and crushed <b>glass</b> <b>yields</b> more conservative increment in cohesion and friction angle. The acquired results utilizing high density polyethylene and carpet fibres indicate that when the stabiliser is used at a higher percentage, it gives lower cohesion and friction angle than that the results obtained using crushed glass and fly ash. The obtained results indicate that the fly ash blend produces the highest shear strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{alkali metal}} halide doping of gallium-sulfide <b>glasses</b> <b>yields</b> {{improvements}} in the optical, thermal and glass forming properties. To understand these improvements, the short-range order of xCsCl(1 − x) Ga 2 S 3 glasses was probed by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra have been interpreted using density functional theory (DFT) harmonic frequency calculations on specific clusters of GaS 4 H 4 and/or GaS 3 H 3 Cl tetrahedral subunits. The assignment of the observed vibrational bands confirms the main structural conclusions obtained with X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments and gives some {{new insights into the}} gallium-network present in the xCsCl(1 − x) Ga 2 S 3 glasses. At the lowest concentration, the observed spectrum may be interpreted with small clusters such as dimers and trimers connected by corner-sharing (CS) GaS 4 H 4 tetrahedral subunits. The vibrational fingerprints of tri-clusters with three-fold coordinated sulfur atoms have also been identified; however, no Raman signature of chlorine-doped subunits {{has been found to be}} caused by their insufficient intensity. For higher CsCl concentrations, distinct spectral features corresponding to chlorine-doped clusters appear and are increasing in intensity with x. In other words, undoped and Cl-doped tetrahedra coexist in the xCsCl(1 − x) Ga 2 S 3 glasses. The added chlorine atoms induce a fragmentation of the glass network and replace the sulfur atoms in the CS tetrahedral environment. The comparison of the observed spectra with theoretical predictions and diffraction data favoured one-fold coordinated chlorine atoms in the glass network...|$|R
