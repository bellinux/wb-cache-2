40|$|An <b>exceptional</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>development</b> {{commonly}} referred to as 'double-muscled' (Fig. 1) has been seen in several cattle breeds and has attracted considerable attention from beef producers. Double-muscled animals are characterized by an increase in muscle mass of about 20 %, due to general skeletal-muscle hyperplasia-that is, {{an increase in the number}} of muscle fibers rather than in their individual diameter. Although the hereditary nature of the double-muscled condition was recognized early on, the precise mode of inheritance has remained controversial; monogenic (domainant and recessive), oligogenic and polygenic models have been proposed. In the Belgian Blue cattle breed (BBCB), segregation analysis performed both in experimental crosses and in the outbred population suggested an autosomal recessive inheritance. This was confirmed when the muscular hypertrophy (mh) locus was mapped 3. 1 cM from microsatellite TGLA 44 on the centromeric end of bovine chromosome 2 (ref. 5). We used a positional candidate approach to demonstrate that a mutation in bovine MSTN, which encodes myostatin, a member of the TGF beta superfamily, is responsible for the double-muscled phenotype. We report an 11 -bp deletion in the coding sequence for the bioactive carboxy-terminal domain of the protein causing the muscular hypertrophy observed in Belgian Blue cattle. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Various studies of porcine <b>muscle</b> <b>development</b> have mainly focused on identifying miRNAs that are important for fetal and adult muscle development; however, {{little is known about}} the role of miRNAs in middle-aged <b>muscle</b> <b>development.</b> Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of miRNA transcriptomes across five porcine <b>muscle</b> <b>development</b> stages, including one prenatal and four postnatal stages. We identified 404 known porcine miRNAs, 118 novel miRNAs, and 101 miRNAs that are conserved in other mammals. A set of universally abundant miRNAs was found across the distinct <b>muscle</b> <b>development</b> stages. This set of miRNAs may play important housekeeping roles that are involved in myogenesis. A short time-series expression miner analysis indicated significant variations in miRNA expression across distinct <b>muscle</b> <b>development</b> stages. We also found enhanced differentiation- and morphogenesis-related miRNA levels in the embryonic stage; conversely, apoptosis-related miRNA levels increased relatively later in <b>muscle</b> <b>development.</b> These results provide integral insight into miRNA function throughout pig <b>muscle</b> <b>development</b> stages.

40|$|Proteoglycans are glycoconjugates {{composed}} of a core protein and covalcntly attached glycosaminoglycans. Skeletal muscle produces {{a number of different}} types of proteogiycans, and, importantly, the types of proteogiycans made by skeletal muscle vary during <b>muscle</b> <b>development.</b> At early stages of <b>muscle</b> <b>development,</b> large chondroiim sulfate proteogiycans of the PG-M/versican type are produced both in culture and in vivo.

Subsequently, we examined Tob 1 chromosome assignment, subcellular localization and dynamic expression profile in prenatal skeletal muscle (33, 65 and 90 days post-conception, dpc) from Landrace (lean-type) and Tongcheng pigs (obese-type). The Tob 1 gene was mapped to pig chromosome 12 (SSC 12). The Tob 1 protein was distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm of PK 15 cells. During prenatal skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>development,</b> Tob 1 was up-regulated and highly expressed in skeletal muscle at 90 dpc in Tongcheng pigs but peaked at 65 dpc in Landrace pigs.

40|$|Skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>development,</b> {{nutrient}} uptake, {{and nutrient}} utilization is largely coordinated by growth hormone (GH) and its downstream effectors, in particular, IGF- 1. However, {{it is not}} clear which effects of GH on skeletal muscle are direct and which are secondary to GH-induced IGF- 1 expression. Thus, we generated mice lacking either GH receptor (GHR) or IGF- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R) specifically in skeletal muscle. Both exhibited impaired skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>development</b> characterized by reductions in myofiber number and area as well as accompanying deficiencies in functional performance. Defective skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>development,</b> in both GHR and IGF- 1 R mutants, was attributable to diminished myoblast fusion and associated with compromised nuclear factor of activated T cells import and activity. Strikingly, mice lacking GHR developed metabolic features that were not observed in the IGF- 1 R mutants, including marked peripheral adiposity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance in GHR-deficient myotubes derived from reduced IR protein abundance and increased inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS- 1 on Ser 1101.

Embryos exposed to nicotine become functionally paralyzed by 42  hpf suggesting that the neuromuscular system is compromised in exposed embryos. We previously demonstrated that secondary spinal motoneurons in nicotine-exposed embryos were delayed in development and that their axons made pathfinding errors (Svoboda, K. R., Vijayaraghaven, S., Tanguay, R. L., 2002. Nicotinic receptors mediate changes in spinal motoneuron development and axonal pathfinding in embryonic zebrafish exposed to nicotine. J.

In this study, we show that an alteration in skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>development</b> occurs in tandem with alterations in spinal motoneuron development upon exposure to nicotine.
