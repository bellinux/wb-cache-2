40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>erect</b> sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting on the lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure. [Subjects] For the ex-periments, 17 healthy women were recruited. [Methods] All {{subjects were asked to}} perform three sitting postures: <b>erect</b> sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting, and <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting. Lumbar and pelvic angles were measured using a three-dimensional motion-capture system, and gluteal pressure was measured using a pressure mat. [Results] Compared to erector sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion, posterior pelvic tilt, and left pelvic tilt. Compared to <b>erect</b> sitting, <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched posture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to <b>erect</b> sitting and <b>erect</b> posture with cross-legged sitting, slouched pos-ture with cross-legged sitting showed significantly greater left gluteal pressure; {{there was no significant difference}} in right gluteal pressure. [Conclusion] An <b>erect</b> posture can reduce changes in lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure compared to a slouched posture during cross-legged sitting...|$|R

5|$|After the war the British {{discovered}} Ball's grave, {{which had}} been behind enemy lines, in the Annoeullin Cemetery. In December 1918, personnel of No. 207 Squadron RAF <b>erected</b> a new cross {{in place of the}} one left by the Germans. The Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) were working at the time to consolidate the British war graves into fewer cemeteries; 23 British bodies in graves in the location where Ball was buried were moved to the Cabaret Rouge British Cemetery, but at his father's request Ball's grave was allowed to remain. Albert Sr. paid for a private memorial to be <b>erected</b> over Ball's grave, No. 643, in what later became the Annoeullin Communal Cemetery and German Extension. Ball's is the only British grave from the First World War in this extension, the rest being German.

40|$|The {{value of}} <b>erect</b> and supine {{abdominal}} radiographs and <b>erect</b> chest radiographs was analysed prospectively in 102 consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute abdominal symptoms. The radiographs were reported on initially by junior surgeons of the admitting team, special note being {{made of the}} value of the <b>erect</b> abdominal radiograph over the combination of the supine abdominal radiograph and <b>erect</b> chest radiograph. On the basis of information obtained from the <b>erect</b> abdominal radiograph alone no changes in patient management were recorded. A consultant radiologist reported on the same radiographs at a later date. In five cases the <b>erect</b> abdominal radiograph was thought to have contributed useful or additional information, although in four of these cases abnormal features were visible in the supine film. In three of the five cases important but subtle information was missed by junior surgeons. In five of the 102 patients information obtained from the <b>erect</b> abdominal radiograph was potentially misleading. The small yield of positive information, potentially misleading features, and lack of effect on surgical management suggest that the routine use of the <b>erect</b> abdominal radiograph in the acute abdomen should be abandoned...|$|R

5000|$|A stag's penis {{forms an}} S-shaped curve {{when it is}} not <b>erect,</b> and is {{retracted}} into its sheath by the retractor penis muscle. Some deer species spray urine on their bodies by urinating from an <b>erect</b> penis. One type of scent-marking behavior in elk is known as [...] "thrash-urination, which typically involves palpitation of the <b>erect</b> penis. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. A sambar stag will mark himself by spraying urine directly in the face with a highly mobile penis, which is often <b>erect</b> during its rutting activities. Red deer stags often have <b>erect</b> penises during combat.|$|R
