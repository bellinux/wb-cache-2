5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who tilled lands {{along the edges}} of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An <b>effective</b> <b>yield</b> from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. Planting and weeding often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet. For other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.|$|E

2500|$|The {{yield to}} {{maturity}} (YTM), book yield or redemption yield of a bond or other fixed-interest security, such as gilts, is the internal {{rate of return}} (IRR, overall interest rate) earned by an investor who buys the bond today at the market price, assuming that the bond will be held until maturity, and that all coupon and principal payments will be made on schedule. Yield to maturity is the discount rate at which the sum of all future cash flows from the bond (coupons and principal) is equal to the price of the bond. The YTM is often given in terms of Annual Percentage Rate (A.P.R.), but more often market convention is followed. In a number of major markets (such as gilts) the convention is to quote annualised yields with semi-annual compounding (see compound interest); [...] thus, for example, an annual <b>effective</b> <b>yield</b> of 10.25% would be quoted as 10.00%, because 1.05 × 1.05 = 1.1025.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{results of a}} project, LSD, aimed at obtaining spatially-resolved, {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy of a complete sample of Lyman-Break Galaxies at z~ 3. Deep observations with adaptive optics resulted in the detection of the main optical lines, such as [OII], Hbeta and [OIII], which are used to study sizes, SFRs, morphologies, gas-phase metallicities, gas fractions and <b>effective</b> <b>yields.</b> Optical, near-IR and Spitzer/IRAC photometry is used to measure stellar mass. We obtain that morphologies are usually complex, {{with the presence of}} several peaks of emissions and companions that are not detected in broad-band images. Typical metallicities are 10 - 50 % solar, with a strong evolution of the mass-metallicity relation from lower redshifts. Stellar masses, gas fraction, and evolutionary stages vary significantly among the galaxies, with less massive galaxies showing larger fractions of gas. In contrast with observations in the local universe, <b>effective</b> <b>yields</b> decrease with stellar mass and reach solar values at the low-mass end of the sample. This effect can be reproduced by gas infall with rates of the order of the SFRs. Outflows are present but are not needed to explain the mass-metallicity relation. We conclude that a large fraction of these galaxies are actively creating stars after major episodes of gas infall or merging. Comment: MNRAS, in pres...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we tested the {{hypothesis}} that environmental concentrations of the antifouling agent Irgarol 1051, as measured in coastal Western European waters, affect marine phytoplankton performance. The impact of Irgarol was investigated in the phytoplankton species Thalassiosira weissflogii, Emiliania huxleyi, Tetraselmis sp. and Fibrocapsa japonica. EC(50) concentrations for growth, <b>effective</b> quantum <b>yield</b> of PSII and viability were calculated from dose response relationships established during 72 h exposures to six Irgarol concentrations. Furthermore, the biological recuperation from a temporary exposure to a high Irgarol concentration (39. 47 nM l(- 1)) was monitored. Growth rates and <b>effective</b> quantum <b>yield</b> were strongly affected by Irgarol, however viability loss was never observed. EC(50) values differed five fold between species and ranged from 0. 43 to 2. 38 nM for <b>effective</b> quantum <b>yield</b> and from 0. 46 to 2. 44 nM for growth rate. For all species, complete biological recuperation was shown within 3 - 4 days after the Irgarol treatment, both for <b>effective</b> quantum <b>yield</b> and growth rate. All calculated EC(50) values and EC(20) Values fall within the Irgarol concentration range measured in Western European coastal waters. We therefore conclude that present day Irgarol 1051 levels may affect the in situ performance of marine phytoplankton in this area. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R

50|$|For the 1972-73 school year, the <b>effective</b> <b>yield</b> {{per pupil}} ranged {{anywhere}} from $20,000 to approximately $170,000 per student. Taxpayers in property-poor towns paid higher tax rates for education than taxpayers in property-rich towns. The higher tax rates generated smaller tax revenues, and property-poor towns {{could not afford}} to spend as much per pupil on education as property-rich towns where less tax effort generated more money. The Court found that this funding system ensured that more educational dollars were allotted to children who lived in property-rich towns than to children in property-poor towns. This enabled the property-rich towns to offer a wider range and higher quality of education programs than other towns. It also provided students in property-rich towns with more course offerings and library resources, expanded special education, better learning disability teachers and facilities, and many other opportunities.|$|E

50|$|A thermobaric bomb's <b>effective</b> <b>yield</b> {{requires}} {{the most appropriate}} combination {{of a number of}} factors; among these are how well the fuel is dispersed, how rapidly it mixes with the surrounding atmosphere, and the initiation of the igniter and its position relative to the container of fuel. In some designs, strong munitions cases allow the blast pressure to be contained long enough for the fuel to be heated up well above its auto-ignition temperature, so that once the container bursts the super-heated fuel will auto-ignite progressively as it comes into contact with atmospheric oxygen.Conventional upper and lower limits of flammability apply to such weapons. Close in, blast from the dispersal charge, compressing and heating the surrounding atmosphere, will have some influence on the lower limit. The upper limit has been demonstrated strongly to influence the ignition of fogs above pools of oil. This weakness may be eliminated by designs where the fuel is preheated well above its ignition temperature, so that its cooling during its dispersion still results in a minimal ignition delay on mixing. The continual combustion of the outer layer of fuel molecules as they come into contact with the air, generates additional heat which maintains the temperature of the interior of the fireball, and thus sustains the detonation.|$|E

40|$|Galaxies are not “closed-boxes”.

Low effective yields {{are seen in}} galaxies with rotation speeds less than ∼ 120 kms − 1, and have been widely interpreted as the onset of supernova-driven winds below a characteristic galaxy mass. However, accretion of metal-poor gas is also a viable explanation for the low effective yields observed in low mass galaxies.

In order to enable exact depth control of nanometer structures, the <b>effective</b> sputter <b>yield</b> of silicon was determined as function of the ion dose. At ion doses below 10 /sup 16 / cm/sup - 2 /, the <b>effective</b> sputter <b>yield</b> is not constant and {{the volume of the}} area processed increases due to the implantation of ions. Material removal can be measured for doses above 2 x 10 /sup 16 / cm/sup - 2 / and it reaches equilibrium for doses of about 3 x 10 /sup 17 / cm/sup - 2 /. This dose dependence of the <b>effective</b> sputter <b>yield</b> becomes especially <b>effective</b> in beam tail regions with low ion intensity. The shape of nanostructures is further determined by combining the beam shape and the angle dependence of the sputter yield which was experimentally determined.

Only sidewall regions close to the surface and to the bottom of deep structures show slight deviations. At the surface, non-Gaussian beam tails lead to unintentional sputtering at the corners of the processed area. At the bottom, forward scattered ions lead to higher sputter erosio...|$|R
