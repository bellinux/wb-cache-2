40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} perturbed linear fixed point methods in the {{presence}} of round off errors. Successive approximations as well as the more general, asynchronous iterations are treated. Forward and backward error estimates are presented and are used in order to propose theoretical stoppig criteria for these methods. In the case of asynchronous <b>iterations,</b> <b>macro</b> <b>iterations</b> are used as a tool in order to obtain estimates...|$|R
30|$|The actions {{associated}} with trade-off analysis {{did not occur}} in a continual form. In fact, there was evidence of <b>macro</b> <b>iterations</b> in Brent’s full design processes starting from episode 1 leading to episode 6. These <b>macro</b> <b>iterations</b> occurred between idea fluency and trade-off analysis and exposed managed and iterative designing. In episodes 1, 2, and 3, Brent’s focus was on trade-off analysis with some evidence of knowledge building, he engaged in idea fluency in episode 4. In episode 5, {{he went back to}} trade-off analysis and then moved back to idea fluency in episode 6. In the informed design coding protocol, idea fluency represents the student working with a large variety of ideas (i.e., building height, width, roof characteristics, or location) with the ability to work with one idea element at a time (i.e., building height) or several elements at a time. Idea fluency represents exploration of design alternatives in greater breadth and/or depth. In the exploratory cases of Andrew and Brent, there were no explicit evidence for science connections during idea generation and testing; however, <b>macro</b> <b>iterations</b> were evident between generating multiple designs through idea fluency and balancing benefits and trade-offs. It is possible that idea fluency allowed students to apply their new understandings into designs or gain information about their designs that are later tested more systematically through trade-off analysis. The visualization of the design episodes of Brent allowed us to better understand students’ design goals through their design processes and reflective notes.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new general {{framework}} for designing multiscale methods. Compared with previous work such as Brandt’s systematic up-scaling, the heterogeneous multiscale method and the “equation-free ” approach, this new framework has the distinct feature {{that it does}} not require reinitializing the microscale model at each macro time step or each <b>macro</b> <b>iteration</b> step. In the new strategy, the macro- and micro-models evolve simultaneously using different time steps (and therefore different clocks), and they exchange data at every step. The micro-model uses its own appropriate time step. The macro-model runs at a slower pace than required by accuracy and stability considerations for the macroscale dynamics, in order for the micro-model to relax. Examples are discussed and application to modeling complex fluids is presented...|$|R
30|$|Many {{applications}} {{are based on}} the use of materials with heterogeneous microstructure. Prominent examples are fiber-reinforced composites, multi-phase steels or soft tissue to name only a few. The modeling of structures composed of such materials is suitably carried out at different scales. At the micro scale, the detailed microstructure is taken into account, whereas the modeling at the macro scale serves to include sophisticated structural geometries with complex boundary conditions. The procedure is crucially based on an intelligent bridging between the scales. One of the methods derived for this purpose is the meanwhile well established FE^ 2 method which, however, leads to a very high computational effort. Unfortunately, this impedes the use of the FE^ 2 method and similar methodologies for practically relevant problems as they occur e.g. in production or medical technology. The goal of the present paper is to significantly improve computational efficiency by using model reduction. The suggested procedure is very generally applicable. It holds for large deformations as well as for all relevant types of inelasticity. An important merit of the work is the computation of the consistent tangent operator based on the reduced stiffness matrix of the microstructure. In this way a very fast (in most cases quadratic) convergence within the Newton <b>iteration</b> at <b>macro</b> level is achieved.|$|R
30|$|The present work {{follows the}} line {{suggested}} by Yvonnet and He [29]. In {{the first part}} of the paper, the FE^ 2 method is presented in its standard format using periodic boundary conditions at the micro scale (not considered by Yvonnet and He [29]). The derivation incorporates large deformations, inelasticity as well as the formulation of the consistent tangent to achieve approximately quadratic convergence in the Newton–Raphson <b>iteration</b> at the <b>macro</b> scale. In the second step, model reduction, more specifically POD, is brought into play which means to split the multiscale simulation into an offline and an online procedure. In the offline step, the so-called representative volume element or unit cell is subjected to nine characteristic deformation states additionally varied over time in order to compute a physically meaningful projection subspace. The latter is then used in the online step to significantly reduce the dimension of the equation system to be solved at the micro level. The work is crucially based on using the FE^ 2 interface of the finite element solver FEAP [31]. In this way, a very general multiscale solver is created. An important contribution of the work is the consistent tangent operator which is modified to incorporate the process of model reduction. The example computations performed in the third part of the paper show that speed-ups of two orders of magnitude can be reached. Very good results with negligible deviations from the reference simulation are achieved by means of only a small number of modes.|$|R
40|$|A linear Finite Element(FE) {{procedure}} {{developed by}} DNV GL {{as an alternative}} to standard design procedures for redundant plated panels has been tested and evaluated. The method is based on modifying the so-called macro material input in an anisotropic FE-model, so as to cope with structural non-linearities by essentially using a linear approach. In the studies performed in this thesis, both the initial loss of stiffness at the presence of imperfections and the load-dependent behaviour of compressed plates are addressed. The evaluations are performed in light of a number of parametric studies on the elastic buckling behaviour and imperfection sensitivity of unstiffened plates and larger multi-bayed panels. The Non-liner Finite Element software Abaqus is used as main tool. As an introductory to the elastic buckling problem, a study of the compressive strength of biaxially loaded unstiffened plates was performed. The results showed that a significant stiffness reduction takes place {{in the vicinity of the}} elastic buckling limit, followed by a nearly constant post-buckling stiffness. This implies an extensive load-shedding to adjacent supporting elements that is not captured by standard linear procedures. Subsequent studies including an initial geometry equal to that of the transverse eigenmode documented the effects of initial imperfections on the initial stiffness. The transverse and the coupled stiffness were seen to be highly affected by the imperfection amplitude, the latter even taking on a negative value for major imperfections. The immediate deflection mode after onset of compression proved to have a considerable impact on the initial stiffness. Large imperfection amplitudes imposed an advanced deflection mode in the form of a flattened buckle along the mid-plate, which displayed a lower stiffness than the applied imperfection mode. Based on a number of parametric studies including variations of the plate aspect ratio, slenderness and imperfection level, the explicit formulations for initial stiffness developed by DNV GL were compared with numerical results. High agreement was found for small imperfections and moderate aspect and slenderness ratios. Considerable deviations were seen for larger imperfections, with the numerical results being on the lower side. The deviating trend was more pronounced for large aspect ratios and slender plates. The knock-down of numerical results was found to be due to the altered deflection mode imposed by large initial distortions. This behaviour is not captured by the analytical formulations, which presumes a constant deflection mode equal to the initial imperfection. A study on the effects of various imperfection geometries and lateral pressure was performed on a multi-bayed model similar to a typical stiffened panel. The imperfections were defined as weighed combinations of the unfavourable eigenmode and the more realistic "Hungry-Horse"(HH) geometry. The HH-mode was found to be stiffer than the geometries with eigenmode contributions, and even coincided with the linear elastic stiffness for small imperfection amplitudes. The emergence of buckling modes was not considerably affected by neither the initial imperfection nor lateral pressure, considering that the eigenmode grew quite rapidly for most conditions. The practical application of the macro material model was evaluated for a card-deck configuration. A coarsely meshed linear anisotropic model with modified initial stiffness properties was compared to a non-linear isotropic model with geometrical imperfections. The anisotropic approximation showed high agreement with the non-linear model, given moderate imperfection levels. The membrane stresses in the plating, stresses in supporting frames and so the overall stiffness of the panel were successfully mimicked for strain ranges in the proximity of the elastic buckling limit of individual plates. A study on embedding load-dependent effects in the macro material input was found to give accurate estimates of the plate membrane stresses and the stress redistribution to transverse frames at target load-states. Thickness <b>iterations</b> with the <b>macro</b> material model documented a theoretical potential for steel savings for the considered car-deck. The latter however requires an evaluation of all relevant load-conditions and safety limits to be confirmed as a conservative approach. The main conclusion include two convenient applications of the macro material model in design. Firstly, the imitation of initial stiffness may enable steel savings, depending on the configuration and operation of the considered panel. Secondly, the load-dependent macro material input may serve as a convenient alternative to non-linear procedures in the prediction of the stress redistribution accompanying elastic buckling. However, such a utilization requires more confident assumptions regarding modelling of initial imperfections and a generalization with respect to model configuration and load-conditions to be truly applicable and conservative as a design procedure...|$|R
