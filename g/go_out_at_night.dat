5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It {{does not make}} any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains {{go out of their way}} so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E
25|$|Rebbe Nachman {{told his}} disciples {{that as a}} small child, he eschewed the pleasures of this world and {{set his sights on}} spirituality. He paid his melamed (teacher) three extra coins for every page of Talmud that he taught him, beyond the fee that his father was paying the teacher, to {{encourage}} the teacher to cover more material. From the age of six, he would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> to pray at the grave of his great-grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov, and immerse in the mikveh afterward.|$|E
25|$|West Midlands Police {{struggled}} {{to operate on}} the estate due to recurring incidents and also incidents where officers were attacked by youths. The lack of law enforcement led to the residents feeling intimidated and helpless on the estate. In the 1980s, the police tried an alternative approach called Community Policing where hot spots for crime were tackled with more officers. The scheme received national attention but was considered to not be drastic {{enough to deal with}} the problems on the estate. By 1992, 41% of residents said they were victims of crime and 55% said they were afraid to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Going</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> {{to attract}} less attention, Jae-min films his sister as she feeds {{on a young}} woman in a {{telephone}} box. He and Ji-eun later talk to the woman, who remains unharmed, and she tells them that the experience was not painful, likening the sensation to an electric shock. The events prove to them that Hyun-joo is telling the truth.|$|R
25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along {{the next morning to}} offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E

25|$|Sigui is {{the most}} {{important}} ceremony of the Dogon. It takes place every 60 years and can take several years. The last one started in 1967 and ended in 1973; the next one will start in 2027. The Sigui ceremony symbolises the death of the first ancestor (not to be confused with Lébé) until the moment that humanity acquired the use of the spoken word. The Sigui is a long procession that starts and ends in the village of Youga Dogorou and goes from one village to another during several months or years. All men wear masks and dance in long processions. The Sigui has a secret language, Sigui So, that women are not allowed to learn. The secret Society of Sigui plays {{a central role in the}} ceremony. They prepare the ceremonies a long time in advance, and they live for three months hidden outside of the villages while nobody is allowed to see them. The men from the Society of Sigui are called the Olubaru. The villagers are afraid of them, and fear is cultivated by a prohibition to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> when sounds warn that the Olubaru are out. The most important mask that plays a major role in the Sigui rituals is the Great Mask or the Mother of Masks. It is several meters long, held by hand, and not used to hide a face. This mask is newly created every 60 years.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the time}} of the German {{occupation}} of Italy, she joined the Italian Communist Party and began her involvement in the resistance. A comrade in the struggle described her as [...] "this young blonde woman who <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> to shoot Germans... With arms in hand, first among the first, she participated in dozens of actions, distinguishing herself in a superb way." [...] During the war she was known as [...] "The little English Girl" [...] (Inglesina).|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} Battle of Mylae was {{a stunning}} victory for Rome, mainly {{due to the}} use of the corvus boarding device. Duilius captured several enemy vessels, including Gisco's flagship, and was thus the first Roman successful in a naval engagement. [...] He was awarded a triumphal parade featuring the ramming [...] "beaks" [...] of captured Carthaginian warships that later would adorn a column erected in Duilius' honor in the Roman Forum. When in Rome, he also had the honor of being accompanied by a torch-bearer and flute-player whenever he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R

Jim's polo team has won a silver cup, and he's brought all his friends to George's house to celebrate.

2500|$|In {{a speech}} at the 1993 Conservative conference, Archer urged then Home Secretary Michael Howard, to [...] "Stand and deliver," [...] saying: [...] "Michael, I am sick and tired of being told by old people that they are frightened to open the door, they're frightened to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> frightened to use the parks and byways where their parents and {{grandparents}} walked with freedom... We say to you: stand and deliver!". He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending. He criticised the role of [...] "do-gooders" [...] and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party's law and order policies. This was a time when Archer was actively seeking another front-line political role.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, rioting and {{disorder}} continued. In June 1970, two men {{set fire to}} garbage bags to protest the New York City Department of Sanitation's reduction of trash collection pickups in Brownsville from six times to twice per week. In the riots that followed this arson, one man was killed and multiple others were injured. In May 1971, the mostly black residents of Brownsville objected to reductions in Medicaid, welfare funds, and drug prevention programs in a peaceful protest that soon turned violent. In the ensuing riot, protesters conflicted with police, with windows being broken, children stealing rides aboard buses, housewives tipping over banana stands, and the New York City Fire Department fighting over 100 fires in a single night. By then, people were afraid to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> and the forty white families in south Brownsville were concerned about public housing being expanded southward. The streets boasted empty storefronts, with one block of Pitkin Avenue having over two-thirds of its 16 storefronts lying vacant. In 1970, Mayor John Lindsay referred to the area, which had been the city's poorest for several years, as [...] "Bombsville" [...] because of its high concentration of empty lots and burned-out buildings.|$|E

My Ernest is not the sort of man who can love twice in a lifetime." ...|$|R
60|$|Jim {{carried a}} heavy ten-bore gun {{and his feet}} sank in the mud as he crept quietly up the hollow. He liked this rough {{shooting}}, and now and then Jake and he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>nights.</b> When one had hunted fierce game in Canada, shooting driven pheasants was tame sport, and the beaters found the birds; but on the sands one must match one's intelligence against the instinctive cunning of the ducks and geese. Besides, there was some risk that gave the thing a spice. Belts of sand were dangerously soft and the tides were treacherous. Sometimes they rose faster than one reckoned.|$|R
50|$|On 21 July 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimean Peninsula, Corporal Ross <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> {{in charge}} of a working party of 200 men each {{carrying}} an entrenching tool and a gabion, and before morning they had connected the 4th parallel right attack with an old Russian rifle-pit in front.

He intends to use his past as material for a book, but when he sits down to write, {{he is unable to}} accurately capture his thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Dornton rose and, {{walking to}} the door, looked out into the passage; then he shut the door {{carefully}} and returned, glancing about the room and at the storm-washed windows.

2500|$|On {{the second}} of December 1978, the Muharram protests began. Named for the Islamic month they began in, the Muharram protests were impressively huge and pivotal. Over two million protesters (many of whom were {{teenagers}} organized by the mullahs from the mosques of southern Tehran) took to the streets, crowding Shahyad Square. Protesters frequently <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> defying the set curfew (often taking to rooftops and shouting [...] "Allahu-Akbar" [...] (God is Great). According to one witness, many of the clashes on the street had an air of playfulness rather than seriousness, with security forces using [...] "kid gloves" [...] against the opposition (nevertheless, the government reported at least 12 opposition deaths).|$|R
50|$|The Collector - A {{very large}} fat man who, without his beard, might {{be mistaken for}} a woman. He {{believes}} children are toys, and collects them and other things regularly. He is intelligent, even for a sicko, and capable of speech (though can only say one or two words at a time). He spends his days sleeping in an apartment basement, having knocked out the walls separating his apartment from neighboring apartments, and <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> collecting anything. He is encountered by DogNut's crew after they leave Buckingham Palace, and eats Olivia's body after she commits suicide. The group later returns with some kids from the museum, as well as Ryan's hunters, and kills him.|$|R

6000|$|... "MY DEAR MOTHER,--I {{bring down}} {{the story of my}} {{proceedings}} to the present time since the 29th of September. I think it must have been after that day that I was at a great breakfast at the elder Perdonnets', with whom I had declined to dine, not choosing to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night....</b> I was taken by my hostess to see several pretty pleasure-grounds and points of view in the neighborhood; and latterly Calvert was better, and able to go with us. He was in force again, and our passports were all settled so as to enable us to start {{on the morning of the}} 2d, after taking leave of our kind entertainer with thanks for her infinite kindness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] {{replied the}} beach-comber. [...] "Never {{heard of the}} parties. They're superstitious beggars, these Kanekas. You've heard of buying a thing 'for a song'? Well, I got my station for a whistle. They believe that spirits twitter and whistle, and you'll hardly get them to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> even with a boiled potato in their hands, which they think good against ghosts, for fear of hearing the bogies. So I just went whistling, 'Bonny Dundee' at nights all round the {{location}} I fancied, and {{after a week of}} that, not a nigger would go near it. They made it over to me, gratis, with an address on my courage and fortitude. I gave them some blankets in; and that's how real property used to change hands in the Pacific." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{people of}} the village, however, are all true to their faith; {{it is only the}} {{governing}} body which is modern-infidel and radical. The population is quite charming,--a word of kindness makes them as bright as if you brought them news of a friend. All the same, it does not do to offend them; Monsieur Cavalcasella, who is expecting the Government order to take the Tabernacle from the Sanctuary of St. Francis, cannot, it is said, <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> with safety. He decamped the day before I came, having some notion, I fancy, that I would make his life a burden to him, if he didn't, by day, as much as it was in peril by night. I promise myself a month of very happy time here (happy for me, I mean) when I return in May.|$|E
50|$|Groups of {{soldiers}} known as wiring parties <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> into no man's land to position these supports. They later strung {{the barbed wire}} through the loops to form a defensive wire obstacle as a protection for their trench line. The British called this type of stake a 'corkscrew' picket because it was screwed into the ground rather than hammered in as the timber posts had been (the hammering made loud noise, usually attracting enemy fire). The screw pickets replaced the timber posts (although screw pickets were less rigid than timber posts), because they could be installed rapidly and silently. A wiring party is described in detail in World War I novel All Quiet on the Western Front by contemporary author Erich Maria Remarque.|$|R
5000|$|Bodine {{preferred}} {{early morning}} light. He got special effects by aiming his camera {{at the early}} morning sun. He said that on a hazy morning with the sun just over the horizon {{it was possible to}} shoot into it (the sun) without ruining the picture with glare. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> particularly if it was snowing or raining. To the editor of [...] "Minicam Photography" [...] magazine Bodine wrote: “Only an experienced photographer would know how to make a decent night picture, and get the lines straight, exposure correct, sufficient imagination to make it on a rainy night, and likewise protect his camera from the rain, and be skillful enough to watch the automobile traffic, especially from side streets." ...|$|R

But the night he started to make a journey to the Old Pasture, his mind was so full of Old Man Coyote and Granny and Reddy Fox that he wholly forgot Hooty the Owl. So, as he scampered across the Green Meadows, lipperty--lipperty-- lip, {{as fast as he could}} go, with his long ears and his big eyes and his wobbly nose all {{watching}} out for danger on the ground, not once did he think that there might be danger from the sky above him.|$|R
