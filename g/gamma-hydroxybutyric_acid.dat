25|$|Stephen John Port (born 22 February 1975) is {{a convicted}} British serial rapist and serial killer. He is {{responsible}} for murdering at least four men and for committing multiple rapes. Port received a life sentence with a whole life order on 25 November 2016, meaning he will not become eligible for parole and {{is unlikely to be}} released from prison.

25|$|Specific {{examples}} include levodopa (when {{used in the}} long term, as in Parkinson's disease), fluoxetine, metoclopramide, lithium, cocaine, venlafaxine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylphenidate (used in attention deficit hyperactive disorder), and <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GHB) and similar gamma-aminobutyric acid-inducing analogues such as phenibut. Bruxism can also be exacerbated by excessive consumption of caffeine, as in coffee, tea or chocolate. Bruxism has also been reported to occur commonly comorbid with drug addiction. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) {{has been reported to}} be associated with bruxism, which occurs immediately after taking the drug and for several days afterwards. Tooth wear in people who take ecstasy is also frequently much more severe than in people with bruxism not associated with ecstasy.|$|E

50|$|GABAB receptors are {{involved}} in behavioral actions of ethanol, <b>gamma-Hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GHB), and possibly in pain. Recent research suggests that these receptors may play an important developmental role.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of sodium oxybate, <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> {{is known to}} produce its therapeutic effects by acting as an agonist at the GABAB receptor complex and the GHB receptor. This likely contributes to some part of sodium oxybate's therapeutic effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GHB) {{has been}} studied to increase SWS.

50|$|In 2007 ACH {{treated the}} case of 20-month-old Jacob Esses, which spurred the recall of the Aqua Dots toy. After {{swallowing}} {{a number of the}} toy beads, 1,4-Butanediol coating the beads was metabolized to <b>Gamma-Hydroxybutyric</b> <b>Acid</b> (GHB, a recreational anesthetic). The drug has been shown to cause unconsciousness, drowsiness, seizures, coma, or death.|$|E
5000|$|The Act {{also would}} have created a civil penalty of $250,000 or [...] "2 times the gross receipts, either known or estimated, that were derived from each {{violation}} that is attributable to the person.", whichever was greater.

50|$|A toy called Bindeez (Aqua Dots in North America) was {{recalled}} by {{the distributor}} in November 2007 {{because of the}} unauthorized substitution of 1,5-pentanediol with 1,4-butanediol. The toy consists of small beads that stick to each other upon sprinkling with water. 1,4-Butanediol, which when ingested is metabolized to <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> was detected by GC-MS. ChemNet China lists the price of 1,4-butanediol at between about US$1,350-2,800/tonne, while the price for 1,5-pentanediol is about US$9,700/tonne.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of sedative/hypnotic toxidrome include ataxia, blurred vision, coma, confusion, delirium, deterioration of {{central nervous system}} functions, diplopia, dysesthesias, hallucinations, nystagmus, paresthesias, sedation, slurred speech, and stupor. Apnea is a potential complication. Substances that may cause this toxidrome include anticonvulsants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, <b>gamma-Hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> Methaqualone, and ethanol. While most sedative-hypnotics are anticonvulsant, some such as GHB and methaqualone instead lower the seizure threshold, and so can cause paradoxical seizures in overdose.|$|E
50|$|As a lactone, GBL is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, {{for example}} in a sodium {{hydroxide}} solution into sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate, the sodium salt of <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid.</b> In acidic water, a mixture of the lactone and acid forms coexist in an equilibrium. These compounds then may go on to form the polymer poly(4-hydroxybutyrate). When treated with a non-nucleophilic base, such as lithium diisopropylamide, GBL undergoes deprotonation alpha to the carbonyl. The related compound caprolactone {{can be used to}} make a polyester in this manner.|$|E

50|$|SSADH {{deficiency}} {{is caused}} by an enzyme deficiency in GABA degradation. Under normal conditions, SSADH works with the enzyme GABA transaminase to convert GABA to succinic acid. Succinic acid can then be utilized for energy production via the Krebs cycle. However, because of the deficiency, the final intermediate of the GABA degradation pathway, succinic semialdehyde, accumulates and cannot be oxidized to succinic acid and is therefore reduced to <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GHB) by gamma-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase. This causes elevations in GHB and {{is believed to be}} the trademark of this disorder and cause for the neurological manifestations seen.|$|E
50|$|Current {{research}} at the University of Utah is investigating whether sodium oxybate, also known as <b>Gamma-Hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> is an effective treatment for AHC. Thus far, {{only a small number}} of patients have been sampled, and no conclusive results are yet available. While some success has been had thus far with the drug, AHC patients have been known to respond well initially to other drugs, but then the effectiveness will decline over time. Currently, sodium oxybate is used as a narcolepsy-cataplexy treatment, though in the past it has been used controversially in nutritional supplements. This drug was chosen to test because of a possible link between the causes of narcolepsy-cataplexy and AHC.|$|E

50|$|Back in Harmony, Gwen's mother Rebecca {{formulated}} {{a plan to}} take Little Ethan {{away from}} Theresa while Ethan and Gwen {{decided to have a}} baby using a surrogate mother. Little Ethan was eventually adopted by Ethan and Gwen. To get her son back, Theresa drugged and kidnapped Ethan and Gwen's surrogate and had herself implanted with Gwen and Ethan's fertilized embryo, planning to trade the baby for Little Ethan. Later, Theresa believed she had miscarried the baby, and tried unsuccessfully to get Fox Crane to impregnate her. Knowing she had only a limited window of time to replace the fetus, she stole a date rape drug (<b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid)</b> from Eve Russell and slipped it into Ethan's wine, then dressed up like Gwen and sneaked into his bed resulting in Theresa getting pregnant with a second baby.|$|E

50|$|In {{the company}} of three young men at another man's apartment, Samantha Reid and her friends, Melanie Sindone and Jessica VanWassehnova , were offered drinks. Samantha and Melanie asked for Mountain Dew, while Jessica asked for a Screwdriver (orange juice and vodka). The young men brought them the cocktails, to which they had added either <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GHB) or gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). Melanie stated that her face became numb soon afterward, and then both she and Samantha passed out. The boys at first did not think {{anything}} was wrong, since both GHB and alcohol can cause those drinking them to pass out if they drink too much of them, {{and this is not}} usually a medical emergency. However, Jessica noticed later that they were having difficulty breathing. The boys eventually drove them to the hospital, but Samantha stopped breathing on the way there. Both of the girls were put on life-support; Reid died roughly 18 hours later.|$|E
50|$|On 1 June 2016, the NBI {{arrested in}} a buy bust {{operation}} five persons allegedly {{involved in the}} sale of illegal drugs at the CloseUp Forever Summer concert. Arrested were Marc Deen, his wife Erica Valbuena, Thomas Halili, Martin Dimacali and Seergeoh Villanueva (alias Gio). During the buy bust operation conducted in Parañaque, Atty. Joel Tovera, chief of the NBI’s Anti-Illegal Drugs Division, said it was Villanueva who handed a small medicine bottle containing 10 pieces of ecstasy pills after receiving the marked money. The NBI agents proceeded to the condominium unit where Deen was waiting for his share of the proceeds of the ecstasy sale. Inside Deen’s condominium unit was a kitchen type laboratory where the illegal drugs were being manufactured. Also recovered in the operation were synthetic materials, various drug paraphernalia and a manual on making illegal drugs such as methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu, D-lysergic acid diethylamide and <b>gamma-Hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (GHB) or liquid ecstasy.|$|E
5000|$|One drug {{mentioned}} was {{a fictitious}} Czechoslovakian drug called [...] "Cake".

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> on {{extracellular}} glutamate {{levels in the}} hippocampus was studied by microdialysis in freely moving rats and in isolated hippocampal synaptosomes. Intra-hippocampal (CA 1) perfusion with <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (10 nM- 1 mM) concentration-dependently influenced glutamate levels: <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (100 and 500 nM) increased glutamate levels; 100 and 300 microM concentrations were ineffective; whereas the highest 1 mM concentration reduced local glutamate levels. The stimulant effect of <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (100 nM) was suppressed by the locally co-perfused <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> receptor antagonist NCS- 382 (10 microM) but not by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP- 35348 (500 microM). Furthermore, the <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (1 mM) -induced reduction in CA 1 glutamate levels was counteracted by NCS- 382 (10 microM), {{and it was also}} reversed into an increase by CGP- 35348. Given alone, neither NCS- 382 nor CGP- 35348 modified glutamate levels. In hippocampal synaptosomes, <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (50 and 100 nM) enhanced both the spontaneous and K(+) -evoked glutamate efflux, respectively, both effects being counteracted by NCS- 382 (100 nM), but not by CGP- 35348 (100 microM). These findings indicate that <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> exerts a concentration-dependent regulation of hippocampal glutamate transmission via two opposing mechanisms, whereby a direct <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> receptor mediated facilitation is observed at nanomolar <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations, and an indirect GABA(B) receptor mediated inhibition predominates at millimolar concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> on alcohol {{consumption}} and alcohol craving in alcoholics {{was investigated in}} a randomized double-blind study versus placebo. Patients were treated as outpatients during a three month period either with <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> (50 mg/kg/day, divided into three daily doses) or with placebo. Of the 82 alcoholics that entered the study, 71 completed it, 36 in the <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> and 35 {{in the placebo group}}. Alcohol consumption was assessed by the subject's self report. At the 3 rd month of treatment, 11 patients in the <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> group referred to be abstinent and 15 referred controlled drinking; while in the placebo group only two and six patients referred abstinence and controlled drinking, respectively. Serum-gammaglutamyl-transferase activity correlated with the admitted alcohol consumption. <b>Gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> treatment decreased alcohol craving during the 3 months of treatment. Transient side effects were noted by six patients on <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> and two on placebo. The results suggest that <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> may be useful in the treatment of alcohol dependence...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> an {{endogenous}} compound {{present in}} mammalian brain and {{supposed to be}} a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator, has been shown to affect several aspects of dependence from some drugs of abuse. It has been successfully used in clinical practice to alleviate both alcohol and opiate withdrawal symptoms. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> possesses rc warding properties by means of conditioned place preference and intravenous self-administration paradigms. In the present study, <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> induced conditioned place preference in rats, was intravenously self-administered by drug naive mice, and altered cocaine intravenous self-administration in rats. Although to date the physiological role of this compound still re mains unclear, there is no doubt that <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> in addition to its proved effect on alcohol and opiate dependence, possesses reinforcing properties of its own and may interfere with the neurochemical events in the rewarding effects produced by psychostimulant drugs. Our investigation points out the abuse: liability of this drug, suggesting the use of particular precaution in handling <b>gamma-hydroxybutyric</b> <b>acid</b> as a clinically useful drug.
