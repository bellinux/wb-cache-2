Drilled shaft foundation elements provide a cost-effective foundation alternative for the support of building and bridge superstructure loads. Bi-directional pile loading tests (BDPLTs) to evaluate the capacity of drilled shafts have become popular owing to their capacity to save time and effort as compared to the use of top-down loading tests. However, the use of BDPLTs requires that production shafts be post-grouted following testing in order to assure appropriate in-service performance. Commonly used single-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> and/or <b>loading</b> <b>cell</b> construction details can pose the potential for the development of voids following post-grouting due to their monotonic jacking action and large footprint. This paper described the development and use of high pressure bi-directional <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> intended to minimize the possibility of post-test construction defects. First, a comparison was made between the single-acting and double-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells.</b> Second, the results of laboratory calibrations on the pressurized <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> were performed, as were component testing of the pumps, hoses, and hydraulic fluid synchronization lines.
