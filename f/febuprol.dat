40|$|The {{effect of}} a new potent {{choleretic}} drug (<b>Febuprol)</b> on lipid composition and cholesterol nucleation time in gallbladder bile was studied in 8 patients with cholesterol gallstones. Nine untreated patients with cholesterol cholecystolithiasis and functioning gallbladder served as controls. Under <b>Febuprol</b> treatment (3 X 100 mg for 6 - 10 days) mean concentrations of total bile acids (125. 4 vs. 59. 5 mmol/l), phospholipids (46. 1 vs. 25. 6 mmol/l) and total lipids (10. 4 vs. 5. 9 g/dl) were significantly higher (p less than 0. 01) than in controls. No significant difference between both groups was calculated for the mean values of cholesterol (17. 8 vs. 13. 3 mmol/l), cholesterol saturation index (1. 5 vs. 2. 1) and cholesterol nucleation time (2. 1 vs. 2. 6 days). Our findings are compatible with a choleretic effect of <b>Febuprol</b> but no alteration of the rapid cholesterol crystallisation in gallbladder bile of patients with cholesterol gallstones was found. ...|$|E
