Brent Bozell III and Action for Children's Television founder Peggy Charren {{have both}} {{condemned}} the show, {{with the latter}} claiming it is [...] "dangerous to the democracy". Several other activist groups have protested the show's parodies of Christianity and portrayal of Jesus Christ. Stone claims that parents who disapprove of South Park for its portrayal of <b>how</b> <b>kids</b> behave are upset because they [...] "have an idyllic vision of what kids are like", adding [...] " [...] don't {{have any kind of}} social tact or etiquette, they're just complete little raging bastards".|$|E
500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Gould says that, {{when the}} team were thinking {{of a way to}} start the show, George Meyer said, [...] "I like <b>how</b> <b>kids</b> will just dig a hole". Homer's story ends with a Chinese satellite spying on Bart. This was an attempt by Gould to write a bizarre joke in the style of fellow Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder. Moe's plot in the second act was also created by Meyer, who suggested that the bartending school that Moe attended would resemble the law school on the 1970s television series The Paper Chase, and that the school's professor would be based on the professor from the earlier series.|$|E
500|$|Crown Duel {{has been}} labeled a coming-of-age story. According to The ALAN Review, Mel's [...] "journey from captivity to freedom {{parallels}} her coming of age," [...] {{in which she}} [...] "comes {{to realize that she}} has led a very sheltered life and that people are often not what they seem." [...] This teenage perspective affects how the reader views the novel's events – Smith has commented that if she [...] "see a story from a kid's eye view, then what shapes that story is <b>how</b> <b>kids</b> look at the world." [...] In Brigham Young University's Children's Book and Play Review, Leah Hanson wrote that as a result, [...] "we view the happenings at court with her same confusion and suspicion." [...] Writing for the same publication, Lillian H. Heil added that [...] "the reader learns to expect that she will plunge into every situation with minimal thought about the consequences." ...|$|E

500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about <b>how</b> <b>kids</b> were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We hung out with them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E
500|$|Foley has {{praised the}} group's musical style on several occasions. He {{described}} the concept as innovative, {{as the music}} [...] "is not nursery rhyme, it actually has a top 40 essence to it but the lyrics are for kids." [...] He suggested this musical appeal for all ages {{as a reason for}} the group having a large teenage and adult fanbase. He cited the Wiggles as an influence of Hi-5, however he said that the respective groups have different [...] "styles of music". Hi-5 has been successful internationally. Foley explained <b>how</b> <b>kids</b> are universal and [...] "love to hear music", suggesting that the music is part of how international audiences connect to the group. Robinson stated the cast were encouraged to write their own music for the group, which all of the original members did, and by 2015 said she still receives occasional royalty cheques for her work. Original member of the Wiggles, and classical musician, Phillip Wilcher declared that Hi-5 [...] "successfully explore the essential components that come together to make music"; he detailed how the educational appeal [...] "seems to happen gently and [...] seem so at one with their audience of young folk... They also seem to know the subtle difference between childlike and childish".|$|E
2500|$|Before Slumdog Millionaire was released, Patel {{auditioned for}} the role of Zuko by {{submitting}} a tape to the studio. Shyamalan called Patel personally to inform him that he got the part. Training for the film was intense, as he had to learn Wushu and different martial arts. Patel recalls fighting, punching, and throwing and said the experience was [...] "truly amazing." [...] While he was filming Slumdog in India, he would finish a take and turn one of the channels over to the animated series. Even though it is based on a cartoon, he wanted to bring as much of himself as possible to the character he was portraying. Shaun Toub, who was cast as Iroh, describes his character in the first film as [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "free". He compares Zuko's [...] "obsession" [...] to his childhood memories and <b>how</b> <b>kids</b> are always looking for their parents' approval, saying that Zuko just wants his father's. [...] "He isn't necessarily bad, he just {{has a great deal of}} built up anger and forgets to consider others. I think people will understand that he's not bad, he's just angry and hurting because he really wants his father to love him, but his father is too busy with other things." [...] He says that Patel is an [...] "18 year old with all this energy," [...] and that Patel was able to influence him into appreciating the business of filmmaking more. While comparing the animated series to the film, he says the film is much more serious. He attributed this change to the director trying to relate to every age group, rather than just kids.|$|E
