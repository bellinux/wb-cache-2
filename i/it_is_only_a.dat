5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> minimum, the Society is always free {{to put in place}} the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E
5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the {{experiment}} {{seems to me to}} render the adoption of Fresnel's hypothesis necessary, or at least the law which he found for the expression of the alteration of the velocity of light by the effect of motion of a body; for although that law being found true may be a very strong proof in favour of the hypothesis of which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> consequence, perhaps the conception of Fresnel may appear so extraordinary, and in some respects so difficult, to admit, that other proofs and a profound examination on the part of geometricians will still be necessary before adopting it as an expression of the real facts of the case.|$|E

5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> matter of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons {{it is a matter of}} first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E

50|$|A {{previous}} designation for K-30 {{was brought}} into the Kansas state highway system by 1927. The route connected US 40 in Tonganoxie to US 73W in Oskaloosa. At that time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> graded road. This designation was removed by 1932. The current designation of K-30 was established in 1950, from K-10 to Maple Hill, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> gravel road. In 1953, the route was paved. In 1960, I-70 was completed through the region, replacing K-10. Since then, the route has not been realigned.|$|R

25|$|Kurzweil {{says the}} law of {{accelerating}} returns suggests that once a civilization develops primitive mechanical technologies, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few centuries before they achieve everything outlined in the book, at which point it will start expanding outward, saturating the universe with intelligence. Since people have {{found no evidence of}} other civilizations, Kurzweil believes humans are likely alone in the universe. Thus Kurzweil concludes it is humanity's destiny to do the saturating, enlisting all matter and energy in the process.|$|E

25|$|There is {{yet another}} points table for State/Provincial wide events for the State/Provincial Championship. However, instead of wide gap points between winners and those who follow and between skill levels, they are quite close i.e. for first place in Expert, Intermediate and Novice it is 20, 19, and 18 respectively. Also, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> one-point {{difference}} between places i.e. 20 points for first and 19 points for second place in Expert. The same for the Novice and Intermediate levels. Also unlike on the National and District level no participant points are awarded.|$|E

Architecture firm Aedas and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill designed Terminal 2 and the SkyPlaza.|$|E
25|$|When {{dentures}} {{no longer}} fit well, the correct action {{is to seek}} follow-up care. Using denture adhesive may improve the fit, but it tends to work better when {{only a small amount}} is used as covering the denture fitting surface in adhesive makes it stay in less well. Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a denture, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> temporary solution; it does not solve the problem. Fortunately, dentures can often be relined with relining materials to restore the proper fit, and this process costs less than creation of new dentures. Overall, a well-made denture should last about 5 years or more.|$|E
25|$|Eid salah is {{performed}} {{on the morning of}} Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The Eid prayer is most likely an individual obligation (fard al-ayn) and Niyyah for both Eid salah is made as Wajib, though some Islamic scholars argue <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> collective of the obligation(fard al-kifayah). It consists of two rakats, with seven (or three for the followers Imam Hanafi) takbirs offered {{before the start of the}} first rakat and five (or three for the followers of Imam Hanafi) before the second. After the salah is completed, a sermon (khutbah) is offered. However, the khutbah is not an integral part of the Eid salah. The Eid salah must be offered between sunrise and true noon i.e. between the time periods for Fajr and Zuhr.|$|E
