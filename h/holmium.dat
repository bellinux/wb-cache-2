5|$|Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide <b>holmium</b> with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly the same as that of <b>holmium</b> (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than <b>holmium.</b> The melting point of einsteinium (860°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900°C), fermium (1527°C) and <b>holmium</b> (1461°C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve {{separated}} from the rare earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components, which he called holmia and thulia; these were the oxides of <b>holmium</b> and thulium, respectively. A relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911.|$|E
5|$|While {{dysprosium}} {{is never}} encountered {{as a free}} element, it is found in many minerals, including xenotime, fergusonite, gadolinite, euxenite, polycrase, blomstrandine, monazite and bastnäsite; often with erbium and <b>holmium</b> or other rare earth elements. Currently, most dysprosium is being obtained from the ion-adsorption clay ores of southern China, and future sources will include the Halls Creek region in Western Australia. In the high-yttrium version of these, dysprosium {{happens to be the}} most abundant of the heavy lanthanides, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium). The concentration of Dy in the Earth's crust is about 5.2mg/kg and in sea water 0.9ng/L.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium {{can form}} alloys and {{intermediate}} compounds with most other metals. Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium of the alkaline earth metals; and europium and ytterbium {{of the rare}} earth metals. Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium. Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, <b>holmium</b> and thallium also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature. Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Holmium</b> oxide {{occurs in}} trace amounts in the {{minerals}} gadolinite, monazite, {{and in other}} rare-earth minerals. <b>Holmium</b> metal readily oxidizes in air; therefore presence of <b>holmium</b> in nature is synonymous with that of holmia. With the abundance of 1.4mg/kg, <b>holmium</b> is the 56th most abundant element. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia with reserves of <b>holmium</b> oxide estimated as 400,000 tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Holmium(III) oxide, or <b>holmium</b> oxide is a {{chemical}} compound of a rare-earth element <b>holmium</b> and oxygen with the formula Ho2O3. Together with dysprosium(III) oxide (Dy2O3) <b>holmium</b> oxide {{is one of}} the most powerfully paramagnetic substances known. The oxide, also called holmia, occurs as a component of the related erbium oxide mineral called erbia. Typically the oxides of the trivalent lanthanides coexist in nature and separation of these components requires specialized methods. <b>Holmium</b> oxide is used in making specialty colored glasses. Glass containing <b>holmium</b> oxide and <b>holmium</b> oxide solutions have a series of sharp optical absorption peaks in the visible spectral range. They are therefore traditionally used as a convenient calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Holmium</b> oxide {{is one of}} the {{colorants}} {{used for}} cubic zirconia and glass, providing yellow or red coloring. Glass containing <b>holmium</b> oxide and <b>holmium</b> oxide solutions (usually in perchloric acid) have sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range 200-900nm. They are therefore used as a calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers and are available commercially. As most other oxides of rare-earth elements, <b>holmium</b> oxide is used as a specialty catalyst, phosphor and a laser material. <b>Holmium</b> laser operates at wavelength of about 2.08 micrometres, either in pulsed or continuous regime. This laser is eye safe and is used in medicine, LIDARs, wind velocity measurements and atmosphere monitoring.|$|E

25|$|<b>Holmium</b> oxide {{has some}} fairly {{dramatic}} color changes {{depending on the}} lighting conditions. In daylight, it is a tannish yellow color. Under trichromatic light, it is a fiery orange red, almost indistinguishable from the way erbium oxide looks under this same lighting. This {{is related to the}} sharp emission bands of the phosphors. <b>Holmium</b> oxide has a wide band gap of 5.3 eV and thus should appear colorless. The yellow color originates from abundant lattice defects (such as oxygen vacancies) and is related to internal transitions at the Ho3+ ions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Holmium</b> oxide has a cubic, yet rather complex structure, {{with many}} atoms per unit cell {{and a large}} lattice {{constant}} of 1.06nm. This structure is characteristic of oxides of heavy rare-earth elements, such as Tb2O3, Dy2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, Yb2O3 and Lu2O3. The thermal expansion coefficient of Ho2O3 is also relatively large at 7.4×10−6/°C.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exceptions}} of La, Yb, and Lu (which have no unpaired f electrons), the lanthanides are strongly paramagnetic, {{and this is}} reflected in their magnetic susceptibilities. Gadolinium becomes ferromagnetic at below 16°C (Curie point). The other heavier lanthanides – terbium, dysprosium, <b>holmium,</b> erbium, thulium, and ytterbium – become ferromagnetic at much lower temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The most {{efficient}} separation routine for <b>holmium</b> oxide from the rare-earths is ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are adsorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions {{present in the}} resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent, such as ammonium citrate or nitrilotracetate.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the method}} {{developed}} by Carl Gustaf Mosander, Cleve first removed {{all of the}} known contaminants from erbia. The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance holmia (after the Latin name for Cleve's home town, Stockholm) and the green one thulia. Holmia was later {{found to be the}} <b>holmium</b> oxide and thulia was thulium oxide.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the time}} that ion-exchange methods and elution were available, the {{separation}} of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium-group earths (scandium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium-group earths (yttrium, dysprosium, <b>holmium,</b> erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, gadolinium, and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the terbium group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and gadolinium and terbium were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble, those of the terbium group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes, the yttrium group was further split into the erbium group (dysprosium, <b>holmium,</b> erbium, and thulium) and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups.|$|E
25|$|Discoverers of some {{elements}} named them after {{their home country}} or city. Marie Curie named polonium after Poland; ruthenium, gallium, germanium, and lutetium {{were based on the}} Latin names for Russia, France, Germany, and Paris. Other elements are named after the place where they were discovered. Four elements, terbium, erbium, ytterbium, and yttrium were named after a Swedish village Ytterby, where ores containing them were extracted. Other elements named after places are magnesium (after Magnesia), strontium, scandium, europium, thulium (after an old Roman name for the far north of Scandinavia), <b>holmium,</b> copper (derived from Cyprus, where it was mined in the Roman era), hafnium, rhenium, americium, berkelium, californium, and darmstadtium.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{extraction}} process of <b>holmium</b> oxide can be simplified as follows: The mineral mixtures are crushed and ground. Monazite, {{because of its}} magnetic properties can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of several rare earth elements. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths in to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3.|$|E
500|$|In 1878, erbium ores {{were found}} to contain the oxides of <b>holmium</b> and thulium. French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, while working with <b>holmium</b> oxide, {{separated}} dysprosium oxide from it in Paris in 1886. His procedure for isolating the dysprosium involved dissolving dysprosium oxide in acid, then adding ammonia to precipitate the hydroxide. He was only able to isolate dysprosium from its oxide after more than 30 attempts at his procedure. On succeeding, he named the element dysprosium from the Greek dysprositos (δυσπρόσιτος), meaning [...] "hard to get". The element was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange techniques by Frank Spedding at Iowa State University in the early 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Dysprosium and <b>holmium</b> {{have the}} highest {{magnetic}} strengths of the elements, especially at low temperatures. Dysprosium has a simple ferromagnetic ordering at temperatures below [...] Above , {{it turns into a}} helical antiferromagnetic state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular basal plane layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered (paramagnetic) state at [...]|$|E
500|$|Thulium was {{discovered}} by Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in the oxides of other rare earth elements (this was the same method Carl Gustaf Mosander earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements). Cleve started by removing all of the known contaminants of erbia (Er2O3). [...] Upon additional processing, he obtained two new substances; one brown and one green. The brown substance was the oxide of the element <b>holmium</b> and was named holmia by Cleve, and the green substance was the oxide of an unknown element. Cleve named the oxide thulia and its element thulium after Thule, an Ancient Greek place name associated with Scandinavia or Iceland. Thulium's atomic symbol was once Tu, but this was changed to Tm.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{discrepancies}} between lanthanum and the lighter group 3 elements can simply {{be explained by}} its larger size, as expected from periodic trends, as it precedes the lanthanide contraction that makes the early period 6 transition metals so similar to their period 5 homologs. This phenomenon, based on the poor shielding of nuclear charge by the 4f electrons that are added across the lanthanide series, results in a decrease of ionic and atomic radii across the lanthanide series, causing the early period 6 transition metals (just after the lanthanides) until about rhenium to be very similar to their period 5 homologs. This same effect makes yttrium more similar to lutetium (4f145d16s2) than lanthanum. However, scandium still shows many differences from lutetium because it is even smaller, {{and in any case}} the similarity of yttrium is more generally to all of the late lanthanides from gadolinium onward, especially <b>holmium</b> which has almost the same ionic radius. Unlike all the other lanthanides, no lanthanum ions have any electrons in f-orbitals (La+: 5d2; La2+: 5d1; La3+: [...] ),; this casts some doubt on lanthanum's placement in the f-block, as would be suggested by a table placing lutetium in group 3. Although f-orbitals have been suggested to be involved in metallic bonding in lanthanum metal, [...] d-orbital involvement has been found in calcium, which precedes the d-block.|$|E

2500|$|Crystal field {{splitting}} {{is rather}} {{small for the}} lanthanide ions and {{is less important than}} spin-orbit coupling in regard to energy levels. Transitions of electrons between f orbitals are forbidden by the Laporte rule. Furthermore, because of the [...] "buried" [...] nature of the f orbitals, coupling with molecular vibrations is weak. Consequently, the spectra of lanthanide ions are rather weak and the absorption bands are similarly narrow. Glass containing <b>holmium</b> oxide and <b>holmium</b> oxide solutions (usually in perchloric acid) have sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range 200–900nm and {{can be used as a}} wavelength calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers, and are available commercially.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Holmium</b> (Holmia, Latin {{name for}} Stockholm) was {{discovered}} by Marc Delafontaine and Jacques-Louis Soret in 1878 who noticed the aberrant spectrographic absorption bands of the then-unknown element (they called it [...] "Element X").

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{elements}} which were discovered {{as a consequence}} of the lengthy analysis and breakdown of the ore Gadolinite.
