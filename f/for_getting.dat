5|$|Because the Laborers {{had more}} {{applicants}} than jobs available, the process <b>for</b> <b>getting</b> {{a job on}} the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process. There were multiple levels of eligibility, based {{on the amount of}} seniority a person had. A-level members had the first pick of jobs, but they had to have worked at least 800 hours with the union in the previous year. B-level members had to have worked between 100 and 800 hours with the union. C-level members had to have at least two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year. D-level was for everyone else, and D-level people rarely got jobs. That didn't stop people from trying. At 11 a.m. on January 1, 1974, shortly before the pipeline right-of-way was signed, more than 100 people spent the night outside the Fairbanks office of the Laborers Union, waiting for the first choice of jobs when the office opened.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Tottenham's Pat van den Hauwe was cautioned by Holbrook <b>for</b> <b>getting</b> tangled with Arsenal's David Rocastle, in spite Rocastle {{indicating}} that the player used an elbowâ€“ a bookable offence. Moments after, Rocastle was shown a yellow card for attempting to get his own back on Van Den Hauwe, by tackling the player without intent. Van Den Hauwe was later booked for a wild challenge on Lee Dixon. Arsenal dominated possession during the second half, with Tottenham infrequently troubling their opponent's defence and relying on counterattacks to fashion goal-scoring chances. Smith had a chance saved in the 75th minute by goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, when the ball was back-passed across the penalty area by Steve Sedgley. In the final seconds of the match substitute Andrew Cole, who had replaced Campbell, shot from 20 yards and into the side-netting.|$|E

She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during classâ€”all so that the boys could see her underwear.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{high-ranking}} US Navy officials {{elected to}} contract a private salvage firm {{to free the}} battleship, but Admiral Smith, at the time Commander, Cruisers, Atlantic, {{and the man who}} was responsible for issuing Missouris orders disagreed with this plan. He reasoned that if the Navy got her on to the shoal, then they should be responsible <b>for</b> <b>getting</b> her off the shoal. Ultimately, he won his case for a US Navy salvage effort, but he was explicitly informed by officials at The Pentagon that his career would ride on his ability to successfully get Missouri back into deep water. To better organize the salvage effort, Smith and a number of men on his staff moved aboard Missouri to supervise her return to deep water. Smith's supervision also extended to answering the nearly 10,000 letters sent to the Navy from concerned citizens offering advice on how to get the battleship back into deep water.|$|E
