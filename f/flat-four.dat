5|$|Production of For Your Eyes Only {{began on}} 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days {{shooting}} exterior scenes with the St Georges. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, {{as well as}} the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started on Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons. Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citroën 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s. The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver Rémy Julienne – who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye – driving the Citroën. Four 2CVs were used, with modifications for the stunts – all had more powerful <b>flat-four</b> engines, and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so it could get turned upside down.|$|E
25|$|The last {{evolution}} of the 2CV engine was the Citroën Visa flat-2, a 652cc featuring electronic ignition. Citroën never sold this engine in the 2CV, but some enthusiasts have converted their 2CVs to 652 engines, or even transplanted Citroën GS or GSA <b>flat-four</b> engines and gearboxes.|$|E
25|$|The Legacy still uniquely offers {{standard}} {{all-wheel drive}} and horizontally opposed engine layouts, but discontinues the manual transmission for the US market {{in favor of}} the Lineartronic CVT on both engine configurations. The US Market variation of the 2016 Legacy achieves a notable 36 highway MPG when equipped with the 2.5-liter <b>flat-four.</b>|$|E
50|$|Homebuilt {{aircraft}} builders often favour {{flat four}} engines {{because of their}} smoothness and suitability for air-cooling. For some years modified Volkswagen and Subaru <b>flat-fours</b> were popular. In recent times, <b>flat-fours</b> manufactured specifically for kit planes have been successful; such motors include the Rotax 912, the Jabiru 2200 and the D-Motor LF26.|$|R
5000|$|In 1955, in Britain, Wooler {{produced}} {{a small number}} of 500 cc <b>flat-fours</b> with shaft drive ...|$|R
5000|$|The first Minacro {{was built}} in Austria, making its first flight in about 1991 or 1992 powered by a [...] Potez 4E-20A engine. Later French-built {{examples}} have [...] Continental C90 or [...] Continental O-200-A engines. [...] All of these are air-cooled <b>flat-fours.</b> In 2014 the Austrian Minacro was no longer registered but there were six on the French register, of which at least four, possibly all six, have been completed.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} air-cooled engines, most of <b>flat-four</b> configuration, were used to power J-3 Cubs, resulting in differing model designations for each type: the J3C models used the Continental A series, the J3F used the Franklin 4AC, and the J3L used the Lycoming O-145. A very few examples, designated J3P, were equipped with Lenape Papoose 3-cylinder radial engines.|$|E
25|$|The DM-165 was a tandem two-seat low-wing monoplane. Powered by a 165hp (121kW) Continental IO-346A <b>flat-four</b> piston engine. It had a {{tailwheel}} and retractable {{landing gear}} which folded inwards. Dalotel was assisted by Société Poulet {{in the construction of}} the prototype, registered F-PPZE, which was first flown in April 1969. The aircraft was successfully tested during 1970 but despite efforts to market the aircraft none were ordered.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} and empennage have {{a wooden}} structure and carbon fibre skin. The engine is 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912S <b>flat-four,</b> driving a variable pitch propeller. The cabin {{is over the}} wings, with two pairs of side-by-side seats. Entry is by two upward-opening doors {{and there is a}} baggage space behind the rear seats. At the rear the vertical surfaces are straight-edged and swept, with a long dorsal strake. The horizontal surfaces are approximately trapezoidal in plan, with an unswept leading edge.Both the rudder and elevators are fabric covered. The rudder is balanced and both it and the port elevator carry trim tabs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of motorcycle engines are configured as singles, parallel twins, triples, fours and sixes; {{and all these}} may be inline or transverse. Vee engines include V-twins and V-fours, and horizontally opposed engines include flat-twins, <b>flat-fours</b> and flat-sixes. Wankel engines are either single-rotor or twin-rotor. Bigger bikes {{tend to have more}} cylinders for smoothness and increased power. Modern singles range in capacity from 50 cc to 660 cc, twins from 175 cc to 1,800 cc, triples from 380 cc to 2,300 cc, and so on.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{four-stroke}} cycle <b>flat-fours</b> {{have a problem}} common to all four-cylinder engines: the power strokes do not overlap. With a piston starting its power stroke every 180 degrees of crankshaft rotation, and the crank throws 180 degrees apart, all the pistons finish their power stroke before the next piston starts its power stroke. This results in gaps between power strokes and a pulsating delivery of torque to the flywheel, causing a rotational vibration on the entire engine along the crankshaft axis. By contrast, in engines with more cylinders the power strokes overlap; the next piston starts its power stroke before the previous one has finished, and the delivery of power is much smoother.|$|R
50|$|The Subaru EJ {{engine is}} a series of {{four-stroke}} automotive engines manufactured by Subaru. They were introduced in 1989, intended to succeed the previous Subaru EA engine. The EJ series is the mainstay of Subaru's engine line, with all engines of this series being 16-valve horizontal <b>flat-fours,</b> with configurations available for single, or double-overhead camshaft arrangements (SOHC or DOHC). Naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions are available, ranging from 96 to 320 horsepower. These engines are commonly used in light aircraft, kit cars and engine swaps into air-cooled Volkswagens, and are also popular as a swap into the wasserboxer engined Volkswagen T3/Vanagon. Primary engineering on the EJ series was done by Masayuki Kodama, Takemasa Yamada and Shuji Sawafuji of Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru's parent company.|$|R
2500|$|The short {{fuselage}} is flat sided, mostly {{occupied by}} a long canopy over the single seat cockpit. [...] The engine, a [...] Volkswagen 1.2 litre air-cooled <b>flat-four,</b> is in the rear in pusher configuration. [...] The P.40 has a low, fixed, faired bicycle undercarriage.|$|E
2500|$|On {{its first}} flight and for early tests, the H.100 was powered by two [...] Régnier 4EO four {{cylinder}} inverted air-cooled engines. The aircraft was damaged in a take-off accident on 3 September 1955 and during a prolonged rebuild the Régnier's were replaced {{with much more}} powerful [...] Lycoming O-360 <b>flat-four</b> engines. It flew with these engines in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|The Courier is {{available}} only with conventional landing gear but can be equipped with floats and skis. The original basic engine was the Rotax 503 of , with the Rotax 582 of [...] being available as an option. Today the standard engine is the [...] Rotax 912ULS. [...] At least one S7 has been fitted with a Jabiru 2200 <b>flat-four,</b> four-stroke direct-drive engine.|$|E
5000|$|By about 1979 the Citröen {{engines of}} both the AS-37A and AS-37B had been {{replaced}} with more powerful 75 kW (100 hp) Porsche 2 <b>flat-fours.</b> [...] The first AS-37B was then heavily modified by its builder into the Knoepfli VSTOL. The wings, empennage, forward fuselage and undercarriage of the AS-37B were retained but the rear fuselage was replaced with a slim, low set, flat sided, slightly upward curved beam, allowing {{a new and more}} conventional pusher engine and propeller combination to be placed immediately behind the cabin, just above the original fuselage line. These alterations were made before the end of summer 1980 and may have included another engine change to a Renault 343. [...] Between 1980 and 1998 the AS-37A had undergone further modifications with the installation of tractor, rather than pusher, propellers, belt driven as before. The undercarriage was altered into a similar form to that of the AS-37B though without the wheel fairings. This version was renamed the Starck-Nickel SN.01.|$|R
2500|$|The second Gazelle to fly was the {{prototype}} of the four-seat GV-1031 tourer, powered by a 112kW (150hp) Lycoming O-320 <b>flat-four</b> engine. [...] An intermediate, three-seat variant with a Rolls-Royce built 97kW (130hp) Continental O-240 engine was planned but {{may not have been}} built. A four-five seat variant with a 134kW (180hhp) engine and retractable undercarriage was also planned, and feasibility studies of [...] a twin-engine version made, but neither reached the construction stage.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{distinct}} variants, each {{available as}} a kit or a flyaway aircraft, have been marketed. [...] The Ultralight has a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of [...] to fulfil the European Ultralight limit. Another variant, designated Experimental has an empty weight increased by [...] and an MTOW of [...] The Pioneer 400T has the same MTOW as the Experimental but {{is powered by a}} turbo-charged [...] Rotax 914 <b>flat-four</b> which raises the cruising speed to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Ka 10 was a {{development}} of Nikolay Kamov's earlier Ka-8, {{which had been}} successful enough to allow Kamov to set up his own OKB (design bureau) in 1948. The Ka-10 was of similar layout to the Ka-8, with an open steel-tube structure carrying an engine, a pilot's seat and two three-bladed coaxial rotors. It was larger, however, with a revised transmission and rotor hub design, and a new engine specially designed for the helicopter, the [...] Ivchenko AI-4 <b>flat-four.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Kityonok is {{normally}} {{powered by a}} 73.5kW (98.6hp) Rotax 912 ULS <b>flat-four</b> engine driving a three bladed propeller, though the lower powered Rotax 503UL or 582 UL are options. Access to the cabin is via two deep, glazed doors. The Kityonok has a conventional undercarriage with main wheels on backward leaning cantilever legs mounted on torsion bars in the lower fuselage. The mainwheels have hydraulic brakes and the tailwheel castors. [...] Alternatively it can be equipped with skis or floats.|$|E
2500|$|The first GV-103L, {{as it was}} {{originally}} called, was a two- or three-seat light touring aircraft first flown in 1969. Later {{referred to as the}} GV-103 and powered by an 86kW (115hp) Lycoming O-235 <b>flat-four</b> engine, it led to several production variants with two, three and four seats using engines of increasing power within the same airframe. It had a side-by-side seating layout and a fixed tricycle undercarriage with a longer nosewheel which gave the aircraft a pronounced tail-down attitude on the ground. [...] Its construction was primarily metal but included some glass fibre structures and plastic bonding, novel at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The Husky {{features}} a braced high wing, tandem seating and dual controls. The structure is steel tube frames and Dacron covering {{over all but}} {{the rear of the}} fuselage, plus metal leading edges on the wings. The high wing was selected for good all-around visibility, making the Husky ideal for observation and patrol roles. [...] Power is supplied by a relatively powerful (for the Husky's weight) [...] Textron Lycoming O-360 <b>flat-four</b> piston engine turning a constant speed propeller. In 2015 a reversible MT Propeller was approved under a Supplementary Type Certificate for better control during floatplane water operations. [...] The Husky's high power-to-weight ratio and low wing loading result in good short-field performance.|$|E
2500|$|The 1961 Type 1 Beetle had a 36hp 1200cc four {{cylinder}} air-cooled <b>flat-four</b> opposed OHV engine made {{of aluminum}} alloy block and heads. By 1966, the Type 1 {{came with a}} 1300 engine. By 1967 the Type 1 had a 1500 engine, and 1600 in 1970. The air-cooled engine lost favor in the USA market {{with the advent of}} non-leaded gasoline and smog controls. These air-cooled engines were commonly tuned to be fuel rich in order to control engine over-heating, and this led to excessive carbon monoxide emissions. VW Production equipment was eventually moved to Mexico where vehicle emissions were not regulated. Beetles were popular on the USA West Coast where the limited-capacity cabin heating was less inconvenient. Beetles were popularized on the USA West Coast as beach buggies and dune buggies.|$|E
2500|$|Prototypes {{of the car}} {{called the}} [...] "KdF-Wagen" [...] (German: Kraft durch Freude– [...] "Strength through Joy"), {{appeared}} from 1938 onwards (the first cars had been produced in Stuttgart). The car already had its distinctive round shape and air-cooled, <b>flat-four,</b> rear-mounted engine. The VW car {{was just one of}} many KdF programs, which included things such as tours and outings. The prefix Volks— ("People's") was not just applied to cars, but also to other products in Germany; the [...] "Volksempfänger" [...] radio receiver for instance. On May 28, 1937, Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH ("Company for the Preparation of the German Volkswagen Ltd."), or Gezuvor for short, was established by the Deutsche Arbeitsfront in Berlin. More than a year later, on September 16, 1938, it was renamed to Volkswagenwerk GmbH.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Flamingo had a laminar flow airfoil and were made entirely of wood. The first {{prototype}} was powered by 150hp (112kW) Lycoming O-320 <b>flat-four</b> engines but later aircraft had 200hp (150kW) Lycoming IO-360 flat-fours. [...] These were conventionally mounted ahead of the leading edge in long cowlings with their propeller shafts, driving two-blade airscrews, centred above the wing upper surface. There were fuel tanks in the thin wings, with more fuel in wing tip tanks. Unusually, the Flamingo was fitted with both flaps and airbrakes. [...] The flaps were of the camber changing type, to increase lift at low speed; they were split into three sections on each wing and slid rearwards and downwards on concealed rails. [...] The airbrakes were wing mounted spoilers for losing speed. Like the wings the empennage was all-wood; the cantilever tailplane was set low on the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|These were {{initially}} {{powered by a}} [...] Rolls-Royce Continental A65 air-cooled flat four, but this produced insufficient power, due to the shorter-stroke, higher-RPM mid-20th century engine, driving a small-diameter modern propeller, being inefficient at the low airspeed achieved by the Boxkite, which originally used the slower-revving Gnome Omega 50 hp seven-cylinder rotary engine. [...] This resulted in {{the replacement of the}} 65hp <b>flat-four</b> by a [...] Continental O-200-B engine. [...] These proved flyable enough to be used for cross-country flights between filming locations. Another tribute to the soundness of the design is that the calculations made for the purpose of granting the necessary Certificates of Airworthiness found that the stressing of the design was very close to modern requirements. After filming one was sent to the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery another to the Shuttleworth Collection in Bedfordshire, where it is still flown during flying displays when the weather permits, and the third to the Museum of Australian Army Flying in Queensland.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the cooling}} {{problems}} and some issues concerning the undercarriage had been resolved, the same aircraft flew as the Pa.61B Arbalète but {{proved to be}} underpowered with the Hirth engine. As a result, a new machine, the Pa.61F Arbalète II, was built, powered by a [...] Lycoming O-360 air-cooled <b>flat-four</b> engine with side air intakes on the semi-monocoque, circular cross-section fuselage. The Arbalète II's cockpit was {{large enough to hold}} three. The mid-span fins were different, slightly straight tapered, mounted on the trailing edge and extending below it. [...] Below the rudders they carried airbrakes. The slight sweep on the centre wing section trailing edge has led to a description of the wing plan as [...] "crescent" [...] rather than delta. A [...] narrow continuation of {{the leading edge of the}} wing to the nose formed strakes on each side. There were control surfaces on the trailing edges both within and beyond the fins. The Arbalète II's main undercarriage legs were moved inboard, mounted on the wing but close to the fuselage.|$|E
