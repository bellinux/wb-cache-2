50|$|In a rate {{indicating}} gyroscope, the gyroscope {{is turned}} {{at a steady}} rate about its <b>input</b> <b>axis</b> and a torque {{is applied to the}} spin axis. This causes the gyroscope to precess about the output axis.The rate indicating gyroscope consists of a damping fluid between the float assembly can and the outer casing. This viscous fluid resists the motion of the gimbal precession. This causes the gimbal to accelerate initially in the fluid, until the damping effect is equal to the precessing force.The rate of precession, will hence be directly proportional to the rate of turn of the gyroscope about its <b>input</b> <b>axis</b> and the total angle of movement about the output axis will be proportional to the speed and length of time the <b>input</b> <b>axis</b> is turning.|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} The Scale Axis Transform {{provides a}} parametric simplification of the Medial Axis of a 3 D shape {{which can be}} seen as a hierarchical description. However, this powerful shape analysis method has a significant computational cost, requiring several minutes for a single scale on a mesh of few thousands vertices. Moreover, the scale axis can be artificially complexified at large scales, introducing new topological structures in the simplified model. In this paper, we propose a progressive medial axis simplification method inspired from surface optimization techniques which retains the geometric intuition of the scale axis transform. We compute a hierarchy of simplified medial axes by means of successive edge-collapses of the <b>input</b> medial <b>axis.</b> These operations prevent the creation of artificial tunnels that can occur in the original scale axis transform. As a result, our progressive simplification approach allows to compute the complete hierarchy of scales in a few seconds on typical input medial axes. We show how this variation of the scale axis transform impacts the resulting medial structure. </p...|$|R

The present design {{is an attempt to}} reduce cross-coupling to a level that can be controlled with breakout force, rather than to eliminate it entirely. The cascaded design placed lateral and longitudinal cyclic in their normal configuration. Tail rotor thrust was placed atop the cyclic controller. A left/right twisting motion with the wrist made the control <b>input.</b> The <b>axis</b> of rotation was canted outboard (clockwise) to minimize cross-coupling with the cyclic pitch axis. The collective control was a twist grip, like a motorcycle throttle. Measurement of the amount of cross-coupling involved in pure, single-axis inputs showed cross coupling under 10 percent of full deflection for all axes. This small amount of cross-coupling could be further reduced with better damping and force gradient control.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a design methodology for the optimal synthesis of hybrid mechanisms. Hybrid mechanisms have been defined as multi-degree of freedom systems where the input motions are supplied by different motor types. In this work a five bar mechanism is designed for a given task under the constraint that one <b>input</b> <b>axis</b> rotates with constant velocity whilst the other input can exhibit any motion requirement. A machine of this type is classified as being cross-coupled due to the mechanical linkage between the input axes. Cross-coupling implies that the input motion on one axis effects {{the position of the}} other <b>input</b> <b>axis.</b> This can lead to either opposition to, or accentuation of the control system input. Such a system as this is difficult to control due to the compensation for this on each axis leading to further disturbance. Results are presented for a real machine operating in this way and the actual output of the machine is compared to the desired input of the machine.

The system, {{which is based on}} control moment gyroscope (CMG) principles, utilises the gyroscopic response of a gimballed flywheel mounted within an AUV body to generate energy from the wave induced rotational motions of the vehicle. This method, of using the reaction of a spinning wheel under an input torque to provide an output torque of greater magnitude, orthogonal to the <b>input</b> torque <b>axis</b> and the spin axis provides a means to harvest energy in-situ, without external appendages and additional hydrodynamic drag. The system promises to extend AUV mission durations indefinitely and reduce support vessel time currently required for periodical recharging and redeployment.
