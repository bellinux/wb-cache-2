The <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> {{instability}} {{has been}} suggested as {{a participant in the}} creation of frontal structures observed in both the Es and F layers of the nighttime midlatitude iono-sphere, {{in spite of the fact}} that the spatial scales of the frontal structures are very different in the two layers. The linear growth rate of the instability has a maxima in the vicin-ity of the wavelength observed for the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> structures (short wavelengths). However, the maxima is non-distinct, and simulations have shown that the instability is extremely nonlinear. Therefore, to understand the wavelength depen-dence of the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> instability it is necessary to factor in nonlinear behavior. Simulations have shown that the insta-bility is active at the wavelengths observed in the F layer, and revealed that the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> behavior at these long wave-lengths is so nonlinear that the common, highly localized <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> observation techniques would likely miss the signature, which is highly visible in the F layer.

It is found that the latitudinal variation in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> occurrence is substantially geomagnetically controlled, most frequent in the summer hemisphere within the geomagnetic latitude region between 10 ° and 70 ° and very rare in the geomagnetic equatorial zone. Model simulations show that the summer maximum (winter minimum) in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> occurrence is very likely attributed to the convergence of the Fe+ concentration flux driven by the neutral wind. In addition to seasonal and spatial distributions, the height-time variations in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> occurrence in the midlatitude (> 30 °) region in summer and spring are primarily dominated by the semidiurnal tides, which start to appear at local time around 6 and 18 -h in the height range 110 - 120 -km and gradually descend {{at a rate of about}} 0. 9 - 1. 6 -km/h.

The sodium lidar observed an SSL at 21 : 18 UT on 22 January 2012. The SSL was observed for 18 min, with a maximum sodium density of about 1. 9 × 1010 m− 3 at 93 km with a 1. 1 km thickness. The European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar observed a sporadic E layer (<b>Es</b> <b>layer)</b> above 90 km from 20 : 00 to 23 : 00 UT. After 20 : 00 UT, the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> gradually descended and reached 94 km at 21 : 18 UT when the SSL appeared at the same altitude. In this event, considering the abundance of sodium ions (10 % or less), the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> could provide only about 37 % or less of the sodium atoms to the SSL. We have investigated a temporal development of the normal sodium ion layer with a consideration of chemical reactions {{and the effect of}} the (southwestward) electric field using observational values of the neutral temperature, electron density, horizontal neutral wind, and electric field. This calculation has shown that those processes, including contributions of the <b>Es</b> <b>layer,</b> would provide about 88 % of sodium atoms of the SSL. The effects of meteor absorption and auroral particle sputtering appear to be less important. Therefore, we have concluded that the major source of the SSL was sodium ions in a normal sodium ion layer. Two processes – namely the downward transportation of sodium ions from a normal sodium ion layer due to the electric field and the additional supply of sodium ions from the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> under relatively high electron density conditions (i. e., in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer)</b> – {{played a major role in}} generating the SSL in this event.

The generic {{equilibrium}} {{configuration of the}} nighttime midlatitude ionosphere consists of an F layer held up against gravity by winds and/or electric fields, and a spo-radic E (<b>Es)</b> <b>layer</b> located by a sheared wind field, which experiences the same electric fields as the F layer.

Electric fields on scales larger than (about) 10 km map very efficiently between the Es and F layers, and the two instabilities have a similar geometry, al-lowing them to interact with one another. As shown through a linear growth rate analysis, the two most important param-eters governing the interaction are the relative horizontal ve-locity between the Es and F layers, and the integrated con-ductivity ratio 6 H / 6 PF, where 6 H and 6 PF are the field line integrated Hall conductivity of the <b>Es</b> <b>layer,</b> and the field line integrated Pedersen conductivity of the F layer, respec-tively. For both large and small relative velocities the growth rate was found to be more than double that of the Perkins instability alone, when 6 H 6 PF = 1. 8. However, the characteris-tic eigenmode varies considerably with relative velocity, and different nonlinear behavior is expected in these two cases. As a follow up to the linear growth rate analysis, we ex-plore in this article the nonlinear evolution of the unstable coupled system subject to a 200 km wavelength initial per-turbation of the F layer, using a two-dimensional numerical solution of the two-fluid equations, as a function of relative horizontal velocity and 6...|$|E

It was roughly estimated as follows: (a) The lowest {{part of the original}} profile (solid blue) up to 83  km was shifted downward by 12  km. The value of this downward shift is based on the work by Han and Cummer (2010), and references therein, who reported the lowering of reflection height for atmospherics in D layer by about 6  km if the X-ray flux in the 0.1 – 0.8  nm channel increased by a factor of 10. They found that the decrease in the reflection height depends practically linearly on the logarithm of X-ray flux. The X-ray flux in this channel increased approximately 100 times in our case (Fig.  4 a). (b) The height of the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> around 100  km was considered unchanged during the solar flare. This assumption could not be proved experimentally as the minimum frequency detectable in the ionogram is larger than the critical frequency of Es (Fig.  6) during the X-ray flare. However, the height of Es usually does not change rapidly. Also, the rapid change of the height of Es is not expected as the generally accepted main mechanism responsible for the formation of the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> is the wind shear (Mathews 1998; Haldoupis 2012). It is more complicated to estimate the change of {{electron density}} in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer,</b> which likely increases during the X-ray flare because of the enhanced ionizing flux. We will assume for simplicity that the relative increase in the Es density {{is the same as the}} relative increase in electron densities in the layers above that can be estimated from the Doppler shifts. This might be not quite correct and leads to a certain uncertainty. Nevertheless, the influence of this uncertainty on the cumulative attenuation is not dominant because of the relatively narrow height extent of the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> as seen in Fig.  7. (c) The profile in the F layer was lowered by Δh[*]=[*] 4.5  km as estimated from Fig.  5 b. It is reminded that there is a close relation between the height decrease and electron density increase at a specific height (Eqs.  4, 6, 7). To ensure that there is an electron density increase ΔN also at regions with negative electron density gradient, mainly above the <b>Es</b> <b>layer,</b> the sign of Δh was changed in that region. It should be noted that the changes of electron densities above[*]~[*] 110  km and especially in the F layer have only negligible influence on the imaginary part of wave vector and hence on the attenuation. (d) The downward shift of the most critical and important part between 83  km and <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> (in original profile) was adjusted so that the relative changes of attenuations would correspond with the observed changes presented in Fig.  3 a and b. A rough agreement between the observed and simulated changes ΔAdB was obtained for the downward shift of 9  km for this part of the profile. The corresponding imaginary parts of Im(k) and attenuations are shown by dashed lines in Fig.  7 c and d, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Possible {{thunderstorm}} - sporadic E (<b>Es)</b> <b>layer</b> coupling {{effects are}} investigated during two measurement periods, one in 2013 {{and one in}} 2014. The analysis was based on ionospheric observations obtained from a Digisonde at Pruhonice, the Czech Republic, an ionosonde at Nagycenk, Hungary, and a 3. 59 MHz five-point continuous HF Doppler system located {{in the western part}} of the Czech Republic. The latter is capable of detecting ionospheric wave-like variations caused by neutral atmospheric waves generated by thunderstorms. The present study searches for possible impacts on Es layers caused by the presence of two active thunderstorms: one passing across the Czech Republic on June 20, 2013 (19 : 00 - 01 : 00 LT), and one through Hungary on July 30, 2014 (11 : 00 - 01 : 00 LT). During these two time periods, presence and parameters of <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> were inferred from ionograms, recorded every minute at Pruhonice and every two minutes at Nagycenk, whereas concurrent lightning activity was monitored by the LINET detection network. In addition, transient luminous events (TLEs) were also observed during both nights from Sopron, Hungary and from Nydek, the Czech Republic. A noticeable fact was the reduction and disappearance of the ongoing <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> activity during part of the time in both of the traversing thunderstorms. The analysis indicated that the critical frequency foEs dropped below ionosonde detection levels in both cases, possibly because of thunderstorm activity effects. This option, however, needs more case studies in order to be further substantiated...|$|E
40|$|Lightning data, {{collected}} using a Boltek Storm Tracker system {{installed at}} Chilton, UK, {{were used to}} investigate the mean response of the ionospheric sporadic-E layer to lightning strokes in a superposed epoch study. The lightning detector can discriminate between positive and negative lightning strokes and between cloud-to-ground (CG) and inter-cloud (IC) lightning. Superposed epoch studies carried out separately using these subsets of lightning strokes as trigger events have revealed that the dominant cause of the observed ionospheric enhancement in the <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> is negative cloud-to-ground lightning...|$|E
30|$|In the {{equatorial}} region, the most frequently-observed type of <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> {{is the type}} “q” (equatorial). Despite {{the fact that this}} kind of signature in the ionograms does not indicate a layer in the sense of resulting in an enhancement of the electron density, and does not block signals reflected at the upper regions, it is classified as an <b>Es</b> <b>layer</b> in ionosphere research based on ionosondes (Piggot and Rawer, 1972). Indeed, the Esq layer is associated with equatorial electrojet (EEJ) current instabilities (Fejer and Kelley, 1980; Forbes, 1981). The signatures of the Esq layers in ionograms appears as a scattering of the ionosonde signal covering most of the frequency scale, and occurs during daylight time. Knecht and Mcduffie (1969) showed that the Esq can be detected over a distance of about 700 km in latitude around the magnetic equator, which agrees with the width of {{the equatorial}} geomagnetic field enhancements observed with a magnetometer. However, {{it must be noted that}} Esq layers may be observed simultaneously with other Es layers, such as the type “s” (slant), which are slants (in height) that emerge in the original layer trace (Cohen et al., 1962). A more comprehensive review on Es layers has been published by Whitehead (1970).|$|E
