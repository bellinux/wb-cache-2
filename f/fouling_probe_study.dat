40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Industrial Programs (OIP) {{sponsors}} {{the development}} of innovative heat exchange systems. Fouling is a major and persistent cost associated with most industrial heat exchangers and nationally wastes an estimated 2. 9 Quads per year. To predict and control fouling, three OIP projects are currently exploring heat exchanger fouling in specific industrial applications. A <b>fouling</b> <b>probe</b> has been developed to determine empirically the fouling potential of an industrial gas stream and to derive the fouling thermal resistance. The probe is a hollow metal cylinder capable of measuring the average heat flux {{along the length of}} the tube. The local heat flux is also measured by a heat flux meter embedded in the <b>probe</b> wall. The <b>fouling</b> <b>probe</b> has been successfully tested in the laboratory at flue gas temperatures up to 2200 ?F and a local heat flux up to 41, 000 BTU/hr-ft 2. The probe has been field tested at a coal-fired boiler plant. Future tests at a municipal waste incinerator are planned. Two other projects study enhanced heat exchanger tubes, specifically the effect of enhanced surface geometries on tube bundle performance. Both projects include fouling in a liquid heat transfer fluid. Identifying and quantifying the factors affecting fouling in these enhanced heat transfer tubes will lead to techniques to mitigate fouling...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of fouling unit is {{developed}} for high-temperature (500 C) and high-pressure (70 atmosphere) fouling experiments by modifying a commercial autoclave. Key modifications are the installation of a helical impeller in a flow tube and a <b>fouling</b> <b>probe</b> in the autoclave to simulate the fluid dynamics and heat transfer of typical heat-exchange equipment. A calibration technique is described, and fouling results are presented for experimental runs with indene and kerosene. The results are compared with those obtained using other types of fouling test units. Other potential applications of the fouling unit, such as corrosion and micro-scale reaction experiments, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Vaccine <b>probe</b> <b>studies</b> {{have emerged}} in the past 15 years as a useful way to characterise disease. By contrast, {{traditional}} studies of vaccines focus on defining the vaccine effectiveness or efficacy. The underlying basis for the vaccine probe approach is that the difference in disease burden between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals can be ascribed to the vaccine-specific pathogen. Vaccine <b>probe</b> <b>studies</b> can increase understanding of a vaccine's public health value. For instance, even when a vaccine has a seemingly low efficacy, a high baseline disease incidence {{can lead to a}} large vaccine-preventable disease burden and thus that population-based vaccine introduction would be justified. So far, vaccines have been used as probes to characterise disease syndromes caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcus, rotavirus, and early infant influenza. However, vaccine <b>probe</b> <b>studies</b> have enormous potential and could be used more widely in epidemiology, for example, to define the vaccine-preventable burden of malaria, typhoid, paediatric influenza, and dengue, and to identify causal interactions between different pathogens. 092654 /Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom 098532 /Wellcome Trust/United KingdomCC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 12 - 17 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24553294 PMC 468254...|$|R

To our knowledge, {{this is also the}} only such study to incorporate significant time lapse between gallery and probe image acquisition, and to look at the effect of depth resolution. Recognition results are obtained in (1) single gallery and a single <b>probe</b> <b>study,</b> and (2) a single gallery and multiple <b>probe</b> <b>study.</b> A total of 275 subjects participated in one or more data acquisition sessions.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, several indices based on ash {{chemistry}} and ash fusibility {{have been used}} to predict the ash behaviour during coal combustion, namely, its tendency for slagging and fouling. However, due to the physicalechemical differences between coals and biomass, in this work only the applicability of an ash fusibility index (AFI) to the combustion and co-combustion of three types of biomass (straw pellets, olive cake and wood pellets) with coals was evaluated. The AFI values were compared with the behaviour of ash during combustion in a pilot fluidized bed and a close agreement was observed between them. For {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms associated with bed ash sintering, they were evaluated by SEM/EDS and the elements present on the melted ash were identified. Evidences of different sintering mechanisms were found out for the fruit biomass and herbaceous biomass tested, depending on the relative proportions of problematic elements. The particles deposited on a <b>fouling</b> <b>probe</b> inserted in the FBC were analyzed by XRD and the differences between the compounds identified allowed concluding that the studied biomasses present different tendencies for fouling.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this vanadyl spin <b>probe</b> <b>study</b> are threefold: (1) to establish when the breakdown of motionally narrowed formulas occurs; (2) to analyze the experimental vanadyl EPR line shapes by the stochastic Lioville method as developed by Polnaszek et al.

Spectral EPR line shapes are simulated for experimental spectra of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VOAA) in nematic liquid crystal butyl p-(p-ethoxyphenoxycarbonyl) phenyl carbonate (BEPC) and Phase V of EM laboratories. It is shown {{that the use of}} typical vanadyl complexes as spin probes for nematic liquid crystals simplifies the theoretical analysis and the subsequent interpretation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method called speed sketching, which utilizes user data as inspiration in a brainstorm-like session. The user data {{comes from a}} design <b>probe</b> <b>study</b> of an entrance to a building. One challenge with usercentered design is to give life to user data in the design process. A design workshop was held with five designers as participators. During the workshop speed sketching was used and evaluated through analysis of the sketches, a semi-structured questionnaire and discussions with the designers. The findings of the study show that the user data consisting of dream and horror stories of entrances provided input {{that could be used}} in a creative manner. Merely illustrating the stories as such seems to give less creative results than using the stories as a more general source of inspiration. Based on the study performed here speed sketching seems to be an effective and creative way to merge data from user studies with the design process. Using sketching as a quick and expressive means of interpreting a story created by a user of a design object provides designers with a systematic tool to creatively use material from a design <b>probe</b> <b>study.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper details infra-red {{pump and}} <b>probe</b> <b>studies</b> on nitric oxide {{conducted}} with two continuous wave quantum cascade lasers both operating around 5 Î¼m. The pump laser prepares a velocity selected population in a chosen rotational quantum {{state of the}} v = 1 level which is subsequently probed using a second laser tuned to a rotational transition within the v = 2 â v = 1 hot band. The rapid frequency scan of the probe (with respect to the molecular collision rate) {{in combination with the}} velocity selective pumping allows observation of marked rapid passage signatures in the transient absorption profiles from the polarized vibrationally excited sample. These coherent transient signals are influenced by the underlying hyperfine structure of the pump and probe transitions, the sample pressure, and the coherent properties of the lasers. Pulsed pump and <b>probe</b> <b>studies</b> show that the transient absorption signals decay within 1 Î¼s at 50 mTorr total pressure, reflecting both the polarization and population dephasing times of the vibrationally excited sample.
