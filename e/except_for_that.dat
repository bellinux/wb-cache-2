5|$|The JNA {{attacks on}} Dubronik and Zadar were {{supported}} by the Yugoslav Navy, which blockaded the coast on two more occasions. On 3 October, all shipping off Croatia, except for ferry lines to Pag and islands in the Kvarner Gulf, was halted. The blockade, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> of Dubrovnik, was lifted on 11 October. The final blockade, restricting access to Rijeka, Zadar, Šibenik and Split in addition to Dubrovnik, started on 8 November. On 15 November, the Yugoslav Navy sustained losses when it unsuccessfully attacked Split and the island of Brač. The Yugoslav blockade in the northern Adriatic ended on 22 November, but in the southern Adriaticexcept off Dubrovnikit was lifted on 3 December.|$|E

Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|Soho {{is an area}} first {{developed}} in the 1670s which, since the construction of theatres along Shaftesbury Avenue in the 19th century, has had a strong association with the entertainment industry. In {{the south of the}} district stands Leicester Square, the public sculpture of which has had an eventful history. From 1748 the square had as it centrepiece an equestrian figure of George I, but this deteriorated and was sold off {{at the beginning of the}} following century. In 1874 the square was bought by Albert Grant, a company promoter and MP, who had its gardens made over to a design by James Knowles. In this refurbishment the Shakespeare fountain and busts of four historical residents of the locale were installed, the latter positioned near the sites of their former homes. A renovation of the square carried out between 2010 and 2012 was criticised for its removal of all of the sculptures on the square <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> of Shakespeare.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, W. Clark Still {{introduced}} {{a modified version}} of column chromatography called flash column chromatography (flash). The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.|$|E

25|$|Pollution from {{agricultural}} runoff and overtaxing {{of water}} resources is a prevailing issue in the Salmon Falls Creek watershed. With heavy groundwater withdrawal, many of the springs feeding the lower Salmon Falls Creek have decreased in volume. Because the -high Salmon Falls Dam has not released any water (<b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> needed for irrigation) since the floods of 1984, the lower creek depends almost entirely on irrigation runoff drainage to sustain its flow. Pollutants in the runoff have, as a result, hurt the vegetation corridor in the lower canyon. Several tributaries flowing from northern Nevada into southern Idaho have been diverted, leaving even less water to replenish the lower creek.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{days after}} his {{appearance}} at SummerSlam and only one night after competing at a WWF house show in Saint John, New Brunswick, Luger made his return to WCW on the premiere of Nitro, coming out during the main event for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship between champion Hulk Hogan and Big Bubba Rogers. After Luger's return, he did not make his allegiances known acting as a tweener, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> he still did have a long-time friendship with Sting. He merely claimed {{that he wanted to}} stake his claim at Hogan's WCW World Heavyweight Title, facing him on the September 11, 1995 episode of Nitro, which Hogan won by disqualification. At Halloween Havoc, Luger attacked Hogan after his match with The Giant and joined Kevin Sullivan's Dungeon of Doom stable.|$|E
25|$|Sargon {{dealt with}} the Babylonian problem by {{cultivating}} the Babylonians; Sennacherib took a radically different approach, {{and there is little}} sign that he cared about Babylonian popular opinion or took part in the ceremonial duties expected of a Babylonian king, notably the New Year ritual. His relations, instead, were predominantly military, and culminated in his complete destruction of Babylon in 689BCE. He destroyed the temples and the images of the gods, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> of Marduk, the creator-god and divine patron of Babylon, which he took to Assyria. This caused consternation in Assyria itself, where Babylon and its gods were held in high esteem. Sennacherib attempted to justify his actions to his own countrymen through a campaign of religious propaganda. Among the elements of this campaign he commissioned a myth in which Marduk was put on trial before Ashur, the god of Assyria–the text is fragmentary but it seems Marduk is found guilty of some grave offense; he described his defeat of the Babylonian rebels in language of the Babylonian creation myth, identifying Babylon with the evil demon-goddess Tiamat and himself with Marduk; Ashur replaced Marduk in the New Year Festival; and in the temple of the festival he placed a symbolic pile of rubble from Babylon. In Babylon itself, Sennacherib's answer to the Babylonian problem sparked an intense hatred that would eventually lead to a war for independence and the destruction of Assyria.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{reported}} {{that if the}} 14th of Nisan falls on the Sabbath, Rabbi Meir taught that one must destroy leaven before the Sabbath (<b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> required {{for the beginning of}} the Sabbath itself). But the Sages maintained that one destroys the leaven at its usual time (on the morning of the 14th). Rabbi Eleazar bar Zadok taught that one had to destroy consecrated meat before the Sabbath (because if any was left, none could eat it), and unconsecrated food at its usual time (because one could easily find eaters for it). The Mishnah taught that those on the way to perform religious duties who recollect leaven at home, if they are able to go back, destroy it, and then return to the religious duty, must go back and destroy it. But if they cannot, then they annul it in their heart. Similarly, those on the way to save people from an emergency annul it in their heart. But those on their way to appoint a Sabbath station to set the limits of where they may travel on the Sabbath must return immediately to destroy the leaven. Similarly, those who left Jerusalem and recollected that they had consecrated meat with them, if they had passed Mount Scopus, they burned it where they were. But if they had not traveled that far, they returned and burned {{it in front of the}} Temple with the wood arranged for use in the altar. The Mishnah then discussed for what quantity they had to return. Rabbi Meir said for both leaven and consecrated meat, they had to return for a quantity as much as an egg. Rabbi Judah said when there was as much as an olive. But the Sages ruled that for consecrated meat, they had to return for as much as an olive; while for leaven, they had to return for as much as an egg.|$|E

500|$|Though {{requiring}} {{additional revenue}} {{to fund the}} Han–Xiongnu War, the government during Emperor Wu of Han's reign (141–87 BC) sought to avoid heavy taxation of small landowners. To increase revenue, the government imposed heavier taxes on merchants, confiscated land from nobles, sold offices and titles, and established government monopolies over the minting of coins, iron manufacture and salt mining. New taxes were imposed on the ownership of boats, carts, carriages, wheelbarrows, shops and other properties. The overall property tax for merchants was raised in 119 BC from 120 coins for every 10,000 coins-worth of property owned to 120 coins for every 2,000 coins-worth of property owned. Tax rates for almost all commodities are unknown, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> of liquor.
