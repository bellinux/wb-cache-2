40|$|Flashbulb {{memories}} (FBMs) are detailed {{recollections of}} {{the context in which}} people first heard about important events.

The present study compares these three competing models by investigating the FBMs that Belgian citizens developed upon learning of the unexpected death of their <b>king</b> <b>Baudouin.</b> Structural equation modeling revealed that, as compared to the two previously proposed models, the third model, which takes into account emotional processes, better explains FBM...|$|R
