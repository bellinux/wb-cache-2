5|$|Many Actinomycetales (Actinobacteria), a {{group with}} many <b>filamentous</b> bacteria, were also long {{believed}} to be fungi.|$|E
5|$|The {{cells of}} most fungi grow as tubular, elongated, and thread-like (<b>filamentous)</b> {{structures}} called hyphae, which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by growing at their tips. Each tip contains {{a set of}} aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the Spitzenkörper. Both fungi and oomycetes grow as <b>filamentous</b> hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as <b>filamentous</b> green algae, grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells. There are also single-celled fungi (yeasts) that do not form hyphae, and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms.|$|E
5|$|Tianyulong from China {{appears to}} {{preserve}} <b>filamentous</b> integument {{which has been}} interpreted to be {{a variant of the}} proto-feathers found in some theropods. These filaments include a crest along its tail. The presence of this <b>filamentous</b> integument has been used to suggest that both ornithischians and saurischians were endothermic.|$|E
5|$|One recent {{mathematical}} modeling {{study has}} suggested that the optical properties of the cristae in <b>filamentous</b> mitochondria may affect the generation and propagation of light within the tissue.|$|E
5|$|The fungi {{have several}} {{unicellular}} species, such as baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Some fungi, {{such as the}} pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, can undergo phenotypic switching and grow as single cells in some environments, and <b>filamentous</b> hyphae in others.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} systematic scheme exists using gill morphology. This {{distinguishes between}} Protobranchia, Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia. The first corresponds to Newell's Palaeotaxodonta and Cryptodonta, {{the second to}} his Pteriomorphia, with the last corresponding to all other groups. In addition, Franc separated the Septibranchia from his eulamellibranchs because of the morphological differences between them. The septibranchs belong to the superfamily Poromyoidea and are carnivorous, having a muscular septum instead of <b>filamentous</b> gills.|$|E
5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (<b>filamentous</b> structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, <b>filamentous</b> hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and truffles, unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many <b>filamentous</b> fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of <b>filamentous</b> ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
5|$|The asci {{are roughly}} {{cylindrical}} {{with a long}} stem-like base; the entire ascus is often as long as 300–325µm and about 15µm in diameter at the thickest point. The spores are round, smooth, translucent (hyaline), and have diameters of about 12–14µm. They are filled with many small oil droplets. The paraphyses (sterile <b>filamentous</b> hyphae in the hymenium) are enlarged at their tips and filled with brown colored matter, about 4µm thick.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{translucent}} (hyaline), roughly spherical, thin-walled and smooth, with {{dimensions of}} 6–8µm in diameter. The asci, the spore-bearing cells, are cylindrical and 80–100 by 7–8µm; the paraphyses are thin and <b>filamentous</b> and contain orange granules. Edibility {{has not been}} recorded for this fungus.|$|E
5|$|The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been}} an {{important}} model organism in modern cell biology for much of the twentieth century, {{and is one of the}} most thoroughly researched eukaryotic microorganisms. It was the first eukaryote whose genome was sequenced. In the twentyfirst century, the <b>filamentous</b> mould Aspergillus has been adopted for genome studies.|$|E
5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented <b>filamentous</b> bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of <b>filamentous</b> tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them {{a better chance of}} escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Some trees {{such as the}} alders (Alnus species) have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with Frankia species, a <b>filamentous</b> bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive. The plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.|$|E
5|$|Spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} in shape, amyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of either 8–10 by 6–7µm or 10–14 by 6.7–8.5µm {{depending on whether}} they originated from four-or two-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), respectively. There are abundant cheilocystidia on the gill edges. They measure 30–50 by 7–12µm, and are fusoid-ventricose, with tips that are broadly rounded. They are filled with a purplish sap and have granular contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated cuticle, a distinct hypoderm, and a <b>filamentous</b> tramal body. Clamp connections in the hyphae are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or <b>filamentous</b> structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The asci {{are long}} and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300–375 by 14–16µm. Although in most Pezizales all of the ascospores are formed {{simultaneously}} through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane, in S.coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster. The paraphyses (sterile <b>filamentous</b> hyphae present in the hymenium) are about 3µm wide (and only slightly thickened at the apex), and contain red pigment granules.|$|E
5|$|The {{green algae}} {{are a large}} group of {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not always with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and <b>filamentous</b> forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is an olive-brown colour. The oval to {{spindle-shaped}} spores have dimensions of 8–10 by 3.5–4.5μm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, measuring 22.4–33.4 by 5.8–8.0μm. They bear four sterigmata (each holding a single spore), which {{are up to}} 6.8μm long. Cystidia are present on both the tube ends (cheilocystidia) and tube faces (pleurocystidia). There are no clamp connections in the hyphae of Suillus bovinus. The cap cuticle comprises <b>filamentous,</b> gelatinized hyphae with a diameter of 2.6–5.0μm. The mycelium has a pink tinge.|$|E
5|$|The spores are , smooth, {{and measure}} 7–9 by 4.5–5µm. They are {{yellowish}} when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored, and measure 40–54 by 6–8µm. There are no cystidia on the gill faces or edges. The cap cuticle is an ixotrichoderm—a layer of gelatinized tissue where the distal portion of the <b>filamentous</b> hyphae are different lengths and the hyphae themselves are arranged perpendicular to the surface; this layer of gelatinous hyphae is between 100 and 250µm thick. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae of the cuticle and the gill tissue.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 7–9µm, spherical {{or nearly}} so, ornamented with a partial to {{complete}} reticulum (a system of raised, net-like ridges), with prominences up to 0.5µm high. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are both two- and four-spored, and measure 45–52 by 9–11µm. The cap cuticle is a poorly formed layer of inflated cells with scattered <b>filamentous</b> pileocystidia (cystidia on the cap). Somewhat {{unusual for a}} Lactarius, L.rufulus lacks or has few swollen cells (sphaerocysts) in the cap and stem.|$|E
5|$|The spores are hyaline (translucent), smooth, and {{ellipsoid}} {{with the}} ends truncate. They have dimensions of 11.5–20 by 5–9µm, and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, <b>filamentous</b> cells interspersed among the asci, or spore-producing cells) are 5–8µm wide at the tip, branched, septate (with partitions that divide the cells into compartments), and constricted at the septa. The asci are cylindrical, and measure 300–360 by 10–13µm; {{the tips of}} the asci stain blue with Melzer's reagent. The finely cylindrical paraphyses have slightly swollen tips and are forked at the base.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{translucent}} (hyaline), smooth, have {{an ellipsoid}} shape, with dimensions of 12–16 by 3–5µm. Spores contain {{one or two}} oil droplets. The imperfect (conidial) form of the fungus produces smooth, hyaline spores that are 3–3.5 by 1–2µm. The asci – sexual spore-bearing cells – have a cylindrical shape, with dimensions of 115–125 by 8–10µm. The paraphyses (sterile <b>filamentous</b> cells interspersed among the asci) are cylindrical with slightly swollen tips, and few branches.|$|E
5|$|White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its lifecycle. One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow <b>filamentous</b> coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust.|$|E
5|$|Another 2016 {{study used}} laser-stimulated {{fluorescence}} imaging {{to analyze the}} internal structure of the bristles. The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad <b>filamentous</b> feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.|$|E
5|$|Despite its feathers, most palaeontologists do not {{consider}} Sinosauropteryx to be birds. Phylogenetically, the genus is only distantly related to the clade Aves, usually defined as Archaeopteryx lithographica plus modern birds. The scientists who described Sinosauropteryx, however, used a character-based, or apomorphic, definition of the Class Aves, in which any animal with feathers {{is considered to be}} a bird. They argued that the <b>filamentous</b> plumes of Sinosauropteryx represent true feathers with a rachis and barbs, and thus that Sinosauropteryx should be considered a true bird. They classified the genus as belonging to a new biological order, Sinosauropterygiformes, family Sinosauropterygidae, within the subclass Sauriurae. These proposals have not been accepted, and Sinosauropteryx is generally classified in the family Compsognathidae, a group of small-bodied long-tailed coelurosaurian theropods known from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Asia, Europe, and South America.|$|E
5|$|Feduccia's frill {{argument}} was followed up {{in several other}} publications, in which researchers interpreted the <b>filamentous</b> impressions around Sinosauropteryx fossils as remains of collagen fibres rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the fibres formed a frill {{on the back of}} the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would refute the proposal that Sinosauropteryx is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also raise questions about the current theory of feather origins itself. It calls into question the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or <b>filamentous</b> virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching <b>filamentous</b> types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, {{but they are}} among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the <b>filamentous</b> gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile <b>filamentous</b> hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8μm, {{and may be}} {{attached}} to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2μm, and have a <b>filamentous</b> neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} for feathers in tyrannosauroids {{came from the}} small species Dilong paradoxus, found in the Yixian Formation of China, and reported in 2004. As with many other theropods discovered in the Yixian, the fossil skeleton was preserved with a coat of <b>filamentous</b> structures which are commonly recognized as the precursors of feathers. Because all known skin impressions from larger tyrannosauroids known at the time showed evidence of scales, the researchers who studied Dilong speculated that feathers may correlate negatively with body size—that juveniles may have been feathered, then shed the feathers and expressed only scales as the animal became larger and no longer needed insulation to stay warm. Subsequent discoveries showed that even some large tyrannosauroids had feathers covering much of their bodies, casting doubt on the hypothesis {{that they were a}} size-related feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In {{this type of}} development, the hymenium forms early {{on the underside of}} the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring <b>filamentous</b> hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{was first}} officially {{described}} in 1796 as Geoglossum glutinosum by Dutch mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon, who proposed several defining characteristics, including the black color; the smooth, compressed, club-shaped head (clavula) with grooves; and the somewhat curved and glutinous stipe. In 1908, Elias Judah Durand transferred it to Gloeoglossum, a genus he circumscribed to contain species with paraphyses (<b>filamentous,</b> sterile cells interspersed between the asci) present {{as a continuous}} gelatinous layer on the stipe; Gloeoglossum has since been reduced to synonymy with Geoglossum. In 1942 Japanese mycologist Sanshi Imai thought the species should be in Cibalocoryne, a genus name used earlier by Frigyes Ákos Hazslinszky, and so published Cibalocoryne glutinosa. Later authors thought Cibalocoryne to be ambiguous, and the name was synonymized with Geoglossum. Persoon also described the species Geoglossum viscosum (1801) and the variety Geoglossum glutinosum var. lubricum (1822), but both of these taxa were placed into synonymy with G.glutinosum by Elias Judah Durand in 1908.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of <b>filamentous</b> fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
