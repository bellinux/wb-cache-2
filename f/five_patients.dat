25|$|Aside from fiction, Crichton wrote {{several other}} books based on medical or {{scientific}} themes, often based upon his own observations {{in his field}} of expertise. In 1970, he published <b>Five</b> <b>Patients,</b> a book which recounts his experiences of hospital practices in the late 1960s at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The book follows each of <b>five</b> <b>patients</b> through their hospital experience and {{the context of their}} treatment, revealing inadequacies in the hospital institution at the time. The book relates the experiences of Ralph Orlando, a construction worker seriously injured in a scaffold collapse; John O'Connor, a middle-aged dispatcher suffering from fever that has reduced him to a delirious wreck; Peter Luchesi, a young man who severs his hand in an accident; Sylvia Thompson, an airline passenger who suffers chest pains; and Edith Murphy, a mother of three who is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease. In <b>Five</b> <b>Patients,</b> Crichton examines a brief history of medicine up to 1969, to help place hospital culture and practice into context, and addresses the costs and politics of American health care.|$|E

The corresponding ratios for 68 Ga-DOTATATE were 80, 4 and 1. Based on this, the phantom measurements were performed with no {{activity in the}} background (NB) to correspond to tumours in or close to the lung and the SBRs 5 : 1 and 2.5 : 1 to reflect tumours in the liver and 1.25 : 1 to reflect tumours in the spleen.|$|R

In a phase I clinical trial, five subjects with chronic HIV infection who had failed to respond to at least two antiretroviral regimens were treated. A single intravenous infusion of autologous CD4 T cells genetically modified with VRX496 was well tolerated.

25|$|<b>Five</b> <b>patients</b> with {{symptoms}} of persistent sleepiness were {{described in detail}} in 1925 by Willi Kleine, a neurologist from Frankfurt. This report was followed four years later by details of a similar case by New York-based psychiatrist Max Levin. In 1935, Levin published information about several more cases, including one described by Kleine. Levin noted that some patients displayed an intense appetite {{in addition to their}} persistent tiredness. MacDonald Critchley, who first wrote about the condition in 1942, described 11 cases he had examined and reviewed 15 other published cases in a 1962 publication. In the report, which included patients he had examined in the Royal Navy during World War II, he observed that irritability and depersonalization often occurred while patients were awake. He named the condition Kleine–Levin syndrome and noted four common traits: hypersexuality, adolescent onset, spontaneous resolution, and compulsive eating. He believed that the condition only affected males, but later studies showed some female patients. In the 1970s, several psychoanalytic and psychodynamic explanations for the condition were proposed. In 1980, a Hawaiian–Caucasian family was found in which nine family members suffered from the condition.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. We {{compared}} the ultrasonography and pathology features of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in pediatric and adolescents with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) {{with those of}} non-HT patients. Materials and Methods. Eleven patients who were surgically confirmed to have pediatric or adolescent PTC from 2006 to 2014 were included in this study. We retrospectively analyzed the preoperative ultrasonography and pathology features of PTC arising in HT and non-HT patients. Results. On ultrasonography, thyroid gland was lobulated and enlarged, with many scattered microcalcifications in four of <b>five</b> HT <b>patients.</b> Four of six non-HT patients had suspicious masses with calcifications. The diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC (DSVPTC) was found in three of <b>five</b> HT <b>patients,</b> but none in non-HT patients.

Three of five PTCs in pediatric and adolescent HT patients were DSVPTC, whereas all PTCs of the non-HT patients were classic type.
