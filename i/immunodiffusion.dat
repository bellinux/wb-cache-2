5|$|Practically, several {{immunodiagnostic}} methods {{based on}} detection of complex antigen-antibody {{are used to}} diagnose infectious diseases, for example ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blot, <b>immunodiffusion,</b> immunoelectrophoresis, and magnetic immunoassay. Antibodies raised against human chorionic gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double <b>immunodiffusion</b> using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Measuring and {{charting}} CRP values {{can prove}} useful in determining disease progress or {{the effectiveness of}} treatments. ELISA, immunoturbidimetry, nephelometry, rapid <b>immunodiffusion,</b> and visual agglutination are all methods used to measure CRP.|$|E
50|$|Radial <b>immunodiffusion</b> (RID) or Mancini method, Mancini <b>immunodiffusion</b> {{or single}} radial <b>immunodiffusion</b> assay, is an <b>immunodiffusion</b> {{technique}} used in immunology {{to determine the}} quantity or concentration of an antigen in a sample.|$|E
50|$|Two {{commonly}} known forms are Ouchterlony double <b>immunodiffusion</b> and radial <b>immunodiffusion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ouchterlony double <b>immunodiffusion</b> (also {{known as}} agar gel <b>immunodiffusion</b> or passive double <b>immunodiffusion)</b> is an {{immunological}} technique {{used in the}} detection, identification and quantification of antibodies and antigens, such as immunoglobulins and extractable nuclear antigens. The technique is named after Ã–rjan Ouchterlony, the Swedish physician who invented the test in 1948.|$|E

50|$|<b>Immunodiffusion</b> is a {{diagnostic}} test which involves diffusion through a substance such as agar.|$|E
50|$|<b>Immunodiffusion,</b> a {{modified}} direct complement-fixation test, and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} also have been used successfully to detect antibody for PPV.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{relies on}} agar gel <b>immunodiffusion,</b> ELISA and PCR. Post-mortem {{findings}} are characteristic and include widespread white tumours in most organs.|$|E
50|$|The Coggins test (agar <b>immunodiffusion)</b> is a {{sensitive}} diagnostic test for equine infectious anemia developed by Dr. Leroy Coggins in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Histology, virus isolation, {{electron}} microscopy, immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescent staining, <b>immunodiffusion,</b> complement fixation, {{virus neutralisation}} and ELISA {{can all be}} used to confirm diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|Presumptive diagnoses {{may be made}} {{based on}} the {{observation}} of clinical signs. They can be confirmed using virus isolation, complement fixation, ELISA, <b>immunodiffusion</b> or histopathology (following postmortem exam).|$|E

5000|$|Single radial <b>immunodiffusion</b> assay (SRID), {{also known}} as the Mancini method, is a protein assay that detects the amount of {{specific}} viral antigen by <b>immunodiffusion</b> in a semi-solid medium (e.g. agar). The medium contains antiserum specific to the antigen of interest and the antigen is placed {{in the center of the}} disc. As the antigen diffuses into the medium it creates a precipitate ring that grows until equilibrium is reached. Assay time can range from 10 hours to days depending on equilibration time of the antigen and antibody. The zone diameter from the ring is linearly related to the log of protein concentration and is compared to zone diameters for known protein standards for quantification. [...] There are kits and serums commercially available for this assay (e.g. The Binding Site Inc.).|$|E
50|$|The sera {{of birds}} {{infected}} with avian reovirus display circulating antibodies through the validation of ELISA, agar gel <b>immunodiffusion,</b> indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), and virus neutralization (VN). Virus neutralization identifies type-specific antibodies, {{which allows for}} differentiation between strains of viruses through their distinct antigens. The other four tests detect group antigens.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of aviadenovirus is by histopathology, {{electron}} microscopy, viral {{isolation and}} ELISA. In addition, virus antigen {{can be detected}} double <b>immunodiffusion.</b> Postmortem examination may reveal a variety of clinical signs relating directly to the organ affected. Specifically, Egg Drop Syndrome can be diagnosed by hemagglutinin inhibition and the virus causes haemagglutination in chickens and ducks.|$|E
50|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test is {{the diagnostic}} test of choice. ELISA is available commercially and can detect anti-hepatica antibodies in serum and milk; new tests intended for use on faecal samples are being developed. Using ELISA is more specific than using a Western blot or Arc2 <b>immunodiffusion.</b> Proteases secreted by F. hepatica have been used experimentally in immunizing antigens.|$|E
50|$|Precipitating IgG {{antibodies}} against fungal or avian antigens can {{be detected}} in the laboratory using the traditional Ouchterlony <b>immunodiffusion</b> method wherein 'precipitin' lines form on agar plate. The ImmunoCAP technology has replaced this time consuming, labor-intensive method with their automated CAP assays and FEIA (Fluorescence enzyme immunoassay) that can detect IgG antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus (Farmer's lung or for ABPA) or avian antigens (Bird Fancier's Lung).|$|E
50|$|Counterimmunoelectrophoresis is a {{laboratory}} technique {{used to evaluate}} the binding of an antibody to its antigen, it is similar to <b>immunodiffusion,</b> but with the addition of an applied electrical field across the diffusion medium, usually an agar or polyacrylamide gel. The effect is rapid migration of the antibody and antigen out of their respective wells towards one another to form a line of precipitation, or a precipitin line, indicating binding.|$|E
50|$|Petri {{dishes are}} also used for {{eukaryotic}} cell culture in a liquid medium or on solid agar. They are used in <b>immunodiffusion</b> studies when partially filled with agar or agarose gel. Empty Petri dishes {{may be used to}} observe plant germination, the behavior of very small animals or for other day-to-day laboratory practices such as drying fluids in an oven and carrying or storing samples. Their transparency and flat profile also mean they are commonly used as temporary receptacles for viewing samples, especially liquids, under a low-power microscope.|$|E
50|$|Another very {{important}} aspect that the IHP addresses {{is linked to}} the challenge of educating horse-owners and the general public on the realities related to equine infectious anemia, a disease that the association considers to be misunderstood and less dangerous than what is generally believed. To this end it started a scientific collaboration with the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Perugia. With the authorization of the competent veterinary AUSL (Local Health Agency) and according to Italian norms, the Italian Horse Protection Association is the only active isolation center in Italy that allows freedom of movement for horses who were found positive to the Coggins test (agar <b>immunodiffusion).</b>|$|E
50|$|Agarose is a {{preferred}} matrix for work with proteins and nucleic acids {{as it has}} {{a broad range of}} physical, chemical and thermal stability, and its lower degree of chemical complexity also makes it less likely to interact with biomolecules. Agarose is most commonly used as the medium for analytical scale electrophoretic separation in agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels made from purified agarose have a relatively large pore size, making them useful for separation of large molecules, such as proteins and protein complexes >200 kilodaltons, as well as DNA fragments >100 basepairs. Agarose is also used widely for a number of other applications, for example <b>immunodiffusion</b> and immunoelectrophoresis, as the agarose fibers functions as an anchor for immunocomplexes.|$|E
5000|$|CymMV {{causes a}} mosaic of irregularly shaped {{chlorotic}} and/or necrotic lesions to appear on infected hosts. Additionally, infected plants will show smaller yields. Sometimes the orchids may display chlorotic rings while others will display symptoms in lesions. Sunken patches can also be observed on leaves. Lastly, certain infected plants may be symptom-less but are still viral enough to infect other neighboring plants. This is because the chlorosis and necrosis can take time to show; however, the virus can still be present on a leaf that does not display such obvious symptoms of the disease. The virus is still able to be transmitted from the plant despite its [...] "healthy" [...] appearance. The virus can be detected with ELISA, <b>immunodiffusion</b> tests, or a nucleic acid hybridization assay.|$|E
50|$|Capripoxviruses infect {{primarily}} sheep, goat, and cattle, but {{strains of}} capripoxviruses {{are difficult to}} distinguish between. Capripoxvirus strains are often recognized by how the main target host responds. They cannot be distinguished using routine laboratory tests such as virus neutralisation test, immunofluorescence test or agar gel <b>immunodiffusion</b> test. They, however, can be isolated by using the HinDill restriction enzymes to separate their DNA. Comparisons of fragmented DNA sequences from different strains showed that all capripoxviruses have a very similar nucleotide sequence homology. Strains were also proven to not all be host-specific. All Capripoxvirus DNA are double-stranded with lengths of around 150 kbp. Strains from goatpox and sheeppox share at least 147 genes; LSDV have an extra 9 genes that are non-functional in GTPV and SPPV. Strains of GTPV, SPPV, and LSDV generally have genome identities similar by at least 96%.|$|E

5000|$|In humans, P. skrjabini infections {{can result}} {{in a wide variety of}} symptoms, {{rendering}} it difficult to diagnose and challenging to quickly enact proper treatment. [...] Diagnosis typically requires first a general recognition of the symptoms followed by laboratory and radiologic tests. [...] Radiology, for example, can pick up on P. skrjabini's migration to ectopic places like the brain. [...] Serological or immunological tests including intradermal test, <b>immunodiffusion,</b> indirect haemagglutination test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot also play a key role in not only diagnosing the overall presence of Paragonimus parasites in the body but also distinguishing the various different species invading. [...] The ELISA test detects the antibody used to combat the P. skrjabini infection. [...] Although cases of P. skrjabini infection can exhibit early symptoms such as abdominal pain, a lack of appetite, and high fever, it can also come on slowly and fail to exhibit identifiable symptoms for a period of latency between 20 days to as long as 3 months. [...] Later on in the infection, the type of symptoms that appear primarily depends on which organs the P. skrjabini parasites enter. [...] Infections and the resulting set of symptoms can be classified under five different types including the subcutaneous mass type, cerebral type, pericarditis type, abdominal type, and pleurisy type. [...] Infections of the pleurisy type, for instance, exhibit symptoms like chest pain and cough while the cerebral type tends to result in vomiting and headaches. [...] The pericarditis type is associated with shortness of breath and palpitation while the abdominal type infections lead to diarrhea and abdominal pain. [...] P. skrjabini has shown no effect on mammalian reproductive abilities. [...] Despite occasional cases resulting in death, P. skrjabini has not been widely known to cause morbidity and death. [...] Surgery may be occasionally necessary for patients with cerebal or pleural paragonimiasis.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} syncytium-induction {{inhibition test}} {{which is more}} sensitive than the <b>immunodiffusion</b> test, was developed using rabbit complement. In this test, fetal lamb kidney cells continuously infected with bovine leukemia virus were used as effector cells, and the CC 81 cat cells transformed with murine sarcoma virus, were used as indicator cells. The syncytium-induction inhibition effect of anti-bovine leukemia virus serum was enhanced significantly {{by the addition of}} rabbit complement. The syncytium-induction inhibition titers had a statistically significant correlation with the <b>immunodiffusion</b> titers and were four to 64 times higher than <b>immunodiffusion</b> titers. In 12 experimentally infected cattle, the syncytium-induction inhibition test detected the antibodies earlier than the <b>immunodiffusion</b> test and continuously detected them when <b>immunodiffusion</b> antibody changed to negative. In the 81 sera from naturally infected herds, 35 (43. 2 %) were positive by the <b>immunodiffusion</b> test and 55 (67. 9 %) by the syncytium-induction inhibition test...|$|E
40|$|Membrane and soluble {{fractions}} of one genital and two oral strains of Mycoplasma hominis were compared by <b>immunodiffusion</b> and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Differences were demonstrated between the membrane antigens {{of the three}} strains by <b>immunodiffusion,</b> and the membrane proteins also gave dissimilar patterns in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The soluble fractions gave identical lines in <b>immunodiffusion</b> tests and similar patterns in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Ten T-mycoplasma strains {{isolated}} from the urine of male students with nongonococcal urethritis were compared in <b>immunodiffusion,</b> indirect hemagglutination (IHA), metabolic inhibition (MI), and immunoelectrophoretic tests using antigens prepared from these isolates and specific rabbit antisera. <b>Immunodiffusion,</b> MI, and IHA tests revealed complex antigenic interrelationships among the T-mycoplasmas, whereas immunoelectrophoretic analysis failed to resolve antigenic differences with the antigens and antisera utilized. The isolates {{were found to be}} antigenically heterogeneous by <b>immunodiffusion,</b> MI, and IHA tests, but all were related; the degree of heterogeneity was more pronounced in the MI tests than in the <b>immunodiffusion</b> and IHA tests. The results of the MI tests in this study confirmed the degree of serological heterogeneity observed by others in MI studies of T-mycoplasmas. Highly variable combinations of titers in both the MI and IHA tests precluded serotypic grouping of the isolates. The sensitivity of the <b>immunodiffusion</b> and IHA techniques were not as great as that of the MI technique. Heterologous anti-medium antibodies were not detected in the rabbit antisera by <b>immunodiffusion</b> tests. This is the first reported study to date in which T-mycoplasmas have been compared by <b>immunodiffusion,</b> IHA, and immunoelectrophoresis techniques. The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>immunodiffusion,</b> MI, and IHA tests are useful in resolving antigenic differences of T-mycoplasmas; however, the usefulness of immunoelectrophoretic analysis for resolving antigenic differences of T-mycoplasmas is questionable...|$|E
