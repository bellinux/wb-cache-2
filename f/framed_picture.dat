In his personal life at this point, the album's arrival coincided with the failure of Starr's marriage, {{partly as a result}} of Harrison and Maureen conducting an affair.

500|$|Honey pays {{homage to}} some of Nagai's other creations, such as the Mazinger and Devilman series; the first two episodes alone include many cameos. [...] The first shows Mayor Light and Chokkei in a picture with {{characters}} from Nagai's Harenchi Gakuen, Iyahaya Nantomo, and Oira Sukeban, while Devilman titular character appears as a gargoyle. In the second, a scene in a downtown market in Cosplay City has cameos from Hige Godzilla from Harenchi Gakuen and Naojiro Abashiri from The Abashiri Family; a scene in Honey's bedroom shows a bust of Mazinger Z and a <b>framed</b> <b>picture</b> of her father, Dr. Kisaragi; and several scenes show Mazinger Z Sayaka Yumi, The Abashiri Family Kikunosuke, and an unnamed character from Kekkō Kamen as they get turned into plastic-coated statues. Cutie Honey's skin-tight, full-body costume uses the same design and tricolor (blue, black, and red) scheme as that of Nagai's original manga, but its chest opening—with rounded side edges—resembles the one in her 1973 anime attire. The opening sequence used {{in the first four}} episodes shows versions of Honey's original seven forms in the TV series: Kisaragi, Hurricane, Misty, Idol, Flash, Fancy, and Cutie. Danbei's techniques parody those of Nagai's super robots Mazinger Z and Grendizer. Later episodes feature appearances by Akira Fudo of Devilman and Professor Kabuto of Mazinger Z. In episode 7, Honey transforms herself into Kouji Kabuto. The title sequence of episodes 5 through 8 features Sirene, Devilman's nemesis, and Akira Fudo of Devilman along with Mazinger Z's Juzo Kabuto. Devilman can be briefly seen as one of the back-up guitarists for the one-time antagonist Saline in episode 3.|$|E

On March 29, 1865, his brigade participated in a major skirmish on the Quaker Road during Grant's final advance that would finish the war. Despite losses, another wound (in the left arm and chest that almost caused amputation), and nearly being captured, Chamberlain was successful and brevetted {{to the rank of}} major general by President Abraham Lincoln.

To all observers Union and Confederate, it appeared that he was shot through his chest. He continued to encourage his men to attack. All sides cheered his valiant courage, and the Union assault was successful.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014 Rey Escorpión went on hiatus from CMLL, {{which led}} to Dragón Rojo, Jr. turning to the tecnico side, ending Los Revolucionarios {{at that point in}} time. Rey Escorpión {{returned}} to CMLL in March 2015, followed by Dragón Rojo, Jr. returning to the Rudo side shortly afterwards. Dragón Rojo, Jr. explained that it was a ploy by Los Revolucionarios and that he only turned tecnico to fool the tecnico side. In late Último Guerrero started to team with Thunder on a regular basis, although he was never officially made a member of Los Guerreros. In April and May 2015 Thunder started to have problems with Guerrero and other members of his group, causing him to turn on them during a match on the June 5 CMLL Super Viernes show. The match started out with Thunder teaming up with Guerrero and Euforia to take on Los Revolucinarios, {{but by the end of}} the match Thunder switched sides as he attacked Guerrero and the four rudos beat down the remaining two Guerreros members. Thunder was subsequently introduced as the fourth member of Los Revolucionarios, who also referred to themselves as Los Chicos Malo ("The Bad Guys") during interviews. In his first outing as a Revolucionario the trio of Rey Escorpión, Thunder and Dragón Rojo, Jr. lost to Guerrero, Euforia and Gran Guerrero, not because they were pinned but because the trio was disqualified in both falls for excessive violence and unmasking of both Euforia and Gran Guerrero. During the Super Viernes show on June 19 a wrestling [...] "angle" [...] played out where Rey Escorpión grabbed a <b>framed</b> <b>picture</b> from a fan at ringside and smashed the frame and glass over Último Guerrero's head, causing a disqualification and leaving Guerrero on the canvas with the frame around his head as [...] Rey Escorpión gloated. Following the Glass attack event the idea that the two factions would face off in a multi-man Luchas de Apuestas match was suggested by CMLL itself and enforced by all eight making both hair and mask challenges at a CMLL press conference on June 24 Hours after the press conference CMLL held an official contract signing between Rey Escorpión and Último Guerrero for a Luchas de Apuestas match with both wrestlers putting their hair on the line, not including any of the six masked wrestlers involved in the storyline. At the following Friday night Super Viernes show Rey Escorpión and Los Revolucionarios once again had the upper hand, defeating Los Guerreros in two straight falls, the second fall occurring after a low blow on Último Guerrero that the referee did not see. On July 14, 2015 Rey Escorpión challenged Máximo for the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, where Guerrero walked to ringside during the third and deciding fall, distracting Rey Escorpión long enough for Máximo to gain the third and deciding pinfall to retain the championship.|$|E

60|$|These early {{schools were}} {{not of a}} very high order; the books used by younger {{scholars}} being what were called hornbooks, which were made by pasting upon a board {{a piece of paper}} containing the alphabet and some lessons in spelling, and covering the whole with a very thin sheet of horn, which was fastened on the board as glass is fastened over a <b>framed</b> <b>picture.</b> Thus the children could see the letters and words under the horn, but were not able to deface or tear the paper. It was difficult to get books in those days, and a hornbook would last a long time.|$|E
60|$|Musing thus, {{he reached}} the studio, and found {{the door open and}} the room empty. It had the air of a room whose owner has dashed in to fetch his golf-clubs and biffed off, after the casual fashion of the artist temperament, without bothering to close up behind him. And such, indeed, was the case. The studio had seen the last of J. B. Wheeler for that day: but Archie, not {{realising}} this and feeling that a chat with Mr. Wheeler, who was a light-hearted bird, was what he needed this morning, sat down to wait.

60|$|Even at the Aero Club, where scores {{knew him}} by sight, {{he was a}} nobody.

Any group would have welcomed him, but he did not seek them out. For the first time he really saw the interior decorations of the club. In the old days he had been much too busy talking with active comrades to gaze about. But now he stared for five minutes together at the stamped-leather wall-covering of the dining-room. He noted, much too carefully for a happy man, the trophies of the lounging-room. But at one corner he never glanced.

60|$|He {{passed through}} the open French windows and neither of them made any further attempt to detain him. Their silence was a little unnatural and from the walk outside he glanced for a moment behind him. The two men were sitting {{in exactly the same}} positions, their faces were turned towards him, and their eyes seemed to be {{following}} his movements. Yet there was a change. The professor was no longer the absorbed, mildly benevolent man of science. Mr. Bomford had lost his commonplace expression. There was a new thing in their faces, something eager, ominous. Burton felt a sudden depression as he turned away. He looked with relief at the thin circle of the moon, visible now through the waving elm trees {{at the bottom of the}} garden. He drew in with joy a long breath of the delicious perfume drawn by the night from the silent boughs of the cedar tree. Resolutely he hurried away from the sight of that ugly little <b>framed</b> <b>picture</b> upon which he had gazed through the open French windows--the two men on either side of the lamp, watching him.|$|E
60|$|Put out of humour {{perhaps by}} this gross impugnment of her sincerity, {{the head of}} the family kept her room on pretexts during a greater part of Euphemia's stay, so that the latter's angelic innocence was left all to her grandson's mercy. It {{suffered}} no worse mischance, however, than to be prompted to intenser communion with itself. Richard de Mauves was the hero of the young girl's romance made real, and so completely accordant with this creature of her imagination that she felt afraid of him almost as she would have been of a figure in a <b>framed</b> <b>picture</b> who should have stepped down from the wall. He was now thirty-three--young enough to suggest possibilities of ardent activity and old enough to have formed opinions that a simple woman might deem it an intellectual privilege to listen to. He was perhaps a trifle handsomer than Euphemia's rather grim Quixotic ideal, but a very few days reconciled her to his good looks as effectually they would have reconciled her to a characterised want of them. He was quiet, grave, eminently distinguished. He spoke little, but his remarks, without being sententious, had a nobleness of tone that caused them to re-echo in the young girl's ears {{at the end of the}} day. He paid her very little direct attention, but his chance words--when he only asked her if she objected to his cigarette--were accompanied by a smile of extraordinary kindness.|$|E
