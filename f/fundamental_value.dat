25|$|Social {{influence}} is an overarching term given {{to describe the}} persuasive effects people have on each other. It {{is seen as a}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>value</b> in social psychology and overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include: conformity, compliance, and obedience. Social {{influence is}} also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most principles of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.|$|E
25|$|Bubbles in {{financial}} markets {{have been studied}} not only through historical evidence, but also through experiments, mathematical and statistical works. Smith, Suchanek and Williams designed a set of experiments in which an asset that gave a dividend with expected value 24 cents {{at the end of}} each of 15 periods (and were subsequently worthless) was traded through a computer network. Classical economics would predict that the asset would start trading near $3.60 (15 times $0.24) and decline by 24 cents each period. They found instead that prices started well below this <b>fundamental</b> <b>value</b> and rose far above the expected return in dividends. The bubble subsequently crashed before the end of the experiment. This laboratory bubble has been repeated hundreds of times in many economics laboratories in the world, with similar results.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the puzzle}} has been {{resolved}} through mathematical modeling and additional experiments. In particular, starting in 1989, Gunduz Caginalp and collaborators modeled the trading with two concepts that are generally missing in classical economics and finance. First, they assumed that supply and demand of an asset depended not only on valuation, but on {{factors such as the}} price trend. Second, they assumed that the available cash and asset are finite (as they are in the laboratory). This is contrary to the “infinite arbitrage” that is generally assumed to exist, and to eliminate deviations from <b>fundamental</b> <b>value.</b> Utilizing these assumptions together with differential equations, they predicted the following: (a) The bubble would be larger if there was initial undervaluation. Initially, “value-based” traders would buy the undervalued asset creating an uptrend, which would then attract the “momentum” traders and a bubble would be created. (b) When the initial ratio of cash to asset value in a given experiment was increased, they predicted that the bubble would be larger.|$|E

Skolverket has during the past 20 years {{stressed}} the importance of <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> through their documents and guidelines. In the Lgy 11 curriculum for English for Swedish upper secondary school, poetry is for the first time listed as a core content. Therefore this essay asks the critical question: Does teaching of poetry in English 6 textbooks live up to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> specified by Skolverket? In this essay two textbooks in English 6 have been studied along with literature on the topic. The essay uses a modified model presented by Gunnel Colnerud that differentiates the term <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> to be able answer the research question. The result shows that the two textbooks include poetry that talks about the <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> according to all the categories suggested in the model.

Defeated in 1968 by the regime which {{took advantage of the}} opposition's social isolation, the opposition activists opted for an alliance with the Polish Catholic Church. The alliance ended the opposition's isolation and legitimated the movement in popular perception. However, the cost for the Left was a surrender of its <b>fundamental</b> <b>value</b> system (the mainstream opposition could thus no longer be considered leftist) and, in the long run, granting the Right the upper hand in the ability to mobilize mass political support. The opposition's alliance with the Church (before 1989 and after, when it became the ruling establishment) is also responsible, according to the cultural philosopher Andrzej Leder, for the marginalization of the Left and its social concept in the political spectrum of democratic Poland.|$|E

Sulla's victory in {{the first of a series}} of civil wars led to a new {{constitutional}} framework that undermined libertas (liberty), the <b>fundamental</b> <b>value</b> of the Roman Republic. Nonetheless, Sulla's reforms strengthened the position of the equestrian class, contributing to that class's growing political power. Cicero was both an Italian eques and a novus homo, but more importantly he was a Roman constitutionalist. His social class and loyalty to the Republic ensured that he would [...] "command the support and confidence of the people as well as the Italian middle classes". The optimates faction never truly accepted Cicero; and this undermined his efforts to reform the Republic while preserving the constitution. Nevertheless, he successfully ascended the cursus honorum, holding each magistracy at or near the youngest possible age: quaestor in 75 BC (age 31), aedile in 69 BC (age 37), and praetor in 66 BC (age 40), when he served as president of the [...] "Reclamation" [...] (or extortion) Court.

An interview with social studies teachers in secondary schools about {{their relationship to the}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> in the Swedish curriculum Lgy 11. This thesis aims to explore how teachers in social studies understand the <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> of the Swedish curriculum for the secondary school (Lgy 11). Although there are several previous studies of how Swedish teachers understand specific <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> there are few studies aimed to describe a overall understanding of the curriculums <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> based on the teachers perspective. The purpose of this thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part the aim is to identify the tension that can exist between different perspectives in the theoretical and practical research on education of values and sociocivic education. The thesis identifies five central fields of tension that is recurring in the research. In part two the aim is to examine how social studies teachers in secondary schools report that they interpreters and relate to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> of the Swedish public school. The fields I then use as a theoretical framework for understanding the teachers statements about their work with values. The result of the study suggests that the teachers are well based in the Swedish curriculums <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> but prioritise some values more than others. Witch values that are prioritised is very different between the examined schools. Since the Swedish National Agency of Education recently have been addressing that it is essential that the education for establishing values should be seen as a coherent mission and not be divided into parts or specific problem areas, I believe this work may be a relevant contribution. The result shows that some areas are more prioritised than others in the schools and some parts seem to be less prioritised. The first part provide a framework that can be a tool for understanding witch parts that is prioritised and witch are not...|$|R

To be able to do a thorough and legitimate examination, our assessment of the party program has been made in four phases. After the interpretation and analyze of the party program we found out that the Sweden Democrats has a complicated relation to democracy and that the party does not achieve the requirements for a democratic party, according to our chosen democratic values. The school system in Sweden is based on democratic foundations and <b>fundamental</b> <b>values</b> shall reign in our schools.
