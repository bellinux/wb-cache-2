Each <b>Data</b> <b>Island</b> Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E

The resulting increase in acetylene density dramatically lowers the nominal threshold acetylene coverage required for reaction. In addition, the threshold reaction temperature is reduced from 150 to < 100 K, and increased lateral interactions within the organic domains promote formation of tilted benzene. Co-adsorption of NO with benzene itself accelerates the desorption of both tilted and flat-lying benzene at low temperatures. These factors act to increase the yield of reactively formed benzene to 100 %, completely suppressing carbon deposition that would otherwise result from decomposition of reactant and product...|$|R

The solution consists of a transparent virtual repository that supports informational intelligence components. By using this approach we not only mask the differences in divergent data repositories but also provide a standard way to access enterprise-wide data. Security is provided through a twotier mechanism. The result is a single database that percolates and draws data residing in incoherent repositories alongside an intelligence layer. In real-time, there is a determination of the available data repositories.

40|$|A new {{technique}} for producing electron systems with quantum confinement in three dimensions, quantum dots, has been studied. These quantum dots are coherent islands spontaneously formed {{at the early}} stages of Ge/Si(100) epitaxy due to the misfit of the system. Our goal is to gain understanding and control of the growth process so uniform quantum dot ensembles can be created for possible use in optoelectronic devices. A UHV Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) growth system was built and calibrated to grow our samples. The samples were prepared by depositing Ge onto a Si(100) surface cleaned by flash desorption of the native oxides. Varying the growth rates from 0. 6 ML/min to 4. 0 ML/min, the substrate temperature from 450 °C to 600 °C, and the coverage from 3. 5 ML to 14 ML produces different sample morphologies. After growth, the samples were analyzed both in situ and ex situ. The in situ analysis consisted of Auger electron spectroscopy for elemental analysis and reflection high energy electron diffraction, for surface structure analysis. The ex situ analysis included atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and/or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Many digital images were obtained from the microscope analysis. A novel, computer based, analysis was developed to extract the islands parameters from the microscope images. This data, which includes island area and average height for each island on every image, was used for a statistical analysis. Also from the <b>data,</b> <b>island</b> size distributions (histograms of island size) were generated. These measurements confirm that islands form after growth of a 3 ML wetting layer and that islands evolve as they grow. As more Ge is deposited these islands grow and as they grow they evolve from huts, square based pyramids, to domes, truncated pyramids, to dislocated domes. Our results show that the substrate temperature, deposition rate, and amount of deposited material are factors that affect the growth evolution. Higher growth temperature affects the size at which islands evolve from one type of island to another, also introduces new strain release mechanisms such as alloying and trench formation that compete with dislocation formation. Finally a detailed morphological characterization of the observed islands was done. ...|$|E
