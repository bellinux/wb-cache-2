An analytical solution for axial force, restoring moment, and transverse moment is presented that covers the whole range from zero to full angular misalignment. Both low pressure seals with cavitating flow and high pressure seals with full fluid film are considered. Strong coupling is demonstrated between angular misalignment and transverse moment which leads the misalignment vector by 90 degrees. This transverse moment, which is entirely due to hydrodynamic effects, is a significant factor in the seal operating mechanism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the role of the modal content of surface defects on static <b>flat</b> <b>seal</b> efficiency. The {{configuration}} under consideration is an annular contact between two surfaces, one holding all the defects, the other being assumed flat and infinitely rigid. The analysis is carried out on synthetic "turned-like" surfaces generated by combinations of the first 50 vibrational eigen modes determined from modal discrete decomposition. The transmissivity of the contact, that fully characterizes the seal efficiency, is computed on the basis of a Reynolds model for incompressible flow. The dependence of the transmissivity upon the modal content of the surface defects is analyzed on a contact pressure range of common use employing a simplified deformation algorithm. Impact of the defects modal content is investigated statistically through a pair of experimental designs. It is shown that, i) the uncertainty on transmissivity, while considering a series of parts, can be drastically reduced if defect modes are well selected; ii) the transmissivity itself can be very significantly decreased when the defects modal content is conveniently controlled. While clearly indicating that the common surface roughness specification is generally not a relevant one to ensure a required seal performance, this work opens wide perspectives on the seal improvement by surface defects optimization only...|$|E

The <b>flat</b> <b>sealing</b> element is permanently fixed to the end plate adjacent to a first end face of same facing the fuel cell and extends toward the second end face of the end plate. At an end adjacent to the second end face, the <b>flat</b> <b>sealing</b> element is permanently loaded by a preload force in a direction from the end plate toward the sealing device. A prestressing device is provided for impacting with the preload force. The preloaded means of the prestressing device is variable. The prestressing device has a cylindrical preload element. The <b>flat</b> <b>sealing</b> element interacts in a sealing with a sealing ramp. The transverse seal of the sealing device of an active sealing surface is developed for contact with the <b>flat</b> <b>sealing</b> element. The longitudinal seal of the sealing device projects in the area of overlapping through the <b>flat</b> <b>sealing</b> element. The end plate has a material reduced region adjacent to the <b>flat</b> <b>sealing</b> element, in which the <b>flat</b> <b>sealing</b> element is immersible during pressing against the active sealing surface.

40|$|The reagent {{delivery}} mechanism in a point-of-care, HIV diagnostic, microfluidic device is studied. Reagents held in an aluminum pack are released {{on the opening}} of a fluidic seal. Fluidic seals, controlling the flow of reagents, are characterized to reduce anomalies in the desired flow pattern. The nature of the current seal was investigated. Four seal patterns - line hemisphere, line flat, chevron hemisphere and chevron flat were created and tested for reagent delivery using a flow sensor and a force gauge. Preliminary experiments suggested that one of the patterns - "line-flat" - resulted in fewer flow anomalies. A parameter scoping exercise involving sealing process parameters (temperature, time, gap and distance) was performed for the line <b>flat</b> <b>seal.</b> The findings of this research can be divided into three categories - 1) bonding phenomenon in current seals, 2) influence of seal pattern on flow and rupture mechanics and 3) process parameters which result in the least flow anomalies. The current seal is found to be a bond between the exposed aluminum on the lid film and the heat seal coating on the dome film. The two chevron patterns result in large amounts of flow anomalies, the line hemisphere pattern also resulted in some instances of flow anomalies. The line-flat pattern creates a seal with the least flow anomalies. A specific set of temperature, time, gap and distance which minimizes flow anomalies was found. The flow performance of the reservoir improved and delamination decreased as the distance of the seal from the reservoir was reduced. The thesis also develops a model to better understand the deformation of the reagent carrying dome and flow dynamics prior to and following the opening of the seal. The dome deformation model provides a framework for relating volume, delamination and flow rate to the geometry and material properties of the reservoir pack. by Tejas Satish Inamdar. Thesis (M.

Acoustic measurements were acquired for a small scale model, nominally 10 % scale, supersonic nozzle with baseline and suppressed configurations.

The modern design process dictates {{that it is necessary to}} generate a large number of variants of the proposed element to determine the best theoretical solution. However, the results of the processing, even a very large number of alternatives based on traditional approaches, cannot give to the designer an idea of the design possibilities. A complicating factor is the fact that the task of valve developing has conflicting requirements, so it is difficult to choose a justified compromise. The above given method allows to choose on the initial electromagnetic valve with metal on metal sealing design phase the parameters of the valve, which are depending on the characteristics of the working environment and the requirements of sealing. Findings. It is found that there is necessity of taking into consideration the effect of sealing surfaces sliding against each other when calculating the parameters of the valve. Originality/value.

40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} into the use of photocatalytic particles in a dual bed configuration, so as to effect the solar-driven decomposition of water to its constituent elements, particularly hydrogen. The system envisioned would consist of two modules, each consisting of a shallow, <b>flat,</b> <b>sealed</b> container, in which micron-sized photocatalytic particles are immobilized. An aqueous solution containing a redox mediator is pumped between the two chambers. Different photoparticles and catalysts are chosen for their respective modules so as to effect oxidative water-splitting in one vessel to evolve oxygen gas, and reductive water-splitting in the other to evolve hydrogen. This is a direct photoconversion scheme that breaks down the energetic requirement for water decomposition into a 2 -photon process, and enables separate production of hydrogen and oxygen. Titanium dioxide, TiO{sub 2 }, and indium phosphide, InP, were employed as photoparticles in the O{sub 2 }- and H{sub 2 }-evolving beds, respectively. Platinum catalysts were evaluated to prompt H{sub 2 }-evolution. Calculations on the energy band structure of free and immobilized particles provided guidance as to how the microstructure of the particles should be configured. A series of redox mediators, spanning a range of redox potentials, were tested. While many electron donors facilitated H{sub 2 }-evolution, only the most oxidizing ones enabled O{sub 2 }-evolution.
