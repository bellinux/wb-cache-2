40|$|Our {{research}} aims {{to support}} community health workers (CHWs) in low-resource settings by {{providing them with}} personalized information regarding their work. This information is delivered {{through a combination of}} voice- and web-based feedback that is derived from data already collected by CHWs. We describe the in situ participatory design approach used to create usable and appropriate feedback for low-literate CHWs and present usage data from a 12 -month study with 71 CHWs in India. We show how the system supported and motivated CHWs, and how they used both the web- and voice-based systems, and each of the visualizations, for different reasons. We also show that the comparative feedback provided by the system introduced elements of competition that discouraged some CHWs while motivating others. Taken together, our findings suggest that providing personalized voice- and web-based <b>feedback</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> an <b>effective</b> way to support and motivate CHWs in low-resource settings...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that scalp {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has a great potential for motor rehabilitation in stroke patients with severe hemiplegia. However, key elements in BCI architecture for functional recovery has yet to be clear. We in this study focused on the type of feedback to the patients, which is given contingently to their motor-related EEG in a BCI context. The efficacy of visual and somatosensory feedbacks was compared by a two-group study with the chronic stroke patients who are suffering with severe motor hemiplegia. All the patients were asked an attempt of finger opening in the affected side repeatedly, and the event-related desynchronization (ERD) in EEG of alpha and beta rhythms was monitored over bilateral parietal regions. Six patients were received a simple visual feedback in which the hand open/grasp picture on screen was animated at eye level, following significant ERD. Eight patients were received a somatosensory feedback in which the motor-driven orthosis was triggered to extend the paralyzed fingers from 90 to 50 degrees. All the participants received 1 -h BCI treatment with 12 - 20 training days. After the training period, while no changes in clinical scores and electromyographic (EMG) activity were observed in visual feedback group after training, voluntary EMG activity was newly observed in the affected finger extensors in 4 cases and the clinical score of upper limb function in the affected side was also improved in 5 participants in somatosensory feedback group. Although the present study was conducted with a limited number of patients, these results imply that BCI training with somatosensory <b>feedback</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> more <b>effective</b> for rehabilitation than with visual feedback. This pilot trial positively encouraged further clinical BCI research using a controlled design...|$|R

40|$|Practical {{cooperative}} diversity protocols often rely on low-cost radios that treat multiple in-band signals as {{noise and}} thus require strictly orthogonal transmissions. We analyze {{the performance of}} a class of opportunistic relaying protocols that employ simple packet level feedback and strictly orthogonal transmissions.

40|$|Intraspecific plant-soil {{feedback}} {{is a relationship}} in which plant affects {{the composition of the}} soil and such modified soil affects growth of the same plant species. This relationship and its intensity may be linked with plant dominance and invasiveness. Dominant species can alter the composition of the soil in their favor and thus show positive intraspecific plant-soil feedback. As the invasive species are commonly being dominant in their new environment, it can be expected that intraspecific positive plant-soil <b>feedback</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> an important factor allowing the invasive species to achieve their dominant position and become invasive. To test if the existence of positive intraspecific <b>feedback</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a general mechanism underlying plant invasiveness I compared intraspecific plant-soil feedback in a group of invasive and introduced, but non-invasive, plants in the Czech Republic. I did this using a preselected set of 34 species - 17 invasive and 17 non-invasive. For realization of the project I used the method of two-phase experiment. The first phase is called soil conditioning - influencing of soil by the plant. In the second phase the same plant species are planted in conditioned soil from the first phase and in control (unconditioned) soil. Then I compared plant biomass from conditioned and [...] ...|$|R
