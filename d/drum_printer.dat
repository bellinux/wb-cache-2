50|$|Sustained by {{the disk}} drive {{business}} and Informatics, Data Products began {{development of their}} first line printer. Introduced in 1963, the 3300 was a 300 line per minute <b>drum</b> <b>printer</b> that used a moving coil actuator for the print hammer.|$|E
50|$|Drum printers, where a {{horizontally}} mounted {{rotating drum}} carries the entire character {{set of the}} printer repeated in each printable character position. The IBM 1132 printer {{is an example of}} a <b>drum</b> <b>printer.</b> Drum printers are also found in adding machines and other numeric printers (POS), the dimensions are compact as only a dozen characters need to be supported.|$|E
50|$|Dataproducts was {{a typical}} vendor of <b>drum</b> <b>printers,</b> often selling similar models with both {{a full set of}} hammers (and delivering, for example 600 lines-per-minute of output) and a half set of hammers (delivering 300 LPM).|$|R
50|$|CPI's precursor, Holley Computer Products, {{was formed}} as {{a joint venture between}} Control Data Corporation (CDC) and the Holley Carburetor Company in April 1962. Holley {{developed}} and produced a series of <b>drum</b> <b>printers.</b> In June 1964, CDC bought out Holley and partnered with NCR and ICL to form CPI in Rochester.|$|R
5000|$|In {{all three}} designs, {{timing of the}} hammers (the {{so-called}} [...] "flight time") was critical, and was adjustable {{as part of the}} servicing of the <b>printer.</b> For <b>drum</b> <b>printers,</b> incorrect timing of the hammer resulted in printed lines that wandered vertically, albeit with characters correctly aligned horizontally in their columns. For train and bar printers, incorrect timing of the hammers resulted in characters shifting horizontally, albeit on vertically-level printed lines.|$|R
50|$|The EP-101 was {{the first}} ever {{electronic}} miniprinter for printing figures and symbols and was launched by Shinshu Seiki Co., a subsidiary of Suwa Seikosha Co., Ltd, in September 1968. The <b>drum</b> <b>printer</b> wasn't very big, being only 164 millimetres in width, 102 millimetres in height, 135 millimetres in depth and weighed 2.5 kilograms. It was created out of development work that Shinshu Seiki did for the Seiko Group when they became the official time-keepers for the 1964 Tokyo Olympic games and needed a machine that could print out times they gathered from their time-pieces.|$|E
5000|$|An early <b>drum</b> <b>printer</b> was the [...] "Potter Flying Typewriter", in 1952. [...] "Instead {{of working}} laboriously, one {{character}} at a time, it prints whole lines at once, 300 lines per minute, {{on a paper}} band. ... Heart of the machine is a continuously spinning disk with the necessary letters and numbers on its rim. ... As the disk revolves, 80 electrically operated hammers tap {{the back of the}} paper against an inked ribbon in contact with the disk, thus printing the proper characters in the proper places on the line." ...|$|E
50|$|California State University at Northridge had a dual 3170 that {{provided}} timesharing {{service to the}} California State University and College system. Many of the other campuses also had CDC 3150 machines for local batch operation. In 1970 CDC 3150s were installed at most campuses of the California State College system. San Jose State and LA State got CDC 3300s and served as regional data centers with (very flaky) data links to the other campuses. California State Polytechnic College (San Luis Obispo) and San Diego State University had IBM System/360s. The rest got 3150s. Typical configuration was 24K words of 24-bit core memory, four 7-track tape drives, <b>drum</b> <b>printer,</b> card reader, card punch, two 8MB disc drives (removable packs). At Humboldt State College where I worked this was used for both administrative and instructional purposes. It replaced an IBM 1620.|$|E
50|$|The tape {{transport}} {{was followed}} by the 405 Card Reader and the 415 Card Punch, followed by a series of tape drives and <b>drum</b> <b>printers,</b> all of which were designed in-house. The printer business was initially supported by Holley Carburetor in the Rochester, Michigan suburb outside of Detroit. They later formalized this by creating a jointly held company, Holley Computer Products. Holley later sold its stake back to CDC, the remainder becoming the Rochester Division.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} medium and {{high-speed}} <b>drum</b> <b>printers</b> could be supplied. Medium-speed printers printed at about 600 {{lines per minute}} using all available characters. The high-speed printers delivered 1080 lines per minute or 1000 lines per minute (depending on the model), printing all 64 characters per line with excellent print quality. A later model delivered up to 1150 lines per minute. When fitted with a drum having a 16-character set, the printing speed was 2,700 lines per minute.|$|R
50|$|As the {{technology}} matured, most large <b>printer</b> installations were <b>drum</b> <b>printers,</b> {{a type of}} impact printer which could print an entire line of text at once {{through the use of}} a high speed rotary printing drum. It was thought that in the event of a severe jam, the friction of paper against the drum could ignite either the paper itself, or, in a dirty machine, the accumulated paper and ink dust in the mechanism. Whether this ever happened is not known; there are no reports of friction-related printer fires.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} <b>drum</b> <b>printer</b> design, a fixed font {{character}} set is engraved onto {{the periphery of}} a number of print wheels, the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer could print. The wheels, joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed and paper and an inked ribbon is stepped (moved) past the print position. As the desired character for each column passes the print position, a hammer strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the continuous paper. Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers had to be very fast. Typically, they were driven by voice coils mounted on the moving part of the hammer.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1968 {{he hired}} Albert Eng to run {{development}} of the system Laura had sketched out, {{now known as the}} FM 390. The 390 consisted of two main parts, the reader/writer on top, and the store and retrieval system under it. Together they formed a single two-part cabinet {{about the size of a}} large <b>drum</b> <b>printer.</b> The [...] "Foto-Data Cards" [...] used to store data were standard A5 microfiche, but punched along one edge to allow them to be mechanically sorted. The Cards were packed into [...] "Foto-Data Cell"s, each containing 100 cards (IBM used similar terminology). Each 390 stored up to 250 Cells, for a combined total of [...] "1 to 3 billions bits of information". The only available reference suggests this was the storage capacity of a single Cell, but this seems unlikely. Several additional storage units could be added to the base FM 390 to increase total storage.|$|E
5000|$|The UNIVAC 1004 was a plug-board {{programmed}} {{punched card}} data processing system, introduced in 1962, by UNIVAC. Total memory was 961 characters (6 bits) of core memory. Peripherals were a card reader (400 cards/minute), a card punch (200 cards/minute) using proprietary 90-column, round-hole cards or IBM-compatible, 80-column cards, a <b>drum</b> <b>printer</b> (400 lines/minute) and a Uniservo tape drive. The 1004 was also supported as a remote card reader & printer via synchronous communication services. A U.S. Navy (Weapons Station, Concord) 1004 {{was dedicated to}} printing from tape {{as a means of}} offloading the task from their Solid State 80 mainframe, which produced the tapes. A plug-board program called Emulator was widely installed to convert 1004s to stored-program operation, reading in instructions from program decks of cards which determined the processing of the following data decks. Once installed, Emulator was rarely removed as it could run the machine as desired and, as almost every machine function was used, it was physically heavy from the sheer mass of installed jumpers filling nearly the entire board. Emulator was not a Univac product, rather it was built by each customer, a tedious task. Its heavy use of the 1004's program-branching reed relays, called selectors, caused increased failures, later solved by the use of electronic selectors in the follow-on 1005.|$|E
50|$|Jefferson Drum, {{portrayed by}} Jeff Richards, is a crusading {{newspaper}} editor in the Old West town of Jubilee. A widower, he rears his son, Joey, played by 10-year-old Eugene Mazzola, {{also known as}} Eugene Martin. <b>Drum's</b> <b>printer</b> is Lucius Coin, played by Cyril Delevanti. Big Ed, the town bartender, is portrayed by Robert J. Stevenson, later {{a member of the}} Los Angeles City Council. Hal J. Smith, later known for his role of the town drunk, Otis Campbell, on CBS's The Andy Griffith Show, was cast five times on Jefferson Drum as Hickey.|$|R
50|$|Code 11 is a barcode {{symbology}} {{developed by}} Allais while at Intermec in 1977.In 1977 Intermecâ€™s printing and reading technology limited {{the density of}} Code 39 to 9.4 characters per inch. For numeric applications, Codabar provided somewhat higher density (12 characters per inch). However, at the time, Intermec was contractually obligated to sell Codabar printers only to Monarch Marking Systems. Interleaved 2 of 5 was not a discrete symbology and thus could not be printed at a high enough density by our <b>drum</b> <b>printers.</b> It is used primarily in telecommunications. The symbol can encode any length string consisting of the digits 0-9 and the dash character (-).|$|R
50|$|Data storage was {{strictly}} serial on paper tape, {{and then later}} to magnetic tape: the use of data storage within readily accessible memory was not cost-effective.Significant developments took place in 1959 with IBM announcing the 1401 computer and in 1962 with ICT (International Computers & Tabulators) making delivery of the ICT 1301. Like all machines during this time the core processor together with the peripherals - magnetic tape decks, discs, <b>drums,</b> <b>printers</b> and card and paper tape input and output required considerable space in specially constructed air conditioned accommodation. Often parts of the punched card installation, in particular sorters, were retained to present the card input to the computer in a pre-sort form that reduced the processing time involved in sorting large amounts of data.|$|R
5000|$|Chain {{printers}} (also {{known as}} train printers) placed the type on moving bars (a horizontally-moving chain). As with the <b>drum</b> <b>printer,</b> as the correct character passed by each column, a hammer {{was fired from}} behind the paper. Compared to drum printers, chain printers had the advantage that the type chain could usually be changed by the operator. A further advantage was that vertical registration of characters in a line was much improved over drum printers, which needed extremely precise hammer timing to achieve a reasonably straight line of print. By selecting chains that had a smaller character set (for example, just numbers and a few punctuation marks), the printer could print much faster than if the chain contained the entire upper- and lower-case alphabet, numbers, and all special symbols. This was because, with many more instances of the numbers appearing in the chain, the time spent waiting for the correct character to [...] "pass by" [...] was greatly reduced. Common letters and symbols would appear more often on the chain, according to the frequency analysis of the likely input. It was also possible to play primitive tunes on these printers by timing the nonsense of the printout to the sequence on the chain, a rather primitive piano. IBM was probably the best-known chain printer manufacturer and the IBM 1403 {{is probably the most}} famous example of a chain printer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line printer}} is an impact printer that prints one entire line of text at a time. It is mostly {{associated}} with unit record {{equipment and the}} early days of digital computing, but the technology is still in use. Print speeds of 600 lines-per-minute (approximately 10 pages per minute) were achieved in the 1950s, later increasing to as much as 1200 lpm. Line printers print a complete line at a time and have speeds in the range of 150 to 2500 lines per minute. The different types of line <b>printers</b> are <b>drum</b> <b>printers</b> and chain printers. Other non-impact technologies have also been used, as thermal line printers were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, [...] and some inkjet and laser printers produce output a line or a page at a time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line printer}} ran at 600 lines per minute, using a {{continuously}} rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 solenoid-operated flat-faced print hammers comprised a print line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character {{arrived at the}} printing position, as indicated by timing marks {{on the end of}} the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyraton firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. <b>Drum</b> <b>printers,</b> when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically.|$|R

40|$|CHIP (Cornell Hypothetical Instructional Processor) is a {{computer}} system that was designed as an educational tool for teaching undergraduate courses in operating systems and machine architecture. This document constitutes the sole reference manual for the CHIP computer system. A simulator for this hypothetical system exists under the UNIX operating system. The CHIP architecture includes dynamic memory mapping suitable for implementing virtual memory, eight interrupt priority levels, memory-mapped input/output and two modes of processor operation. The central processor of CHIP {{is compatible with the}} PDP- 11 at the user-mode instruction level. Therefore, any non-privileged code written for the PDP- 11 can be executed on CHIP. Several new user and kernel-mode instructions have been added to CHIP for increased efficiency. The CHIP simulator also supports input/output devices such as terminals, <b>drums,</b> disks and <b>printers.</b> All interactions with CHIP take place through an operator's console being simulated on a terminal. Users can examine/alter memory locations, set breakpoints, detect the referencing of specified memory locations, start/stop execution, etc. through a console command language. Program global variables and functions can be referred to by symbolic name with the mapping to absolute addresses being performed automatically by the system. The software support environment for CHIP includes a C compiler, assembler and loader...|$|R
