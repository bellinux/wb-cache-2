50|$|Another {{source of}} error arises from {{electromagnetic}} interaction with {{the walls of the}} vacuum chamber. White argued that any wall interaction could only be the result of a well-formed resonance coupling between the device and wall, and that the high frequency used imply the chances of this would be highly dependent on the <b>device's</b> <b>geometry.</b> As components get warmer due to thermal expansion, the <b>device's</b> <b>geometry</b> changes, shifting the resonance of the cavity. In order to counter this effect and keep the system in optimal resonance conditions, White used a phase-locked loop system (PLL). Their analysis assumed that using a PLL ruled out significant electromagnetic interaction with the wall.|$|R

50|$|This {{technique}} {{suffered from}} several drawbacks, which made for non-optimized transistors. The {{first was the}} metal contact, which actually had very little contact to the CNT, since the nanotube just lay {{on top of it}} and the contact area was therefore very small. Also, due to the semiconducting nature of the CNT, a Schottky barrier forms at the metal-semiconductor interface, increasing the contact resistance. The second drawback was due to the back-gate <b>device</b> <b>geometry.</b> Its thickness made it difficult to switch the devices on and off using low voltages, and the fabrication process led to poor contact between the gate dielectric and CNT.|$|E

50|$|When a HEMT {{is built}} from AlGaN/GaN, higher power density and {{breakdown}} {{voltage can be}} achieved. Nitrides also have different crystal structure with lower symmetry, namely the wurtzite one, which has built-in electrical polarisation. Since this polarization differs between the GaN channel layer and AlGaN barrier layer, a sheet of uncompensated charge {{in the order of}} 0.01-0.03 C/m is formed. Due to the crystal orientation typical for epitaxial growth ("gallium-faced") and the <b>device</b> <b>geometry</b> favorable for fabrication (gate on top), this charge sheet is positive, causing the 2D electron gas to be formed even if there is no doping. Such a transistor is normally on, and will turn off only if the gate is negatively biased - thus this kind of HEMT is known as depletion HEMT, or dHEMT. By sufficient doping of the barrier with acceptors (e.g. Mg), the built-in charge can be compensated to restore the more customary eHEMT operation, however high-density p-doping of nitrides is technologically challenging due to dopant diffusion into the channel.|$|E
