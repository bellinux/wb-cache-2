5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had <b>forgotten</b> <b>about).</b> <b>The</b> new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E
500|$|Forgotten Realms is {{the name}} of a fantasy world setting, {{described}} as a world of strange lands, dangerous creatures, and mighty deities, where magic and supernatural phenomena are quite real. The premise is that, long ago, the Earth and the world of the Forgotten Realms were more closely connected. As time passed, the inhabitants of planet Earth have mostly <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> existence of that other world – hence the term Forgotten Realms. On the original Forgotten Realms logo, which was used until 2000, small runic letters read [...] "Herein lie the lost lands", an allusion to the connection between the two worlds.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Dave Alizadeth from Las Vegas outlasted a {{field of}} 109 {{participants}} {{to become the first}} [...] "Dealers World Poker Championship". While other Dealer Tournaments had a reputation for sloppy play, the first Dealer Championship was noted for the seriousness with which the players approached the game. In the end, however, the winner was not determined by the deal of the cards, but by a deal at the table. According to initial reports, the deal was only achieved because [...] "a World Series bracelet was not available for negotiation, the players decided to take their money and go home." [...] Other sources, however, indicate that the event was always intended to be a bracelet event. Either way, the official WSOP standings, credits Alizadeth with winning a WSOP bracelet at this event. By contrast the final three contestants at the 2003 Championship were doing Kamikaze shots. [...] "We were all having such a great time," [...] the winner David Lukaszewski said, [...] "sitting around playing poker that I think we may have <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prize money and the bracelet." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Billen {{argued that}} the episode used {{the link between the}} [...] "breaches of realism" [...] in ghost stories and the [...] "transgressions" [...] of comedy in order [...] "to make a serious {{statement}} about the supernatural". For him, the episode was a story about [...] "human memory's spasmodic grasp" [...] and Christine's [...] "friable mental condition". The fact that Christine has <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> death of her first boyfriend—that Christine has a [...] "memory like a sieve"—is, for Billen, [...] "inexplicable". The haunting element of the story, Billen suggests, is indicative of mental illness; specifically, Christine's early-onset Alzheimer's disease. That Christine is afflicted with the condition means that her life has become a [...] "nightmare version" [...] of blind man's buff. The motif of blindness—Christine's mental blindness juxtaposed with physical blindness—again emerges with the recurrence of [...] "Con te partirò", performed by Andrea Bocelli, who is blind. Billen conceded that his interpretation may be incorrect, and that the episode may have been a single [...] "dying dream". McDowall noted that, with Christine's growing unhappiness and increasingly dishevelled appearance as the episode progresses, {{it is easy to see}} the story as about a mental collapse.|$|E

The same executive also boasted that the Nigerian government had <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> extent of Shell's infiltration. Documents released in 2009 (but not used in the court case) reveal that Shell regularly made payments to the Nigerian military {{in order to prevent}} protests.|$|E

[...] New York novelist Jay McInerney observed, [...] "The mayor seems to have <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{presumption}} of innocence, but his statement probably reflects the attitude of his constituents pretty accurately. New York's a tough place. Deal with it." [...] Seven weeks later, when doubts about the accuser's credibility made it unlikely the case would be tried, Bloomberg reversed position, stating: [...] "I've always thought perp walks were outrageous...e vilify them for the benefit of theater, for the circus. You know they did it in Roman times, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 12, Coming Home {{was made}} {{available}} for streaming via the band's PureVolume account. The album was released on September 13, 19 and 25 in Japan, North America and the United Kingdom respectively. Following the album's release, the band announced a 34-date tour of North America stretching from Cincinnati to Boston. The band had initially planned to release either the title track [...] "Coming Home" [...] or [...] "On My Mind" [...] as the second single, however due to internal problems at Geffen Records, any further release plans were scrapped. Just after the album was released Jordan Schur, the labels president, lost his job. With no focus on the record in the immediate aftermath, Jordan Pundik recalls, [...] "Everything fell apart and Coming Home was just <b>forgotten</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> record didn't stand a chance." [...] Later the label would offer the band a new contract under a subsidiary label called Octone Records, however the band declined and parted ways with the label in early 2007. Despite this, the band continued to tour {{in support of the}} album, touring with Fall Out Boy in January 2007. From late June to late August, the band went on the 2007 edition of Warped Tour. The band joined Paramore on their tour of the UK in October.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 November 1958, {{over the}} {{opposition}} of the Emperor, Crown Prince Akihito announced his engagement to Shōda Michikio, which {{marked the first time}} that a member of the House of Yamato had married a commoner or had married for love. For the Japanese people, the idea that a member of the Imperial family would marry a commoner for love was revolutionary as such thing had never happened in Japan before, and the marriage proved very popular with the public. In February 1959, a public opinion showed 87% of the Japanese people approved of Akihito's choice of bride. The Shinto clergy disapproved of the wedding because Michikio was a Roman Catholic while traditionalists in general led by the Emperor himself were opposed to the idea of the Crown Prince marrying a commoner for love as this was out of line with Japanese tradition, but given the level of public support, there was nothing to be done to stop the wedding. Kishi saw the Imperial wedding as a chance to divert attention from the unpopular security treaty, and gave his approval to the engagement. As the nation was caught in Imperial wedding fever, the so-called [...] "Mitchii" [...] crave as Michikio became the most popular woman in Japan, the issue of the security treaty vanished and Kishi mistakenly assumed the matter was over. On 10 April 1959, before a TV audience of 15 million people, Crown Prince Akihito married Michiko while half-million people showed up to watch the wedding in person. After the wedding, the matter of the security treaty returned to the public mind while Kishi thought the public had <b>forgotten</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> treaty. At the same time, right-wing terrorism which had flourished in the 1930s returned to Japan. The prospect of the children of a commoner sitting one day on the Chrysanthemum Throne energized the far-right in Japan, and left-wing opponents of the revised security treaty were threatened and sometimes assassinated. The most gory killing of the terrorist campaign of 1958-61 occurred when Inejiro Asanuma, the leader of the Socialist Party was killed while giving a speech on live television by a right-wing fanatic who stabbed him to death with his samurai sword. Kishi does seem not to ordered the killings, but he fostered a climate of opinion when anyone who criticized his government was seen as a traitor, and the police proved remarkably ineffective at stopping the far-right in their campaign of intimation and assassination against critics of the Kishi government. In 1959, Kishi visited Buenos Aires, Argentina.|$|E
