500|$|In November 2015, {{when asked}} if the BitTorrent release had been a success, Yorke said: [...] "No, not exactly. But I wanted it to be an {{experiment}} ... I wanted to show that, in theory, today one could follow the entire chain of record production, from start to finish, on his own. But in practice it is very different. We cannot be burdened with all of the responsibilities of the record label. But I'm <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it, for having tried to." ...|$|E
500|$|Acknowledging the album's lack of {{commercial}} success, Dixon {{said she would}} always prefer to [...] "take a chance creatively" [...] than release what she perceived to be stultifying records. She commented: [...] "I knew the single 'Drummer Boy' was a risk. It {{was a very difficult}} record and so far removed from anything I'd done before. I get that... I take full responsibility for that, but I'm <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. I'd rather make a unique record like 'Drummer Boy' and have it fail than play it safe and release bland, generic music that doesn't excite me." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Shaw despaired of the British government's coercive {{policies}} towards Ireland, and joined his fellow-writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton in publicly condemning these actions. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 {{led to the}} partition of Ireland between north and south, a provision that dismayed Shaw. In 1922 civil war {{broke out in the}} south between its pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions, the former of whom had established the Irish Free State. Shaw visited Dublin in August, and met Michael Collins, then head of the Free State's Provisional Government. Shaw was much impressed by Collins, and was saddened when, three days later, the Irish leader was ambushed and killed by anti-treaty forces. In a letter to Collins's sister, Shaw wrote: [...] "I met Michael for the first and last time on Saturday last, and am very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I rejoice in his memory, and will not be so disloyal to it as to snivel over his valiant death". Shaw remained a British subject all his life, but took dual British-Irish nationality in 1934.|$|E

500|$|Lane {{was born}} near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on July 15, 1864, {{the first of}} four {{children}} of Christopher Lane and the former Caroline Burns. [...] Christopher Lane was a preacher who owned a farm outside Charlottetown; when his voice began to fail, he became a dentist. The elder Lane, disliking the island colony's cold climate, moved with his family to Napa, California in 1871, and to Oakland in 1876, where Franklin graduated from Oakland High School. [...] Franklin Lane was hired to work in the printing office of the Oakland Times, then worked as a reporter, and in 1884 campaigned for the Prohibition Party. From 1884 to 1886, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, though he did not graduate. [...] Lane later wrote, [...] "I put myself through college by working on vacation and after hours, and I am very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it." [...] He later received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of California, from New York University, Brown University, and the University of North Carolina. [...] After leaving college, he worked as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. In 1889, he was admitted to the California Bar, having attended Hastings Law School.|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] and she was so anxious about singing that she [...] "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone else is going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. And I never want to do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E

2500|$|On December 31, 2007, at age 77, Moore was {{released}} from prison on parole after serving 32 years of her life sentence. Ford had died from natural causes on December 26, 2006, one year and five days before her release. Moore has stated that she regrets the assassination attempt, saying she was [...] "blinded by her radical political views". Moore {{was released}} under a federal law that makes parole mandatory for inmates who have served at least 30 years of a life sentence and have maintained a satisfactory disciplinary record. When asked about her crime in an interview, Moore stated, [...] "I am very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not succeed. I know now that I was wrong to try." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that the punch was thrown {{by a member of}} Raekwon's entourage named Hanz. Hanz stated that he [...] "did not appreciate Budden speaking disrespectfully about Inspectah Deck and Method Man in interviews over the summer." [...] He further commented [...] "I punched him in the face because he was outta line. I look at him like, not the school yard bully, but the motherfucker that's always picking on a motherfucker that don't fuck with nobody. To say something about a nigga like Meth is crazy, Meth don't fuck with nobody. I'm not gonna sit here and say Rae made me do it, that was a spontaneous decision on my own.
