40|$|The {{tendency}} of wool to felt and shrink is mainly {{due to its}} scaly structure. The enzymatic treatment of textiles significantly improves some of their properties as well as increases their aesthetic values and comfort of use. The application of <b>enzymes</b> in the <b>wool</b> modification process was studied, and it was proven that the application of enzymes has an important influence on changes in the surface structure. However, although proteases are large molecules, their attack is not only limited to the scales, they penetrate inside the fibre causing unacceptable weight and strength loss. It is believed that if the proteases are chemically modified {{in order to increase}} their molecular weight, then they will act just {{on the surface of the}} fibres, thus providing wool with anti-shrinking behaviour. The free <b>enzyme</b> penetrated into <b>wool</b> fibre cortex while the modified enzyme, with a bigger size, was retained at the surface, in the cuticle layer. Modified proteases can be a promising alternative for wool bio-finishing processes at an industrial level, since it is an effective way of removing wool scales...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{different}} <b>enzymes</b> on <b>wool</b> top. Wool top was incubated with proteases SP 655, SP 656, SP 490 {{as well as with}} lipase SP 398. The changes in wool morphology that occurred {{as a result of the}} enzyme treatment were shown by means of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. On the basis of the morphological results protease SP 655 was chosen for further experiments to improve the wool properties like handle, dyeing, shrink resistance and whiteness. Wool cortex and cuticle are not significantly changed after treatment with protease SP 655 over a period of 1 h. This was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. By contrast, the densitogram of merino wool treated with protease SP 655 over a period of 6 h, showed no more peaks in the area of the low sulfur proteins with a molecular weight of 45 - 50 kD, but an increase of peak number in the area of the low molecular weight proteins. The handle of merino wool was improved by enzyme treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 % over a period of 1 h at 57 °C. Moreover 72 % of the testing persons found that the softness of crossbred wool increased after this enzyme treatment compared to the reference sample. The felting of merino wool top is not reduced by the enzyme treatment described above. The felting of crossbred wool, however, was significantly reduced after enzyme treatment in comparison to the reference fibres and untreated crossbred wool. The shrink resistance of merino wool is significantly improved only after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 %. A further decrease of felting was achieved by enzyme treatment in sodium borate/HCl-buffer. The felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/HCl-buffer is significantly lower in comparison to the felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/acetate-buffer. The felting results of merino wool after different treatment times showed that the felt density decreases with treatment time. Non-extracted wool felts significantly more compared to extracted <b>wool</b> top after <b>enzyme</b> treatment. The modification of merino wool fibres is very high after increasing the enzyme concentration and the treatment time. The modification of non-extracted <b>wool</b> top after <b>enzyme</b> treatment is distinctly smaller compared to wool top, which was extracted before. The degree of whiteness of <b>enzyme</b> treated <b>wool</b> top, such as merino and crossbred wool, is generally higher than that of the respective reference samples and of untreated <b>wool</b> top. After <b>enzyme</b> treatment, the whiteness of non-extracted wool top is significantly higher than the whiteness of extracted wool top. A higher protease SP 655 concentration on wool top does not cause a further improvement of the degree of whiteness. The tensile strength of merino and crossbred wool is not influenced by treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 owf in borate/acetate buffer. The tensile strength of merino wool decreases significantly after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 owf compared to untreated wool top. The results of a new test method developed for measuring the buckling force of fibre bundles showed that significant differences in the buckling force of wool bundles with varying fibre diameter can be measured. By contrast, the values obtained when using this test method on enzyme-treated wool samples varied widely. Dyeing tests with Lanasol Blue 8 G at 98 °C and 50 °C showed that the <b>enzyme</b> treated <b>wool</b> samples are darker stained in comparison to the reference samples. The dye uptake of the enzyme treated samples is higher and faster than that of the reference samples. Using the dyestuffs Acid Red 88 -II and Food Red 5 with a smaller molecular weight in comparison to Lanasol Blue 8 G no significant difference is found between the dye uptake of the <b>enzyme</b> treated <b>wool</b> fibres and the reference fibres...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Wool {{was treated}} with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) under {{alkaline}} conditions to remove the lipid layer from the fibre surface. A reduction in lipid content of 88 % could be achieved resulting in a very hydrophilic fibre. The efficiency of dyeing with reactive dyes was improved. When treated with proteolytic enzymes (protease) a loss of enzyme activity occurred due to residual CTAB on the fibre surface. Residual CTAB could {{be removed from the}} fibre using solvent or anionic surfactant in acid conditions ensuring <b>enzyme</b> activity. Hydrophilic <b>wool</b> could promote a more efficient proteolytic enzyme treatment process...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new enzymatic process {{direction}} is described for obtaining machine washable wool with acceptable quality. In general, application of protease <b>enzyme</b> technology in <b>wool</b> processing results in considerable loss of tensile strength by diffusion of the enzyme {{into the interior}} of wool fibers. To overcome this disadvantage enzymatic activity has been more targeted to the outer surface of the scales by improving the susceptibility of the outer surface scale protein for proteolytic degradation. This has been realized by a pretreatment of wool with hydrogen peroxide at alkaline pH {{in the presence of}} high concentrations of salt...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} missed biotechnological {{opportunities}} in the developmental countries. Wool quality improvement is one of them. This study is concerning with improving the wool quality using technical <b>enzymes.</b> White <b>wool</b> proves to be more susceptible to the enzymatic treatment than blackish brown wool. This proves that the enzymatic reaction is sensitive to the natural color differences between wool fibers. A simple enzymatic method {{has been used to}} improve the wool quality as well as to investigate the changes happened in the wool fibers. Geobacillus stearothermophilus has been used under mesophilic and static cultivation conditions using wool as the main carbon source. These conditions prove to be more suitable for maintaining the fiber structure, less expensive, and reliable as an in-house biotechnological process that can be adapted everywhere. The enzyme activity in case of white wool was 4 [*]Units/ml and for blackish brown wool was 1. 5 [*]Units/ml. Electron microscope has been used to evaluate the end result. By following the process included in this paper using probable microbial strain(s), the wool quality improvement can be applied globally and can add another value to the economy of the developmental countries...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} considerable {{interest in the}} use of enzymes to achieve a variety of finishing effects on wool, but it is apparent that the extent of fibre degradation by enzymes is of major concern during their commercial application. Proteolytic enzymes are known to penetrate and degrade the internal wool structure during processing, causing fibre damage, rather than limiting the degradation to the cuticle cells. The ability to be able to control the exact location of proteolytic attack on wool protein structures will lead to the successful development of enzymatic treatments for achieving a variety of finishing effects for wool-containing products. This present work describes the modification of proteases so that enzymatic modification of wool fibres is restricted to the cuticle scales of the fibres. Bulk trials have demonstrated that novel modifications of the enzyme enable the reaction of the <b>enzyme</b> with <b>wool</b> to be controlled, so that less degradation of the wool occurs than in similar treatments with the native protease. An anti-felting effect has been achieved without any significant weight loss being caused by the modified protease during the treatment. This novel enzymatic process leads to environmentally friendly production of machine washable wool...|$|R
40|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of coarse wool and mohair is their harshness, making them unacceptable to the consumer. The {{best way to}} improve the softness of coarse fibres is by a chemical treatment. In this regard, a variety of options are available and the current study focused {{on the effect of}} enzymes, either alone or in combination with an oxidative (chlorine) treatment, on the softness and other properties of the fibres. It was found that an enzyme treatment reduced the feltability of wool. Furthermore, the scale height of the fibres was reduced by an enzyme treatment and this together with a decrease in the hardness of the fibres, improved the handle of the <b>enzyme</b> treated <b>wool</b> and mohair. The enzyme treatment also resulted in whiter fibres and did not cause any real damage to the wool and mohair. Better results were obtained, in general, if the enzyme treatment was applied to wool that was chlorinated first. The wool and mohair industries are facing many challenges, amongst other, competition from other fibres, diminishing consumption, environmental pressures, etc. Innovative methods and processes should continuously be developed to produce products which will improve the competitiveness of the industry especially as far as the usage of the coarser component of the respective clips i...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of immobilized and native Esperase, a commercial serine protease, was studied by incubating the enzymes in four formulations containing {{the same amount}} of anionic and non-ionic surfactants. The results show that the activity of the immobilized enzyme is not affected by the presence of detergents while the native enzyme lost 50 % of activity after 20 min of incubation in these four formulations. The washing performance of the detergents prepared with the immobilized Esperase was studied on cotton and wool fabric samples stained with human blood and egg yolk, using as control the detergent containing native Esperase. The best stain removal for cotton samples stained with human blood was achieved using the detergent with immobilized Esperase. Several physical tests confirmed that wool keratin was not degraded by the immobilized Esperase, validating the ability to use formulated detergents containing this immobilized <b>enzyme</b> for safe <b>wool</b> domestic washing...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{diffusion}} of serine proteases into wool fabrics and yarns was studied. The proteases used were free subtilisin and subtilisin-PEG (the same enzyme that was covalently cross linked to polyethylene glycol). It is shown that the adsorption and diffusion is facilitated by the pre-treatment performed, being the alkaline surfactant washing and bleaching the most effective in what concerns enzyme adsorption. Furthermore, {{this study suggests that}} {{the diffusion of}} proteases into wool is dependent {{on the size of the}} protease. The free <b>enzyme</b> penetrates into <b>wool</b> fibre cortex while the modified bigger enzyme is retained only at the surface, in the cuticle layer. Also, proteins without proteolytic activity do not adsorb considerably on wool due to its hydrophobic nature, therefore the diffusion is facilitated by hydrolytic action. These results have important practical implications for the establishment of enzymatic wool finishing processes, since they allow for control of the enzyme hydrolysis, which was the major drawback of this environmental friendly option to the conventional chlorine treatments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Twenty Naieni breed {{replacement}} ewe lambs {{were used}} to determine the substitution effects of treated wheat straw with exogenous fiber-degrading enzymes for alfalfa hay on wool characteristics. Five treatment diets were included: 1) control (100 % alfalfa hay without wheat straw), 2) 10 % enzyme treated wheat straw replaced for alfalfa hay, 3) 20 % enzyme treated wheat straw replaced for alfalfa hay, 4) 30 % enzyme treated wheat straw replaced for alfalfa hay and 5) 30 % untreated wheat straw replaced for alfalfa hay. Final fleece weight, and fleece weight index; wool production per day, feed conversion to wool; final staple length, wool and hair crimp per centimeter of length, percent of heterotype, coronal, kemp, reticulate and imbricate fibers and accumulation of scales in 100 µm fiber lengths were not affected by replacing treated wheat straw for alfalfa hay, but feeding untreated wheat straw tended to decrease final fleece weight, wool production, and final staple length. Replacing 20 %, and 30 % treated, and 30 % untreated wheat straw for alfalfa hay numerically increased mean final diameter of fiber. The results of this experiment indicated that treated wheat straw with exogenous fiber-degrading enzymes can be replaced for alfalfa hay in Naieni replacement ewe lamb diets.

40|$|Enzyme {{technology}} is explored on wool fibers to prevent shrinkage and consolidation behavior during washing of woolen bed coverings using normal household machine conditions. <b>Enzyme</b> modification of <b>wool</b> fibers after two different pretreatments has been realized on industrial scale. Enlarged proteolytic enzyme by chemical modification was applied successfully to prevent substantial fiber strength loss. Felt-ball {{analysis of the}} fibers as obtained from this industrial process showed substantial improvement in felting resistance. Further processing of these enzyme-modified fibers and finally integration in bed covering quilts have been executed successfully on industrial production lines. The observed fiber losses during processing were {{in the range of}} 4. 5 - 6 % which is comparable with that of nonmodified fibers. The machine-washability of these produced bed covering quilts was tested in a household washing machine using both wool and normal wash programs applied at different temperatures. It appeared that, contrary to the good washing results in terms of shrinkage and consolidation resistance using the wool program at moderate temperatures, this resistance is marginal when washed with the normal washing program with higher mechanical agitation level or with the wool program at elevated temperature. This result was different from that obtained with woolen fabrics and explained by the less-structured organisation of fibers within a fleece. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA...|$|R
40|$|By {{use of the}} {{commercial}} protease, the wool fabric has been treated enzymatically. The modified form of the Michaelis-Menten equation has been used and the maximal velocity and the half-saturation constant, V. and k'm, were calculated. The effects {{of different types of}} surfactants (cationic 'CAS', non-ionic 'NNS', anionic 'ANS', amphoteric 'AMS') on the rate of enzymatic reaction were studied. By considering Lineweaver-Burk plot, K"m and V',, values are: 0. 37, 2; 0. 07, 5. 15; 0. 10, 5. 98; 0. 10, 2. 89; pmoltmin for CAS, NNS, ANS, AMS surfactants, respectively. In the absence of surfactant (WOS), the K', and V ". values are. 0. 059 and 4. 52 pmollmin, respectively. The results obtained showed that the amount of released amino acid (raa) in presence of either ANS or NNS surfactant were higher than that {{in the absence of the}} named surfactants. In presence of CAS or AMS surfactants, the amount of raa, was decreased. With the use of surfactants results obtained from scanning electron microscopy on the treated fabrics and also from determination of one of the measurable physical properties (tensile strength), indicate that there is a good correlation between amount of raa and loss of the tensile strength of fabric. The measured kinetic parameters (K [...] and V',O) were also changed accordingly. AMS showed to act more properly on the uniformity of the wool substrate as compared with that of the other tested surfactants. Moreover, as the catalytic specificity, the ratio of V',,,aIK',a, was determined. Key Words: <b>wool</b> <b>enzyme,</b> surfactant, Lineweaver-Burk plot, specificit...|$|R
40|$|E is an {{alkaline}} {{serine protease}} secreted by the Gram positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and {{widely used in}} industry as a biocatalyst for various processes. The most common application of subtilisins is in laundry detergents. However, due to environmental concerns, the application of subtilisins to treat wool, is un-der study. There are some reports regarding the attempts to substitute the con-ventional chlorine treatment by an enzymatic process capable of providing the same characteristics to the fabric, like anti-shrinking and better uptake and fixa-tion of the dyestuff. However, the degree of uncontrolled hydrolysis due to diffu-sion of the <b>enzyme</b> inside the <b>wool</b> fiber causes unacceptable losses of strength. To overcome this fact, and {{taking advantage of the}} x-ray crystallographic struc-ture, the authors have modified subtilisin E genetically, increasing its molecular weight, to restrict the hydrolysis {{to the surface of the}} wool fibers. Therefore, three genetically modified enzymes with a molecular weight 2 -fold to 4 -fold higher than the native subtilisin E were produced and assessed for activity. The prokar-yotic expression systems, pET 25 b (+), pET 11 b and pBADC, were explored for the production of recombinant enzymes. The results demonstrated that regardless the expression system or strain used, chimeric subtilisins were not expressed with the correct folding. No active and soluble recombinant protein was recovered under the testing conditions. Despite this drawback, a novel approach was described to increase the molecular weight of subtilisin. The reported results are noteworthy and can indicate good guidelines for future work aiming at the solubilization of recombinant chimeric subtilisins...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} the {{industry}} related development of an enzymatic finishing treatment based on the finishing processes of a medium-seized textile plant (Tuchwerk Westmark, Mönchengladbach (TW)). Moreover the wool modifying potential of enzyme preparations from newly isolated hyperthermophilic micro organisms provided by the TU Hamburg-Harburg (TU-HH) were to be investigated. Of the three enzyme preparations from the TU-HH only the culture supernatants of Fervidobacterium gondwanense and Thermoanaerobacter keratinophilus are generally able to modify wool. However due to the low activity the industrial use of the culture supernatant of F. gondwanense in reasonable treatment time and dosage is not sensible. The enzyme fraction of the culture supernatant of T. keratinophilus showed a higher activity towards wool. Nonetheless the incubation didn’t result in positive effects {{on the degree of}} whiteness or the dye ability of wool top. The available portion of enzyme only allowed a limited amount of experiments. Therefore a concluding evaluation of a potential use of the enzyme preparation of T. keratinophilus in the textile technical process was not possible. Investigations in laboratory scale with the commercial available thermo stable and alkali-resistant serine protease Esperase 8. 0 L (Novo Nordisk) showed that the treatment parameters of the pre washing step to the dyeing of wool fabrics at TW are suitable for the integration of Esperase 8. 0 L. The hard well water used at TW and the added water softener showed no impact on the <b>enzyme</b> catalysed <b>wool</b> modification. The auxiliaries used have synergistic effects on the influence of the enzyme with regard to the degree of whiteness and the dye ability. After the completed pre washing the Esperase 8. 0 L does not show an activity, it is consequently irreversible heat-denatured. The denaturation is necessary to rule out uncontrolled enzyme catalysed reactions in the following finishing steps or at the end consumer (e. g. while washing). The treatment that was carried out successfully in laboratory scale was up-scaled to the semi industrial scale. In the 40 l winch beck at TW several wool- and blended fabrics were treated with Esperase 8. 0 L and afterwards dyed in competition with blind treated reference fabric. Additionally the impact of the enzyme treatment was compared with the effects of a traditional chlorination with Basolan DC exemplary on one fabric that was also available in chlorinated form. The semi-industrial treatment with Esperase 8. 0 L did not influence or enhance the degree of whiteness respectively, whereas the chlorination caused a yellowing of the fabric. The dyeability of the enzyme treated samples at 100 °C and the printability with an Ink Jet are comparable with that of chlorinated fabric. Due to the different kind of modification of the <b>wool</b> the <b>enzyme</b> treatment but not the chlorination implies the possibility of a low temperature dyeing. This is especially interesting for the industry because of ecological and economic reasons. The felting tendency of the enzyme treated fabrics was significantly reduced but for strongly felting fabrics an anti-felting treatment can not be reached. The fabric that was used to compare the chlorination to the enzyme treatment showed only a slight felting tendency (each ~ 3 % in broadness and length) that was reduced by the chlorination as well as the enzyme treatment to the same extent. Therefore the impact of the enzyme treatment with Esperase 8. 0 L on the felting behaviour of this kind of wool fabric is regarded as comparable to that of the chlorination. In the last part of this work the mode of action of the proteases used was investigated and checked if they are able to catalyse not only the hydrolysis of the “non-keratinous” parts of wool but also the hydrolysis of the KIF and KAP. Esperase 8. 0 L catalyses at the begin of the reaction the hydrolysis of the endocuticle and the soluble proteins of the ZMK entering via the ZMK the cortex and accumulate within the nucleus remnants. Moreover also the degradation of a low amount of the HGT proteins is catalysed. The mode of action of the serine protease from T. keratinophilus is comparable to this of the Esperase 8. 0 L. The KIF as well as the HS proteins of the matrix are not accessible for these enzymes and for the serine protease from F. gondwanense...|$|R
