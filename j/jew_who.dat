5|$|Having {{rejected}} paganism as a {{young man}} due to its perceived moral corruption, he travelled in Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine and Egypt. Clement's journeys were primarily a religious undertaking. In Greece, he encountered an Ionian theologian, who has been identified as Athenagoras of Athens; while in the east, he was taught by an Assyrian, sometimes identified with Tatian, and a <b>Jew,</b> <b>who</b> was possibly Theophilus of Caesarea.|$|E

5|$|My {{object in}} the present work is to paint the rich Jew in his true colors, as the enemy of society; {{to show that the}} <b>Jew</b> <b>who</b> steals millions, can, in Europe, at any rate, defy the laws with impunity, and that he almost {{invariably}} escapes punishment owing to improper occult influences, and the mighty power of Israelitish gold.|$|E

5000|$|The Hanukkah {{bush is a}} bone of {{contention}} between those <b>Jews</b> <b>who</b> see it, especially in its [...] "menorah look-alike" [...] manifestations, as a distinctly Jewish plant badge; and those <b>Jews</b> <b>who</b> regard it as an assimilationist variation of a Christmas tree — especially when it is indistinguishable from the latter.

Services were held in Hebrew and Yiddish, men and women sat separately, and men covered their heads, as mandated by the constitution.|$|E
5|$|While {{the term}} Holocaust {{generally}} {{refers to the}} systematic mass murder of the Jewish people in Nazi-occupied Europe, the Nazis also murdered {{a large number of}} non-Jewish people who were considered subhuman (Untermenschen) or undesirable.

5|$|Tiberius Julius Alexander was {{probably}} born {{early in the}} reign of the Emperor Tiberius (1437). His father was Alexander, an Alexandrian <b>Jew</b> <b>who</b> held the office of Alabarch; the exact meaning of this term is debated, but it may have denoted a senior customs official. The older Alexander enjoyed Roman citizenship, a rare privilege among the Jews of Alexandria, and therefore passed it to his sons. He also had business connections both with Agrippa, grandson of Herod the Great, and with Antonia, mother of the emperor Claudius. Another prominent member of Tiberius Alexander's family was his uncle, the philosopher Philo.|$|E
5|$|Weizmann's {{political}} efforts {{picked up}} speed, and on 10December 1914 {{he met with}} Herbert Samuel, a British Cabinet member and a secular <b>Jew</b> <b>who</b> had studied Zionism; Samuel believed Weizmann's demands were too modest. Two days later, Weizmann met Balfour again, {{for the first time}} since their initial meeting in 1905; Balfour had been out of government ever since his electoral defeat in 1906, but remained a senior member of the Conservative Party in their role as Official Opposition.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{merchant}} community, {{which played}} a significant role in the commercial development of then Bombay (now Mumbai), consisted of Jews from Iraq, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries who immigrated in the late 18th century under the threat of persecution. They found the environment conducive to continuing their trade and settled in the city, becoming prosperous in business ventures such as textile mills and international trading. In 1784, the British government took over the East India Company. With this change, many business opportunities emerged in India, and Bombay in particular, encouraging immigrants to set up businesses. In 1790, one such business magnate was Shalom ben Ovadiah HaCohen, a Baghdadi <b>Jew</b> <b>who</b> had migrated from Aleppo (Halab), in Syria to Bombay; other Jewish businessmen from Baghdad, Basra, and Yemen followed him.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>Jews</b> <b>who</b> {{served in the}} American {{military}} during World War I was disproportionate to their representation in the American population at large.

5|$|In 2005, Eisenberg {{appeared}} in Cursed, a horror film directed by Wes Craven, and The Squid and the Whale, a well-reviewed independent drama starring Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels. In 2007, he starred opposite Richard Gere and Terrence Howard in The Hunting Party, a comic thriller {{in which he}} plays an American journalist reporting from Bosnia. In 2009, Eisenberg played the lead role Adventureland, a comedy directed by Greg Mottola and filmed in Kennywood Park, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Filming wrapped in October 2007, and the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009. In November 2007, Eisenberg was cast in the indie comic-drama Holy Rollers alongside his sister, Hallie Eisenberg, who played his fictional sister in the film. He played a young Hasidic <b>Jew</b> <b>who</b> becomes involved in the ecstasy smuggling trade, using his religion as a disguise to deal without suspicion. Filming took place in New York in 2008. During the late 2000s, he also had roles in the independent films Solitary Man, playing college student Daniel, and Camp Hell, a horror film directed by George Van Buskirk.|$|E
5|$|In October 1866, Sopron {{sold the}} {{establishment}} to the Government of the Vilayet of Bosnia. It was renamed Vilajetska pečatnja, or the Vilayet Printing House, and from March 1867 onwards it bore the name Vilajetska štamparija (the same meaning). Sopron remained {{the owner and}} editor of Bosanski vjestnik, and managed to publish 51 issues. After a year in Sarajevo, Sopron left the city and returned to Zemun. The first director of the printing house was Haim Davičo, a Belgrade <b>Jew,</b> <b>who</b> was offered that position by Osman Pasha. Mehmed Šakir Kurtćehajić, the editor of Bosna since early 1868, began publishing Sarajevski cvjetnik {{at the end of}} that year. It was a bilingual weekly like Bosna, containing commentaries on current politics and articles on various social issues, most of which was written by Kurtćehajić. He fiercely defended the Ottoman regime in Bosnia, polemicising with newspapers from Serbia and Austria which criticised it. In May 1869, when Osman Pasha ceased to be the governor of the Vilayet of Bosnia, Davičo returned to Belgrade. The new governor installed Kurtćehajić as the director of the printing house. Kurtćehajić died of tuberculosis in September 1872; the last issue of Sarajevski cvjetnik had appeared two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian <b>Jew</b> <b>who</b> previously starred in the 1932 documentary film Igloo. Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on Igloo was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E

25|$|As Judaism {{considers}} suicide to {{be a form}} of murder, a <b>Jew</b> <b>who</b> {{commits suicide}} is denied some important after-death privileges: No eulogies should be given for the deceased, and burial in the main section of the Jewish cemetery is normally not allowed.|$|E
