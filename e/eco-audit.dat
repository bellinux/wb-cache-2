40|$|The {{internal}} environmental audit, {{which has}} only been used for company's purposes, has developed into the external <b>eco-audit.</b> According to an EC Regulation commercial enterprises may participate voluntarily in external eco-audits since April 1, 1995. An external <b>eco-audit</b> is an external environmental audit, a tool {{which is used to}} examine the enterprise with respect to environmentally compatible behaviour and processing. By help of energy and material flow analysis, e. g., sources and sinks of harmful substances may be detected and eliminated. The aim of this EC Regulation is not only to obey the governmental restrictions, but much rather to realize a continuous improvement of environmental protection by regular participation in external audits. Inside the enterprise an Eco-Management-System (EMS) has to be installed as part of the global management system. Its task is to push through and control the environmental policy inside the enterprise...|$|E

40|$|Austria {{has long}} been urged to make wider use of market-based {{instruments}} by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Despite this and the significant increase in domestic demands in recent years, the uptake of 'new' environmental policy instruments (NEPIs), namely market-based instruments (such as eco-taxes and tradable permits), voluntary agreements and informational devices (such as eco-labels and <b>eco-audits)</b> has been only moderate. Austria has used some eco-taxes but has refrained from adopting an ecological tax reform. Tradable permits have arrived on the domestic political agenda {{primarily because of the}} European Union's efforts to make use of this type of NEPI. Voluntary agreements have been used only very sparingly despite a consensual domestic policy style. Overall, NEPIs have mainly supplemented traditional regulatory instruments and subsides which continue to dominate Austrian environmental policy. Austria is struggling to leave behind a strongly regulatory past. The Austrian policy structures and style as well as its formidable past environmental record have retarded NEPI innovation...|$|R
40|$|Demands for wider use of 'new' {{environmental}} policy instruments (NEPIs), namely market-based instruments (such as eco-taxes and tradable permits), voluntary agreements and informational devices (such as eco-labels and <b>eco-audits)</b> have increased significantly in Germany in recent years. Germany {{has also been}} urged to make wider use of market-based instruments by external actors (such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Bank). However, the uptake of 'new' policy instruments in Germany has remained uneven despite considerable NEPI innovation. German {{environmental policy}} has shown a high uptake of VAs and eco-labels. However, it has made only moderate use of eco-taxes although they have increased significantly {{with the introduction of}} the ecological tax reform in 1999. Tradable permits have not yet been tested on the national level although some states (Länder) set up pilot projects to gain practical experience ahead of the EU's tradable permit scheme. Overall, NEPIs have been used mainly to supplement traditional regulatory instruments which still dominate German environmental policy. Germany's transformation from a 'high regulatory' state (which makes wide use of traditional regulation and VAs) towards an ecological market economy (which relies primarily on market-based instruments) has therefore been a slow one...|$|R
40|$|Motorsport {{students}} are sometimes seen {{as people who}} want to get maximum performance with little regard to the effect their passion has on sustainability and the environment. A core module delivered in the final year of a three year undergraduate motorsport course is “Advanced Engineering Materials and Applications”. This module is also an option on the final year of a manufacturing and production engineering degree that is studied by mainly part time students employed by local industry. An assignment in the 2012 / 2013 academic year required the cohort to consider sustainable solutions for car body panels. This paper discusses and evaluates the submissions of the motorsport students in terms of sustainability outcomes and compares these with the submissions of mainly part time students on the manufacturing and production degree. Students made extensive use of CES EduPack in their work. They were able to use the software to explore sustainability using appropriate materials indices and some used a synthesizer tool to model their own novel materials. Both groups of students were able to justify their materials selection and confirm these by carrying out simple <b>eco-audits.</b> The manufacturing and production students though showed much more awareness of issues around the processes of actually making the panels and their environmental impact. The work shows that different groups engineering students can become aware of sustainability but that their previous background and study can influence their holistic thinking abilities. It is pleasing to note that one of the motorsport students went to work for a renowned motor manufacturer in a job role with specific responsibilities for making interior fittings more sustainable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{variations in}} ¢rm-level adoption of {{environmental management systems}} (EMS) ^ ISO 14001 and the European Union’s <b>Eco-Audit</b> and Management Scheme (EMAS) ^ in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. Drawing on insights from club theory, institutional theory, and stakeholder theory, it argues that {{despite the fact that}} these EMS are created by supranationalorganizations (one regionaland one international), ¢rms’ perceptions of their costs and bene¢ts are largely determined by domestic factors. In particular, these perceptions are shaped by how EMS are promoted and information about them is disseminated in each country (supply aspects) and how the constellation of stakeholders (suppliers, environmentalgroups, regulators, generalpublic) support their introduction (demand aspects). The paper concludes that there are numerous ways governments and interested stakeholders can encourage companies to adopt voluntary environmental codes. The key is to ¢nd the right mix of incentives for speci¢c nationalcontexts...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{awareness}} {{in the general}} community is at a high level. There {{is a feeling that}} time is running out in the quest for global solutions to global problems. It is inevitable that the role in this of commerce and industry should be discussed, and that companies are coming under pressure to demonstrate that their policies are environmentally sustainable. Thirteen reasons are substantiated as to why companies are becoming involved, and non joiners or half-hearted joiners need to weigh up the risks they are taking. They may become outliers and corporate pariahs, and find that abuse of the environment is equated with abuse of the public and customer, and that both market share and share valuation will suffer accordingly. With a new British Standard on Environmental Management Systems, with a cross-link to the European <b>eco-audit</b> scheme, and the growth of green advertising, the environment is at long last receiving the attention it deserves. ...|$|E
40|$|Polluting firms {{must have}} the willingness, opportunity, and {{capacity}} or capability to undertake technological changes to improve their environmental performance. These changes could involve the adoption (diffusion) of already-proven technologies, or require incremental to radical innovation. This paper addresses the likely effects on technological change {{of a variety of}} so-called "voluntary approaches" to environmental problems including eco-labeling; eco-audits; pollution reporting requirements; the negotiation of emission, effluent, waste and technology-based standards for compliance; innovation waivers; negotiation of the means and timetable for coming into compliance; and the inclusion of pollution prevention/cleaner production in enforcement agreements. The capability to change depends on both the inherent innovativeness of the firm and available economic resources. The outcomes of various strategies will necessarily differ, depending on whether they create incentives which encourage firms (1) to investigate here-to-fore unrecognized environmental problems and to act on information the firm already has (as a result of being required to report emissions, effluents, and waste; by seeking to earn a product eco-label; by undertaking <b>eco-audits,</b> or by negotiating the means and timetable for coming into compliance), (2) to search for information outside the firm regarding already-existing solutions, thus encouraging the diffusion of technology from other firms or industries (as a result of performing technology options analysis), or (3) to undertake incremental technological innovation, or more radical innovation if they can (as a result of applying for innovation waivers, negotiating compliance levels or technology-based standards with regulatory agencies, or negotiating pollution prevention/cleaner production agreements with regulatory authorities). It is important to think about what kind of technological change is needed to address an environmental problem and who is {{in the best position to}} deliver it. Sometimes it must be acknowledged that the firms creating the problems are not capable of providing the needed or best solutions, and a new entrant must displace the polluting firm or technology...|$|R
40|$|Since 13 July 1993 the EC <b>eco-audit</b> {{regulation}} has regulated {{voluntary participation}} of enterprises in eco-auditing. As. {{yet it is}} a vague plan for environmental management systems and eco-auditing of enterprises, which in practice, {{when it comes to}} implementing it, may be interpreted in many different ways. The European Council's aim of promoting a steady improvement of environmental standards in enterprises with the help of this regulation can only be achieved in part. It is to be feared that instead of the desired problem-oriented analysis of weaknesses, an objective-oriented approach to secure a document certifying participation will prevail {{on the part of the}} enterprises. The inadequate description of the nature of the auditing may result in a watering down of the requirements. Such a development in terms of the implementation could tarnish the public image of this tool designed for environmental protection and lead people to consider it a swiz. To prevent this from happening the further elaboration of the regulation should continue to be a dynamic Iearning process, taking into account future practical experience. Moreover, eco-audits must not be regarded as substitutes for necessary tools of a market economy in the sphere of environmental policy. [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{live in an}} era of {{continuous}} change. In the branch of engineering, beyond the usual and pressing objectives of functionality, safety and integrity, computers are now used pervasively, new economic pressures and concern for the environment are looming, and the availability of energy resources and proper functioning of materials supply chains are ever more important. Students need an education that allows them to understand and deal with these changes, in a time when {{growth in the number of}} students, expectations and pressure on teaching resources is a challenge for professors, particularly for younger academics. Engineers create things out of materials. What do engineering students need to know to select and use materials that perform as expected, are safe, economically efficient and have the least environmental impact? This question leads to the introduction of the design approach. Knowledge, data and tools are necessary for students to make decisions that meet complex design requirements. This means that science is introduced in a way that facilitates understanding how to meet design requirements and select materials and processes. This paper also introduces briefly some of the new aspects of the 2012 CES EduPack. This tool developed by Granta Design, supports professors and helps students of both introductory and advanced courses in branches such as engineering, design and science in the study of materials. CES EduPack is used in more than 850 universities and institutes around the world and is continually evolving to offer a new version each January. Changes and new features are focused on two pathways, one active (eg development of Eco Selector and <b>Eco-audit</b> tool) and another in response to feedback from users. The latter has made the software more intuitive and easy to use. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
