5|$|Lighting {{also served}} Gaudí for the {{organisation}} of space, which required a careful {{study of the}} gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the <b>gradation</b> of colour used in the atrium of the Casa Batlló to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.|$|E
5|$|The {{aspect of}} the {{colouring}} which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the <b>gradation</b> through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, {{there is no such}} gentle <b>gradation.</b> The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle <b>gradation</b> of tone.

5|$|Tolkien based Quenya {{pronunciation}} more on Latin than on Finnish. Thus, Quenya {{lacks the}} vowel harmony and consonant <b>gradation</b> present in Finnish, and accent {{is not always}} on the first syllable of a word. Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels ö, ä and y are lacking in Quenya, but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or {{the development of the}} syllables ti > si in both languages. The combination of a Latin basis with Finnish phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles Italian in many respects, which was Tolkien's favourite modern Romance language.|$|E

The original hairpin banksia, this plant is coastal in Queensland, seen in such places as Walshs Pyramid (near Cairns), Byfield National Park and the Blackdown Tableland, then again in New South Wales south of the Hawkesbury River, just north of Sydney, down the New South Wales South Coast and into Victoria. Northwards of the Hawkesbury River on Sydney's northern outskirts there is a <b>gradation</b> between this and B.spinulosa var.collina. It commonly has black, maroon or claret styles on gold spikes but all-gold inflorescences are seen, and leaves are generally narrower than other varieties at 1–2mm in width and have several serrations toward the apex only.|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a <b>gradation</b> from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} {{that began with the}} {{accession}} of the Emperor Nerva and ended with the death of the Emperor Commodus, the Empire continued to weaken. It was becoming difficult to recruit enough soldiers for the army, inflation was becoming an issue, and on at least one occasion, the Empire almost went bankrupt. The most significant constitutional development during this era was the steady drift towards monarchy. M. Cocceius Nerva succeeded Domitian, and although his reign was too short for any major constitutional reforms, he did reverse some of his predecessor's abuses. He was succeeded by Trajan in 98, who then went further than even Nerva had in restoring the image of a free republic, by, for example, allowing the senate to regain some independent legislative abilities. Hadrian succeeded Trajan as Emperor. By far, his most important constitutional alteration was his creation of a bureaucratic apparatus, which included a fixed <b>gradation</b> of clearly defined offices, and a corresponding order of promotion. Hadrian was succeed by Antonius Pius, who made no real changes to the constitution. Antonius Pius was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius in 161. The most significant constitutional development that occurred during the reign of Marcus Aurelius was the revival of the republican principle of collegiality, as he made his brother, L. Aelius, his co-emperor. In 169, Aelius died, and in 176, Marcus Aurelius made his son, L. Aurelius Commodus, his new co-emperor. In 180, Marcus Aurelius died, and Commodus became Emperor. Commodus' tyranny revived the worst memories of the later Julian emperors, as he was more explicit than any of his predecessors in taking powers that he did not legally have, and in disregarding the constitution. He was killed in 192.|$|E

40|$|Although {{extensively}} used as {{core material}} in dams {{in many parts}} of the world, internal instability and suffusion potential of glacial till is still a relatively unexplored field. Statistically, dams with cores of glacial till have higher frequency of internal erosion incidents than dams with other types of core soils. Such potential overrepresentation may stem back to the erodibility of the glacial till itself. One mechanism that may be influential is suffusion due to internal instability. The literature offers several methods to evaluate a soils vulnerability to this mechanism, however, in terms of glacial till soils; the validity of assessment criteria is unclear. An offset in applicability may, at best, provide too conservative guidance, but at worst, it may be misleading, confusing or erroneous. Thus, the applicability of available state-of-the-art criteria for internal instability of glacial till soils is investigated in this paper. Using <b>gradations</b> from: laboratory tests performed by the author at Luleå University of Technology; <b>gradations</b> from experimental suffusion tests in the literature; and <b>gradations</b> from existing dams, a total of 36 glacial till <b>gradations</b> are evaluated. The study indicates that the approach by Kenney-Lau and its Li-Fannin adaptation provide predictions relatively more accurate in identifying glacial till <b>gradations</b> with unstable performance due to suffusion.
