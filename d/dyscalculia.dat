Though Chakravarty was puzzled by Ishaan's trouble in simple arithmetic—a trait of <b>dyscalculia</b> rather than dyslexia—he reasoned {{it was meant to}} [...] "enhance the image of [...] helplessness and disability". Labeling Ishaan an example of [...] "dyslexic savant syndrome", he especially praised the growth of Ishaan's artistic talents after receiving help and support from Nikumbh, and deemed it the [...] "most important (and joyous) neurocognitive phenomenon" [...] of the film. This improvement highlights cosmetic neurology, a [...] "major and therapeutically important issue" [...] in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.|$|E
50|$|Dyslexia and <b>dyscalculia</b> are two {{learning}} disorders {{with different}} cognitive profiles. Dyslexia and <b>dyscalculia</b> have separable cognitive profiles, namely a phonological {{deficit in the}} case of dyslexia and a deficient number module {{in the case of}} <b>dyscalculia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dyscalculia</b> {{can occur}} in people from across the whole IQ range - often higher than average - along with {{difficulties}} with time, measurement, and spatial reasoning. Estimates of the prevalence of <b>dyscalculia</b> range between 3 and 6% of the population. In 2004, {{it was reported that}} a quarter of children with <b>dyscalculia</b> had ADHD.In 2015, it was established that 11% of children with <b>dyscalculia</b> also have ADHD. [...] <b>Dyscalculia</b> has also been associated with people who have Turner syndrome and people who have spina bifida.|$|E
50|$|Neuroimaging {{studies of}} {{mathematical}} learning disabilities are still rare but <b>dyscalculia</b> {{is an area}} of increasing interest for neuroscience researchers. Since different neural mechanisms contribute to different elements of mathematical performance, it may be that children with <b>dyscalculia</b> show variable patterns of abnormality at the brain level. For example, many children with <b>dyscalculia</b> also have dyslexia, and those that do may show different activation of the verbal networks that support maths, while those who have <b>dyscalculia</b> only, may show impairments of the parietal number sense system. Indeed, the few studies carried out on children with <b>dyscalculia</b> only point to a brain level impairment of the number sense system.|$|E
5000|$|This {{suggestion}} that <b>dyscalculia</b> {{is caused by}} a deficits in a core deficit in number sense is analogous to the theory that dyslexia is due to a core deficit in phonological processing. Despite these similarities in terms of the scientific progress, public awareness of <b>dyscalculia</b> is much lower than it is for dyslexia. The UK's Chief Scientific Advisor, John Beddington, notes that, [...] "developmental <b>dyscalculia</b> is currently the poor relation of dyslexia, with a much lower public profile. But the consequences of <b>dyscalculia</b> are at least as severe as those for dyslexia." ...|$|E
50|$|Research on subtypes of <b>dyscalculia</b> {{has begun}} without consensus; {{preliminary}} {{research has focused}} on comorbid learning disorders as subtyping candidates. The most common comorbidity in individuals with <b>dyscalculia</b> is dyslexia. Most studies done with comorbid samples versus dyscalculic-only samples have shown different mechanisms at work and additive effects of comorbidity, indicating that such subtyping may not be helpful in diagnosing <b>dyscalculia.</b> But there is variability in results at present.|$|E
5000|$|In some instances, such as Turner syndrome, {{the onset}} of <b>dyscalculia</b> is genetic. Morphological studies have {{revealed}} abnormal lengths and depths of the right intraparietal sulcus in individuals suffering from Turner syndrome. [...] Brain imaging in children exhibiting symptoms of <b>dyscalculia</b> show less gray matter or less activation in the intraparietal regions stimulated normally during mathematical tasks. [...] Additionally, impaired ANS acuity {{has been shown to}} differentiate children with <b>dyscalculia</b> from their normally-developing peers with low maths achievement.|$|E
50|$|A {{consensus}} has not {{yet been}} reached on appropriate diagnostic criteria for <b>dyscalculia.</b> Mathematics is a specific domain that is complex (i.e. includes many different processes, such as arithmetic, algebra, word problems, geometry, etc.) and cumulative (i.e. the processes build on each other such that mastery of an advanced skill requires mastery of many basic skills). Thus <b>dyscalculia</b> can be diagnosed using different criteria, and frequently is; this variety in diagnostic criteria leads to variability in identified samples, and thus variability in research findings regarding <b>dyscalculia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term <b>dyscalculia</b> {{dates back}} to at least 1949.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dyscalculia</b> {{is thought}} to be present in 3-6% of the general population, but {{estimates}} by country and sample vary somewhat. Many studies have found prevalence rates by gender to be equivalent. Those that find gender difference in prevalence rates often find <b>dyscalculia</b> higher in females, but some few studies have found prevalence rates higher in males.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{appearance of}} <b>dyscalculia</b> is typically a {{deficit in the}} ability to know, from a brief glance and without counting, how many objects there are in a small group (see subitizing). Human adults can subitize 3 or 4 objects. However, children with <b>dyscalculia</b> can subitize fewer objects and even when correct take longer to identify the number than their age-matched peers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{syndrome}} {{known as}} <b>dyscalculia</b> {{is seen in}} individuals who have unexpected difficulty understanding numbers and arithmetic despite adequate education and social environments. [...] This syndrome can manifest in several different ways from the inability to assign a quantity to Arabic numerals to difficulty with times tables. <b>Dyscalculia</b> can result in children falling significantly behind in school, regardless of having normal intelligence levels.|$|E
50|$|More importantly, several {{behavioral}} {{studies have}} found that children with developmental <b>dyscalculia</b> show an attenuated distance/ratio effect than typically developing children. Moreover, neuroimaging studies have also provided additional insights even when behavioral difference in distance/ratio effect might not be clearly evident. For example, Price and colleagues found that children with developmental <b>dyscalculia</b> showed no differential distance effect on reaction time relative to typically developing children, but they did show a greater effect of distance on response accuracy. In addition, they also found that the right intraparietal sulcus in children with developmental <b>dyscalculia</b> was not modulated to the same extent in response to non-symbolic numerical processing as in typically developing children. With the robust implication of the intraparietal sulcus in magnitude representation, it is possible that children with developmental <b>dyscalculia</b> have a weak magnitude representation in the parietal region. Yet, it does not rule out an impaired ability to access and manipulate numerical quantities from their symbolic representations (e.g., Arabic digits).|$|E

5000|$|Working memory: Studies {{have found}} that {{children}} with <b>dyscalculia</b> showed impaired performance on working memory tasks compared to neurotypical children. [...] Furthermore, {{research has shown that}} children with <b>dyscalculia</b> have weaker activation of the intraparietal sulcus during visuospatial working memory tasks. [...] Brain activity in this region during such tasks has been linked to overall arithmetic performance, indicating that numerical and working memory functions may converge in the intraparietal sulcus. However, working memory problems are confounded with domain-general learning difficulties, thus these deficits may not be specific to <b>dyscalculia</b> but rather may reflect a greater learning deficit. Dysfunction in prefrontal regions may also lead to deficits in working memory and other executive function, accounting for comorbidity with ADHD.|$|E

50|$|Such {{evidence}} {{is beginning to}} contribute to a theoretical debate between researchers who believe that <b>dyscalculia</b> is caused by a brain level deficit of the number sense and those who believe that the disorder stems from a problem in using numerical symbols to access the number sense information.
