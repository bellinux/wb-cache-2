5|$|Airport {{officials}} estimate that around a third of airline tickets purchased by area residents are for travel from other airports. Competition includes Piedmont Triad International Airport near Greensboro, North Carolina, as an alternate and others <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> which have service from Southwest Airlines or international flights. However, aviation industry consultant Michael Boyd compared Roanoke's level of air service favorably to similarly sized cities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (panning) {{of the cameras}} to achieve good quality. The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, {{limiting the number of}} data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E
50|$|Before 1979 Nacional Route 1 {{was placed}} <b>farther</b> <b>aways</b> from the Río de la Plata, {{as seen in}} the green line.

50|$|Dominance {{interactions}} amongst {{females were}} not overly aggressive. The wasps {{with the highest}} status {{would be the first}} to receive food upon the forager's return.

5|$|The {{high rate}} of test animal {{survival}} was {{due in part to}} the nature of single-pulse radiation. As with the two Los Alamos criticality accidents involving the earlier demon core, victims who were close enough to receive a lethal dose died, while those <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> recovered and survived. Also, all the mice were placed outside the expected lethal zone in order to study possible mutations in future generations.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E
5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from the nucleus. As such this electron {{would be less}} attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to}} the poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E

50|$|In 1842, erosion {{threatened}} the lighthouse and Winslow Lewis was again called in. He {{was given a}} contract to move the tower to a safer location. Lewis's contractors dismantled and removed the lantern and illuminating apparatus, then tore down the original 1829-1831 brick tower. Another site was selected <b>farther</b> inland, <b>away</b> from the water, and a new tower was constructed, then the original lantern and illuminating apparatus were reinstalled.|$|R
50|$|If a radio {{receives}} a packet transmitted from a radio that {{is closer to}} the destination, the <b>farther</b> radio throws <b>away</b> that packet, and never retransmits it. It also updates its list of packet progress.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1950s, plans for a Tulsa freeway system {{included}} a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south (<b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from the urban core), while still having low right-of-way costs, comparable to more southerly corridors. This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had {{plans to build a}} toll-free facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of SH-117.|$|E
5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking <b>farther</b> <b>away.</b> Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{date was}} also loosely {{tied to the}} long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which {{predicted}} a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could {{have no effect on}} Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from it.|$|E
25|$|With {{the commercialization}} of the neighborhood, elite {{residents}} moved <b>farther</b> uptown, <b>away</b> from Madison Square, enabling more restaurants, theatres and clubs to open up in the neighborhood, creating an entertainment district, albeit an upscale one where society balls and banquets were held in restaurants such as Delmonico's. Nearby, huge dry-goods emporia such as Siegel-Cooper in the Ladies' Mile district brought daytime crowds of shoppers. No longer primarily residential, Madison Square was still a thriving area.|$|R

5000|$|Lindley's Lick Creek settlement, {{four miles}} east of the later town of Paoli along the road to Chambersburg, was one of the {{earliest}} white settlements in southern Indiana. Many of the free black settlers who moved north with him settled <b>farther</b> back <b>away</b> from the Chambersburg Road, in a remote part of what became the Hoosier National Forest. This settlement is also often referred to as [...] "Lick Creek" [...] or [...] "Little Africa" [...] and was abandoned by the early 20th century.|$|R
5|$|The {{excavated}} area of {{the mound}} was demarcated into two zones {{on the basis of}} occupation and elevation. Northern sector of the mound is nearer to the sea coast while the southern sector is <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from the coast. The ceramic find of crockery and cooking vessels found in the northern sector were indicative of mass feeding of sailors and traders who camped there. Wine stored in amphorae was the principal item imported from the western countries during the later part of the 2nd century BCE.|$|E
5|$|This crater {{was named}} after Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Anglo-Irish {{explorer}} of Antarctica from 1901 {{until his death in}} 1922. The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994. Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker, Haworth, de Gerlache, Sverdrup, Slater, and Faustini. Somewhat <b>farther</b> <b>away,</b> on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side, are the larger craters Amundsen and Scott, named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent.|$|E
5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from Earth.|$|E
50|$|Fort Miami, {{originally}} called Fort St. Philippe or Fort des Miamis, was a French palisade fort {{built in}} 1715 at Kekionga, a large Miami Indian village founded where the St. Joseph River and St. Marys River merge {{to form the}} Maumee River in northeastern Indiana, near the Ohio border. The Miami refused to abandon their village and move <b>farther</b> West, <b>away</b> from British traders, so Governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil authorized Jean Baptiste Bissot to build a strong fort to protect the trade routes of New France.|$|R
2500|$|Big Sur {{typically}} {{enjoys a}} mild climate year-round, with a sunny, dry summer and fall, and a cool, wet winter. [...] Coastal temperatures {{range from the}} 50s at night to the 70s by day (Fahrenheit) from June through October, and in the 40s to 60s from November through May. [...] <b>Farther</b> inland, <b>away</b> from the ocean's moderating influence, temperatures are much more variable. The weather varies widely due {{to the influence of}} the jagged topography, creating many microclimates. This {{is one of the few}} places on Earth where redwoods grow in close proximity to cacti.|$|R

5|$|All four Galilean moons {{are bright}} {{enough that they}} could be sighted from Earth without a telescope, if they were <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily visible with even low-powered binoculars.) They have {{apparent}} magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.|$|E
5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> than the moon.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are mainly}} {{polygynous}} with polyandrous queens, however, polyandry in jack jumper colonies {{is low in}} comparison to other Myrmecia ants, but it is comparable to M. pyriformis ants. In 1979, Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack jumper ant colonies, and although queens are unrelated {{to each other as}} mentioned previously, the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible. During colony foundation, there are suggestions of dependent colony foundation in jack jumper queens, although independent colony foundations can occur, as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns have been recorded, specifically where nests that tend to be closer to each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests <b>farther</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
25|$|Submarine {{landslides}} are turbidity {{currents and}} consist of water saturated sediments flowing downslope.

Minutes later, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, farther and <b>farther</b> downslope, <b>away</b> from the epicenter. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that a 60-mile-per-hour (100km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600km) down the continental slope from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed.|$|R

50|$|As these raids {{became more}} and more frequent, the native Yakans retreated farther and <b>farther</b> inland, <b>away</b> from the coasts which were {{periodically}} harried by Datu Bantilan's Tausug warriors and slave-raiders. The biggest and most advanced Yakan coastal settlement was located on the northeastern shores of Basilan, in Lamitan, and far from the usual routes of pirate raiders on their way to Zamboanga from Sulu and Maluso. The Yakans were understandably wary of the Tausugs who proceeded to occupy much of the lowlands of the island's southeast coast, and have remained hostile to the Tausug kingdom that eventually flourished in the area.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times <b>farther</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|So-called superluminal {{motion is}} seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the {{relativistic}} jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds {{in excess of the}} speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.|$|E
5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, {{the brightest star}} in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E
