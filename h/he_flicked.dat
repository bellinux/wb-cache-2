5|$|To the {{attacker}}s' surprise, Voss {{did not try}} {{to escape}} the aerial trap. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> his triplane about in a flat spin and fired at his attackers in a headon firing pass, holing McCudden's wings. Voss riddled Cronyn's SE.5 from close range, putting him out of the dogfight. Cronyn had to turn in under his attacker and throw his aircraft into a spin to escape being killed. His wingmates attacked Voss while Cronyn also limped for home.|$|E
25|$|Marillier {{made his}} debut {{in place of}} Craig Wishart in the second match. The first ball he faced was on his legs and so <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> it away for three, which settled him. He put on 83 for the first wicket with Alistair Campbell before pulling a long hop to midwicket for 27. Their stand was a major reason why Zimbabwe won the match. In the third game he scored 47, in a {{partnership}} of 97 with Campbell.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the Test, only just, by 13-12 on a wet and windy Athletic Park. Another one-point margin. We had it {{won more}} comfortably than it looked until David Campese, {{who was at}} fullback, made a mistake {{towards the end of}} the game. Standing in a tackle, <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> the ball back infield where it was snapped up by All Black centre Joe Stanley who then popped up a pass as he was being tackled to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden for a try beside the posts. The easiest of conversions made it one point the difference, and in the dozen minutes remaining we had to tackle like mad dogs in the fierce wind and pelting rain to keep them out. We were tremendously relieved at fulltime...|$|E

Ben unscrews {{the lid and}} finds many diamonds, rings, bracelets, necklaces and earrings clustered together in the tin. Ben hears Granny approaching and quickly puts the tin back and sits back down at the table.|$|R
500|$|An [...] "spectacular" [...] goal by Henry against Manchester United on 1 October 2000 inflicted {{the champions}} their first league {{defeat of the}} season. The Frenchman scored after {{receiving}} a pass from Gilles Grimandi in the 30th minute; {{with his back to}} goal <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> the ball up before pivoting to strike the ball over goalkeeper Fabian Barthez. Henry scored the winning goal against Aston Villa the following week and a further league victory, away at West Ham United moved Arsenal level on points with Manchester United. The month ended with a 5–0 win against Manchester City.|$|E
500|$|On 29 June 1958, Pelé {{became the}} {{youngest}} player {{to play in a}} World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected {{as one of the best}} goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; [...] "When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding". When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.|$|E
500|$|In {{a hostile}} League Cup quarter-final against local rivals Aston Villa, Žigić had an {{apparently}} valid goal disallowed for offside against another player, {{and with the}} scores level after 86 minutes, {{was about to be}} substituted when he produced a [...] "mis-hit, deflected, scruffy late goal" [...] that secured the win. He opened the scoring against favourites Arsenal in the final with a short-range header, and with one minute of normal time remaining, <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> on a long clearance, Arsenal's goalkeeper and central defender got in each other's way, and the ball fell to Obafemi Martins to tap in the winning goal. Football manager turned commentator David Pleat wrote that [...] "Birmingham earned their victory through terrific teamwork and astute deployment of Žigić's strengths." [...] Because of [...] "niggling" [...] hip and groin injuries, he made only two more substitute appearances. His absence deprived the team of what the Birmingham Mails reporter called their [...] "most effective style: getting the ball forward early, pressing up the pitch and playing off him", as they were relegated to the Championship.|$|E

500|$|Five {{years after}} Gooch's [...] Test debut {{where he made}} a pair of ducks against Australia at Edgbaston in July 1975, he scored his first Test century with 123 against the West Indies at Lord's in June 1980. [...] Gooch's highest Test score is 333, which he made in the first innings against India in 1990. [...] As of January 2013, this is the third-highest Test score by an Englishman (after Len Hutton's 364 and Wally Hammond's 336 not out), and is the equal twelfth-highest score in Test history. [...] He went on to score 123 in the second innings of the same Test match, {{becoming}} the sixth Englishman {{at that time to}} have scored a century in both innings of a Test match, and the first for over 40 years. Gooch is one of fewer than 50 batsmen to carry his bat in a Test innings when, in 1991 against the West Indies, he remained not {{out at the end of}} the England innings with a score of 154. He is also one of only seven cricketers in Test history, and the only on a score of 100 or greater, to have been dismissed by handling the ball, when <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> the ball away from the stumps against Australia in 1993.|$|E
500|$|In February 2013, Boyd joined Championship side Hull City on loan {{until the}} end of the 2012–13 season, with a view to a {{permanent}} move. He made his debut two days after signing, on 23 February, coming on as a second-half substitute for Robert Koren in a 4–1 away defeat to Bolton Wanderers. Boyd's full debut came at home in the following match a week later, as he scored twice in a 5–2 victory over Birmingham City. After the performance, Hull manager Steve Bruce stated — [...] "It was a wonder show. His work-rate and intelligence – he looked the real deal. I've always been a big admirer, but I didn't know he was that good. If he can keep performing like that then we've got some player on our hands". He scored in Hull's next match at the KC Stadium later that month, in a 2–1 loss to Nottingham Forest, who he failed a medical at in January, netting just before half-time when <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> the ball over his shoulder with his back to goal. Boyd's fourth goal in six matches came on 30 March, scoring the only goal of the match as Hull secured a 1–0 away victory over Huddersfield Town, an inch perfect ball played through by Jay Simpson found Boyd on the edge of the box, who clinically fired a first time strike into the keepers' top left corner. He played regularly for the remainder of the campaign, including in Hull's 2–2 home draw with Cardiff City on the last day of the season, the match that ultimately secured the club's promotion back to the Premier League. During his loan spell, Boyd made thirteen appearances and scored four times.|$|E
2500|$|Chatfield is {{also noted}} for being seriously injured on the cricket field, in a Test match against England in the 1974/5 season. England {{were at the}} end of a long and {{difficult}} tour in which they had been defeated in the Ashes by Australia, chiefly by the Australian fast bowlers Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee. Chatfield, a number 11 batsman, was holding up England with a last wicket partnership with his future captain, Geoff Howarth. English fast bowler Peter Lever decided to test Chatfield with a bouncer. At the time helmets and other now common protective gear were not in use. The ball struck Chatfield on the temple, rendering him unconscious and not breathing. Watching English physiotherapist Bernard Thomas was the first to realise what had happened: Chatfield had swallowed his tongue. <b>He</b> <b>flicked</b> it back into place (and managed to revive Chatfield with a heart massage. Lever was distraught and Chatfield later joked that when he was visited by Lever in hospital, that [...] "he looked worse than I did". A couple of years later helmets were introduced into cricket and Chatfield wore one thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Mustafizur Rahman is {{probably}} the most successful bowler of the off cutter. Instead of rolling the fingers over the seam of sliding it back <b>he</b> <b>flicks</b> his wrists at the very last moment with very less change to his action. Thus the 'Fizz' grips the surface and deviates the ball from its line and gets a sudden jump like bounce with slower pace. He even bowls a fast off cutter. Thus Nasser Hossain rightly described him as a 'fast off spinner'. A good example would be Andre Russels dismissal by Mustafizur in the Vivo IPL 2016.|$|R
50|$|Challenger Challenge: The Reverse Flick - In this challenge, contestants must {{perform the}} reverse flick inside a {{confined}} space. Tab, originally so nervous she freaked {{out as the}} technique was being demonstrated, has a slight turn when reversing the car, hitting the entrance obstacles in most of her five attempts. Aaron turns the wheel too many times through his first four runs, and needed Andrew's help in his fifth run; even then, he steers too far. Afiya brakes through her first three runs, and plows into the foam barriers. She passes on her fifth run. On Shirley's first run, she doesn't attempt the turn until she is at the exit. Frustrated, Janis leaves the car and Andrew takes her place. Shirley passes on her third attempt after a near miss in her second run. Sly, who has a nonverbal learning disorder, is given written instructions for his run. He hits the brake in his first three runs. He is too frustrated and barely turns at all in his fourth attempt, but before his final attempt, the rain sets in. Forced to do a slower 30 km/h reverse instead of a 40 km/h reverse, he passes on his last attempt. Ben over-steers in his first three runs and tries to brake to compensate. <b>He</b> <b>flicks</b> too early in his fourth run, and <b>he</b> <b>flicks</b> slightly too far {{in the opposite direction}} in his last attempt, failing the challenge.|$|R
2500|$|Father Mancuso was a lawyer, {{judge of}} the Catholic Court and {{psychotherapist}} who lived at the local Sacred Heart Rectory. He arrived to perform the blessing while George and Kathy were unpacking their belongings {{on the afternoon of}} December 18, 1975, and went into the building to carry out the rites. When <b>he</b> <b>flicked</b> the first holy water and began to pray, he heard a masculine voice demand that he [...] "get out." [...] When leaving the house, Father Mancuso did not mention this incident to either George or Kathy. On December 24, 1975, Father Mancuso called George Lutz and advised him {{to stay out of the}} second floor room where he had heard the mysterious voice, the former bedroom of Marc and John Matthew DeFeo that Kathy planned to use as a sewing room, but the call was cut short by static. Following his visit to the house, Father Mancuso allegedly developed a high fever and blisters on his hands similar to stigmata. At first George and Kathy experienced nothing unusual in the house. Talking about their experiences subsequently, they reported that it was as if they [...] "were each living in a different house." ...|$|E
