50|$|The {{motor-generator}} set may contain a large flywheel {{to improve its}} ride-through; however, consideration must be taken in this application as the motor-generator will require {{a large amount of}} current on re-closure, if prior to the pull-out torque is achieved, resulting in a shut down. The <b>in-rush</b> <b>current</b> during re-closure will depend on many factors, however. As an example, a 250 kVA motor generator operating at 300 ampere of full load current will require 1550 ampere of <b>in-rush</b> <b>current</b> during a re-closure after 5 seconds. This example used a fixed mounted flywheel sized to result in a 1/2 Hz per second slew rate. The motor-generator was a vertical type two-bearing machine with oil-bath bearings.|$|E

In particular, the inhomogeneity of high temperature superconducting coated conductors (HTS-CC) combined with the diffculty to predict RFCLs behaviour when interfaced with the existing electrical grid represents an important bottleneck that limits their competitiveness on the electrical market. In order to study {{the influence of the}} local inhomogeneity of the HTS tape on the global effective performance of an RFCL, a modular equivalent circuit model has been developed using SimPowerSystemsTM. The model implements an inhomogeneity distribution based on statistical data and takes into account the thermal conduction between different zones of the HTS-CC.

The Quarantine Power Station was unable to start the larger Unit #5 required to provide enough power to restart any of the Torrens Island Power Station units, so Torrens Island needed power from the Victorian interconnector to be restarted. A circuit breaker in the Quarantine Power Station switchyard connecting Torrens Island Power Station and the smaller units at Quarantine Power Station with Unit #5 tripped repeatedly due to <b>in-rush</b> <b>current</b> on the generator transformer and auxiliary transformer, and subsequently ran out of stored energy before Unit #5 could be started.|$|E

The UNIVAC I was designed with parallel computation circuits and result comparison. In practice, only failing components yielded comparison faults as their circuit designs were very reliable. Tricks were used to manage the reliability of tubes. Prior {{to use in the}} machine, large lots of the predominant tube type 25L6 were burned in and carefully tested. Often half of a production lot would be thrown away. Technicians installed a tested and burned in tube in an easily diagnosed location such as the memory recirculate amplifiers. Then when aged further, this [...] "golden" [...] tube was sent to stock to be used in a difficult to diagnose logic position. It took about 30 minutes to turn on the computer as all filament power supplies were stepped up to operating value over that time, to reduce <b>in-rush</b> <b>current</b> and thermal stress on the tubes. As a result, uptimes (MTBF) of many days to weeks were obtained on the processor. The UNISERVO did not have vacuum columns, rather had springs and strings to buffer tape from the reels to the capstan. These were a frequent source of failures.|$|E
40|$|Adverse {{effects of}} starting-torque {{transients}} and high <b>in-rush</b> <b>currents</b> in induction motors are typically mitigated by employing electronically controlled soft starting voltages through silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs). However, the heat dissipation {{in the soft}} starter must be carefully managed {{in the design of}} motor drives. The objective of this study is both to address the heat dissipation in the soft starter by implementing analytical solutions to the heat diffusion equations inside the soft starter, and to investigate the use of a phase change material (PCM) based heat sink for thermal management of the device. The analytical modeling approach is, however, general, and {{can be applied to the}} solution of a range of thermal problems in power electronics. The transient analytical thermal model, based on the thermal quadrupole approach, allows a determination of the transient performance of a soft starter by evaluating the thyristor junction temperature. Predictions from the model are first compared to results obtained using a coupled thermal and electricalmodel based on a resistance/capacitance network approach. Experimental results obtained with the soft starter connected to a low-voltage 200 hp induction machine are then used to validate the model. Additionally, the performance improvement resulting from the use of a hybrid heat sink (plate fin heat sink immersed in a PCM) is evaluated and compared to a conventional air-cooled heat sink without a PCM under identical conditions...|$|R

The focus on renewable energy has {{over the past few}} decades intensified greatly. This thesis contributes to the research on developing renewable energy technologies, within the wind power, wave power and marine current power projects at the division of Electricity, Uppsala University. In this thesis grid connection of permanent magnet generator based renewable energy sources is evaluated. A tap transformer based grid connection system has been constructed and experimentally evaluated for a vertical axis wind turbine. Full range variable speed operation of the turbine is enabled by using the different step-up ratios of a tap transformer. This removes the need for a DC/DC step or an active rectifier on the generator side of the full frequency converter and thereby reduces system complexity. Experiments and simulations of the system for variable speed operation are done and efficiency and harmonic content are evaluated. Â  The work presented in the thesis has also contributed to the design, construction and evaluation of a full-scale offshore marine substation for wave power intended to grid connect a farm of wave energy converters. The function of the marine substation has been experimentally tested and the substation is ready for deployment. Results from the system verification are presented. Special focus is on the transformer losses and transformer <b>in-rush</b> <b>currents.</b> A control and grid connection system for a vertical axis marine current energy converter has been designed and constructed.

A major use in the past was in power rectifiers and direct current motor controllers to produce direct current (DC), where they were {{used in conjunction with}} large electrolytic capacitors to remove the voltage ripple (AC) at the output DC. A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the rectifier and filter capacitors to excessive <b>in-rush</b> and ripple <b>currents</b> if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more power supply ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from mains frequency power supplies.

In this work, we investigate a power-gating strategy for through-silicon via (TSV) -based 3 D IC stacking structures. Power-gating control is becoming more complicated as more dies are stacked. We combine the on-chip PDN and TSV in a multilayered 3 D IC to perform power-gating analysis of the static and dynamic voltage drops and <b>in-rush</b> <b>current.</b> Then, we propose a novel power-gating strategy that optimizes the <b>in-rush</b> <b>current</b> profile, subject to the voltage-drop constraints.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} current-mode {{hysteretic}} buck converter with a spur-free constant-cycle frequency-hopping controller that fully eliminates spurs from the switching noise spectrum irrespective of {{variations in the}} switching frequency and operating conditions. As a result, the need for frequency regulation loops to ensure non-varying switching frequency (i. e. fixed spurs location) in hysteretic controllers is eliminated. Moreover, compared to frequency regulation loops, the proposed converter offers the advantage of eliminating mixing and interference altogether due to its spur-free operation, and thus, {{it can be used}} to power, or to be integrated within noise-sensitive systems while benefiting from the superior dynamic performance of its hysteretic operation. The proposed converter uses dual-sided hysteretic band modulation to eliminate the inductor current imbalance that results from frequency hopping along with the output voltage transients and low-frequency noise floor peaking associated with it. Moreover, a feedforward adaptive hysteretic band controller is proposed to reduce variations in the switching frequency with the input voltage, and an all-digital soft-startup circuit is proposed to control the <b>in-rush</b> <b>current</b> without requiring any off-chip components.
