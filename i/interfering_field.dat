40|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} light driving force induced surface deformation on azobenzene-containing polymers. The surface deformation is attributed to light-induced mass migration inside the polymers. Circular cap arrays are firstly fabricated by high power laser ablation via polarization controlled three-beam interference. The circular caps are subsequently exposed to polarization controlled two-beam <b>interfering</b> <b>field.</b> The results illuminate that when the interfering laser beams are both set to P polarization, the circular caps are deformed. While the laser beams are of other interfering modes like (S, S) and (+ 45 °, - 45 °), the caps are seldom deformed. The circular caps are also exposed to single intensity-homogeneous linearly polarized laser beam. The deformation of the caps keeps {{the same direction as}} the irradiating polarization. A model based on the focusing effect of the circular caps is addressed to explain the origin of the light driving force for mass migration in azopolymers.

40|$|In negative-feedback {{amplifier}} design, electromagnetic interference (EMI) behavior is usually completely disregarded. EMI can, e. g., result in detection of low-frequency envelope {{variations of the}} usually high-frequency interfering signals. If the detected signals {{end up in the}} pass band of the {{negative-feedback amplifier}}, they cannot be distinguished from the intended signal any longer, so the signal-to-error ratio (SER) is reduced. Several measures can be taken to prevent unacceptable reduction of the SER, like applying filters, chokes, etc. In this paper, however, circuit design aspects are investigated. It is assumed that interference reaches the amplifier input and that the SER has to be assured by a proper design of the negative-feedback amplifier. Since EMI is related to nonlinear distortion, it {{is a function of the}} loop gain of the negative-feedback amplifier. For a given electromagnetic (EM) environment it is therefore possible to calculate the minimum loop gain required to reduce EMI to acceptable levels without filtering. To illustrate this systematic design method a transimpedance amplifier is designed and built to properly function in <b>interfering</b> <b>field</b> strengths up to 30 V/m.

40|$|Periodic micro and nano {{structures}} {{are required for}} a variety of different products in micro optics, semiconductors and products with functional surfaces. Today the common approach is standard lithography with numerous processing steps including masking imaging, resist development and subsequent etching. Laser interference structuring is an appropriate solution to provide a manufacturing technology which is able to process polymers as well as semiconductors and metals in a single processing step without any subsequent etching. Based on the theory of interference superposition, the influence of different parameters is theoretically expressed and simulated. In this paper the influence of the phase and the polarization of the interfering beams upon the intensity distribution of the electrical fields of the three-beams are theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated. It is demonstrated that in case of coplanar three-beam interference, the phase of the interfering beams has strong influence upon the intensity patterns of the <b>interfering</b> <b>field.</b> However, in case of non coplanar three-beam interference, the phase of the interfering beams has no influence upon the intensity patterns it just causes a lateral motion of the intensity pattern. By controlling the polarization arrangements of the laser beams, different intensity patterns, like circular holes, circular bumps or rectangular bumps can be generated.

40|$|The South African railway {{company makes}} use of a train wheel {{detection}} system to monitor the trains present on a particular track, noting their lengths, positions and speeds. Interference due to distorted traction currents cause havoc with this system rendering the information gathered unreliable. To combat this interference two paths are available to reduce the detection systems susceptibility. These paths include the addition of shielding between the railway track and the wheel detectors, which form the functional entities of the train wheel detection system, and the installation of a cable running parallel to the railway track with connections to it some distance {{before and after the}} position of the wheel detector. To verify these paths, high frequency experiments were performed in the lab as well as FEM simulations. To perform the high frequency experiments a source capable of producing the high frequency current needed was designed and constructed, along with a well shielded measurement system to enable the mapping of the flux density within the region occupied by and surrounding the wheel detector. The results of both the experimental measurements and simulations yielded that the interfering magnetic field could indeed be reduced through the use of the two available paths, when they are both applied separately and in combination. To obtain the greater reduction in the <b>interfering</b> <b>field</b> within the area occupied by and surrounding the wheel detector the paths should be used in combination. Therefore {{through the use of a}} shield that is constructed from a magnetic material and the installation of a parallel cable the train wheel detection system can be made more robust. Prof. W.

50|$|A {{balanced}} line allows a differential receiver {{to reduce the}} noise on a connection by rejecting common-mode interference.

Since the receiver responds only {{to the difference between}} the wires, it is not influenced by the induced noise voltage. If {{balanced line}} is used in an unbalanced circuit, with different impedances from each conductor to ground, currents induced in the separate conductors will cause different voltage drops to ground, thus creating a voltage differential, making the line more susceptible to noise.

However, problem can occur if the telephone network is {{in close proximity to}} an AM radio transmitter, transmitting high power signal at a frequency which overlaps the bandwidth of the Internet transmission. The interfering electromagnetic field can induced enough current and voltage in the telephone network and causing significant data errors. This report presents a study on the effects of high-powered AM transmission at 576 kHz on a digital transmission system. A GTEM Cell was used to generate the 576 kHz electric field intensity varying from lV/m to 15 V/m with 80 % amplitude modulation. The electric field is imposed on a section of the cable and the Bit Error Rate (BER) is noted using Data Tools 5000. Shielding technique was employed using four conducted materials (soft steel, hard steel, aluminum and copper) in order to test the attenuation of the electric field reaching the cable. Measured results showed that copper can reduce up to 70 % of the BER. The relationship between electric field E and BER for copper is expressed as BER = 2 x 10 + 2. 48 x 10 indicating that the BER increases exponentially with the magnitude of the applied electric field. It is obvious from the work done in this project that any network situated near a high-powered electromagnetic field transmitter should employ a good shielded cabling system.

40|$|Seafloor {{spreading}} anomalies in the world's ocean basins yieldcrucial {{information about}} the paleogeographic configuration of thecontinents {{and the development of}} ocean basins. Standard methodsfor measuring these variations are to apply ship towedmagnetometer systems or aircrafts. For the polar regions,magnetometer systems fixed to a vessel are more appropriate. Aprocessing sequence for the evaluation of magnetometer dataacquired onboard RV Polarstern with a sensor system fixedto the ship is described {{in the first part of}} this thesis. In thesecond part, seafloor spreading anomaly data, measured by ship,aircraft and helicopter, in the South Atlantic region, are used toconstrain a geodynamic model for the Mesozoic break-up of Gondwanaand the development of the Weddell Sea Basin. Magnetometer data acquired onboard the German ice breaker andresearch vessel Polarstern have to be corrected for theship's <b>interfering</b> <b>field</b> caused by the hull and other steel partsof the ship. This correction is done by the calculation ofappropriate compensation coefficients. With the processing schemepresented in this thesis the ship's magnetometer data arecompensated and filtered to an accuracy of about 20 nT at ahorizontal resolution of about 154 m in quiet sea conditions. This makes the data suitable for a consistent interpretation ofsingle track data or further processing of a network of profiles. The compilation of a magnetic anomaly map and comparison withother high resolution magnetic anomaly data demonstrate thesuitability of the processed data to be used for detailedinterpretations of magnetic anomalies in geodynamic problems likethose encountered in the South Atlantic region and dealt with inthe second part of this thesis. A refined model for the break-up of Gondwana and the opening ofthe Weddell Sea is presented in the second part of this thesis. From an interpretation of a newly acquired extensive magneticanomaly data set in the eastern Weddell Sea, well constrained agesand orientations of seafloor spreading anomalies are used tocalculate a new set of model parameters for the opening of theWeddell Sea. These are combined with constraints on the SouthAmerica - Africa and Africa - Antarctica spreading systems, basedon a compilation of magnetic anomaly and fracture zone data, todetermine a new model for Gondwana break-up between 167 Ma and 83 Ma. At the same time when north-south oriented separationbetween Africa and Antarctica is initiated by rifting in theSomali and Mozambique basins, stretching and extension takes placein the Filchner-Ronne Shelf and the Falkland Plateau between 167 Ma and 147 Ma. In contrast to models proposing only rigidEast-West Gondwana separation, this model features three separatebasins developing simultaneously during early Gondwana break-up. These basins are the Somali, Mozambique, and Weddell Sea basins. In the new model, separation between South America and Antarcticastarts in the southern Weddell Sea at around 147 Ma, about 15 to 20 million years later than previously estimated. Subsequentspreading occurs at slow (12 - 14 mm/yr halfrate), and aftermagnetic chron M 2 (122. 3 Ma) ultra-slow (8 mm/yr) spreading rates, with little change in the NNW spreadingdirection. Further consequences of this model are a revision ofthe age of formation of seaward dipping reflector sequences alongthe continental margin off western Dronning Maud Land and newconstraints on possible movements of the Mozambique Ridge betweenAfrica and Antarctica during the break-up of Gondwana and thedevelopment of a deep water connection between the Indian and theSouth Atlantic Ocean...|$|E

40|$|Integrated planar optical {{waveguide}} interferometer biosensors are advantageous combinations of evanescent field sensing and optical phase difference measurement methods. By probing the near surface region of a sensor {{area with the}} evanescent field, any change of the refractive index of the probed volume induces a phase shift of the guided mode compared to a reference field typically of a mode propagating through the reference arm of the same waveguide structure. The <b>interfering</b> <b>fields</b> of these modes produce an interference signal detected at the sensor[U+ 05 F 3]s output, whose alteration {{is proportional to the}} refractive index change. This signal can be recorded, processed and related to e. g. the concentration of an analyte in the solution of interest. Although this sensing principle is relatively simple, studies about integrated planar {{optical waveguide}} interferometer biosensors can mostly be found in the literature covering the past twenty years. During these two decade s, several members of this sensor family have been introduced, which have remarkably advantageous properties. These entail label-free and non-destructive detection, outstandingly good sensitivity and detection limit, cost-effective and simple production, ability of multiplexing and miniaturization. Furthermore, these properties lead to low reagent consumption, short analysis time and open prospects for point-of-care applications. The present review collects the most relevant developments of the past twenty years categorizing them into two main groups, such as common- and double path waveguide interferometers. In addition, it tries to maintain the historical order as it is possible and it compares the diverse sensor designs in order to reveal not only the development of this field in time, but to contrast {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different approaches and sensor families, as well...|$|R
