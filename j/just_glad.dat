500|$|In November 2008, Behan {{was cleared}} {{of the crime}} and allowed full use of his home after a chef named Aldo Staiani was {{identified}} as the murderer from DNA retrieved from under Mrs. Abate's fingernails.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} written by Jules Shear, and included on his 1983 debut solo album, Watch Dog. Shear later recalled in an interview, [...] " [...] {{like a big}} bonus really. Cyndi Lauper does a song ('All Through the Night') that's on a solo record of mine. I just thought, 'No one's really going to hear this.' Then she does it, {{and it becomes a}} Top 5 song." [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> people know the songs, really. I think they're really good. The only problem is with people who don't know I wrote them. I do them and they think, 'God, he's doing that Cyndi Lauper song,'" [...] Shear said.|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Horsfield was {{diagnosed}} with testicular cancer, and advised that his playing career was over. As the disease was discovered in its early stages, no chemotherapy or radiotherapy was needed, surgery proved successful and {{less than two months}} later he was given the all-clear. Horsfield decided to make his illness public to help spread awareness of the disease, and lent his support to a Premier League-backed project launched in 2009 to promote men's health issues. He said: [...] "Getting cancer was something I had to get over. I got it, wanted to beat it and I did. Now I am <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> that I've got another chance in football." ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks was {{fearful of}} the {{attention}} Oscar success would bring as he would be [...] "deprived of a low profile", finding it [...] "hard {{to work with the}} spotlight shining in your eyes." [...] He added: [...] "There's a danger of being seduced into being self-conscious, of being aware of your 'career'. That can be lethal." [...] He also grew more concerned of the [...] "threatening" [...] corporate influence into the film industry at the expense of [...] "the idea of the creative spirit". He channeled this ambivalence into Broadcast News. As a romantic comedy, Brooks felt he could say [...] "something new ... with that form" [...] adding [...] "One of the things you're supposed to do {{every once in a while}} as a filmmaker is capture time and place. I was <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> there was some way to do it in a comedy." [...] He cast William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks in the three main roles.|$|E
500|$|Forty-five {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure.

McMurray qualified third, Bill Elliott took fourth, and A. J. Allmendinger started fifth. Johnson, David Reutimann, Mark Martin, David Ragan and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. Hamlin only managed 37th, having getting close to the wall. The two drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Patrick Carpentier, and Michael McDowell. Once the qualifying session completed, Kahne commented, [...] "That was the best qualifying run by far since I joined Red Bull. I look forward to Sunday’s race. It’s going to be exciting being up front now, being in the mix with Denny , Kevin [...] and Jimmie [...] They’re all going to be fast throughout the race. I’m <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> we are so far. Hopefully we can stick with it tomorrow, have a good practice and be competitive in the mix on Sunday." ...|$|E
60|$|Harry and Kate {{had started}} off to run {{home with the}} news, but Aunt Matilda told the old man all about it, and when he heard {{there was to be}} a Christmas tree, he was <b>just</b> as <b>glad</b> as anybody.|$|R

500|$|The band's style {{changes from}} album to album. Songs About Jane {{consists}} of songs about Levine's ex-girlfriend Jane Herman. On It Won't Be Soon Before Long, however, {{the songs are}} less personal and are more electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a retro feel. Hands All Over continues the band's lost love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single [...] "Moves like Jagger", an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel to it. [...] "It {{was one of those}} songs that was definitely a risk," [...] Levine said. [...] "It's a bold statement. We've never really released a song like that. But it's exciting to do something different, do something new. I'm <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> that everyone likes it." [...] James Valentine called Overexposed [...] "our most 'pop' record ever and we weren’t shy about really going for it." [...] They also have experimented with new wave and disco sounds on several albums.|$|E
500|$|Observers, {{including}} series director David Petrarca and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, {{said that}} illegal downloads did not hurt the series' prospects; it benefited from [...] "buzz" [...] and social commentary, {{and the high}} piracy rate did not significantly translate to lost subscriptions. According to Polygon, HBO's relaxed attitude towards piracy and the sharing of login credentials amounted to a premium-television [...] "free-to-play" [...] model. At a 2015 Oxford Union debate, series co-creator David Benioff {{said that he was}} <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> that people watched the show; illegally downloaded copies of the show sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy of the show, especially in countries where the show was not televised. Co-creator D. B. Weiss had mixed feelings, saying that the show was expensive to produce and [...] "if it doesn't make the money back, then it ceases to exist". However, he was pleased that so many people [...] "enjoy the show so much they can't wait {{to get their hands on}} it." [...] In 2015, Guinness World Records called Game of Thrones the most-pirated television program.|$|E
500|$|McKellen's {{father was}} a civil {{engineer}} and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent. Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a [...] "strict, evangelical Protestant minister" [...] in Ballymena, County Antrim. His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. [...] "My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met." [...] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father {{died when he was}} 24. After his coming out of the closet to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, {{who was a member of}} the Religious Society of Friends, he said, [...] "Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore." [...] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a [...] "grandfather of the modern weekend".|$|E
6000|$|Without {{answering}} the question, Demorest {{turned to his}} companion with the same good-natured, half humorous authority. [...] "Let your wife wait; take a drive with me.

2500|$|The school's principal, Gwendolyn Tose'-Rigell, explained, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped {{out of his chair}} and ran out of the room?" [...] Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have {{expressed}} similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> he didn't get up and leave because then I would have been more scared and confused." ...|$|E
2500|$|Erhard {{representative}} Sharon Spaulding stated [...] "From our standpoint, we're <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> {{that the}} judge ruled we have a viable claim" [...] for {{the issue of the}} slander part of Erhard's lawsuit. Erhard's attorney, William S. O'Hare, asserted that his client was vindicated by the ruling. O'Hare said that [...] "Up until now, we didn't know whether this case had any validity at all.

60|$|And {{the others}} were <b>just</b> as <b>glad</b> as Peter Rabbit. Johnny Chuck was {{especially}} glad, for, you see, Farmer Brown's boy had once found Johnny's snug home, and Johnny had had to move as suddenly as did Granny and Reddy Fox. Johnny knew just how Reddy must feel, for he had had many narrow escapes in his short life. You can read all about them in the next book, The Adventures of Johnny Chuck.|$|R
2500|$|... "It is {{with great}} sorrow, that I must write you these lines. Yesterday {{we have lost}} our beloved son (Niels Peter Joensen) during a whaling in Sandvík. The sea was so rough that two boats capsized, 9 men on board one and 6 in the other. I was myself on board one of these boats and {{was the only one}} who got rescued. Several times I got loose of the boat and was deep down in the sea, but I kept {{grabbing}} the boat again. After a long time a boat came to rescue me. You must not think, that I was <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> to be rescued. It was just because of Mariane (his wife) and the daughters. My brother Hans also died. All together 14 young men and boys like Peter. It is an unbelievable grief, both out where he used to work, and not at least here at home." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, Universal Pictures {{approached}} West {{to star in}} a film opposite W. C. Fields. The {{studio was}} eager to duplicate the success of Destry Rides Again starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart with a comic vehicle starring West and Fields. Having left Paramount 18 months earlier {{and looking for a}} new film, West accepted the role of Flower Belle Lee in the film My Little Chickadee (1940). Despite the stars' intense mutual dislike, and Fields's very real drinking problems, and fights over the screenplay, My Little Chickadee was a box-office success, outgrossing Fields's previous film, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939), and the later The Bank Dick (1940). Despite this, religious leaders condemned West as a negative role model, taking offense at lines such as [...] "Between two evils, I like to pick the one I haven't tried before," [...] and [...] "Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you <b>just</b> <b>glad</b> to see me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow," [...] she smiled, {{with a hint}} of tears, [...] "I'll be a reg'lar lady, I guess, {{and make}} you explain and explain like everything, but now I'm <b>just</b> <b>glad.</b> Yes," [...] defiantly, [...] "I will admit it if I want to! I am glad!" ...|$|E
