Method: A 7 -compartment mathematical model of the human cardiopulmonary system—upgraded to include inertance of blood columns in the aorta and vena cavae—was exercised with parameters scaled to reflect changes in body weight from 1 to 70 kg. Results: Maximal systemic perfusion pressure occurs at chest compression rates near 60, 120, 180, and 250 per minute for subjects weighing 70, 10, 3, and 1 kg, respectively. Such maxima are predicted by analytical models describing the dependence of stroke volume on pump filling time in the presence of blood inertia. This mathematical analysis reproduces earlier experimental results of Fitzgerald et al. in 10 kg dogs. Conclusions: Fundamental geometry and physics suggest that the most effective chest <b>compression</b> <b>frequency</b> in CPR depends upon body size and weight.

40|$|Application of {{intermittent}} pneumatic compressions (IPC) is an extensively used {{therapeutic strategy}} in vascular medicine, but the {{mechanisms by which}} this method works are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that acute application (150 min) of cyclic leg compressions in a rat model signals upregulation of angiogenic factors in skeletal muscle. To explore the impact of different pressures and <b>frequency</b> of <b>compressions,</b> we divided rats into four groups as follows: 120 mmHg (2 s inflation/ 2 s deflation), 200 mmHg (2 s/ 2 s), 120 mmHg (4 s/ 16 s), and control (no intervention). Blood flow and leg oxygenation (study 1) and the mRNA expression of angiogenic mediators in the rat tibialis anterior muscle (study 2) were assessed after a single session of IPC. In all three groups exposed to the intervention, a modest hyperemia (∼ 37 % above baseline) between compressions and a slight, nonsignificant increase in leg oxygen consumption (∼ 30 %) were observed during IPC. Compared with values in the control group, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) mRNA increased significantly (P < 0. 05) only in rats exposed to the higher <b>frequency</b> of <b>compressions</b> (2 s on/ 2 s off). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase, matrix metalloproteinase- 2, and hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α mRNA did not change significantly following the intervention. These findings show that IPC application augments the mRNA content of key angiogenic factors in skeletal muscle. Importantly, the magnitude of changes in mRNA expression appeared to be modulated by the <b>frequency</b> of <b>compressions</b> such that a higher frequency (15 cycles/min) evoked more robust changes in VEGF and MCP- 1 compared with a lower frequency (3 cycles/min) ...|$|R

This is of particular concern in infants and young children, {{who may not be}} able to provide feedback about <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> settings. This study explores use of an objective cortical auditory evoked potential that is sensitive to changes in spectral contrast, the auditory change complex (ACC), in the verification of <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> parameters. We recorded ACC responses in adult listeners to a spectral ripple contrast stimulus processed with a range of <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> ratios (1 : 1 to 4 : 1). Vowel identification, consonant identification, speech recognition in noise (QuickSIN), and behavioral ripple discrimination thresholds were also measured under identical <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> conditions.

In Experiment 2, these same measures were repeated in ten adults with sloping, high frequency hearing loss, which is the clinical population for whom this signal processing technique was intended. No significant relationship of compression ratio and vowel identification was found in the normal hearing listeners, though a significant negative effect of increasing <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> ratio was observed in the hearing impaired group. Significant effects of compression ratio on ACC amplitude, consonant identification, ripple discrimination threshold, and speech perception in noise were found for both the normal hearing and hearing impaired groups.

However, few studies have investigated {{the usefulness of the}} scheme as a bimodal option for cochlear implant users. In this study, that question was posed. It was hypothesized that, following fitting and a period of adjustment to a frequency-compression hearing aid, sound localization and speech perception would be improved compared to conventional amplification. More specifically, more high-frequency cues would be perceived in the hearing aid ear using <b>frequency</b> <b>compression,</b> thereby providing better sensitivity to interaural level differences when a cochlear implant is used contralaterally. There were two experiments in this study. In the first experiment, the goal was to determine if <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> was a better bimodal option than conventional amplification. Performance was assessed on tests of sound localization, speech perception in a background of noise, and using questionnaires. Ten subjects with a cochlear implant plus hearing aid participated in experiment one. In the second experiment, the goal was to determine the impact of <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> on speech perception in quiet. Consonant and vowel perception in quiet was assessed using the frequency-compression and conventional hearing aid. Seventeen adult subjects participated in the second experiment. In both experiments, subjects alternated daily between a frequency-compression and conventional hearing aid for two months. The parameters of <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> were set individually for each subject and audibility was measured for the <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> and conventional hearing aid programs by comparing estimations of the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII) using a modified algorithm (Bentler, R., Cole, B., Wu, Y-H.

Results revealed {{no significant difference between the}} frequency-compression and conventional hearing aid on tests of localization and consonant recognition.

These results suggest that, for the subjects in this study, <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> is not a better bimodal option than conventional amplification. In addition, speech perception may be negatively influenced by <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> because formant frequencies are too severely compressed and can no longer be distinguished...|$|E

Numerous things can damage the complex and delicate structure of the cochlea causing hearing deficit called sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Of the two major types of hearing losses, conductive hearing loss is often corrected with surgery. On the other hand, hearing aids are the only way to compensate for SNHL. Hearing impairment affects many aspects of audition such as audibility, dynamic range, spectral and/or temporal resolution, etc., in particular if background noise is present. Enhancing spectral information of hearing-impaired people can compensate the spectral masking, which occurs due to SNHL <b>Frequency</b> <b>compression</b> {{is one of the more}} appropriate signal processing techniques to compensate for spectral masking.

40|$|Objectives. The {{clinical}} {{effects of}} the simultaneous application of nonlinear <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> and dichotic hearing on people with hearing impairments have not been evaluated previously. In this study, the clinical {{effects of the}} simultaneous application of these two techniques on the recognition of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words with fricatives were evaluated using normal-hearing subjects and a hearing loss simulator operated in the severe hearing loss setting. Methods. A total of 21 normal-hearing volunteers whose native language was English were recruited for this study, and two different hearing loss simulators, which were configured for severe hearing loss in the high-frequency range, were utilized. The subjects heard 82 English CVC words, and the word recognition score and response time were measured. Results. The experimental results demonstrated that the simultaneous application of these two techniques showed almost even performance compared to the sole application of nonlinear <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> in a severe hearing loss setting. Conclusion. Though it is generally accepted that dichotic hearing can decrease the spectral masking thresholds of an hearing-impaired person, simultaneous application of the nonlinear <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> and dichotic hearing techniques did not significantly improve the recognition of words with fricatives compared to the sole application of nonlinear <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> in a severe hearing loss setting.

Previous investigators have shown that the <b>frequency</b> <b>compression</b> is related to the decreasing conduction velocity of the muscle fibers.

A theoretical analysis was performed to investigate the restrictions in estimating the three parameters, as well as their sensitivity to the conduction velocity. The ratio parameter was found to be mostsensitive to conduction velocity, but was the least reliable of the three. The median frequency was theleast sensitive to noise. Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, the median frequency is the preferred parameter. A technique is described which determines an unbiased consistent estimate of the median frequency.
