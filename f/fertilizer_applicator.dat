40|$|Current Mechanical <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applicators</b> using {{centrifugal}} spreading {{system could}} not be applied to young palm oil trees (under 5 years old) and hence needed to be modified. The research was to design a fertilizer spreading system, using a pneumatic system. The design used a positive type pneumatic pressure to blow the granular fertilizer out of the metering device to the soil surface around the tree. The metering device was designed to deliver the fertilizer in several application rates, i. e. : 0. 25, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25, and 1. 5 kg/tree. Based on pressure drop analysis the pneumatic system needed a power of 0. 71 kW, where the blower should be rotated at 3000 rpm to produce an air flow of ± 0. 3375 m 3 /s.

To achieve the objectives, the distribution of live load and dynamic impact effects for different types of farm vehicles on three general bridge types—steel-concrete, steel-timber, and timber-timber—were investigated through load testing and analytical modeling. The types of vehicles studied included, but were not limited to, grain wagons/grain carts, manure tank wagons, agriculture <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applicators,</b> and tractors. Once the effects of these vehicles had been determined, a parametric study was carried out to develop live load distribution factor (LLDF) equations that account for the effect of husbandry vehicle loads. Similarly, recommendations for dynamic effects were also developed. The live load distribution factors and dynamic load allowances are covered in the first volume of the report.

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track II: Transportation and BiofuelsVigorous debate continues {{regarding the}} net energy {{that can be}} gained in producing liquid fuels from crop materials. However, {{it is clear that}} the net energy gain from the process is small relative to the energy demands of producing the fuel. Thus, a small reduction in the energy required to produce biofuels would result in a much larger increase (proportionally) of net energy produced. Nitrogen nutrition of crops is one of the most promising places to gain a small reduction in energy invested in fuels. Most estimates of energy required to produce corn, for example, suggest that nitrogen fertilizer represents nearly half of the energy budget. Grass-based fuels would also require large energy inputs in the form of nitrogen fertilizer. Our research has shown that the amount of nitrogen fertilizer needed by corn varies widely from field to field and from place to place within a single field. However, corn producers generally apply the same nitrogen fertilizer rate over whole fields and often whole farms. This results in many areas being over-fertilized and represents a large energy input that produces no energy return. Convenient, accurate, and spatially intensive diagnostic tools are needed to match fertilizer use to crop need. Crop sensors are the most promising technology to achieve this goal. They can be mounted on <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applicators,</b> diagnose <b>fertilizer</b> need, and control fertilizer rate within seconds. In 41 on-farm demonstrations of this technology from 2004 - 2007, we were able to improve system nitrogen efficiency (nitrogen removed in grain/nitrogen fertilizer applied) from 81 % (current producer practice) to 96 %. This was accomplished by producing the same grain yield with 16 % less nitrogen fertilizer, thus decreasing the energy input for corn ethanol and increasing the net energy return.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{to learn more about}} the spatial structure of soil NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- concentrations in cornfields in late spring and to identify some major causes of variability in these concentrations. This information is specifically needed to aid in design of efficient sampling strategies for the late-spring test for nitrogen (N) availability, which is a new management tool that enables site-specific evaluation and adjustment of fertilization practices. One study assessed the importance of windrows of plant residue left by combines as a source of variability in soil nitrate (NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]-) concentrations for the next crop. Observations made in several fields having distinct windrows showed that yields of corn were significantly affected, but the effects on soil NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- concentrations were minor compared to other unidentified sources of variability. A second study evaluated rows of young corn plants as a potential source ofvariability. Results from several fields revealed cyclic patterns in soil NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- concentrations along transects perpendicular to rows. A third study evaluated nonuniform distributions of fertilizers across the width of large applicators as a possible source of variability. Observations made in several fields revealed cyclic patterns in NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- concentration that seemed to be caused by <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applicators</b> and other farming operations. Models were developed that enabled integration of the observed cyclic patterns into geostatistical models commonly used to describe spatial structure. Procedures were developed for partitioning variability caused by two or more superimposed cycles;Overall, the results show that cyclic patterns are an important component of the spatial structure of soil NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- concentrations in cornfields. Consideration of these cyclic patterns should enable more complete characterization of the spatial structure of soil NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- concentrations in fields and, therefore, enable design of more efficient sampling strategies to assess NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- concentrations within these fields. In addition, the ability to detect previously unrecognized cyclic patterns in soil NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- concentrations gives the ability to demonstrate the benefits of using practices that minimize formation of troublesome cyclic patterns in fields...|$|R

Zero-tillage farming is essentially farming without ploughing, where seeds are planted in a narrow slit or trench opened up mechanically in the soil. According to IITA, zero-tillage farming gives effective soil management, with cost-saving technology which supports continuous land use. It encourages productivity for all categories of farmers. The compaction and soil degrading effects of heavy machinery are considerably reduced. Zero-tillage farming makes effective post-clearing management possible. Its soil conservation attributes include effective reduction of erosion, increase of waterholding capacity and maintenance of temperature balance in soils. Furthermore, zero-tillage promotes earthworm activity. The IITA report says that the potential of zero-tillage farming for the humid tropics is being increasingly realized.

The equipment was tested {{in the field to}} observe its performance on sugarcane with results showing an increase of 16. 2 %, 16. 4 % and 35. 4 % in yield as compared to conventional ploughing with in-furrow fertilizer application (Control). Subsoiling alone increased the cane weight, number of millable cane and cane yield by 4. 3 %, 11. 4 % and 15. 9 % compared to the control...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{practices}} for nitrogen fertilization of corn produce soil {{conditions that are}} conducive to preferential water flow and nitrate leaching. A new <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applicator</b> is proposed that will more effectively protect the fertilizer from infiltrating water and thus reduce the potential for leaching. The device forms a small compacted layer of soil above the subsurface fertilizer band and then mounds soil into a surface dome directly above the fertilizer band. This new localized compaction and doming (LCD) method is evaluated by measuring soil physical properties around the fertilizer band and comparing them with measurements made within the conventional knifing system. The LCD applicator increased penetration resistance from 0. 50 to 0. 75 MPa at the fertilizer band. As the knife slit above the fertilizer band was closed by the LCD applicator, soil bulk density was increased from 1. 2 to 1. 4 g/cm 3 in the region. The ponded infiltration rate through the fertilizer band was reduced from 19. 7 cm/h at the conventional knife slit to 10. 1 cm/h at the LCD surface. Reduced water flow through the fertilizer band will result in reduced NO 3 -N movement. Nitrate movement was measured during a growing season in a corn field, and NO 3 -N applied by the LCD applicator moved approximately 60 % as deep as NO 3 -N applied by a conventional knife applicator. The ability to restrict NO 3 -N movement by modifying the surface soil at N application represents a simple yet effective strategy to reduce NO 3 -N leaching losses and possible impacts on groundwater quality...|$|E
40|$|Ridge {{conservation}} tillage systems are receiving increased attention {{as an alternative}} to flat no-till systems for row crop production. A recently-developed <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applicator,</b> the spoke-wheel injector has potential to improve fertilizer-use efficiency in ridge-till systems, but little work has been done to identify efficient N placements for ridges. A field study to investigate corn (Zea mays L.) response to ridge-till N placement methods and to examine the inorganic N distribution resulting from point-injected N fertilizer was conducted within a corn-soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) rotation at two central Iowa locations on poorly-drained till-derived soils. Urea-ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) treatments consisted of combinations of three placements (surface broadcast spray, point injection between rows, or point injection in rows) and five rates from 0 to 157 kg N ha[superscript]- 1. To determine fertilizer-N recovery, [superscript] 15 N-depleted NH[subscript] 4 NO[subscript] 3 (99. 99 % [superscript] 14 N) was substituted for UAN on one-row microplots from within the main plots of the 67 - and 157 -kg N ha[superscript]- 1 treatments. Nitrogen recovery was estimated from plant samples taken at four growth stages from [superscript] 15 N-depleted microplots. Nitrate- and NH[subscript] 4 -N were determined on soil samples taken late in the growing season at five positions perpendicular to the plant row and at several depth intervals from 0 -, 67 -, and 157 -kg N ha[superscript]- 1 injection treatments;Generally, 157 kg N ha[superscript]- 1 treatments resulted in soil NO[subscript] 3 -N and NH[subscript] 4 -N levels greater than other rates. The greatest N accumulations were measured around the injection point and in the ridge surface soil. Injected N resulted in significantly greater corn yields, percentage N derived from fertilizer, and percentage of fertilizer N recovered than broadcast, but differences between injection positions were generally not significant;A portion of the study area was used to compare the sufficiency of one- and three-row microplots for studying N uptake from in-row N applications. Nitrogen recoveries did not differ significantly between the two microplot types. One-row microplots seem to have potential to decrease the amount of labeled-N required under some experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} in 1986, 1987, and 1988 were conducted at three sites in Iowa {{to determine the}} performance of the corn hybrids, selected for variation of relative maturity ratings, at varying rates of fertilizer N in {{the presence or absence of}} N-Serve. Sites 1 and 2 were under a continuous corn cropping while Site 3 was a corn-soybean rotation. The response of 4 corn hybrids to level and form of N was studied in a factorial of 3 N x 2 N-Serve x 2 methods of N application at Site 1. All pre-plant N was compared to the split application of N, with the second half of the N and N-Serve rates incorporated during V 9 -V 12 stage.;At Site 1, 5 corn hybrids were used in a factorial of 3 K x 3 N x 2 N-Serve at 3 plant populations in 1986 and 2 plant populations in 1987. In 1986, half of the N from (NH[subscript] 4) [subscript] 2 SO[subscript] 4 was applied just before anthesis (81 DAP) with wheel point injector <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applicator</b> (PIFA) with or without N-Serve. In 1987, 77 kg N ha[superscript]- 1 from urea was broadcast over the entire field before planting. Additional rates of N from UAN was applied 56 DAP using PIFA, with or without N-Serve.;At Site 3 a, 3 corn hybrids were used in a factorial of 6 N x 3 methods of N application. For Site 3 b, the response of P 3471 was evaluated in a factorial of 3 K x 3 N x 2 N-Serve x 2 methods of N application. At Site 3 c, 2 corn hybrids were evaluated using 3 sources of N, namely: UAN, NP, and P. Urea ammonium nitrate and NP were applied with or without N-Serve using PIFA.;Of all the hybrids used in this experiment, the commercial corn hybrid P 3377 and experimental corn line XC 754 were found to have good potential to produce higher yield with most of the treatment or the factors used. At Site 1, where N and N-Serve were applied early, N-Serve increased grain yield and decreased stalk lodging. In 1986, at Site 2, where N was applied at anthesis, N-Serve decreased grain yield and stalk lodging increased, probably because of immobilization of the N. At Sites 3 a and 3 b, the insignificant response to the added fertilizer N and N-Serve may have been due to the large amount of fixed N by soybean crop residue which was returned to the soil...|$|E
