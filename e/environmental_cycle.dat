5000|$|Do {{circadian}} timekeepers {{enhance the}} fitness of organisms growing under natural conditions? Despite {{the expectation that}} circadian clocks are usually assumed to enhance the fitness of organisms by improving their ability to adapt to daily cycles in environmental factors, {{there have been few}} rigorous tests of that proposition in any organism. Cyanobacteria {{are one of the few}} organisms in which such a test has been performed. The adaptive fitness test was done by mixing cyanobacterial strains that express different circadian properties (i.e., rhythmicity vs. arhythmicity, different periods, etc.) and growing them in competition under different environmental conditions. The idea was to determine if having an appropriately functional clock system enhances fitness under competitive conditions. The result was that strains with a functioning biological clock out-compete arhythmic strains in environments that have a rhythmic light/dark cycle (e.g., 12 hours of light alternating with 12 hours of darkness), whereas in [...] "constant" [...] environments (e.g., constant illumination) rhythmic and arhythmic strains grow at comparable rates. Among rhythmic strains with different periods, the strains whose endogenous period most closely matches the period of the <b>environmental</b> <b>cycle</b> is able to out-compete strains whose period does not match that of the environment. Therefore, in rhythmic environments, the fitness of cyanobacteria is improved when the clock is operational and when its circadian period is similar to the period of the <b>environmental</b> <b>cycle.</b> These were among the first rigorous demonstrations in any organism of a fitness advantage conferred by a circadian system.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two general}} modes of entrainment: Phasic vs. Continuous. The phasic model is {{when there is}} limited {{interaction}} with the environment to [...] "reset" [...] the clock every day by the amount equal to the [...] "error", which {{is the difference between}} the <b>environmental</b> <b>cycle</b> and the organism's circadian rhythm. The continuous model is where the circadian rhythm is continuously adjusted by the environment usually by constant light. Two properties, the free running period of an organism, and the phase response curve, are the main pieces of information needed to investigate individual entrainment. There are also limits to entrainment. Although there may be individual differences in this limit, most organisms have a +/- 3 hours limit of entrainment. Due to this limit, it may take several days for re-entrainment.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} {{circadian}} clock, timeless {{is essential}} for entrainment to light-dark (LD) cycles. The typical period length of free-running Drosophila is 23.9 hours, requiring adaptations to the 24-hour <b>environmental</b> <b>cycle.</b> Adaptation first begins with exposure to light. This process leads to the rapid degradation of the TIM protein, allowing organisms to entrain at dawn to environmental cycles. [...] In light-dark cycles, TIM protein level decreases rapidly in late night/early morning, followed by the similar but more gradual changes in PER protein level. TIM degradation is independent of per and its protein, and releases PER from the PER/TIM complex. [...] In some cell types, the photoreceptor protein cryptochrome (CRY) physically associates with TIM and helps regulate light-dependent degradation. CRY is activated by blue light, which binds to TIM and tags it for degradation. This ends the PER/TIM repression of the CLK/CYC-mediated transcription of per and tim genes, allowing per and tim mRNA to be produced to restart the cycle.|$|E

40|$|Circadian clocks are {{required}} to coordinate metabolism and physiology with daily changes in the environment. Such clocks have several distinctive features, including a free-running rhythm of approximately 24 h {{and the ability to}} entrain to both light or temperature cycles (zeitgebers). We have previously characterized the EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF 4) locus of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as being important for robust rhythms. Here, it is shown that ELF 4 is necessary for at least two core clock functions: entrainment to an <b>environmental</b> <b>cycle</b> and rhythm sustainability under constant conditions. We show that elf 4 demonstrates clock input defects in light responsiveness and in circadian gating. Rhythmicity in elf 4 could be driven by an <b>environmental</b> <b>cycle,</b> but an increased sensitivity to light means the circadian system of elf 4 plants does not entrain normally. Expression of putative core clock genes and outputs were characterized in various ELF 4 backgrounds to establish the molecular network of action. ELF 4 was found to be intimately associated with the CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA 1) /LONG ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) -TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC 1) feedback loop because, under free run, ELF 4 is required to regulate the expression of CCA 1 and TOC 1 and, further, elf 4 is locked in the evening phase of this feedback loop.

40|$|AbstractCircadian clocks allow a {{temporal}} coordination and segregation of physiological, metabolic, and behavioural processes {{as well as}} their synchronization with the <b>environmental</b> <b>cycles</b> of day and night. Circadian regulation thereby provides a vital advantage, improving an organisms’ adaptation to its environment. The molecular clock can be synchronized with <b>environmental</b> <b>cycles</b> of day and night, but is able to maintain a self-sustained molecular oscillation also in the absence of environmental stimuli. Interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops were shown to form the basis of circadian clock function in all phyla from bacteria, fungi, plants, insects to humans. More recently post-translational regulation was identified to be equally important, if not sufficient for molecular clock function and accurate timing of circadian transcription. Here we review recent insights into post-translational timing mechanisms that control the circadian clock, with a particular focus on Drosophila. Analogous to transcriptional feedback regulation, circadian clock function in Drosophila appears to rely on inter-connected post-translational timers. Post-translational regulation of clock proteins illustrates mechanisms that allow a precise temporal control of transcription factors in general and of circadian transcription in particular...|$|R

Here we compared the reproductive condition of Acropora at 4 locations in the Coral Sea with contrasting <b>environmental</b> <b>cycles.</b> In the Solomon Islands (SI) where environmental conditions varied little, mature oocytes were found in 28 of the 38 Acropora species sampled.

In 8 widespread and abundant species the proportion of the population with mature oocytes was 2 - 4 times lower in the SI, and a higher proportion of colonies had immature oocytes. These data are consistent with an extended reproductive season in the SI when compared to the GBR. Some asynchrony of gamete release was evident in most species at all locations. In addition, a high number of colonies with no visible gametes suggests that colonies of species which typically participate in mass spawning episodes on the GBR, may miss one or more years, or spawn at other times of the year...|$|R
