5|$|After Biman {{became a}} public limited company, renewed {{attempts}} were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>more)</b> to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>more)</b> to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Although rarely {{performed}} today, at the time, Fatinitza was {{an international}} success. The composer, lyricists, and theatre would reunite <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> international successes in their next two productions: Boccaccio (1879), Suppé's best-known and most popular operetta; and another cross-dressing army opera in Donna Juanita (1880). However, after these successes, Suppé's later operettas proved less popular with audiences, and, {{according to the}} musicologist Andrew Lamb, were also of lower quality.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Diolkos at Corinth, there is scant {{literary}} evidence <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> ship trackways {{by that name}} in antiquity, both in Roman Egypt: The physician Oribasius (c. 320–400AD) records two passages from his 1st centuryAD colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria {{which may have been}} located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90–168AD) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea. Neither Xenocrates nor Ptolemy offers any details on his trackway.|$|E
