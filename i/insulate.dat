One of Arrington's biographers, Gary Topping, praised the research in Brigham Young: American Moses, but criticized its lack of psychological depth, missing the opportunity to re-examine the Mountain Meadows massacre and how Young's wives were treated.|$|E

5|$|Ice {{was also}} transported by {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the {{first use of}} the technique being on the track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company. A special railroad car was built to <b>insulate</b> the ice and equipment designed to allow the cars to be loaded. In 1842 a new railroad to Fitchburg was used to access the ice at Walden Pond. Ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally awkward to transport. By the 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across the North American continent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

In the view of thermal <b>insulating</b> properties the natural <b>insulating</b> material show slightly different behavior in comparison with synthetic <b>insulating</b> materials which is caused by fibrous structure of <b>insulating</b> materials and low thermal conductivity of natural fibres (contrary to glass or mineral fibres).

5|$|At these lower prices, ice {{began to}} sell in {{considerable}} volumes, with the market moving beyond the wealthy elite to {{a wider range of}} consumers, to the point where supplies became overstretched. It was also being used by tradesmen to preserve perishable good, rather than for direct consumption. Tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to Maine and even to harvesting from passing icebergs, but neither source proved practical. Instead, Tudor teamed up with Nathaniel Wyeth to exploit the ice supplies of Boston on a more industrial scale. Wyeth devised a new form of horse-pulled ice-cutter in 1825 that cut square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods. He agreed to supply Tudor from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the cost of harvesting ice from 30 cents ($7.30) a ton (901kg) to only 10 cents ($2.40). Sawdust to <b>insulate</b> the ice was brought from Maine, at $16,000 ($390,000) a year.|$|E
5|$|The New York Giants, an American {{football}} team which {{plays in the}} National Football League (NFL), have had a long, and at times turbulent financial history. The Giants were founded in 1925 by businessman and bookmaker Tim Mara with an investment of 500 US$, {{and became one of}} the first teams in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara passed ownership of the team on to his sons Wellington and Jack after the 1929 Stock Market Crash to <b>insulate</b> the team from creditors. At first the Mara sons owned the team in name only, but they took increasingly larger roles in the organization beginning in the mid-1930s. Tim Mara remained involved in the team's operations until his death in 1959, when his sons assumed full control of the club. After Jack's passing in 1965, his son, Tim, took over his share of the team.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the failure potential of <b>insulated</b> packaging to heat outside, a so-called evaluation boundary for <b>insulating</b> packages was proposed for designing and estimating <b>insulating</b> packages {{based on the}} heat transfer law between the environment and a packaged product through packaging.

Finally, a new design method of <b>insulating</b> packages based on the boundary was proposed and an application example was performed as a demonstration. The {{results indicated that the}} three evaluation parameters (which are thermal load, adsorption ability of phase change material (PCM) and system thermal resistance of <b>insulating</b> packages) are the key parameters for designing <b>insulating</b> package and that the performance of <b>insulating</b> packages is only determined by the thermal load.

5|$|To <b>insulate</b> {{the sacred}} {{power in the}} {{sanctuary}} from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels near {{the back of the}} temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes.

5|$|During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, {{which helps}} to <b>insulate</b> {{them during the}} winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have {{different}} coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent {{in the winter and}} a more reddish, darker coat in the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat {{and the rest of the}} body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim.

The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise <b>insulate</b> the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E
