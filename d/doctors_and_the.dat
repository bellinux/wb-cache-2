The Rockets were granted the exception, and used approximately $5.7million on free agent Trevor Ariza. After weeks of consulting, it was decided that Yao would undergo surgery in order to repair the broken bone in his left foot. He did not play the entire 2009–10 season.|$|E

25|$|Kenny's {{success was}} controversial; many Australian <b>doctors</b> (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> British Medical Association) {{questioned}} her results and methodology.

Kenny replied publicly, fiercely taking Cilento to task for his criticisms (unusual from a self-taught bush nurse at that time in Australia). This response caused a contentious relationship among Kenny, Cilento, the BMA and the Australian Medical Association (AMA).|$|E

25|$|According to Danish {{physician}} and historian Kirsten Lylloff, these deaths were partially due to denial {{of medical care}} by Danish medical staff, as both the Danish Association of <b>Doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Danish Red Cross began refusing medical treatment to German refugees, starting in March 1945. The last refugees left Denmark on 15 February 1949. In the Treaty of London, signed 26 February 1953, West Germany and Denmark agreed on compensation payments of 160 million Danish crowns for its extended care of the refugees, which West Germany paid between 1953 and 1958.|$|E

25|$|Bellbird, Number 96 and The Box, {{which had}} been {{experiencing}} declining ratings, were cancelled in 1977. Various attempts to revamp each of the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful. The Young <b>Doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Sullivans continued to be popular. November 1977 saw the launch of successful soap opera/police procedural series Cop Shop (1977–1984) produced by Crawford Productions for Channel Seven. In early December 1977 Channel Ten debuted the Reg Grundy Organisation produced The Restless Years (1977–1981), a more standard soap drama focusing on several young school leavers.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{comprehension}} {{and production of}} these few words demonstrated that she distinguished speech from other environmental sounds and could hear individual phonemes when listening to people talking, two critical early components of language acquisition. Nonetheless, based on their observations both Children's Hospital <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> linguists who later worked with her concluded {{that she had not}} acquired a first language during childhood. Due to the lack of physical or mental explanations for her lack of speech, Kent and Hansen attributed it to the extreme isolation of her childhood. Kent came away from his first encounters with Genie extremely pessimistic about her prognosis on all fronts.|$|E
25|$|While in Iași, Rainer {{joined the}} left-wing {{literary}} circle formed around Viața Românească magazine, {{for which he}} contributed notes on medical science. He befriended the group's doyen, Garabet Ibrăileanu, whom he treated for his lung problems. Rainer persuaded Ibrăileanu, who was Marta's cousin, to hold courses in Romanian language and literature two evenings a week for medical students. His intention was to develop cultured <b>doctors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> students heard lectures by Mihail Sadoveanu, George Topîrceanu and Titu Maiorescu. He also took them for nature excursions so they could observe biological phenomena outside the laboratory. Rainer himself traveled extensively after 1914: among his earliest trips was a working visit to Odón de Buen's oceanographic institute in Palma de Mallorca.|$|E

25|$|In 1938 Misha’s {{father was}} sent on an {{extended}} {{mission to the}} Far East, where he went with his whole family. They lived on the In Station in Birakan and Birobidzhan. At the beginning of 1941 the Brusilovsky family returned to Kiev, and the war broke out that June. Misha and his brother Seva {{were sent to the}} town of Troitsk in the South Urals to their aunt Raya, their father's sister. Their father went to the front, and their mother stayed in Kiev and joined them later. In 1943, their aunt Raya, a general practitioner and surgeon, was mobilised, and Misha went with her on a medical train. On the medical train he helped the <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> injured, and when it would stop for long periods he would go to the nearest villages to exchange salt for groceries for them.|$|E

Ronaldo was forced to pay for the remaining period on his contract which tied him to Real Madrid, only because the latter did not agree to release him, while Milan were not ready to pay such a sum. On 25 January, Ronaldo flew from Madrid to Milan to watch the team play in a cup tie against Roma. Statements on the club's website said that Ronaldo was in Milan for a medical, and that a meeting had been arranged for Monday with Real Madrid officials to discuss and finalize his transfer to the Milanese club. On 26 January, Ronaldo successfully completed his medical tests at the Milanello training complex under the supervision of club <b>doctors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> transfer completed on 30 January and got the squad number 99. He made his debut as a substitute on 11 February 2007, during the 2–1 victory over Livorno. The next game at Siena, on 17 February, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted on a third goal in his first start for Milan, as they won 4–3.

500|$|With {{the coming}} of the deadly Spanish flu {{pandemic}} in 1918, aspirin—by whatever name—secured {{a reputation as one of}} the most powerful and effective drugs in the pharmacopeia of the time. Its fever-reducing properties gave many sick patients enough strength to fight through the infection, and aspirin companies large and small earned the loyalty of <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public—when they could manufacture or purchase enough aspirin to meet demand. Despite this, some people believed that Germans put the Spanish flu bug in Bayer aspirin, causing the pandemic as a war tactic.|$|E
500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{attribute the}} series' popularity to the altruism of its <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> emphasis on seeking to build peaceful relations between different species. John Clute wrote that [...] "in {{the depiction of}} goodness may lie the real genius of James White." [...] White's hatred of war and xenophobia is a constant theme of the series, notably in: Star Surgeon, where the Monitor Corps fights a savage battle in defence of the hospital space station, to prevent the conflict from escalating into a full interstellar war that can only end in genocide; and in The Genocidal Healer, where an alien race's sexual urges are almost eliminated by a plague and can only be stimulated by hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
500|$|During one protest, {{a police}} constable named Subhash Tomar {{collapsed}} and later died in hospital.

Some experts state that his chest injuries may have been a side effect of the administration of CPR. The Delhi Police arrested 8 young men and charged them with Tomar's murder and rioting at India Gate. Later in March 2013, the police admitted in the High Court they had no evidence against the eight and gave them a clean chit. [...] The youths said the move by the commissioner of police to charge them with murder had been [...] "irresponsible".|$|E
