5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and <b>elastin</b> are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or <b>elastin</b> genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
25|$|At small strains, <b>elastin</b> confers {{stiffness}} to {{the tissue}} and stores {{most of the}} strain energy. The collagen fibers are comparatively inextensible and are usually loose (wavy, crimped). With increasing tissue deformation the collagen is gradually stretched {{in the direction of}} deformation. When taut, these fibers produce a strong growth in tissue stiffness. The composite behavior is analogous to a nylon stocking, whose rubber band does the role of <b>elastin</b> as the nylon does the role of collagen. In soft tissues the collagen limits the deformation and protects the tissues from injury.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{not always}} clear why an intimal tear may occur, quite often it {{involves}} degeneration of the collagen and <b>elastin</b> that make up the media. This is known as cystic medial necrosis and is most commonly associated with Marfan syndrome and is also associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} substances {{inside the}} extracellular matrix {{of this kind}} of tissue are the collagen, <b>elastin</b> and ground substance. Normally the soft tissue is very hydrated because of the ground substance. The fibroblasts are the most common cell responsible for the production of soft tissues' fibers and ground substance. Variations of fibroblasts, like chondroblasts, may also produce these substances.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of arterial manifestations of BD bears many pitfalls, since the obliterative endarteritis of vasa vasorum causes thickening of the medial layer and splitting of <b>elastin</b> fibers. Therefore, anastomotic pseudoaneurysms {{are likely to}} form, as well as pseudoaneurysms {{at the site of}} puncture in case of angiography or endovascular treatment; furthermore, early graft occlusion may occur.|$|E
25|$|Menkes {{patients}} exhibit severe neurological abnormalities, apparently due to {{the lack}} of several copper-dependent enzymes required for brain development, including reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity. The brittle, kinky hypopigmented hair of steely appearance is due to a deficiency in an unidentified cuproenzyme. Reduced lysyl oxidase activity results in defective collagen and <b>elastin</b> polymerization and corresponding connective-tissue abnormalities including aortic aneurisms, loose skin, and fragile bones.|$|E
25|$|The {{subcutaneous}} tissue (also hypodermis and subcutis) {{is not part}} of the skin, and lies below the dermis of the cutis. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue, adipose tissue and <b>elastin.</b> The main cell types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes ({{subcutaneous tissue}} contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.|$|E
25|$|S. schenckii {{breaks down}} {{proteins}} by producing two separate proteases, a serine protease and an aspartic protease. These proteases {{appear to be}} essential for fungal growth. However, they have some functional overlap as the inactivation of either protein does not affect growth but inactivation of both inhibits the fungus. Protease activity {{has been shown to}} be important in in vivo infection of mice. Substrates for these proteases include the skin proteins type-I collagen, stratum corneum, and <b>elastin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{proteins}} {{are either}} {{soluble in water}} (sarcoplasmic proteins, about 11.5 percent of total muscle mass) or in concentrated salt solutions (myofibrillar proteins, about 5.5 percent of mass). There are several hundred sarcoplasmic proteins. Most of them – the glycolytic enzymes – {{are involved in the}} glycolytic pathway, i.e., the conversion of stored energy into muscle power. The two most abundant myofibrillar proteins, myosin and actin, are responsible for the muscle's overall structure. The remaining protein mass consists of connective tissue (collagen and <b>elastin)</b> as well as organelle tissue.|$|E
25|$|Hirano et al. {{previously}} {{found that}} the newborns {{did not have a}} true lamina propria, but instead had cellular regions called maculae flavae, located at the anterior and posterior ends of the loose vocal fold tissue. Boseley and Hartnick examined at the development and maturation of pediatric human vocal fold lamina propria. Hartnick {{was the first one to}} define each layer by a change in their cellular concentration. He also {{found that the}} lamina propria monolayer at birth and shortly thereafter was hypercellular, thus confirming Hirano’s observations. By 2 months of age, the vocal fold started differentiating into a bilaminar structure of distinct cellular concentration, with the superficial layer being less densely populated than the deeper layer. By 11 months, a three-layered structure starts to be noted in some specimens, again with different cellular population densities. The superficial layer is still hypocellular, followed by an intermediate more hypercellular layer, and a deeper hypercellular layer, just above the vocalis muscle. Even though the VF seem to start organizing, this is not representative of the trilaminar structure seen in adult tissues, where the layer are defined by their differential <b>elastin</b> and collagen fiber compositions. By 7 years of age, all specimens show a three-layered vocal fold structure, based on cellular population densities. At this point, the superficial layer was still hypocellular, the middle layer was the hypercellualr one, with also a greater content of <b>elastin</b> and collagen fibers, and the deeper layer was less cellularly populated. Again, the distinction seen between the layers at this stage is not comparable to that seen in the adult tissue. The maturation of the VF did not appear before 13 years of age, where the layers could be defined by their differential fiber composition rather than by their differential cellular population. The pattern now show a hypocellular superficial layer, followed by a middle layer composed predominantly of <b>elastin</b> fiber, and a deeper layer composed predominantly of collagen fibers. This pattern can be seen in older specimens up to 17 years of age, and above. While this study offers a nice way to see the evolution from immature to mature VF, it still does not explain what is the mechanism behind it.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the muscle}} {{proteins}} denature in varying degree, {{with the exception}} of the collagen and <b>elastin</b> of connective tissue, and rigor mortis resolves. Because of these changes, the meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor. As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning. Hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.|$|E
25|$|The skin envelope. The breast skin is {{in three}} (3) layers: (i) the {{epidermis}}, (ii) the dermis, and (iii) the hypodermis. The epidermis is 50–100µm thick, and {{is composed of}} a stratum corneum of flat keratin cells, that is 10–20µm thick; it protects the underlying viable epidermis, which is composed of keratinizing epithelial cells. The dermis is mostly collagen and <b>elastin</b> ﬁbers embedded to a viscous water and glycoprotein medium. The fibers of the upper dermis (“papillary dermis”) are thinner than the fibers of the deep dermis, thus the skin envelope is 1–3mm thick. The thickness of the hypodermis (adipocyte cells) varies from woman to woman, and body part.|$|E
25|$|MiR-712 targets tissue {{inhibitor}} of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3). TIMPs normally regulate {{activity of}} matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM). Arterial ECM is mainly composed of collagen and <b>elastin</b> fibers, providing the structural support and recoil properties of arteries. These fibers {{play a critical}} role in regulation of vascular inflammation and permeability, which are important in the development of atherosclerosis. Expressed by endothelial cells, TIMP3 is the only ECM-bound TIMP. A decrease in TIMP3 expression results in an increase of ECM degradation in the presence of d-flow. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of pre-miR712 increases expression of TIMP3 in cells, even when exposed to turbulent flow.|$|E
25|$|Chambers {{isolated}} by {{filters are}} proper tools for accurate determination of chemotactic behavior. The pioneer type of these chambers was constructed by Boyden. The motile cells are placed {{into the upper}} chamber, while fluid containing the test substance is filled into the lower one. The size of the motile cells to be investigated determines the pore size of the filter; {{it is essential to}} choose a diameter which allows active transmigration. For modelling in vivo conditions, several protocols prefer coverage of filter with molecules of extracellular matrix (collagen, <b>elastin</b> etc.) Efficiency of the measurements was increased by development of multiwell chambers (e.g. NeuroProbe), where 24, 96, 384 samples are evaluated in parallel. Advantage of this variant is that several parallels are assayed in identical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Although silicon {{is readily}} {{available}} {{in the form of}} silicates, very few organisms use it directly. Diatoms, radiolaria and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material for skeletons. In more advanced plants, the silica phytoliths (opal phytoliths) are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell; some plants, for example rice, need silicon for their growth. There is some evidence that silicon is important to nail, hair, bone and skin health in humans, for example in studies that show that premenopausal women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density, and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis. Silicon is needed for synthesis of <b>elastin</b> and collagen, of which the aorta contains the greatest quantity in the human body.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{degradation}} of the tunica media {{by means of a}} proteolytic process seems to be the basic pathophysiologic mechanism of AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases in individuals with AAA. This leads to elimination of <b>elastin</b> from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of blood pressure. Other reports have suggested the serine protease granzyme B may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of decorin, leading to disrupted collagen organization and reduced tensile strength of the adventitia. There is also a reduced amount of vasa vasorum in the abdominal aorta (compared to the thoracic aorta); consequently, the tunica media must rely mostly on diffusion for nutrition, which makes it more susceptible to damage.|$|E
25|$|The skin envelope. The breast skin is {{in three}} (3) layers: (i) the {{epidermis}}, (ii) the dermis, and (iii) the hypodermis. The epidermis is 50–100µm thick, and {{is composed of}} a stratum corneum of flat keratin cells, that is 10–20µm thick; it protects the underlying viable epidermis, which is composed of keratinizing epithelial cells. The dermis is mostly collagen and <b>elastin</b> ﬁbers embedded to a viscous water and glycoprotein medium. The fibers of the upper dermis ("papillary dermis") are thinner than the fibers of the deep dermis, thus the skin envelope is 1–3mm thick. The thickness of the hypodermis (adipocyte cells) varies from woman to woman, and body part. The skin of the nipple and areola is further composed of a modified and specialized myoepthelium {{that is responsible for}} contraction in response to stimuli.|$|E
25|$|If {{the muscular}} wall {{enlargement}} is overdone over time, then a gross {{enlargement of the}} artery results, usually over decades of living. This is a less common outcome. Atheroma within aneurysmal enlargement (vessel bulging) can also rupture and shower debris of atheroma and clot downstream. If the arterial enlargement continues to 2 to 3 times the usual diameter, the walls often become weak enough that with just {{the stress of the}} pulse, a loss of wall integrity may occur leading to sudden hemorrhage (bleeding), major symptoms and debility; often rapid death. The main stimulus for aneurysm formation is pressure atrophy of the structural support of the muscle layers. The main structural proteins are collagen and <b>elastin.</b> This causes thinning and the wall balloons allowing gross enlargement to occur, as is common in the abdominal region of the aorta.|$|E
25|$|The {{breasts are}} apocrine glands that produce milk for the feeding of infant children; each breast has a nipple within an areola (nipple-areola complex, NAC), the skin color of which varies from pink to dark brown, and has sebaceous glands. Within the mammary gland, the lactiferous ducts produce breast milk, and are {{distributed}} throughout the breast, with two-thirds of the tissue within 30mm of {{the base of the}} nipple. In each breast, 4–18 lactiferous ducts drain to the nipple; the glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in lactating women, and to 1:1 in non-lactating women; besides milk glands, the breast is composed of connective tissue (collagen, <b>elastin),</b> adipose tissue (white fat), and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. The peripheral nervous system innervation of the breast is by the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the fourth, fifth, and sixth intercostal nerves, while the thoracic spinal nerve 4 (T4) innervating the dermatomic area supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
25|$|Atherogenesis is the {{developmental}} process of atheromatous plaques. It {{is characterized by}} a remodeling of arteries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed {{over a period of several}} years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the arterial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the artery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arterial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and <b>elastin.</b> At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself.|$|E
25|$|The breast is an {{apocrine gland}} that {{produces}} the milk used to feed an infant. The nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout {{the body of the}} breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (collagen, <b>elastin),</b> white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal nerves. The T-4 nerve (Thoracic spinal nerve 4), which innervates the dermatomic area, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
500|$|The endocervical mucosa {{is about}} [...] thick, lined {{with a single}} layer of {{columnar}} mucous cells, and contains numerous tubular mucous glands which empty viscous alkaline mucus into the lumen. In contrast, the ectocervix is covered with nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which resembles the squamous epithelium lining the vaginal. The junction between {{these two types of}} epithelia is called the squamocolumnar junction. [...] Underlying both types of epithelium is a tough layer of collagen. The mucosa of the endocervix is not shed during menstruation. [...] The cervix has more fibrous tissue, including collagen and <b>elastin,</b> {{than the rest of the}} uterus.|$|E
2500|$|Copper Deficiency. A {{minority}} of aneurysms {{are caused by}} copper deficiency, which results in a decreased activity of the lysyl oxidase enzyme, affecting <b>elastin,</b> a key component in vessel walls Copper deficiency results in vessel wall thinning, and thus has been noted {{as a cause of}} death in copper-deficient humans, chickens and turkeys ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{next three}} layers {{comprise}} lamina LPs, which is stratified by their histological composition of <b>elastin</b> and collagen fibers, with fibroblast, myofibroblast and macrophages interspersed sparsely. The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this cover layer to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, proteoglycan like fibromodulin, decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The intermediate layer of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer <b>elastin</b> and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as <b>elastin</b> and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. <b>Elastin</b> fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The normal strain level of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging. Each vocal ligament is a band of yellow elastic tissue attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage.|$|E
2500|$|The MMP-3 enzyme degrades {{collagen}} types II, III, IV, IX, and X, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, and [...] <b>elastin.</b> In addition, MMP-3 {{can also}} activate other MMPs such as MMP-1, MMP-7, and MMP-9, rendering MMP-3 crucial in connective tissue remodeling. The enzyme is also {{thought to be}} involved in wound repair, progression of atherosclerosis, and tumor initiation.|$|E
2500|$|Cortisol stimulates many copper enzymes (often to 50% {{of their}} total potential), {{probably}} to increase copper availability for immune purposes. This includes lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that cross-links collagen, and <b>elastin.</b> [...] Especially valuable for immune response is cortisol's stimulation of the superoxide dismutase, since this copper enzyme is almost certainly used by the body to permit superoxides to poison bacteria.|$|E

[...] Fish, shark, and snakes are all examples of animals that locomote using undulatory locomotion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix of the VF LP {{is composed of}} fibrous proteins such as collagen and <b>elastin,</b> and interstitial molecules such as HA, a non-sulfated [...] glycosaminoglycan. While the SLP is rather poor in elastic and collagenous fibers, the ILP and DLP are mostly composed of it, with the concentration of elastic fibers decreasing and the concentration of collagenous fibers increasing as the vocalis muscle is approached. Fibrous proteins and interstitial molecules play different roles within the ECM. While collagen (mostly type I) provides strength and structural support to the tissue, which are useful to withstanding stress and resisting deformation when subjected to a force, <b>elastin</b> fibers bring elasticity to the tissue, allowing it to return to its original shape after deformation. Interstitial proteins, such as HA, plays important biological and mechanical roles in the VF tissue. In the VF tissue, HA plays a role of shear-thinner, affecting the tissue viscosity, space-filler, shock absorber, as well as wound healing and cell migration promoter. The distribution of those proteins and interstitial molecules has been proven {{to be affected by}} both age and gender, and is maintained by the fibroblasts.|$|E

Of the muscles that insert themselves into the mesh scaffolding, larger muscles anchor the skin to the bone and control the membrane tension and camber of the bat wing during flight, whereas smaller muscles, which originate from within the mesh scaffolding, attach to collagen fibers within the fiber network and modulate bone loading and allow for precise control of wing shape and tension.|$|E
2500|$|Hemodynamics {{affect the}} {{development}} of AAA, which has a [...] for the [...] aorta. The histological structure and mechanical characteristics of the infrarenal aorta {{differ from those of}} the thoracic aorta. The diameter decreases from the root to the aortic bifurcation, and the wall of the infrarenal aorta also contains a lesser proportion of <b>elastin.</b> The mechanical tension in the abdominal aortic wall is therefore higher than in the thoracic aortic wall.

Higher intraluminal pressure in patients with arterial hypertension markedly contributes to the progression of the pathological process.
