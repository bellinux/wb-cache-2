I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F.

It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E

2500|$|Rolfe was an {{enthusiastic}} letter writer. [...] John Holden recalled that [...] "Corvo {{was one of}} those men who never speak a word if they can write it. We lived in the same house, a very little one, yet he would always communicate with me by note if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the same room with him. He had dozens of letter books. He seized upon every opportunity for writing a letter, and every letter, whether to a publisher or to a cobbler, was written with the same care." [...] About a thousand of his letters have survived, and several sequences of them have been published in limited editions. [...] The letters reveal a lively, intelligent and absorbent mind, but because of Rolfe’s paranoiac tendencies they are often disputatious and recriminatory. [...] Among the commentators who rated Rolfe’s letters more highly than his fiction was W H Auden, who wrote that Rolfe [...] "had every right to be proud of his verbal claws … A large vocabulary is essential to the invective style, and Rolfe by study and constant practice became one of the great masters of vituperation."

Gregory <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> any way denying the universal jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome. John Norman Davidson Kelly wrote that Gregory I, [...] "was indefatigable ... in upholding the Roman primacy, and successfully maintained Rome's appellate jurisdiction in the east. ...

While every bishop is a subject of the , in 1998, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith explained, that [...] "In the case of the Bishop of Rome - Vicar of Christ in the way proper to Peter as Head of the College of Bishops - the [...] acquires particular force because it is combined with the full and supreme power in the Church: a truly episcopal power, not only supreme, full and universal, but also immediate, over all pastors and other faithful." [...] Gregory I himself, though he asserted the reality of the primacy of the bishop of his apostolic see, the bishop who carried on the work entrusted to Peter, rejected use of the title [...] "universal bishop", which he called [...] "profane".|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Steve Hewitt {{and the rest}} of the band had become tense during the recording of Meds and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that [...] "Being in a band is very much like being in a marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. To say that you don't love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you've been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from your relationship and that you can no longer live under the same roof, so to speak". Olsdal commented [...] "We couldn't go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn't have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. It all went wrong during the Meds tour. [...] There was no communication between us. Brian and I are one, but at some point we even didn't talk to each other anymore. We realised Placebo was dying. To be able to go on, things had to change." [...] According to Hewitt, [...] "Alex Weston, our manager, [...] called me in to the office and said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the band anymore. And that's it. I was thrown out". Hewitt claims that it was [...] "very hurtful" [...] and [...] "disappointing" [...] to have been ejected in this way after being in the band for over a decade. Early in 2008 Hewitt founded the band Love Amongst Ruin, switching to guitar and singing lead vocals. In August 2012 he became the drummer of the reformed Six by Seven.|$|E
