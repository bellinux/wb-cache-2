50|$|USS Klondike (AD-22) {{was one of}} four {{destroyer}} tenders {{built at}} the tail end of World War II for the United States Navy. The lead ship in her class, she was named for the Klondike River in the Yukon Territory, Canada, which was the scene of the gold rush of 1897. The Klondike class destroyer tenders were a Navy adaptation of the Maritime Commissions C3 <b>fast</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> design.|$|E
50|$|Outrigger type pentamarans may be {{likened to}} an evolved trimaran, {{with a long}} and narrow central hull at least 50 metres long, though none with this {{configuration}} have ever been built, and two pairs of outriggers - one pair aft, one pair amidships - {{as opposed to the}} trimaran's single pair. Going with the current trend of fast conventional hulls in naval shipbuilding, the pentamaran is based upon a narrow but long hull, that is deeper than it is wide, so that it cuts through waves. The outriggers then provide the stability such a narrow hull needs. While the aft sponsons act as trimaran sponsons do, the front sponsons do not touch the water normally; only if the ship edges to one side they do, in which case the sponsons will slow the ship and level it up until the ship is stable again. BMT Group, a shipbuilding and engineering company located in the United Kingdom, has proposals for a <b>fast</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> and a yacht using this kind of hull.|$|E
50|$|For the {{remainder}} of her service, Beltrami operated out of Earle, New Jersey, and Norfolk, primarily servicing ports and installations in the West Indies. Her most common duty was the shuttling of passengers and cargo between Guantánamo Bay, Roosevelt Roads, and Trinidad. Made obsolete by larger and <b>faster</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships,</b> Beltrami sailed from Norfolk to Charleston, South Carolina, in late July 1955, arriving at the navy yard there on the 29th.|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} the potentialof Short Sea Shipping (SSS) in Europe, {{with a focus on}} four corridors, {{consists}} of four parts. In the first part (Chapter I) the existing intra-European SSS-traffic is identified and analyzed for each relevant category of goods and transport corridor. In the second part (Chapter II), a new methodology is proposed for the strategie analysis of the competitive position of SSS vis-à-vis transport altematives. This methodology is applied to ten case studies with substantial policy relevanee within the corridors under consideration. The third part (Chapter III provides an analysis of the potential offour 'innovative' types of SSS-vessels, namely <b>fast</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships,</b> sea-river ships, selfunloading bulk carriers and selfunloading and -loading unitload ships. Finally, in the fourth part (Chapter IV), ten major policy recommendations are formulated to guide EU-policies in the area of SSS. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
25|$|Media and {{her sister}} ship Parthia were the first ships built for Cunard after the {{conclusion}} of World War II, and were built for transatlantic service between Liverpool and New York City. Medias maiden voyage began on 20 August 1947 from Liverpool. She received a major refit in 1953, part {{of which was the}} introduction of stabilisers; Media was the first ship on the transatlantic route so equipped. She continued on the transatlantic trade through the late 1950s, by which time competition from jet aircraft had cut into her passenger trade, and newer, <b>faster</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> had done the same to her cargo trade.|$|R
50|$|The Algol-class vehicle <b>cargo</b> <b>ships,</b> {{also known}} as Fast Sealift Ships (FSS) or SL-7s, are {{currently}} the <b>fastest</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> in the world, capable of speeds in excess of 33 kn. Originally built in 1972 and 1973 as high-speed container ships known as SL-7s for Sea-Land Services, Inc., the ships high operating costs limited their profitability. All eight ships were acquired by the US Navy in 1981 and 1982, with the last ship converted, recommissioned and delivered to Military Sealift Command in 1986. The conversion entailed the installation of four cranes, addition of roll on/roll off capability and a redesign of the cargo hold to better facilitate storage of vehicles. Due largely to their high cost of operation, all fast sealift ships are kept in Reduced Operating Status, but can be activated and ready to sail in 96 hours. All ships are named after bright stars in the night sky.|$|R
5000|$|After sea-trials {{and a brief}} {{delivery}} sailing with Union-Castle {{office staff}} acting as passengers, Windsor Castles commercial maiden voyage was from Southampton to Durban on 18 August 1960. Joining a long established pattern followed by the companys ships engaged in the Cape mail service, the vessel sailed regularly to South Africa, via Madeira (occasionally), to Las Palmas, then Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and finally Durban, returning to Southampton by the same route. In 1965 the long planned acceleration of the mail service took place, with the Southampton-Cape Town voyage being reduced from 13 days to 11 days. The three remaining pre-war motor ships were unable to maintain the new schedule and were replaced by two <b>fast</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships.</b> Windsor Castle was now required (like her fleetmates) to sail at her designed 22 knots and the time honoured Thursday at 4 oclock departure became Friday at 1 oclock ...|$|R

50|$|During World War II, Stirling Castle {{was used}} as a troopship, coming through the war unscathed after {{steaming}} some 505,000 miles and carrying 128,000 personnel. She was released from government service in 1946 and was refitted by her builders, returning to passenger service in 1947. In 1946, she sailed before being refitted from Southampton on 31 August for Australia arriving at Fremantle on 28 September. The mail service was accelerated in 1965 and Stirling Castle and her sisters had insufficient speed to maintain the new schedule. They were replaced by two new <b>fast</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> (the new schedule required only seven ships rather than eight) and Stirling Castle was withdrawn from service upon arrival at Southampton on 30 November 1965. A proposed sale to Taiwan breakers (where her sister had gone two months earlier) fell through and she was instead sold for scrapping in Japan. She left Southampton on 1 February 1966 for Mihara where she arrived on 3 March 1966 to be broken up by Nichimen Co.|$|R
5000|$|As Comdr. Cooley later reported, Almaack, [...] "being {{light and}} big, {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} position in the convoy at speeds less than 7.5 kn." [...] The heavy weather wrought havoc on the abilities of the ships to stay in formation, and Almaack found herself on her own on three occasions, each time managing to rejoin the convoy. Upon rejoining for the third time, Comdr. Cooley informed the escort commander [...] "what speed he would make and what positions he would pass through if separated again." [...] When this came to pass, and the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> was again on her own, Almaack proceeded independently to New York without incident. Reflecting back on the voyage, on 6 December 1941, Almaack's commanding officer opined that his ship {{would have been far}} safer [...] "steaming alone [...] [...] [...] than in any convoy that does not maintain a speed of at least 10 kn." [...] He also used that occasion to press for his ship to be armed with at least two 4-inch or 5 in guns. In endorsing Comdr. Cooley's report on 19 December, Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander in Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet, agreed to recommend independent routing for <b>fast</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> such as Almaack unless [...] "available information indicates undue danger from submarine concentration [...] [...] [...] [...]" ...|$|R
50|$|The ISTDC staff went {{everywhere}} seeking {{material and}} devices and running experiments {{to discover how}} sea assaults could proceed. For ships with sufficient speed to become Landing Ships Infantry, the best available was a class of four <b>fast</b> passenger-carrying <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> (referred to as “cargo-liners”) then under construction for Alfred Holt’s Glen Line Far Eastern trade: the Glengyle, Glenearn, Glenroy, and Breconshire. This class could make eighteen knots, be equipped with suitable davits for hoisting out landing craft, and each be adapted to carry a complete battalion, plus some vehicles. They were duly earmarked for commandeering {{in the event of}} war.|$|R
5|$|Typically, ice traders hired {{vessels to}} ship ice as freight, {{although}} Frederic Tudor initially purchased his own vessel and the Tudor Company later bought three <b>fast</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> {{of its own}} in 1877. Ice was first transported in ships {{at the end of}} the 18th century, when it was occasionally used as ballast. Shipping ice as ballast, however, required it to be cleanly cut in order to avoid it shifting around as it melted, which was not easily done until Wyeth's invention of the ice-cutter in 1825. The uniform blocks that Wyeth's process produced also made it possible to pack more ice into the limited space of a ship's hold, and significantly reduced the losses from melting. The ice was typically packed up tightly with sawdust, and the hold was then closed to prevent warmer air entering; other forms of protective dunnage used to protect ice included hay and pine tree cuttings. This requirement for large quantities of sawdust coincided with the growth in the New England lumber industry in the 1830s; sawdust had no other use at the time, and was in fact considered something of a problem, so its use in the ice trade proved very useful to the local timber industry.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, MARCOM {{distributed}} tentative {{designs for}} criticism by shipbuilders, ship owners, and naval architects. The final designs incorporated many changes suggested by these constituencies. The ships {{were to be}} reasonably <b>fast</b> but economical <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> which, with some government subsidies to operators, could compete with vessels of other nations. Building costs were to be minimized by standardization of design and equipment, and the ships were to have sufficient speed and stability {{that they could be}} used as naval auxiliaries in time of national emergency.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the term [...] "Clipper" [...] in the race name comes from the {{historic}} tea clippers. In the 1830s tea clippers were small, <b>fast,</b> <b>cargo</b> carrying sailing <b>ships.</b> Premium prices were paid for the season's first consignment of tea from China to reach London. In the Great Tea Race of 1866, four such ships held an unofficial race, and this inspired {{the name of the}} modern day race. The eight Clipper 60 yachts were initially named after tea clippers including Ariel, Blackadder, Taeping and Thermopylae.|$|R
50|$|John Jock Willis {{operated}} a shipping line which specialised in <b>fast</b> sailing <b>cargo</b> <b>ships,</b> including tea clippers trading tea from China. These were 'state of the art' ships {{designed to take}} part in what had become a race to be the fastest ship home with the new season tea. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 together with steady improvements in steam engineering meant that sailing ships were slowly being replaced by steam ships, which could operate on guaranteed timetables and make use of the shorter route through the canal, which was unsuitable for sailing ships. However, steamers had the disadvantage of having to purchase coal for the journey and to carry coal, reducing the space available for cargo. A number of ship owners therefore still believed there was a place for good sailing ships, and these continued in profitable service for many years.|$|R
50|$|As a flag officer, Clarey {{deployed}} {{twice to}} the Persian Gulf {{during the first}} Gulf War. He commanded the U.S. Maritime Prepositioning Force during Desert Shield and secured the arrival in Saudi Arabian ports of the first thirty prepositioned and <b>fast</b> sealift commercial <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> and the link-up of their combat equipment with over 50,000 airlifted Marines and army troops. Deploying from the West Coast again in December 1990, he commanded the Pacific Fleet/5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade Amphibious Task Force of eighteen ships and over 7,000 Marines. In February 1991, during the largest amphibious operation of Desert Storm, those Marines landed administratively in northeast Saudi Arabia where they joined in the coalition ground campaign in the liberation of Kuwait.|$|R
50|$|The steam powered {{cargo liner}} {{developed}} in the mid-19th century with the advancement of technology allowing bigger steamships to be built. As cargo liners were generally <b>faster</b> than tramp <b>cargo</b> <b>ships,</b> they {{were used for the}} transport of perishable and high-value goods, as well as providing a passenger service. At first, they were mostly used in Europe and America as well as across the Atlantic Ocean between Europe and America. Longer routes, such as that to Oceania, mainly remained in the hands of sailing ships a little bit longer, due to the inefficiency of the steamship of the time, until the late-1860's when the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal put sailships to disadvantage.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Maritime Commission was multifold as {{described}} in the Merchant Marine Act's Declaration of Policy. The first role was to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and then have built over a ten-year period 900 modern <b>fast</b> merchant <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> which would replace the World War I-vintage vessels which made up the bulk of the U.S. Merchant Marine prior to the Act. Those ships were intended to be chartered (leased) to U.S. shipping companies for their use in the foreign seagoing trades for whom {{they would be able to}} offer better and more economical freight services to their clients. The ships were also intended to serve as a reserve naval auxiliary force in the event of armed conflict which was a duty the U.S. merchant fleet had often filled throughout the years since the Revolutionary War. The second role given to the Maritime Commission was to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act which would offset the differential cost between both building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag. Another function given to the Commission involved the formation of the U.S. Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship's officers to man the new fleet. The actual licensing of officers and seamen still resided with the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, PLAN begun to convert Qiongsha-class <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> to {{ambulance}} transport {{to meet the}} urgent maritime/naval medical needs. A pair of Qiongsha-class converted {{was not enough to}} meet the need, so some other <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carry passengers were selected to be converted to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) to supplement the converted Qiongsha-class. The reason <b>cargo</b> <b>ships</b> that can also carrying passengers were specifically selected is because neither the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> nor the passenger ship could meet the requirement for conversion: the <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> lacked the accommodation and comfort for crew and patient because it does not carry passengers, and passenger ship does not have the room needed to house the medical facilities and support equipment, so both types would require higher conversion cost because more work is needed for both types. In contrast, <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> that also carries passengers would cost less to convert to <b>cargo</b> <b>ship,</b> medical evacuation (APR) because it has what both <b>cargo</b> <b>ship</b> and passenger ship lack. As a result, Type Long March cargo-passenger ship was selected for conversion.|$|R
