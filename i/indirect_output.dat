40|$|South Africa is {{regarded}} as a leading developing country in terms of SEA practice. However, the lack of empirical research to evaluate and learn from this wealth of practical experience can be considered a major lost opportunity not only for South Africa but also for the development of our understanding of SEA in the developing world. This paper provides the research results of an effectiveness review of six high profile SEA case studies within the South African context. Measured against four key performance areas (KPAs) and nine key performance indicators (KPIs) the research results show a high degree of ineffectiveness across all six cases in terms of 'direct outputs'. The main areas of weakness were the inability to influence the contents of plans and programmes as well as decision making in general. It can thus be concluded that based on the 'poor' direct effectiveness results SEA is not achieving its objectives within the South African context. However, certain 'indirect outputs' also emerged such as highlighting deficiencies and gaps in existing policy as well as examples where SEA facilitated capacity building and raised awareness of sustainability issues. Moreover, SEAs also contributed significantly to information generation and sharing. The research results suggest that practitioners need to either redefine the purpose of SEA, or fundamentally rethink the way in which SEA is being applied within the South African context. The paper concludes by making proposals for future international research.

40|$|Abstract Data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) is {{an important}} analytical tool for estimating the technical efficiency of decision-making units. However, input allocative efficiency is less frequently investigated in the DEA framework because the measure of input allocative efficiency-derived as the ratio of cost efficiency to Farrell input technical efficiency-may be biased because of slack in the constraints that define the technology or because of differences in input prices paid by firms. We extend the DEA methodology by proposing a new measure of input allocative efficiency based on the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>output</b> quasi-distance functions.

The occurrence of dyskinesia {{has been associated}} with an altered balance between the direct and <b>indirect</b> striatal <b>output</b> pathways. Using in situ hybridisation histochemistry, we now compare the e¡ects of these drug treatments on striatal preproenkephalin-A (PPE-A) and adenosine A 2 a receptor mRNA expression as markers of the indirect pathway and striatal preprotachykinin (PPT) mRNA and preproenkephalin-B (PPE-B, prodynorphin) mRNA expression as markers of the direct pathway. The equivalent marked losses of speci¢c [3 H]mazindol binding in the striatum of all drug treatment groups con¢rmed the identical nature of the nigral cell loss produced by MPTP treatment. MPTP-induced destruction of the nigro-striatal pathway markedly increased the level of PPE-A mRNA in the caudate nucleus and putamen and decreased the levels of PPT and PPE-B mRNA relative to normal animals. Repeated treatment with L-DOPA for 30 days produced marked dyskinesia but had no e¡ect on the MPTP-induced increase in PPE-A mRNA in the caudate nucleus and putamen. In contrast, L-DOPA treatment normalised the MPTP-induced decrease in the level of PPT and PPE-B mRNA. Repeated treatment with ropinirole produced little or no dyskinesia but markedly reversed the MPTP-induced elevation in PPE-A mRNA in the caudate nucleus and putamen. However, it had no e¡ect on the decrease in PPT or PPE-B mRNA. Similarly, bromocriptine treatment which induced only mild dyskinesia attenuated the MPTP-induced elevation in PPE-A mRNA in the caudate nucleus and putamen with no e¡ect on reduced striatal PPT or PPE-B mRNA. Neither MPTP treatment nor treatment with L-DOPA, bromocriptine or ropinirole had any e¡ect on adenosine A 2 a receptor mRNA in the striatum.

This study analyzes some of the tradeoffs between upstream depletion of water for irrigation and downstream use of the water for production of aluminum, which depends on large blocks of inexpensive hydroelectric energy The economic value of two projected increments of irrigated crops in 1985 and the consequent losses of economic value from less aluminum output due to reduced hydroelectric generation are analyzed in a 1985 multiregional inputoutput model of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho The analysis also estimates direct and <b>indirect</b> changes in <b>output</b> and employment by industry, State, and for the region.

As a consequence, novel approaches to therapy are sought, and adenosine A 2 A receptors (A 2 AARs) provide a viable target. A 2 AARs are highly localized to the basal ganglia and specifically to the <b>indirect</b> <b>output</b> pathway, which is highly important in the control of voluntary movement. A 2 AAR antagonists can modulate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate release in basal ganglia and other key neurotransmitters that modulate motor activity. In both rodent and primate models of PD, A 2 AAR antagonists produce alterations in motor behavior, either alone or in combination with dopaminergic drugs, which suggest that they will be effective in the symptomatic treatment of PD. In clinical trials, the A 2 AAR antagonist istradefylline reduces “off” time in patients with PD receiving optimal dopaminergic therapy. However, these effects have proven difficult to demonstrate on a consistent basis, and further clinical trials are required to establish the clinical utility of this drug class. Based on preclinical studies, A 2 AAR antagonists may also be neuroprotective and have utility in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We are only now starting to explore the range of potential uses of A 2 AAR antagonists in central nervous system disorders, and their full utility is still to be uncovered...|$|E

Efficiency scores of inefficient units allows their ranking but efficient units cannot be ranked directly because of their maximum efficiency score. The paper presents the most popular ranking models (Andersen and Petersen model, Tone’s SBM model and cross efficiency evaluation) and discusses their advantages and drawbacks. All presented models are illustrated on an example with academic background - evaluation of academic departments that consumes several resources (academic staff and sum of salaries) and produces outputs as direct or <b>indirect</b> teaching, research <b>outputs,</b> etc. Computational aspects of all presented models are discussed...|$|R
