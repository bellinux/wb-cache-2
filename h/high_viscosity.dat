5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} years, jetting {{processes}} for <b>higher</b> <b>viscosity</b> materials have gained widespread interest in microelectronics manufacturing.

Especially the <b>higher</b> <b>viscosity</b> materials are of interest for the integration {{of a variety of}} heterogeneous components as needed for the assembly of System in Package. As knowledge on jetting behavior of these materials is not generally available, a study combining material analysis and process development has been conducted with the aim to demonstrate the limits of jet dispensing for <b>higher</b> <b>viscosity</b> materials. Summarized this paper gives a detailed insight into jet process develop for <b>higher</b> <b>viscosity</b> materials necessary for SiP assembly and describes process design rules and limitations and thus allows the optimized use of advanced jetting technology for micro electronics assembly...|$|R
30|$|Figure  15 {{demonstrates}} that each shale interacts differently with anionic polyacrylamide. The Chattanooga shale sample has the <b>highest</b> <b>viscosity</b> {{in a given}} polyacrylamide concentration, and the Pride Mountain sample has the lowest viscosity. Usually the sample with <b>highest</b> <b>viscosity</b> is considered to have strong interaction of the bulk fluid with the shale particles, but in this case, the viscosity decreases after adding the shale to the polyacrylamide, i.e., polyacrylamides without shale have <b>higher</b> <b>viscosity</b> values at a given polyacrylamide concentration. This was indicative that the polyacrylamides adsorbing onto the shale and leaving the solution are causing the decrease in the viscosity. Hence, Pride Mountain shale has stronger interactions with anionic polyacrylamide.|$|R
30|$|Rheology {{describes}} the deformation and flow behavior of materials. When flowing, molecules and particles {{are forced to}} slide along each other. They exhibit a flow resistance force caused by internal friction. Larger components of a liquid cause correspondingly <b>higher</b> <b>viscosity</b> values.

25|$|Oil {{may account}} for 75% {{or more of the}} total volume. This means that the oil {{droplets}} become distorted from their normal, spherical shape. The close packing of the droplets also allow them to interact very strongly with one another. A combination of these factors gives traditional mayonnaise its <b>high</b> <b>viscosity.</b> The viscoelasticity of mayonnaise made with egg yolk reaches a maximum very quickly after preparation.|$|E

25|$|In its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), it is {{a useful}} solvent for NMR spectroscopy, again due to its ability to {{dissolve}} {{a wide range of}} analytes, the simplicity of its own spectrum, and its suitability for high-temperature NMR spectroscopic studies. Disadvantages to the use of DMSO-d6 are its <b>high</b> <b>viscosity,</b> which broadens signals, and its hygroscopicity, which leads to an overwhelming H2O resonance in the 1H NMR spectrum.

25|$|Heavy oil and bitumen, {{which have}} far more carbon than hydrogen, are heavy, black, sticky and either slow-pouring or so close to being solid {{that they will not}} pour at all unless heated. Although the {{dividing}} line is fuzzy, the term heavy oil refers to slow-pouring heavy hydrocarbon mixtures. Bitumen refers to mixtures with the consistency of cold molasses that pour at room temperatures with agonizing slowness. Oils with <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> and heavy gravity do not float on water, but sink.|$|E
25|$|Static {{settling}} {{consists of}} leaving the must to let the debris settle: after pressing, the must is left to stand in a tank away from air. Suspended particles precipitate {{to the bottom of}} the tank. This is facilitated by the addition of pectolytic enzymes which are long chain carbons composed of pectic compounds. These pectins give a <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> to the juice, cut the suspended particles into shorter chains, and accelerate precipitation. Refrigeration of the wort is needed: if the fermentation starts, the release of bubbles of carbon dioxide would spread suspended particles throughout the wort preventing their deposition. After the wort is clarified it is decanted for fermenting.|$|E
30|$|A {{recent study}} {{has shown that}} NADESs {{physical}} properties can be tailored by adding water as a tertiary component. The authors showed that the strong hydrogen interactions within NADESs (accounting for their <b>high</b> <b>viscosities)</b> could be reduced upon addition of water (< 50  % v/v). In fact, the resulting viscosities {{were found to be}} as low as those of water and other common VOCs (Dai et al. 2015). Consequently, water-based NADESs may represent yet another alternative to DESs of <b>high</b> <b>viscosities,</b> poor conductivities and higher toxicities.|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of petroleum-derived diesel fuels, interest in vegetable oils as fuels for internal combustion engines was reported in several countries during the 1920s and 1930s and later during World War II. Belgium, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Japan and China were reported to have tested and used vegetable oils as diesel fuels during this time. Some operational problems were reported due to the <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> of vegetable oils compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which results in poor atomization of the fuel in the fuel spray and often leads to deposits and coking of the injectors, combustion chamber and valves. Attempts to overcome these problems included heating of the vegetable oil, blending it with petroleum-derived diesel fuel or ethanol, pyrolysis and cracking of the oils.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an {{electric}} mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E
25|$|Self-assembly of nanofibrous {{scaffolds}} is able {{to occur}} only when the fibers themselves are engineered for self-assembly. One common way to drive the self-assembly of scaffold fibers is to use amphiphilic peptides so that in water the hydrophobic moiety drives the self-assembly. Carefully calculated engineering of the amphiphilic peptides allows for precise control over the self-assembled matrix. Self-assembly {{is able to}} create both ordered and unordered topographies. Phillips et al. (2005) developed and tested in vitro and in vivo a self-aligned collagen-Schwann cell matrix, which allowed DRG neurite extension alignment in vitro. Collagen gels have been used extensively as substrates for three-dimensional tissue culture. Cells are able to form integrin-mediated attachments with collagen, which initiates cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. As cells move along the collagen fibers they generate forces that contract the gel. When the collagen fibers are tethered at both ends, cell-generated forces create uniaxial strain, causing the cells and collagen fibers to align. The advantages of this matrix are its simplicity and speed of preparation. Soluble plasma fibronectin can also self-assemble into stable insoluble fibers when put under direct mechanical shearing within a viscous solution. Phillips et al. (2004) investigated a new method of shear aggregation that causes an improved aggregation. The mechanical shearing was created by dragging out a 0.2 ml bolus to 3cm with forceps; fibronectin aggregates into insoluble fibers at the rapidly moving interface in an ultrafiltration cell. The proposed mechanism for this fiber aggregation is protein extension and elongation under mechanical shear force, which leads to lateral packing and protein aggregation of fibers. Phillips et al. showed that mechanical shear produced by stretching a <b>high</b> <b>viscosity</b> fibronectin gel causes substantial changes in its structure and that when applied through uniaxial extension, a viscous fibronectin gel forms oriented fibrous fibronectin aggregates; additionally, the fibrous aggregates have a decreased solubility and can support the various cell types in vitro.|$|E
