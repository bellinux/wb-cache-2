Sections cut at 4 - 6 μ were floated on 0. 2 % gelatin containing 1. 25 % formalin, and spread and dried on slides at a temperature not exceeding 25 C. Wax was removed with xylene, and the sections brought to water through ethanol as usual. The working staining solution was made from three stock solutions: A. Chlorantine fast blue 2 RLL, 0. 5 %; B. Cibacron turquoise blue G-E, 0. 5 %; C. Procion red M-P, 0. 5 %-each of which was dissolved in 98. 5 ml of distilled water to which 0. 5 ml of glacial acetic acid and 0. 5 ml of propylene glycol monophenyl ether (a fungicide) had been added. For use, the three solutions were mixed in the proportions: A, 3; B, 4; and C, 3 volumes. Staining time was uncritical, 10 - 30 min usually sufficing for 6 μ sections. The chief feature of the staining is the differentiation of oxygenated and nonoxygenated red blood corpuscles, in reds and blues respectively.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{two methods}} for staining resinless thin sections with antibodies and gold-conjugated second antibodies. Immunolocalization of specific proteins {{is a powerful}} tool for cell structure studies but current techniques do not develop its full potential. Immunofluorescence provides only low-resolution localization, whereas conventional thin-section electron microscopy images and immunostains only the section surface. Resinless sections of extracted cell structures offer a simple and effective means of immuno-electron microscopy. Without embedding plastic or soluble proteins, the cell cytostructure produces high-contrast, three-dimensional images. Resinless sections of detergent-extracted cells are prepared by embedding in diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>distearate,</b> sectioning, and removing diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>distearate</b> before microscopy. In the first method of immunostaining, extracted cells were fixed and stained with antibodies before embedment, sectioning, removal of the embedding resin, and critical point drying. In the postembedment method, the sample was embedded and sectioned, the diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>distearate</b> was removed, and the sample was rehydrated before antibody staining. With these techniques, specific proteins were localized with high resolution throughout the entire section. Stereoscopic micrographs of resinless sections revealed the precise localization of specific cytoskeleton and nuclear matrix proteins in three dimensions with unprecedented clarity...|$|E
40|$|Owing to its {{physical}} properties, diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>distearate</b> is especially suited for obtaining thin sections {{of high quality}} {{with little or no}} compression. Tissues can be cut as thin as 1 Mm on a steel knife without cooling, but a water trough is essential. The wax is translucent, so that specimens can be oriented for a desired plane of sectioning. The wax is also of sufficient hardness to serve as an embedding medium for osmium-fixed material and can readily be removed from such tissue sections for rapid phase contrast studies. A general method is described for embedding and sectioning with diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>distearate</b> wax and examples of freeze-substituted and osmium-fixed material are illus-trated. It is concluded that this synthetic wax can offer a convenient and simple means for obtaining thin sections for most aspects of high resolution light microscopy. In light microscopy, high resolution studies of well fixed tissue require thin sections of the range 0. 5 - 2 sm so that little or no specimen material will be superimposed over the plane of interest during examination (10).

40|$|I. A {{modification}} of Steedman's ester wax embedding method is described. This involved purification {{of two of}} the components—diethylene glycol monostearate and distearate. The puckering and floating off of the sections is thereby minimized. 2. The method is particularly applicable to tissues containing much collagen and to tissues that have been badly fixed or which have undergone post-mortem degenera-tion. 3. Cytological preservation is improved, especially that of such substances as glycoproteins and mucoproteins. ORTON and Post (1932) and Cutler (1935) investigated the use of diethy-lene <b>glycol</b> <b>distearate</b> as an embedding medium. The unsatisfactory results were partially overcome by Steedman (1947), who added other components in varying proportions. He examined many different mixtures and investigated with great care the distortion of the tissues produced during embedding, cutting, and mounting. The final mixture chosen has been called ester wax. Although ester wax has been strongly recommended (Gatenby, 1950), {{it does not seem to}} have been realized that, quite apart from diminution of gros...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEthylene <b>glycol</b> <b>distearate</b> (EGDS) {{was forced}} to {{crystallize}} as thin platelet {{in order to obtain}} a pearlescent effect. This was possible by performing a cooling surface crystallization in oil-in-water emulsion with the presence of an emulsifier. Under stagnant conditions, nucleation events and growth of faceted crystals in the oil phase were in situ monitored under microscope. After a first primary nucleation of dendritic crystals, a second population of faceted crystals arose by secondary nucleation and seemed to be the prevailing population. In a stirred vessel, the platelet shape of EGDS crystals was driven by the surfactant choice. Only a non-ionic surfactant, located at the liquid interface was supposed to interact with EGDS during the development of the crystals favouring a platelet habit. The nature of the interaction was not yet established. Moreover, the mastery of the platelet shape was lost when the amount of non-ionic surfactant relatively to the EGDS was decreased. This underlined the importance of the non-ionic surfactant for the obtaining of desired shape. The different physical qualities of crystals produced allowed us to confirm relationships between EGDS particle features with their effect of pearlescence of a cold pearl blend...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{novel in}} situ video probe with {{automated}} image {{analysis was used}} to develop a population balance model for a breakage-dominated liquid liquid emulsification system. Experiments were performed in a 2 L tank, agitated by an axial flow propeller. The dispersed phase (ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>distearate)</b> concentration was varied from 0. 2 to 1. 0 % (w/w), and agitation rates were varied from 0. 2 to 0. 5 W/kg, in the presence of excess surfactant. Three numerical discretization methods were compared: fixed pivot, cell average, and finite volumes. The latter was then chosen for the subsequent simulations due to its rapidity and higher precision. An investigation of the different theories for bubble/droplet breakage was done and the frequencies (or breakage rate kernels) were compared. Four models were found applicable: the models developed by Coulaloglou and Tavlarides (Coulaloglou, C. A.; Tavlarides, L. L. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1977, 32, 1289); Sathyagal and Ramkrishna (Sathyagal, A. N.; Ramkrishna, D. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1996, 51, 1377); Alopaeus, Koskinen, and Keskinen (Alopaeus, V.; Koskinen, J.; Keskinen, K. I. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1999, 54, 5887); and Baldyga and Podgorska (Baldyga, J.; Podgorska, W. Can. J. Chem. Eng. 1998, 76, 456). The one by Sathygal and Ramkrishna included the daughter size distribution. A log-normal daughter size distribution was chosen for the models by Coulaloglou and Tavlarides and Alopeus et al. Also, a normal distribution was used in the model by Baldyga and Podgorska. These models were compared with the experimental data to allow parameter identification. The model by Baldyga and Podgorska was found to give the best prediction of the shape of the distribution, its mean diameter, and standard deviation...|$|E
