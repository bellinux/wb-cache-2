40|$|The dologx package {{contains}} multiple {{versions of}} dolog (q. v.), written in multiple versions of Stata, for executing certification scripts. Usually, a do-file {{should include a}} version statement {{at or near the}} top, so it will still execute in a similar way if the user runs it after the next Stata upgrade. Certification scripts are an exception to this rule, because the same certification script may be executed under multiple versions of Stata, to show that the package being certified still works in the same way under different Stata versions. Therefore, if a certification script is executed using dolog, then it will <b>execute</b> under <b>the</b> Stata version in which dolog is written. Therefore, a certification script should not be <b>executed</b> using <b>the</b> standard dolog, and the user should use the dologx package, using dolog 6 to <b>execute</b> <b>the</b> script under Stata 6, dolog 7 to <b>execute</b> <b>the</b> script under Stata 7, dolog 8 to <b>execute</b> <b>the</b> script under Stata 8, dolog 9 to <b>execute</b> <b>the</b> script under Stata 9, dolog 10 to <b>execute</b> <b>the</b> script under Stata 10, dolog 11 to <b>execute</b> <b>the</b> script under Stata 11, dolog 12 to <b>execute</b> <b>the</b> script under Stata 12, and dolog 13 to <b>execute</b> <b>the</b> script under Stata 13. ...|$|R

5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when <b>executing</b> <b>the</b> move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E

5|$|Basiliscus had {{relied on}} the support of some major figures of the court in his bid for power. However, he quickly lost most of them. First, Basiliscus alienated his own sister Verina's support, <b>executing</b> <b>the</b> Magister Officiorum Patricius. Patricius was the lover of Verina, and the empress had planned to raise him to the {{imperial}} rank and to marry him: the very revolt against Zeno was organised to make Patricius emperor. Basiliscus, however, had out-witted his sister, and, after the flight of Zeno, had the ministers and the Senate choose him, and not Patricius, as Emperor. Basiliscus ordered the death of Patricius, as the officer was a natural candidate to overthrow the new Emperor; as a consequence, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus, because of her lover's execution.|$|E
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player <b>executing</b> <b>the</b> bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
5|$|If the {{governor}} becomes incapacitated, then the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana becomes acting-governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become incapacitated during their terms, and current precedent is that {{the governor}}'s office is to notify the lieutenant governor, who will then {{make the decision to}} become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of <b>executing</b> <b>the</b> duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If the office of the lieutenant governor is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E

5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Judgment Day on the Raw brand was between John Cena and The Great Khali, {{with the two}} battling over the WWE Championship. The rivalry started on the April 30, 2007, episode of Raw during a non-title match between John Cena and Shawn Michaels when Michaels was {{attacked}} from behind by The Great Khali. Edge and Randy Orton were also knocked out by Khali. The Great Khali then performed a Khali Bomb on Cena. The next week on Raw, Khali defeated Shawn Michaels in a number one contenders match by knockout after <b>executing</b> <b>the</b> Khali Bomb on Michaels through the announce table. Later that night, Khali stole Cena's WWE title belt. On the May 14 episode of Raw, when Cena attempted to take his belt back, Khali attacked him.|$|E
5|$|Through 1944 'A' Force {{was slowly}} winding down.

However, {{by the end of}} the summer 'A' Force's usefulness in operations had reached its end. On 13 October Clarke held a party (true to form, at a Cairo cinema) for the remaining members of the department. Command of the remaining tactical deceptions was transferred to Caserta. Clarke, along with a skeleton staff, remained in Egypt to tie up the loose ends of various operations and to begin his history of the department. In April 1945, Clarke left Cairo for London; on 18 June he called a meeting of the remaining 'A' Force members at the Great Central Hotel where the department was disbanded.|$|E
