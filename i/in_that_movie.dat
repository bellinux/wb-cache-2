500|$|The {{final phase}} of {{principal}} photography took place in Alberta in late November2009. The location manager discovered a temporarily closed ski resort, Fortress Mountain. An elaborate set was assembled near the top station of the Canadian chairlift, taking three months to build. The production {{had to wait for}} a huge snowstorm, which eventually arrived. The ski-chase sequence was inspired by Nolan's favorite James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969): [...] "What I liked about it that we've tried to emulate in this film is there's a tremendous balance <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>movie</b> of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion." ...|$|E

Carradine said that during the rape scene <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>movie,</b> he cracked one of Barbara's ribs. They appeared in other films together including Martin Scorsese's Boxcar Bertha.

Later in 1972, Hershey gave birth to their son, Free, who changed his name to Tom when he was nine years old. The relationship fell apart around the time of Carradine's 1974 burglary arrest, after he had begun an affair with Season Hubley, who had guest-starred in Kung Fu.|$|E
500|$|... "Redrum", {{described}} as a [...] "Twilight Zone-type thriller" [...] in The Complete X-Files, was developed by Steven Maeda and Daniel Arkin, while the teleplay was written solely by Maeda. Maeda purposely picked the title to be the backwards spelling of [...] "murder"; notably, the same plot device was used by novelist—and one-time X-Files writer—Stephen King in his book The Shining. Furthermore, Maeda used the spider and its web to symbolize Martin Wells' confusion at being trapped in his situation. Wells was played by noted actor Joe Morton who had previously {{played a role in}} the 1991 sci-fi film [...] Robert Patrick later noted that [...] "Joe Morton is a fantastic actor.

500|$|On February 21, 1989, former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey filed {{a lawsuit}} against Orion Pictures, {{claiming}} defamation and invasion of privacy. The lawsuit, filed at a United States district court in Meridian, Mississippi, asked for $8 million in damages. Rainey, who was the county sheriff {{at the time of the}} 1964 murders, alleged that the filmmakers of Mississippi Burning had portrayed him in an unfavorable light with the fictional character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain). [...] "Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>movie</b> is referring to me," [...] he stated. [...] "What they said happened and what they did to me certainly wasn't right and something ought to be done about it." [...] Rainey's lawsuit was unsuccessful; he dropped the suit after Orion's team of lawyers threatened to prove that the film was based on fact, and that Rainey was indeed suspected in the 1964 murders.|$|E
500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera {{for every one of}} those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>movie</b> that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E

2500|$|Moyers {{reported}} and Potter confirmed {{that there were}} attempts to radicalize Moore {{in an effort to}} discredit the film’s message. Moore would be referred to as a [...] "Hollywood entertainer" [...] or [...] "Hollywood moviemaker" [...] to associate the film as being grounded in entertainment without any basis in objective reality. [...] "They would want you to see this as just some fantasy that a Hollywood filmmaker had come up with. That's part of the strategy."

2500|$|Mad Max: Fury Road {{contains}} 2,000 {{visual effects}} shots. The lead effects company was Iloura, who delivered more than 1,500 effects shots for the film. Additional visual effects studios that {{worked on the}} film include Method Studios, Stereo D, 4DMax, BlackGinger, The Third Floor, and Dr. D Studios. Miller recruited his wife, Margaret Sixel, to edit the film, as he felt she could make it stand out from other action films. Sixel had 480 hours of footage to edit; watching it took three months. The film contains about 2,700 cuts of its entire running length, which is equivalent to 22.5 cuts per minute compared to The Road Warriors 1,200 cuts of its 90-minute running time equivalent to 13.33 cuts per minute. The frame rate was also manipulated. [...] "Something like 50 or 60 percent {{of the film is}} not running at 24 frames a second, which is the traditional frame rate," [...] said Seale. [...] "It'll be running below 24 frames because George, if he couldn't understand {{what was happening in the}} shot, he slowed it down until you could. Or if it was too well understood, he'd shorten it or he'd speed it up back towards 24. His manipulation of every shot <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>movie</b> is intense." [...] The Washington Post would later note that the changing frame rate gave the film an [...] "almost cartoonishly jerky" [...] look.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Flickering Myth critiqued that [...] "Some stories just don’t need telling, and Leatherface {{is one of}} them. It's not that it retcons elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre mythology, or that it's a 'pointless prequel' – it's just an empty movie. You'll have forgotten you've seen {{it as soon as}} the credits roll. Prequels, sequels and remakes can all enrich a story and tell it from a new perspective, but Leatherface just doesn’t do that."Screen International called the film [...] "a production line effort with an eye on cashflow rather than the demented work of art Hooper loosed on the world", stating [...] "this eighth entry is above average for its attenuated series. Gore levels are as high as expected and, naturally, the finale leaves things open for further installments." [...] Regarding the film's viewer appeal, HeyUGuys theorised, [...] "Not only is this prequel attempting to deliver something fans of the series don't necessarily want, it doesn't really do what it promises particularly well either. One for completists for sure, but on the whole Leatherface is too detached for TCM fans, and too extreme for the wider public." [...] William Bibbiani of IGN ranked it as the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film because [...] "it adds nothing new or interesting to the series. The problem is not just that this film is a prequel, so we know exactly where it’s going, but that the road to the inevitable takes us through almost unbearably familiar territory. It honestly looks as though the filmmakers who made Leatherface didn't watch the original films, but watched all of the films that ripped off The Texas Chain Saw Massacre instead." [...] Film critic Rob Gonsalves reviewed that [...] "Hooper's Chainsaw is often imitated, never duplicated (or bested, say I), a sui generis sweatbox odyssey that seems to owe nothing to any other film before it. Leatherface feels properly respectful, made by filmmakers who idolize the original, and that’s also its weakness: it's a jumped-up fan film, and because it's meant to be a prequel to Hooper's movie it's locked into whatever happens <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>movie.</b> It can't deviate from what we know, and can't truly surprise us." [...] Heather Wixson of Daily Dead went into Leatherface [...] "primed to love it", but felt that the final product [...] "never quite makes up its mind about just what kind of movie it wants to be, and suffers for its indecision. But as a whole, Leatherface is such a disappointing entry because it spends so much time trying to be so many other things than just a straight-up Texas Chainsaw movie, and I couldn't help but wonder why." [...] Wixson commended the cinematography, practical effects, and Lili Taylor's acting, but slammed the third act.|$|E
