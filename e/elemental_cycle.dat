Two typical ornamental plants (Buxu megistophylla Levl and Syzygium aromaticum) were chosen to study the differences of leaf element contents (C, N, P) and ecological stoichiometry characteristics, which were caused by the UHI effect. Results indicated that UHI effect had significant influences on total leaf C concentration. A range of total leaf N concentration exhibited coherence for the two plants. Total leaf N concentration significantly decreased for B. megistophylla Levl and S. aromaticum in UHI (P< 0. 05). However, total leaf P concentration of the two plants experienced a greatly significant decrease in UHI (P< 0. 001). In contrast to reference site (RS), B. megistophylla Levl and S. aromaticum in UHI both gave a relatively higher C/N ratio, C/P ratio and N/P ratio {{as a result of}} the greatly significant decrease of total leaf phosphorus content. Although UHI effect exhibited a small increase of temperature, leaf element contents as well as their stoichiometric ratio had been influenced.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Marine bacterioplankton play an {{important}} role in global <b>elemental</b> <b>cycles</b> because they return carbon dioxide and nutrients to the biosphere as they reduce organic matter. Furthermore, marine bacterioplankton are not uniformly active, and subpopulations of the in situ community may be more or less active at any given time. Defining whether or not a cell is 'active' is not without difficulty, and the result varies depending on the assay used, since different assays examine different physiological processes within a cell. Linking the level of activity of a cell with its phylogenetic identity is an additional important step in examination of the role of marine prokaryotes in global <b>elemental</b> <b>cycles.</b> In this project, flow cytometry was used in two ways to examine relative cell-specific metabolic activity in bacterioplankton cells: as relative cell-specific nucleic acid content via staining with SYBR Green I, and as ability to reduce sufficient 5 -cyano- 2, 3 -ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) to be identified as having an active electron transport system. Based on flow cytometric sorting of cells labeled with ³H-leucine, the high nucleic acid (HNA) cells had higher cell-specific leucine incorporation rates than the low nucleic acid (LNA) cells. The HNA cells were also responsible for proportionately more of the leucine incorporation by the total heterotrophic population.

Therefore, through a multiple‐sequence alignment, we designed degenerate primers to identify whether the LSI 1 gene is present in the fern Equisetum giganteum. Determining the presence of LSI 1 will enable us to determine if silicon uptake mechanisms have been conserved across lineages.

40|$|Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) harbor unique {{microbial}} {{communities that}} rely on alternative electron acceptors for respiration. Conditions therein enable an almost complete nitrogen (N) cycle and substantial N-loss. N-loss in OMZs is attributable to anammox and heterotrophic denitrification, whereas nitrate reduction to nitrite along with dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium are major remineralization pathways. Despite virtually anoxic conditions, nitrification also occurs in OMZs, converting remineralized ammonium to N-oxides. The concurrence of all these processes provides a direct channel from organic N to the ultimate N-loss, whereas most individual processes are likely controlled by organic matter. Many microorganisms inhabiting the OMZs are capable of multiple functions in the N- and other <b>elemental</b> <b>cycles.</b> Their versatile metabolic potentials versus actual activities present a challenge to ecophysiological and biogeochemical measurements.

When fed P-limited food, populations with a P-limitation selection history suffered 37 % lower mortality, reached twice the steady state biomass, and reduced algae by 40 % compared to populations with a P-replete selection history.

40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution, industry, traffic and the manufacture {{and application of}} nitrogenous fertilizers have increased carbon dioxide emissions and accelerated the nitrogen (N) cycle. The combined effects of a warming climate,CO 2 fertilization, land-use change and increased N availabilitymay be responsible for primary productivity increases {{in many parts of}} the world. Enhanced productivity may lead to shifts in albedo and transpiration, which feed back to the water cycle through heat fluxes and precipitation. Plants may also respond to elevated CO 2 by closing their stomata or by structurally adapting their stomatal density and size, which potentially diminishes transpiration. Intensification of agriculture has also led to an increase in both nitrogenous (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization. The combined effect of atmospheric N deposition and P fertilization has distorted the balance between N and P availability in many ecosystems. The active role of plants in accessing nutrients from the soil may trigger switches in nutrient availability, triggering shifts in plant productivity and species composition in these ecosystems and therefore also in the carbon (C) cycle. In response to global change, the above plant responses may influence each other positively or negatively and may impact on the <b>elemental</b> <b>cycles</b> of C, N and P and the water cycle. We are only beginning to understand how these four cycles interact, the role of plant processes and vegetation in these interactions, and the net outcome for plant competition, vegetation distribution, landscape development and directions of global change. In this paper we have integrated a number of recent research findings into known relationships that together elucidate interactions between these cycles through vegetation, and could potentially have unexpected effects on landscapes and larger-scale systems (continental, global). These interactions include processes operating at very distinct temporal and spatial scales, in which terrestrial ecosystems and their spatial organization in the landscape are key. We argue that to better understand the effects of changes in land cover and land use on biogeochemical and biogeophysical fluxes, it is necessary to account for feedbacks via vegetation and how these interfere with <b>elemental</b> <b>cycles.</b> Finally, we suggest directions for further research to fill the current knowledge gaps...|$|R

In this paper, we focus on trait-based models as tools to study the role of phytoplankton diversity in the stoichiometric phenomenology observed in the laboratory and in the open ocean.

By contrasting the different ecological and evolutionary approaches available in the literature, we explore the strengths and limitations of the existing models. We thus try to identify existing gaps and challenges, and point to potential new directions that can be explored to fill these gaps.

Hence a mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating species dominance is a prerequisite to predictive modelling. Results from EisenEx revealed 6 distinct response behaviours to iron fertilization. Five species of the over 50 recorded, contributed 48 % of total diatom biomass. Of these, two species (a pennate and a centric) reacted immediately with accumulation rates about double those of other species and built up population size exponentially. In contrast species with initially highest abundances responded after a week with a brief period of rapid accumulation which levelled off later. The ratio of live cells to intact empty and broken frustules (LC:EBF), used as a measure of mortality, increased steadily inside the fertilized patch indicating that the grazer assemblage could not keep pace with growth of the dominant species. Species-specific differences in the LC:EBF ratio and the ratio of intact empty to broken frustules indicated that selective grazing by proto- and metazooplankton played an important role in structuring the diatom assemblage...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the past}} three centuries, human {{perturbations}} of the environ-ment have affected the biogeochemical behavior of the global carbon cycle {{and that of the}} other three nutrient elements closely coupled to carbon: nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. The partitioning of anthropogenic CO 2 among its various sinks in the past, for the present, and for projections into the near future is controlled by the interactions of these four <b>elemental</b> <b>cycles</b> within the major environmental domains of the land, atmosphere, coastal oceanic zone, and open ocean. We analyze the past, present, and future behavior of the global carbon cycle using the Terrestrial-Ocean-aTmosphere Ecosystem Model (TOTEM), a unique process-based model of the four global coupled biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. We find that during the past 300 yrs, anthropogenic CO 2 was mainly stored in the atmosphere and in the open ocean. Human activities on land caused an enhanced loss of mass from the terrestrial organic matter reservoirs (phytomass and humus) mainly through deforestation and consequently increased humus remineralization, erosion, and transport t...|$|R
40|$|Diatoms play an {{essential}} role in marine biogeochemical cycles by their large contribution to primary production and particle export. Under nutrient limitation, diatom biomass often exhibits large deviations from the Redfield ratio. Here a biogeochemical ocean general circulation model is applied to investigate the influence of variations in diatom stoichiometry. The ecosystem model allows for variable Chl:C:N:Si stoichiometry in phytoplankton biomass regulated by light and availability of macronutrients (nitrate, silicic acid) and iron. Two size classes of phytoplankton are considered with the larger representing diatoms. After 5 years of simulation, the surface distributions of both phytoplankton groups are in a reasonable cyclostationary state. Compared to the ‘steady’ state, a sensitivity simulation with fixed diatom stoichiometry for Si:N of 1. 2 : 1 showed a slight shift from small phytoplankton to diatoms leading to a shift in primary production between two groups. Total primary and export production were conservative, indicating a tendency for compensation. In the Southern Ocean, less opal production and decreased particle export ratio of Si:N resulted in raising silicic acid to the south of Subantarctic Front elucidating the importance of decoupling of different <b>elemental</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R

In particular, they {{play an important role}} in the electrification of mobility and therefore the battery lifetime prediction is a fundamental aspect for successful market introduction. Numerous studies developed ageing models capable of predicting battery life span. Most of the previous works compared the effect of the ageing factors to a battery’s cycle life. These cycles are identical, which is not the case for electric vehicles applications. Indeed, most of the available information is based on results from laboratory testing, under very controlled environments, and using ageing protocols, which may not correctly reflect the actual utilization. For this reason, it is important to link the effect of duty cycles with the ageing of the batteries.

Despite steep vertical redox gradients, size fraction was a significantly stronger predictor of community composition compared to depth. Phylogenetic diversity showed contrasting patterns, decreasing towards the anoxic OMZ core in the small size fraction, but exhibiting maximal values at these depths within the larger size fraction. Fraction-specific distributions were evident for key OMZ taxa, including anammox planctomycetes, whose coding sequences were enriched up to threefold in the 0. 2 – 1. 6 lm community. Functional gene composition also differed between fractions, with the 41. 6 lm community significantly enriched in genes mediating social interactions, including motility, adhesion, cell-to-cell transfer, antibiotic resistance and mobile element activity.

Yet, these interactions are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an experimental seagrass mesocosm system, we factorially manipulated water column nutrient concentrations, food chain length, and diversity of crustacean grazers to address two questions: (1) Does food web composition modulate the effects of nutrient enrichment on plant and grazer biomasses and stoichiometry? (2) Do ecosystem fluxes of dissolved oxygen and nutrients more closely reflect above-ground biomass and community structure or sediment processes? Nutrient enrichment and grazer presence generally had strong effects on biomass accumulation, stoichiometry, and ecosystem fluxes, whereas predator effects were weaker or absent. Nutrient enrichment {{had little effect on}} producer biomass or net ecosystem production but strongly increased seagrass nutrient content, ecosystem flux rates, and grazer secondary production, suggesting that enhanced production was efficiently transferred from producers to herbivores.

Often, {{the production of}} these reactive natural materials is mediated by microorganisms, and in some systems biogenic oxides may dominate over abiotic oxides in volume and overall importance. Biogenic transition/heavy metal oxides are often nanoparticulate and can interact readily with their chemical environments via ongoing synthesis, aging, and dissolution/reprecipitation reactions. Through these processes, co-contaminant cations may be readily sorbed/ incorporated. The compositions and molecular-scale structures of biogenic transition/heavy metal oxides thus are influenced by ground water solute chemistry. As these factors may significantly moderate the Gibbs energy of the materials, this behavior is of significance as a moderator or predictor of the reactivity of the oxide materials.
