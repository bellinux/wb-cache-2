40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} Causal Joint {{multiuser}} Detection and multichannel Tracking (CJDT) in time-varying flat Rayleigh fading codedivision multiple-access (CDMA) channels is considered. Starting upon the consideration that fading correlation prevents, in this scenario, the symbols to be decoded independently, the causal (i. e., corresponding to zero decoding delay) Maximum-Likelihood (ML) receiver is first derived: as expected, the resulting structure has a complexity which grows exponentially {{in the number}} of users, preventing any practical implementation. Sub-optimum detection strategies are thus investigated, basically through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm: the resulting receiver {{can be thought of as}} a combination of an <b>interference</b> <b>suppressor</b> and a Kalman filter, both operating iteratively.

In particular, the error {{performance of a}} two-user system with a short BCH code and iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding over the associated Tanner graph is evaluated. Two possible combinations of a BP-based iterative decoder and a soft <b>interference</b> <b>suppressor</b> (IS) are studied: (1) joint IS-BP, in which the soft-outputs from the BP decoder at each iteration are used as inputs to the IS, and this soft information is exchanged until some number of IS-BP iterations are executed; and (2) serial concatenated IS-BP, with the IS and BP decoder working independently, the IS delivering soft-inputs to the BP decoder, who performs a number of decoding iterations prior to delivery of soft-outputs back to the IS.

40|$|To {{utilize the}} radio {{frequency}} spectrum efficiently a Cognitive Radio (CR) {{can operate as}} a secondary user in a frequency band which is licensed to a primary user. To this end, the CR must sense the spectrum continuously to find empty frequency channels for its transmission. The transmitted signal by the local transmitter of the CR, however, induces a strong local interference in the local receiver of the CR. Hence a half-duplex transceiver is used where the transmit and sense operations are done in separate time slots. The time-slotted operation though, reduces the throughput of the CR.

This work intends to show some biological properties of these viruses following plant infections. Agroinfiltration experiments on Nicotiana benthamiana confirmed the efficient systemic expression of M 2 e peptides, and two point amino acid substitutions in recombinant CPs significantly influenced the symptoms and development of viral infections. Joint expression of RNA <b>interference</b> <b>suppressor</b> protein p 19 from tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) did not affect the accumulation of CP-M 2 e-ser recombinant protein in non-inoculated leaves. RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from either infected leaves or purified TMV-M 2 e particles proved the genetic stability of TMV‑based viral vectors. Immunoelectron microscopy of crude plant extracts demonstrated that foreign epitopes are located on the surface of chimeric virions. The rod‑shaped geometry of plant-produced M 2 e epitopes is different from the icosahedral or helical filamentous arrangement of M 2 e antigens on the carrier virus-like particles (VLP) described earlier.

40|$|Abstract — The {{presence}} of both multiple-access interference (MAI) and intersymbol interference (ISI) constitutes a major impediment to reliable communications in multipath code-division multiple-access (CDMA) channels. In this paper, an iterative receiver structure is proposed for decoding multiuser information {{data in a}} convolutionally coded asynchronous multipath DS-CDMA system. The receiver performs two successive softoutput decisions, achieved by a soft-input soft-output (SISO) multiuser detector and a bank of single-user SISO channel decoders, through an iterative process. At each iteration, extrinsic information is extracted from detection and decoding stages and is then used as a priori information in the next iteration, just as in Turbo decoding. Given the multipath CDMA channel model, a direct implementation of a sliding-window SISO multiuser detector has a prohibitive computational complexity. A low-complexity SISO multiuser detector is developed based on a novel nonlinear interference suppression technique, which makes use of both soft interference cancellation and instantaneous linear minimum mean-square error filtering. The properties of such a nonlinear <b>interference</b> <b>suppressor</b> are examined, and an efficient recursive implementation is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed low-complexity iterative receiver structure for interference suppression and decoding offers significant performance gain over the traditional noniterative receiver structure. Moreover, at high signal-to-noise ratio, the detrimental effects of MAI and ISI in the channel can almost be completely overcome by iterative processing, and single-user performance can be approached.

40|$|The initial code {{acquisition}} {{techniques for}} direct sequence code {{division multiple access}} (DS/CDMA) communication networks are investigated in this thesis. Conventional methods of code acquisition, which are basically based on the auto correlation and cross correlation properties of spreading codes, fail in the presence of multiple access interference (MAI) and the near-far effect. This fact motivates the study for interference resistant acquisition algorithms in the hostile channel environment. Training-based acquisition is investigated and the effect of training sequence structure on acquisition performance is discussed. A new training sequence architecture is proposed which results in a shorter acquisition time. Demands for high bit rate services and needs for more efficient exploitation of resources lead to the study of acquisition algorithms that do not need the preamble or training sequences. In this context, blind adaptive algorithms for code acquisition are investigated. The mismatch problem of blind algorithms is addressed and a novel method of mismatch problem handling for Constraint Minimum Output Energy (C-MOE) is proposed. The algorithm results in good acquisition performance under different channel conditions and system loadings. The idea of joint acquisition and demodulation of data, where the outcome of the acquisition mode is an <b>interference</b> <b>suppressor</b> filter, is also discussed. It is shown that in this class of receivers, a one-step constraint acquisition process is not sufficient for handling both the mismatch problem and exploiting the multi-path diversity.

Whereas primary and secondary sheep erythrocyte-specific, plaque-forming cell responses by normal murine spleen cells were enhanced by low concentrations of ribavirin (1 microgram per culture), they were strongly inhibited by higher concentrations of ribavirin (5 to 10 micrograms per culture). Both phenomena occurred with the greatest magnitude when spleen cells were exposed to ribavirin 48 to 72 h after culture initiation. Enhancement appeared to result from selective <b>interference</b> with <b>suppressor</b> T cells, since ribavirin failed to augment lipopolysaccharide-specific plaque-forming cell responses in T cell-depleted spleen cell cultures but inhibited concanavalin A-induced lymphocyte proliferation and suppressor T cell generation in cultures of normal spleen cells.

Arthropods lack the protein-based adaptive immune response found in vertebrates. Here we show that the central catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the nuclease Argonaute 2 (Ago- 2), is essential for antiviral defense in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Ago- 2 -defective flies are hypersensitive to infection with a major fruit fly pathogen, Drosophila C virus (DCV), and with Cricket Paralysis virus (CrPV). Increased mortality in ago- 2 mutant flies was associated with a dramatic increase in viral RNA accumulation and virus titers.
