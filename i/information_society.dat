40|$|In the 21 st century, the <b>information</b> <b>societies,</b> {{particularly}} the media, {{began to play}} an important role in shaping world politics, as a result of which there is a recent literature in international politics analysing the impact of <b>information</b> <b>societies</b> on power and international politics. There is an ongoing debate in terms of the impact of the non-state actors such as <b>information</b> <b>societies</b> on the role of states in international politics. This paper analyzes the impact of the media and <b>information</b> <b>societies</b> on international politics and foreign policy making in the 21 st century. A major proposition is that the framing of the issues by <b>information</b> <b>societies</b> greatly impacted the relevant positions of various social groups, greatly reducing the possibility of objective foreign policy choices. Thus, in terms of foreign policy making, the impact of the non-state actors in politics have increased tremendously, adding an additional layer of complexity to foreign policy making. This, in turn, leads us to look for new analytical tools to assess the role that <b>information</b> <b>societies</b> play and to assess the challenges to the concept of state power...|$|R
