40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} model of an {{aircraft}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipe</b> was established in this paper. Based on LS-Dyna software equivalent static pressure and peak pressure surface loads on the tire burst test (main landing gear retracted state, and did not consider the impact of tire debris) jets were applied to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipe.</b> Both stress and strain contours of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipe</b> were obtained under dynamic loading. Plastic strain occurred under both loads on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipe,</b> and the peak pulse loads were more severe than equivalent static loads, the maximum strain reached 0. 41172 under the peak pulse loads. However, {{in both cases the}} pipe is not broken...|$|R

50|$|In stage {{lighting}} and sound a c-clamp, {{also referred to}} as a <b>pipe</b> <b>clamp,</b> is used to attach a larger piece of hardware, such as a lighting instrument, a speaker, or a dimmer, to a pipe or batten.

50|$|A Structural pipe fitting, {{also known}} as a slip on <b>pipe</b> fitting, <b>clamp</b> or <b>pipe</b> <b>clamp</b> is used to build {{structures}} such as handrails, guardrails, and other types of pipe or tubular structure. They {{can also be used to}} build furniture and theatrical riggings. The fittings slip on the pipe and are usually locked down with a set screw. The set screw can then be tightened with a simple hex wench. Because of the modular design of standard fittings, assembly is easy, only simple hand tools are required, and risks from welding a structure are eliminated.|$|R
50|$|In woodwork, a <b>pipe</b> <b>clamp</b> uses clamp heads {{produced}} commercially {{by numerous}} manufacturers. They {{are available in}} various diameter sizes, commonly ½”or ¾”, suited to the same diameter piping. The pipe is usually threaded on both ends. One head is fixed on the pipe by spinning it onto standard pipe threads. This head includes the screw mechanism for tightening the clamp. The other, movable, head slides onto {{the other end of}} the pipe. This head has a mechanism, often a series of movable “clutches” which allow it to slide along the pipe when setting up the clamping operation but which lock onto the <b>pipe</b> when <b>clamping</b> pressure is applied.|$|R

50|$|Trim {{chains and}} shackles, or {{turnbuckles}} and <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps,</b> typically connect the lift {{lines of a}} line set to the batten they support. Those connections facilitate minor adjustments to, trim, the effective length of a lift line. By trimming the lift lines, loads are more evenly distributed to them. Turnbuckles are moused (secured against free rotation) to prevent the jaws from slowly unscrewing over time due to vibrations incurred during normal use.|$|R
50|$|Wrenches and {{applications}} using wrenches or devices that needed wrenches, such as <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps</b> and suits of armor, {{have been noted}} by historians {{as far back as}} the 15th century. Adjustable coach wrenches for the odd-sized nuts of wagon wheels were manufactured in England and exported to North America in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The mid 19th century began to see patented wrenches which used a screw to narrowing or widening the jaws, including patented monkey wrenches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{adaptive}} Helmholtz resonator {{was designed}} and adapted to hydraulics. The resonator was controlled by open- and closed-loop controls so that 20 dB attenuation of the peak-to-peak value of the pulsating pressure was maintained. The closed-loop control was noted to be better, albeit it was slower because of its low pressure and temperature variation, which caused variation in the effective bulk modulus of the hydraulic system. Low-pressure hydraulics contains air, which affects the stiffness of the hydraulics, and temperature variation changes the viscosity of the oil. Thus, an open-loop control loses its efficiency if a condition such as temperature or the amount of air changes after calibration. The instability of the low-pressure hydraulic system reduced the operational frequency range of the Helmholtz resonator {{when compared with the}} results of an analytical model. Different dampers for hydraulics are presented. Then analytical models of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipe</b> and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipe</b> with a Helmholtz resonator are presented. The analytical models are based on the wave equation of sound pressure. Finally, control methods and the results of experiments are presented...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{fatigue failure}} is a {{critical}} problem of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipes</b> under severe working conditions. Strain modal testing of small and light pipes is a good option for dynamic characteristic evaluation, structural health monitoring and damage identification. Unique features such as small size, light weight, and high multiplexing capability enable Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors to measure structural dynamic responses where sensor size and placement are critical. In this paper, experimental strain modal analysis of pipes using distributed FBG sensors ispresented. Strain modal analysis and parameter identification methods are introduced. Experimental strain modal testing and finite element analysis for a cantilever pipe have been carried out. The analysis {{results indicate that the}} natural frequencies and strain mode shapes of the tested pipe acquired by FBG sensors are in good agreement with the results obtained by a reference accelerometer and simulation outputs. The strain modal parameters of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipe</b> were obtained by the proposed strain modal testing method. FBG sensors {{have been shown to be}} useful in the experimental strain modal analysis of small and light pipes in mechanical, aeronautic and aerospace applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an analytical investigation of water hammer in a <b>hydraulic</b> pressurized <b>pipe</b> {{system with a}} throttled surge chamber located at the junction between a tunnel and a penstock, and a valve positioned at the downstream end of the penstock. Analytical formulas of maximum water hammer pressures at the downstream {{end of the tunnel}} and the valve were derived for a system subjected to linear and slow valve closure. The analytical results were then compared with numerical ones obtained using the method of characteristics. There is agreement between them. The formulas can be applied to estimating water hammer pressure at the valve and transmission of water hammer pressure through the surge chamber at the junction for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pipe</b> system with a surge chamber...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>clamps</b> serve {{a similar}} purpose to bar clamps but are {{generally}} {{less expensive to}} purchase and have a versatility derived from {{the ability to use}} a variety of lengths of pipe to suit ones needs. The same clamp heads might be switched over from a two-foot length of pipe to a twelve-foot length as the project at hand dictates. Having threads {{at both ends of the}} pipe also allows the use of pipe couplings, joining two lengths of pipe to extend the length of the clamp.|$|R
