50|$|The bidders {{return a}} {{proposal}} {{by a set}} date and time. Late proposals {{may or may not}} be considered, depending on the terms of the initial RFP. The proposals are used to evaluate the suitability as a supplier, vendor, or <b>institutional</b> <b>partner.</b> Typically organizations follow a detailed vendor screening process to short list the vendors who should be invited for further rounds of negotiation. This screening process could either be vendor scoring models or internal discussions within the buyer organization. Discussions may be held on the proposals (often to clarify technical capabilities or to note errors in a proposal or in many cases to negotiate on the price). In most instances, only selected bidders may be invited to participate in subsequent bids, or may be asked to submit their best technical and financial proposal, commonly referred to as a Best and Final Offer (BAFO). Subsequent changes can be referred to as the Best and Revised Final Offer (BARFO).|$|E

40|$|Conservation {{of marine}} space {{is a new}} {{frontier}} in environmentalists’ involvement with resource governance in Indonesia. The coastal and marine area of Berau was established as a District Marine Conservation Area (MCA) based on District Head Regulation No. 31 / 2005. The total MCA of 1. 27 million ha was expected {{to become part of}} the wider MCA networks of the East Borneo Seascape and the Sulu Sulawesi Marine Ecoregion, as well as of the Coral Triangle international network of conservation areas in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The Berau MCA was developed in collaboration between the Berau district government and international environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). They claimed to use a new concept of partnership with the decentralised district government as the principal <b>institutional</b> <b>partner.</b> However, the governance framework is full of legal disconnects due to decentralisation of resource management, and its implementation faces the real-life challenges of political-economic and historical valuations of the marine environment producing conflicts of interest between the multi-scalar actors involved. Following the very process of establishing the Berau MCA over a five-year period (2005 – 2010), this paper shows why it is necessary to understand how collaboration and contention are constructed and in turn construct actors' perceptions and perspectives on marine conservation and resource extraction in decentralised coastal governance...|$|E

40|$|International {{educational}} experiences {{have the ability}} to promote cultural understanding, cooperation and interaction with global society. In a period of reduced financial and administrative resources it is more difficult to promote these experiences. Auburn University (AU) and the School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences (SFWS) has partnered with International Student Volunteers, Inc. (ISV) to provide academic oversight and credit for study abroad volunteer service experiences. ISV is an international volunteer travel organization who sends over 3, 000 students abroad each year and whose participants have contributed over 250, 000 volunteer hours in the fields of natural resource conservation and community development. ISV works with local agencies and non‐ governmental organizations to develop long term volunteer service projects in eight different countries. Students travel abroad for two weeks of volunteer services gaining hands‐on practical research or work experience generally followed by two weeks of nature and adventure travel. The SFWS has worked with ISV to develop two 3 credit hour academic courses (Natural Resource Management and Community Development) to be administered during the two week volunteer service projects. With input from the SFWS, ISV provides in‐country project leaders with the academic credentials (M. S. or Ph. D.) necessary to lead the field portion of the course. Students seeking academic credit complete a number of project relevant readings prior to departure. In addition to conducting two weeks of volunteer service in‐country, students participate in group discussions and maintain a field notebook, each of which are graded by the ISV project leader. Upon return, students prepare a 10 page academic paper based on their readings, additional research, and their personal experiences. The AU instructor of record will grade final papers, integrate project leader in‐country grades and post final grades. Students from any university can apply to ISV programs and to SFWS for academic credit. Students pay ISV for all aspects of the trip and tuition to AU. The SFWS portion of the tuition will be used to hire and provide travel funds for a full time instructor for in‐country oversight of academic programs, to monitor student reviews of ISV project leaders, and to teach one course in the SFWS each semester. Any additional funds generated will be used to develop scholarships for SFWS students to travel abroad. Benefits to ISV include a recognized <b>institutional</b> <b>partner</b> to provide students academic credit and funding to support the academic portions of their programs. Benefits to AU and the SFWS include international coursework, funding for an instructor to grade and oversee the courses, two new courses taught per academic year and scholarship funds for students. Benefits to students include opportunities for volunteer service projects that meet rigorous academic standards and credit that can be transferred to their home institution...|$|E
