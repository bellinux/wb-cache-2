Sakaida Kakiemon is said to have learned the <b>enamel</b> <b>porcelain</b> technique from a Chinese artisan in Nagasaki in 1643. He was the first in Japan to practice overglaze enameling (applying enamel on top of the glazing), a technique developed in China during the Kangxi era of the Qing dynasty. He also refined the method for producing a translucent white glaze.|$|E
50|$|In late 1977 the {{manufacture}} of plates was standardized {{and they were all}} made on a pressed steel rectangle; previously plates had been plastic, cast iron, <b>enamel,</b> <b>porcelain</b> or even plaster. In around 1982, after 19-B-9999 had been reached, it was decided to begin the series 1-B with five digits. In 1983, after a brief reorganization of the counties, IF (Ilfov County) was dropped, CL (Călărași County) and GR (Giurgiu County) were introduced, and the Bucharest Agricultural Sector (Sectorul Agricol Ilfov) issued plates beginning with 9-B and followed by five digits.

40|$|The {{innovation}} of enamels and enamel painting techniques on porcelain {{during the}} 1720 s marked {{the establishment of}} a new type of porcelain product which soon {{played a significant role in}} Chinese porcelain consumption, both domestically and globally. Yet, the impact of this innovation on production and consumption has rarely been studied. This thesis addresses this gap by offering a historical perspective on eighteenth century Chinese <b>enamelled</b> <b>porcelain,</b> its production and consumption, both in domestic and export markets. It is demonstrated that both the Qing court and the local manufactures responded actively to new technological developments. Following the discussion on how the court and local manufactures interacted and the technology was transferred, my thesis continues to demonstrate the impact of technological innovation on the domestic and export markets. It has shown in domestic market, <b>enamelled</b> <b>porcelain</b> was not only consumed by the imperial court, as current scholarship assumed, rather it had reached a wider set of consumers. In terms of export porcelain trade, my detailed examinations and analyses of the English East India Company Records demonstrate that <b>enamelled</b> <b>porcelain</b> played significant roles over different periods. Overall, this research contributes to knowledge about <b>enamelled</b> <b>porcelain</b> consumption in eighteenth-century China and beyond, and also sheds light on the study of Chinese porcelain and the Chinese porcelain trade. The discussion on the <b>enamelled</b> <b>porcelain</b> trade between China and the English East India Company during the eighteenth century provides a detailed insight into how the Chinese porcelain trade developed and changed over time...|$|R

40|$|Statement of the problem: Surface {{residual}} stress {{is an important}} factor in the comparison of the resistance to fracture of ceramic restorative materials because flaws or cracks may arise in a material or nucleate while in service, and sudden fractures can arise at stresses well below the yield stress. Vicker’s hardness microfracture indentation (IM) has been used as a simple method to measure fracture toughness of ceramics and then applied to the estimation of {{residual stress}}. Although the IM method is simple and convenient, it is a destructive process and not appropriate for the examination of finished materials. Objective: the aim of this study was to attempt the estimation of residual stress in dental porcelain by examining the changes of the Raman spectrum. For comparison, the residual stresses in the specimens were also estimated by the indentation micro-fracture method. Methods: In this study, residual stresses were generated in commercial <b>enamel</b> <b>porcelain</b> (VMK 95, Vita) disks by tempering or ion exchange. In tempering, porcelain discs were reheated at 650, 750, 850, or 950 °C for 5 min each and then removed from the furnace and cooled by convection. For ion exchange, the porcelain discs were coated with a commercial paste (Ceramicoat, GC, Tokyo, Japan) and reheated at 450 °C for 15, 20, and 30 min. Results: The specimens were analyzed using a laser-Raman spectroscopy to estimate the residual stresses. The Raman shift of the largest peak near 500 cm- 1 originated from Silica was used as an indicator of the level of residual stress. The residual stress in the specimen was also estimated by the indentation micro-fracture method, the obtained results were compared to that of laser-Raman spectroscopy. The Raman shift of the porcelain increased with increasing residual stress. The increase in the Raman shift corresponded to the increase in the compressive stress.

40|$|In Japan, {{ceramics}} {{has long}} been considered a medium associated with elevated aesthetic expression and high cultural capital. However, {{the late nineteenth and}} twentieth centuries saw transformations of its epistemological underpinnings. The collapse of the feudal system gave rise to the multivalenced concept of "art craft" (bijutsu kôgei) that included "art ceramics. " For individual artists like Tomimoto Kenkichi (1886 - 1963), ceramics traversed a parallel path with other mediums of modern art that emphasized self-expression and hybridizations of multiple geo-historical sources. Ultimately, these ceramics became significant state-supported symbols of the nation. An analysis of the art, praxis, and theories of Tomimoto Kenkichi presents an ideal case study for illuminating the central mechanisms responsible for the emergence and development of modern Japanese art ceramics. With a wide angle yet critical perspective lacking in previous studies, this dissertation not only reveals Tomimoto's complex individual role in the history of modern ceramics, but also sheds light on the ontology of modern Japanese craft itself. By considering Tomimoto's entire oeuvre [...] including calligraphy, ceramics, design goods, painting, and prints [...] we may track the development of his modernist embrace of the direct observation of nature, abstract form, and original expression. His praxis, synergistically modeled on William Morris and Ogata Kenzan, reveals a modernist stance towards Japanese literati culture in which ceramics became a medium negotiating between British Arts and Crafts design; modernist European sculpture; and Chinese, Korean, and Japanese historical ceramics. The dissertation's diachronic structure charts artistic concepts, ideologies, and creative works from the late Meiji to the mid-Shôwa eras, relying on formal analysis as well as organizational analysis of pedagogical systems, art organizations, and exhibition structures. Chapter One considers Tomimoto's lineal inheritances, university education, and self-study. Chapter Two explores Tomimoto's discourse of self-expression and the equivalency of artistic mediums. Chapter Three deconstructs the image of the ceramic vessel and Tomimoto's discourse of ceramic form according to respective engagements with Joseon porcelain and modernist sculpture. Chapter Four analyzes the sinophilic and modernist aspects of his overglaze <b>enamel</b> <b>porcelain.</b> Finally, Chapter Five surveys the role of exhibitions and preservation efforts in positioning ceramics as art and national tradition...|$|E

50|$|<b>Porcelain</b> <b>enamel</b> {{has been}} applied to jewelry metals such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity for the {{purposes}} of decoration. It was not until the Industrial Revolution that ferrous metals first became the subject of <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamelling</b> processes; these first attempts were met with limited success. A reliably successful technique was not developed until the middle of the 19th century, with the development of a method for enamelling cast-iron cooking pots in Germany. It was not long before this method of enamelling became outdated with the development of new ferrous substrates, and most modern research into <b>porcelain</b> <b>enamelling</b> is concerned with creating an acceptable bond between enamels and new metal substrates.|$|R
50|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>enamelled</b> <b>porcelain</b> near Arita in Kyushu began Kakiemon-style decoration in overglazed coloured enamels. The {{success of the}} Japanese {{was due to the}} failure of the Chinese industry under the Ming Dynasty until it was reestablished under the Qing dynasty. However, in this brief period Kakiemon emerged with this new technique and style. These elephants are thought to have been made in 1660 to 1690. They would have been made by casting into moulds and the remains of broken elephant shaped moulds have been found in modern excavations at Arita. Meissen porcelain, which was developed in the 18th century, is considered to have been strongly influenced by the Kakiemon Japanese imports.|$|R
