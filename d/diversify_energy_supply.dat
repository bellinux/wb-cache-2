It explains radical and practical ways to reduce non-CO2 human forcing of climate. It argues that improved climate risk management is a valid policy goal, and is not simply congruent with carbon policy. It explains the political prerequisite of energy efficiency strategies as a first step and documents how this can achieve real emissions reductions. But, above all, it emphasises the primacy of accelerating decarbonisation of energysupply. This calls for very substantially increased investment in innovation in noncarbon energy sources in order to <b>diversify</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> technologies.

In this context the appeal of Agro-Energy has increased: Agro-Energy is an alternative energy source which guarantees maximum energy security {{while at the same time}} having a less disruptive environmental impact. Policies aimed at providing incentives for Agro-Energy crops combined with the lack of foresight of the European legislature in defining the contents of the medium-term CAP reform have implied a considerable shrinking of other crops directly or indirectly used as food. Growing crops for bioenergy or biofuels is increasingly viewed as conflicting with food production. Balancing the needs of eco-compatible energetic production of agricultural origin with the need to safeguard the basic rights of food is indispensable. The new CAP tries to take that into account.

40|$|The {{resurgence}} of global interest in nuclear energy {{is fueled by}} growing energy demands, concerns of global warming, {{and the desire to}} <b>diversify</b> <b>energy</b> <b>supply.</b> In order for the nuclear renaissance to be safely realized, a number of concerns must first be addressed. Foremost among them are the dual-use nature of nuclear technology and the spread of nuclear weapons. As small nuclear power programs expand and new states introduce nuclear power into their electricity grid, states must {{decide whether or not to}} develop indigenous enrichment and reprocessing facilities that may be misused for a weapons program. One of the must discussed instruments to strengthen the nonproliferation regime and limit the dangerous spread of sensitive fuel cycle technologies is the multilateralzation of the nuclear fuel cycle. Through multilateral mechanisms, multilateral arrangements to the nuclear fuel cycle attempt to limit the spread of fuel cycle technologies by removing the incentives to do so. Concepts and proposals for multilateral arrangements have been around since the advent of nuclear energy in the 1940 s but have received a lukewarm response from the international community. It is postulated that this response is driven by difficulties multilateral arrangements have in addressing all of the motivations for the establishment of fuel cycle facilities. An investigation is presented within to detail the most powerful motivations that multilateral arrangements may have been overlooking to this date. In order to achieve this, three case studies are performed to uncover the most powerful motivations for the development of fuel cycle facilities. The motivations are complex and include a variety of economic, political, and potentially proliferation related incentives. Brazil, South Korea, and Iran are chosen for the case studies because they are currently in the process of introducing sensitive facilities into their nuclear fuel cycles, or are strongly considering it. Following the description of the various motivations for the pursuit of sensitive fuel cycle facilities, an analysis is provided to determine which, if any, of the proposed multilateral arrangements are in best position to be successfully implemented. The study found that the establishment of regional nuclear fuel cycle facilities and centers offers the greatest potential to strengthen the nonproliferation regime by targeting the state's political power incentives. Supply assurances do not address the needs of any of the studied states, indicating they are not applicable to well-developed nuclear power states or those in possession fuel cycle technologies. Supply assurances do however, provide strong confidence building measures in the establishment of regional fuel cycles. Lastly, the development of multilateral spent-fuel repositories may be the most sure-fired way to prevent the spread of reprocessing facilities. by Paul Youchak. Thesis (S. B.)

PBFs in 17 states and Washington, D. C. provide nearly $ 1 billion annually for energy efficiency and related programs. States with restructured as well as traditional electricity markets are using PBFs as a component of their clean energy policy portfolios. PBFs, also known as system benefits charges (SBCs) or clean energy funds, are typically created by levying a small charge on every customer’s electricity bill. These funds provide an annual revenue stream to fund energy efficiency programs. The charges range from 0. 03 to 3 mills 12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and are equivalent to about $ 0. 27 to $ 2. 50 on a residential customer’s monthly energy bill (ACEEE 2004 b).

The available biomass resources (e. g. straw and crop residues) for energy use in China are abundant. As one bioenergy technology, straw-fired cogeneration technology can provide clean energy in rural areas in China. In recent years, some investors have shown their interests in developing straw-fired cogeneration plants. Some projects are already in the pipeline and the number of projects is expected to increase in the near future. However, there exist technical as well as economic barriers hindering the implementation of straw-fired cogeneration projects. These barriers include 1) feedstock preparation barrier regarding the straw collection, transportation, treatment and storage and less incentives from farmers; 2) some technical and production operation management barriers; 3) over-expected market demands; 4) economic barriers; 5) lack of strong policy support, etc. In this paper, all these barriers have been studied and analyzed.

The environmental sustainability of bioenergy production systems is often determined through life-cycle assessments that focus on global environmental effects, such as the emission of greenhouse gases or air pollutants. Local/regional environmental impacts, e. g., the impacts on soil or on biodiversity, require site-specific and flexible options {{for the assessment of}} environmental sustainability, such as the criteria and indicators used in bioenergy certification schemes. In this study, we compared certification schemes and assessed the indicator quality through the environmental impact categories, using a standardized rating scale to evaluate the indicators. Current certification schemes have limitations in their representation of the environmental systems affected by feedstock production. For example, these schemes predominantly use feasible causal indicators, instead of more reliable but less feasible effect indicators. Furthermore, the comprehensiveness of the depicted environmental systems and the causal links between human land use activities and biophysical processes in these systems have been assessed. Bioenergy certification schemes seem to demonstrate compliance with underlying legislation, such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive, rather than ensure environmental sustainability. Beyond, certification schemes often lack a methodology or thresholds for sustainable biomass use. Lacking thresholds, imprecise causal links and incomplete indicator sets may hamper comparisons of the environmental performances of different feedstocks. To enhance existing certification schemes, we propose combining the strengths of several certification schemes with research-based indicators, to increase the reliability of environmental assessments...|$|R
