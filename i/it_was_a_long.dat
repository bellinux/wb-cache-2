5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time after}} the Brooks–Baxter War that people of Arkansas allowed another Republican to become governor. The {{following}} 35 governors of Arkansas, ruling {{for a total of}} 90 years, were all Democrats, until Republican Winthrop Rockefeller became governor in 1966 defeating James D. Johnson. Winthrop became governor while his brother Nelson was governor of New York, while the defeat of Johnson in Arkansas and William M. Rainach in Louisiana ended the once mighty hold of segregation over politics.|$|E
5|$|The 22nd also participated, {{in a minor}} capacity, in the Battle of Chancellorsville. On April 27, Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin's division, {{including}} the 22nd, was ordered to secure the fords along the Rapidan River. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> rapid, forced march for the division. The Confederate army launched a daring and successful flank attack against the Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, during which the 22nd saw little action. The Union army, badly defeated, retreated back across the Rappahannock and the 22nd returned to Camp Gove on May 8.|$|E
5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E

5|$|As the Empire of Japan invaded and {{occupied}} Shanghai {{and much of}} east China, Hu Die and Pan Yousheng fled to British Hong Kong. Hu Die {{gave birth to a}} daughter and a boy during this time. Pan worked for a trading firm in Hong Kong, while she also made two films. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, Hong Kong also fell to the Japanese. The Japanese pressured her to make a documentary film entitled Hu Die Touring Tokyo for their war propaganda, but Hu Die refused to become a collaborator, and secretly escaped to inland Chongqing, the war-time capital of the Republic of China resistance. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and circuitous journey through a war zone. She entrusted her belongings to the underground, and casually walked out of her Hong Kong home one day. Resistance partisans guided her through the New Territories to Guangdong province. She stayed in Shaoguan {{for a year and a}} half before leaving for Guilin in Guangxi, and did not reach Chongqing until the end of 1943.|$|E
5|$|Corippus narrates the {{subsequent}} battle at length, but his imitation of Virgilian verse provides little concrete detail: {{it is clear}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> indecisive, and bloody conflict, which probably took place to the south or east of Sbeitla in late 546 or early 547. Eventually, the Byzantines prevailed and drove back the Moors, breaking through their defences and storming their camp. According to Corippus, Ierna, who was the chief priest of the god Gurzil, was killed while trying to protect an image of the god. Many other tribal leaders fell, and the remainder scattered. The remains of the Tripolitanian tribes abandoned Byzacena, and Antalas was forced to lay down arms. In addition, many prisoners were released from the Moorish camp, and among the treasures captured there were the military standards lost by Solomon at Cillium in 544. These were dispatched to Constantinople, while Troglita held a triumphal entry into Carthage.|$|E

There was a pulpit in the west wall to allow a monk to read to the community during the meal. The kitchen lies west; it had a central fireplace, as was Cistercian custom, and was placed to allow food to be served through hatches both to the choir monks' refectory and to the separate dining hall for the lay brothers on the west side.|$|E

5|$|Parma {{was more}} than willing to help. The Electorate, {{strategically}} important to Spain, offered another land route by which to approach the rebellious northern Provinces of the Netherlands. Although the Spanish road from Spain's holdings on the Mediterranean shores led to its territories in what is today Belgium, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> arduous march, complicated by the provisioning of troops and the potentially hostile populations of the territories through which it passed. An alternative route on the Rhine promised better access to the Habsburg Netherlands. Furthermore, the presence of a Calvinist electorate almost on the Dutch border could delay their efforts to bring the rebellious Dutch back to the Spanish rule and the Catholic confession. Philip II and his generals could be convinced to support Ernst's cause for such considerations. Indeed, the process of intervention had started earlier. In 1581, Philip's forces, paid for by papal gold, had taken Aachen, which Protestants had seized; by the mid–1580s, the Duke of Parma's forces, encouraged by the Wittelsbachs and the Catholics in Cologne, had secured garrisons throughout the northern territories of the Electorate. By 1590, these garrisons gave Spain access to the northern provinces and Philip felt comfortable enough with his military access to the provinces, and with their isolation from possible support by German Protestants, to direct more of his attention to France, and less to his problems with the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal (Now known as Skaka) {{and the other}} was through Mesopotamia passing though Raqqa. Since the Muslim forces in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the {{conventional}} route to Syria via Daumat-ul-Jandal because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also avoided the Mesopotamian route {{because of the presence of}} Roman garrisons in northern Syria and Mesopotamia. Engaging them at the time when Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria, was also ruled out since it would mean fighting on two fronts. Khalid selected a rather shorter route to Syria which unconventionally passed though the Syrian Desert. He marched his army though the desert, where traditions tells that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water, before reaching a pre-decided water source at an oasis. Khalid is said to have solved the water shortage issue using a Bedouin method. Camels were made to drink water after intentionally denying them water for a lengthy time period, encouraging the camels to drink a lot of water at one time. Camels have the ability to store water in their stomach which in turn could be obtained by slaughtering them when necessary. Muslim troops rode entirely on camels and this method became an effective one for the Muslim army.|$|E

25|$|An {{interesting}} interlude {{was provided}} by Hibs' participation as the Toronto-based franchise in the United Soccer Association.

25|$|The terrain {{surrounding}} the training area at Wilsons Promontory {{consisted of a}} number of high, rugged and heavily wooded mountains, swift streams and swamps. It was considered ideal for the six-week training course that the first members of the 2/6th had to endure before they were deployed operationally. Initially training stores were scarce, particularly signalling and engineering stores, and as such there was at first a large focus upon physical training. Training was conducted six days and five nights a week and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> gruelling course. As a result, after the first week, 32 men from the initial intake of 300 were removed from training as being unsuitable.|$|E
25|$|This {{lasted for}} almost nine months from December 1944 {{right up to}} the end of the war in August 1945, during which time the 2/8th was in action almost continuously. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and hard campaign, and to a large extent this made up for the long periods of {{inactivity}} that the squadron had suffered while it had been garrisoned in Australia. Certainly the squadron was in the thick of it, with many of its members distinguishing themselves during this time, as evidenced by the rather large number of decorations 2/8th members earned in such a short space of time. The patrols during this time were conducted in small groups, usually no larger than two sections roughly 18–20 men, and they would last for between four and six days, although some lasted up to nine. Sometimes they would employ barges to move along the coast.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{nationalism}} {{tended to}} see prostitution and venereal disease as legacies of colonialism {{that could be}} resolved through independence. This movement became linked to Catholic conservatism which demanded social purification of the pure Irish soul. Thus the 1920s saw the decline of Monto, as the Legion of Mary founded and led by Frank Duff successfully crusaded to close down the brothels of Monto and bring religion to the area. Prostitution continued {{to exist in the}} form of individual women selling sexual services on the streets in cities, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before organised prostitution was seen again. However, street prostitution remained intrinsically linked to the Dublin Underworld. The 1920s and 1930s witnessed a new era Church-State morality and censorship. The Magdalene Asylums became more punitive, imprisoning young women who transgressed conventional sexual morality, some for the duration of their lives, the last asylum closing only in 1996.|$|E
