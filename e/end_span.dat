40|$|Recent {{earthquakes}} {{have demonstrated}} the vulnerability of cable-stayed bridges to near-fault earthquake excitation. The <b>end</b> <b>span</b> connections of the Higashi-Kobe cable-stayed bridge fractured during the Hyogoken-Nanbu (Kobe) Earthquake in 1995 causing moderate damage to the overall system [1, 2]. The end spans of the Chi-Lu cable-stayed bridge rose vertically out of their transverse shear keys during the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan resulting in extensive damage to the non-ductile superstructure at the superstructure to central pylon connection [3]. This paper explores isolation for protecting these structural systems due to large magnitude, near source seismic events. Using isolation devices under the central pylon in conjunction with isolation devices at the <b>end</b> <b>span</b> connections, the complete system can be isolated and the superstructure can be protected. This paper focuses on issues related to isolating the bridge in the transverse direction. This form of isolation minimizes the demands to both the superstructure and substructure elements. Flexible bearings are provided connecting the end spans to the substructure and the pylon base to the foundation. These isolator groups are tuned such that a vibration mode is created where the superstructure is engaged primarily in translation.

30|$|In {{the case}} of the rod lengths of 2, 4, and 6  cm, {{although}} drag forces were higher than added mass forces when the rotational motion starts, the magnitudes of the two forces reversed during rotation (Fig.  5 a–c). Each arrow mark shown in Fig.  5 a–c represents the point where the two forces are reversed. The rotational angle where the reversal of magnitudes of the two forces occurred became smaller with greater rod length (2  cm: 50.7 °, 4  cm: 29.5 °, 6  cm: 11.20 °). In these three rod lengths, {{it was found that the}} reversals of magnitudes of the two forces occurred when the velocity at the <b>end</b> <b>span</b> of the rod was 0.5  m/s. Therefore, drag force is larger than added mass force when the velocity of the <b>end</b> <b>span</b> is higher than 0.5  m/s, but vice versa when it is lower than 0.5  m/s. On the other hand, added mass force is higher than drag force from start to finish for the rod length of 8  cm.|$|E
30|$|We have {{analyzed}} the relative magnitudes of four force elements (mass force, drag force, buoyancy force, force by the viscous flow, and surface tension force) {{according to the}} rod length, when hydrophobic rods have rotational motion with high speed moving into water from the water surface.

While added mass force and drag force are dominant regardless of the rod length, buoyancy force and surface tension force are relatively small. In {{the case of the}} rod lengths of 2, 4, 6  cm, although drag forces were higher than added mass forces when the rotational motion starts, the magnitudes of the two forces were reversed during rotation. For these three rod lengths, it was found that reversals of magnitudes of the two forces occurred when the velocity at the <b>end</b> <b>span</b> of the rod was 0.5  m/s.

40|$|The {{development}} of transport infrastructure, reconstruction of roads and railways, together with growing urban traffic necessitate {{the construction of}} new bridges and/or the reconstruction of existing ones. The primary objective of design is obtaining a reasonable system in compliance with the requirements for stress-strain state: equal strength or equal torque, maximum rigidity or minimum weight of the structure. In the paper, the object of optimization is the design of a three-span girder bridge of a specified length under the constant load. The sets of both statically determinate and statically indeterminate systems are considered, namely: three-span hinged girders in which the hinge joints are located in the end spans or middle span, and three-span continuous girders on unilateral supports or on resilient supports. Two variable design parameters are taken into account: the length of each <b>end</b> <b>span</b> z 1 and the position of the hinges x for the statically determinate systems, and the displacement of support assemblies joints Δ or the value that affects the displacement, i. e. flexibility of yielding supports c for the statically indeterminate ones.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of structural materials and sensor technology has impacted the bridge industry by improving the robustness {{of the highway}} network and providing behavior based condition assessments. During the last decades, conventional materials have been supplemented with state-of-the-art materials (e. g., carbon and fiber based, ultra-high performance concrete, etc.). The {{evolution of}} smart or intelligent structures by incorporating systems to quantify performance will continue to revolutionize the bridge industry. While laboratory and field applications have indicated that smart materials are appropriate for bridge applications, additional investigations regarding sensor installation, deployment and data reduction are still needed. The work described herein {{is a collection of}} field and laboratory tests in which sensors were applied to verify structural and material behavior and develop smart members for integration as part of a structural health monitoring system for bridge superstructures. Three projects are presented in which new materials and unique structures were evaluated using specialized sensors and monitoring techniques. Two basket-handle arch pedestrian bridges with high-strength steel hanger rods supporting a pre-cast, post-tensioned concrete panel deck system were monitored to prevent deck cracks {{in the vicinity of the}} hanger rods. Fiber optic sensors and externally mounted accelerometers were attached to the hanger rods to indirectly determine the tensile forces during incremental construction stages and in service conditions. For the second project, a three-span prestressed concrete (PC) girder, composite deck bridge was monitored and evaluated. One <b>end</b> <b>span</b> consisted of composite FRP deck panels and was compared to the opposite cast-in-place reinforced concrete deck <b>end</b> <b>span.</b> Strategically placed transducers measured strain levels on the PC girders and the FRR panels from controlled live and ambient traffic loadings to determine the degree of composite action, load distribution, and maximum in-service strains. A FRP panel temporary bypass bridge was evaluated as a replacement to typical steel temporary bridges as part of the third project. The research focused on the design, fabrication, construction and load testing of this state-of-the-art bridge. This bridge was instrumented with transducers for measuring deflections and loaded with a static truck at pertinent locations to evaluate its performance. A five year research plan was established to develop a conceptual smart timber bridge made of glued laminated (glulam) stringers and a transverse glulam deck. Both stock and custom fiber optic sensor packages were implemented to quantify the structural response. The first of multiple phases of this national five year plan includes the development of an efficient structural health monitoring system and a smart timber bridge field demonstration. To support these goals, two types of FBG sensors packages were developed, the first evaluated the structural strain response and the second isolated the sensor from mechanical strain for detecting deterioration parameters (e. g., moisture content, corrosion, wood deterioration, etc.). Techniques were developed for embedding and attaching the FBG sensor packages to glulam specimens. Small scale specimens were instrumented with the custom FBG sensor packages and tested under a range of temperature and loading conditions to determine sensor viability. A full scale glulam beam was instrumented with similar FBG sensor packages to demonstrate applicability and evaluate performance at service level proportions. From this work, the following contributions in structural bridge monitoring were added to the state-of-the-art: *	Application of FBG sensors and accelerometers to monitor the structural behavior of a bridge during construction. *	Applied testing of non-traditional FRP deck panels to validate composite action. *	Initial development of a smart timber bridge structural health monitoring system. *	Development of FBG sensor packages for implementation in glulam members as part of a smart timber bridge...|$|E
40|$|In 1957, the Iowa State Highway Commission, with {{financial}} {{assistance from the}} aluminum industry, constructed a 220 -ft (67 -m) long, four-span continuous, aluminum girder bridge to carry traffic on Clive Road (86 th Street) over Interstate 80 near Des Moines, Iowa. The bridge had four, welded I-shape girders that were fabricated in pairs with welded diaphragms between an exterior and an interior girder. The interior diaphragms between the girder pairs were bolted to girder brackets. A composite, reinforced concrete deck served as the roadway surface. The bridge, which had performed successfully for about 35 years of service, was removed {{in the fall of}} 1993 to make way for an interchange at the same location. Prior to the bridge demolition, load tests were conducted to monitor girder and diaphragm bending strains and deflections in the northern <b>end</b> <b>span.</b> Fatigue testing of the aluminum girders that were removed from the end spans were conducted by applying constant-amplitude, cyclic loads. These tests established the fatigue strength of an existing, welded, flange-splice detail and added, welded, flange-cover plates and horizontal web plate attachment details. This part, Part 2, of the final report focuses on the fatigue tests of the aluminum girder sections that were removed from the bridge and on the analysis of the experimental data to establish the fatigue strength of full-size specimens. Seventeen fatigue fractures that were classified as Category E weld details developed in the seven girder test specimens. Linear regression analyses of the fatigue test results established both nominal and experimental stress-range versus load cycle relationships (SN curves) for the fatigue strength of fillet-welded connections. The nominal strength SN curve obtained by this research essentially matched the SN curve for Category E aluminum weldments given in the AASHTO LRFD specifications. All of the Category E fatigue fractures that developed in the girder test specimens satisfied the allowable SN relationship specified by the fatigue provisions of the Aluminum Association. The lower-bound strength line that was set at two standard deviations below the least squares regression line through the fatigue fracture data points related well with the Aluminum Association SN curve. The results from the experimental tests of this research have provided additional information regarding behavioral characteristics of full-size, aluminum members and have confirmed that aluminum has the strength properties needed for highway bridge girders...|$|E

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of Engineering in Structural Engineering DesignThere are about 4000 bridges on National Road Network with lengths varying from 3. 0 m to about 200. 0 m. These bridges have varying widths about 3. 0 m to 20. 0 m {{and some of these}} bridges has been constructed about 50 to 100 years ago. Most of the Bridges over 30. 0 m spans have been constructed using steel superstructures using Through trusses and are now weak and narrow for the present day traffic. Some of these steel superstructures have been developed as type drawings by then department of Public Works. Due to the cost of the pre-stressed concrete bridges are competitive with steel bridges, new steel bridges are very rear. / The concrete bridges are popular in Sri Lanka and the Pre-stressed girder superstructures are being used for spans in the range of 7. 0 m to 33. 0 m in general. It has gone beyond these typical spans for some places. Warakathota Bridge (Ratnapura district) has been constructed using 39. 0 m (128. 0 feet) Post tension beams. Pre-stressed girder concrete mbridges are being used for bridges in Southern Transport Development Project for spans up to 40. 0 m spans and also Manampitiya Bridge is under construction with <b>end</b> <b>span</b> of 55. 0 m using continuous post tension box girders (Design by Japanese designconsultants). / There are many steel Through truss bridges could be seen in Sri Lanka highways up to about 49. 0 m spans. New Murayama Bridge in Ratnapura has been constructed as variable height Through truss bridge with 99. 0 m long single span. (Design by Japanese design consultants). There is high demand for alternative structural forms with improved bridge aesthetics fc reconstruction of long old bridges or new bridges in long water ways using spans in the range of 30. 0 m to 50. 0 m (medium spans). Prefabricated structures are more preferable for locations with limited access and which helps to reduce the project duration. Steel as a construction material has to be imported and not only cost of material but also fabrication, handling, Protective coating and the maintenance have high unit prices. Therefore, Steel structures with portable steel sections would reduce these all the cost components would competitive with concrete structures for medium span bridges. / This Study is concentrated on the use of Through truss forms in medium span bridges in the range of 30. 0 m to 50. 0 m spans. Three case studies were conducted for 30. 0 m, 40. 0 m and 50. 0 m for each eight number of selected Through truss forms.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the cost-effectiveness of steel girders compared with conventional reinforced concrete girders used in bridge construction in South Africa. The investigation considered an existing bridge which required widening {{as a result of}} increased traffic flow. The consulting engineers chose two 10 m reinforced concrete girders for the <b>end</b> <b>spans,</b> while two 22 m post-tensioned reinforced concrete girders were used for the central spans. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the consulting engineer’s choice, steel girders were designed for the 10 m and 22 m beams based on the relevant South African design codes of practice. The analysis was conducted for both non-composite and composite action between the steel girders and the reinforced concrete bridge deck. Based on the design calculations, a cost comparison was performed. The investigation revealed that steel girders are an economically viable option when off-the-shelf steel sections up to 10 m in length are considered. For the 10 m girders, a significant cost saving was achieved for both non-composite and composite construction compared with reinforced concrete. However, for the 22 m spans, the post-tensioned reinforced concrete girders are significantly more cost-effective compared with steel plate girders. Thus, bridge design engineers should consider steel girders as an option during the conceptual design stage for <b>end</b> <b>spans.</b> A survey was also conducted among senior engineering professionals to determine the reason(s) for the apathy towards using structural steel sections as girders in bridge construction in South Africa...|$|R
