25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has {{the ability}} to metabolise a variety of substrates including n-alkanes, <b>hexadecane</b> and oils. Uptake of these hydrophobic substrates is speculated to rely on the production of rhamnolipids. It is thought that rhamnolipids either cause the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface to become hydrophobic, promoting an interaction between the substrate and the cell, or secreted rhamnolipids emulsify the substrate and allow it to be taken up by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell. There is evidence that rhamnolipids are highly adsorbent to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface, causing it to become hydrophobic. It has also been shown that production of rhamnolipids promotes uptake of <b>hexadecane</b> by overcoming the inhibitory effect of the hydrophilic interactions caused by LPS. Production of rhamnolipids is observed on hydrophobic substrates but equally high yields are achievable on other carbon sources such as sugars. Furthermore, although mono-rhamnolipids have been shown to interact with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell membrane and cause it to become hydrophobic, di-rhamnolipids do not interact well with the cell membrane because the polar head group is too large to penetrate the LPS layer. Therefore, although Rhamnolipids may play a part in interaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with hydrophobic carbon sources, they are likely to have additional functions.|$|E

50|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of the cetane number are rather difficult, as it requires burning the fuel in a rare diesel engine called a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine, under standard test conditions. The operator of the CFR engine uses a hand-wheel to increase the compression ratio (and therefore the peak pressure within the cylinder) of the engine until the time between fuel injection and ignition is 2.407ms.

50|$|Cetane is the {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula n-C16H34, today named <b>hexadecane</b> according to IUPAC rules. It is an unbranched alkane, a saturated hydrocarbon chain with no cycles. Cetane ignites very easily under compression, {{so it was}} assigned a cetane number of 100, while alpha-methyl naphthalene was assigned a cetane number of 0. All other hydrocarbons in diesel fuel are indexed to cetane as to how well they ignite under compression. The cetane number therefore measures how quickly the fuel starts to burn (auto-ignites) under diesel engine conditions. Since {{there are hundreds of}} components in diesel fuel, with each having a different cetane quality, the overall cetane number of the diesel is the average cetane quality of all the components (strictly speaking high-cetane components will have disproportionate influence, hence the use of high-cetane additives).|$|E

40|$|The rhamnolipid biosurfactant {{produced}} by Pseudomonas aeruginosa influences various processes related to hydrocarbon degradation. However, degradation {{can only be}} enhanced by the surfactant when it stimulates {{a process that is}} rate limiting under the applied conditions. Therefore we determined how rhamnolipid influences <b>hexadecane</b> degradation by P. aeruginosa UG 2 under conditions differing in <b>hexadecane</b> availability. The rate of <b>hexadecane</b> degradation in shake flask cultures was lower for <b>hexadecane</b> entrapped in a matrix with 6 nm pores (silica 60) or in quartz sand than for <b>hexadecane</b> immobilized in matrices with pore sizes larger than 300 nm or for <b>hexadecane</b> present as a separate liquid phase. This indicates that the availability of <b>hexadecane</b> decreased with decreasing pore size under these conditions. The rate-limiting step for <b>hexadecane</b> entrapped in silica 60 was the mass transfer of substrate from the matrix to the bulk liquid phase, whereas for <b>hexadecane</b> present as a second liquid phase it was the uptake of the substrate by the cells. <b>Hexadecane</b> degradation in batch incubations was accelerated by the addition of rhamnolipid or other surfactants in all experiments except in those where <b>hexadecane</b> was entrapped in silica 60, indicating that the surfactants stimulated uptake of <b>hexadecane</b> by the cells. Since rhamnolipid stimulated the degradation rate in batch experiments {{to a greater extent than}} any of the other 14 surfactants tested, <b>hexadecane</b> uptake was apparently more enhanced by rhamnolipid than by the other surfactants. Although rhamnolipid did not stimulate the release of <b>hexadecane</b> from silica 60 under conditions of intense agitation, it significantly enhanced this rate during column experiments in the absence of strain UG 2. The results demonstrate that rhamnolipid enhances degradation by stimulating release of entrapped substrate in column studies under conditions of low agitation and by stimulating uptake of substrate by the cells, especially when degradation is not limited by release of substrate from the matrices.

40|$|The {{effect of}} human plasma {{fibronectin}} on the adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes to <b>hexadecane</b> droplets was investigated.

40|$|Laboratory studies {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) on microbial degradation of <b>hexadecane</b> in cultures with sediment-seawater suspensions. With a fermentor system, {{it was possible to}} adjust and regulate different oxic conditions (DOTs between 0. 4 and 80 % of oxygen saturation) as well as anoxia. The effects of DOT reduction on the amount and rate of <b>hexadecane</b> degraded and on the degree of mineralization and on the production of biomass were investigated. When the DOT was reduced from 80 % to 5 %, no dependence of the investigated parameters on the oxygen concentration was found. The amount of <b>hexadecane</b> degraded was constant, with an average value of 86 % of the initially applied amount. The degradation rate was constant even down to 1 % DOT, with an average value of 0. 15 mg of <b>hexadecane</b> per g of sediment per h (16. 2 mg liter- 1 h- 1). The mean degree of mineralization was 70 % of the initially applied <b>hexadecane,</b> and biomass production reached a value of about 1. 5 g per g of <b>hexadecane</b> consumed. A significant influence on the degradation process was detected only with DOTs below 1 %. The degree of mineralization and the amount of degraded <b>hexadecane</b> decreased, whereas the degradation rate was still unaffected. Under anoxic conditions, no <b>hexadecane</b> degradation occurred within 190 h. The fact that the <b>hexadecane</b> biodegradation rate was constant down to at least 0. 04 % DOT shows that the actual oxygen concentration is of minor importance as long as the oxygen supply is high enough to guarantee the oxygen-dependent degradation step...|$|E

30|$|To prevent {{limonene}} volatilizing and {{to extract}} {{it from the}} culture medium, a two-phase culture system composed of n-hexadecane was adopted in this study. <b>Hexadecane</b> was chosen for its high hydrophobicity (log PO/W, 8.8) for the extraction of limonene, and low volatility, which prevents loss due to evaporation.

Instead, <b>hexadecane</b> appeared to enhance lipase secretion, since the amounts of lipase in the culture supernatant increased in the presence of <b>hexadecane,</b> with a concomitant decrease in the cells, even when protein synthesis was inhibited with chloramphenicol. In the presence of olive oil as a carbon source, nonionic detergents, such as Tween 80, increased extracellular lipase activity twofold. Like <b>hexadecane,</b> Tween 80 appeared to stimulate lipase secretion, although in a more disruptive manner, since other, normally nonsecreted proteins were found in the culture supernatant. Additionally, like olive oil, Tween 80 was found to induce lipase gene expression in strain PG 1 in medium containing sucrose as a carbon source but not in glucose-containing medium, suggesting that lipase gene expression is prone to catabolite repression. In contrast, lipase production in the lipase-overproducing strain LU 8093 was independent of the presence of an inducer and was not inhibited by glucose.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the hydrophobicities of 23 urogenital, dairy, poultry, and American Type Culture Collection {{isolates}} of lactobacilli and to determine the effect on hydrophobicity of serially passaging the strains in liquid medium. To this end, strains were grown after isolation and identification and then serially passaged up to 20 times. Hydrophobicity was assessed through contact angle measurements on lawns of cells by using water, formamide, methylene iodide, 1 -bromonaphthalene, and <b>hexadecane</b> as wetting agents and through measurement of their partitioning in a hexadecane-water system. The hydrophobicities of these strains varied widely, with Lactobacillus casei strains being predominantly hydrophilic and L. acidophilus strains being mostly hydrophobic. For some isolates, serial passaging was accompanied by a clear loss of hydrophobic surface properties, whereas for other strains, cultures became heterogeneous in that some cells had already lost their hydrophobic surface properties while others were still hydrophobic. Adhesion of this collection of lactobacilli to <b>hexadecane</b> droplets in microbial adhesion to <b>hexadecane</b> (MATH) tests was driven by their aversion to water rather than by their affinity for <b>hexadecane,</b> as concluded from the fact that <b>hexadecane</b> contact angles were zero for all strains.

Rhamnolipid also enhanced the rate of epoxidation of the aliphatic hydrocarbon alpha,omega-tetradecadiene by a cell suspension of P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the uptake of the hydrophobic probe 1 -naphthylphenylamine by cells of P. aeruginosa was enhanced by rhamnolipid, as indicated by stopped-flow fluorescence experiments.

The presence of each of the four NAPLs increased fractions and rates of pyrene desorption, and <b>hexadecane</b> slowed the effects of aging on these same parameters. Loading with <b>hexadecane</b> and HMN caused earthworm accumulation of pyrene to decrease. These results contrast with generally observed faster desorption rates resulting from NAPL addition, suggesting that additional factors (e. g., association of pyrene with NAPL phases and NAPL toxicities to earthworms) may impact bioaccumulation. The presence of HMN and toluene increased pyrene biodegradation, whereas <b>hexadecane</b> and DMP had the opposite effects.
