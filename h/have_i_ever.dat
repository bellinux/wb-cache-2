25|$|Comedy Against Humanity, {{which was}} an improvisational show {{inspired}} by the party game Cards Against Humanity, was one of Under the Gun Theater’s more successful shows. According to Drew Wancket of the Chicago Stage Standard, he considered it, “enormously funny, and the audience ate it up.” Wancket went on to write, “With iO moving south, Under The Gun is positioning itself {{to be the new}} force for comedy on the North Side.” The show, however, eventually closed due to fear of litigation from Cards Against Humanity. In response to the closing of their show, the theater created a different interactive show inspired by the drinking game Never <b>Have</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever.</b>|$|E

500|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} that Prescott was completely blind, {{which seems to have}} stemmed from a misunderstanding of his comment in the preface to The Conquest of Mexico, in which he stated, [...] "Nor <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> corrected, or even read, my own original draft". The myth was further propagated by a contemporary New York review of the Conquest, and has been a common theme in popular accounts of his work. Other related embellishments of Prescott's disability have also occurred—Samuel Eliot Morison, writing in a 1959 article for The Atlantic Monthly, claimed that Prescott had an artificial eye, although {{there is no evidence to}} suggest this. It has been argued that Prescott's biographers have naturally been drawn to romanticize his life due to Prescott's own romantic style of history.|$|E

500|$|... "Stupid in Love" [...] is a R power ballad which {{lasts for}} 4:01 (four minutes, one second). Instrumentation is {{provided}} by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs, a style of repeated chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] revolve around a woman in an abusive and adulterous relationship, progressing to the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend. The song begins with the line [...] "Let me tell you somethin' / Never / <b>Have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> / Been a size 10 in my whole life." [...] Rihanna sings the line [...] "This is stupid / I'm not stupid / Don't talk to me / Like I'm stupid" [...] during the chorus. The bridge consists of Rihanna singing [...] "Trying {{to make this work}} / but you act like a jerk." [...] As noted by Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice, the bridge represents the moment when Rihanna realizes that it is not worth her while to stay in the relationship, writing [...] "the dunce cap is off". [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] contains a lyrical metaphor, [...] "Blood on your hands." ...|$|E
500|$|While Nelson was {{apparently}} convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine, most biographers, researchers, and other observers {{have concluded that}} his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic. He told Dobson that [...] "true crime" [...] detective magazines had [...] "corrupted" [...] him and [...] "fueled [...] fantasies ... {{to the point of}} becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, [...] "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [...] two or three occasions <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> picked one up." [...] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer. [...] "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. [...] "The problem was Bundy." [...] "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," [...] wrote Rule. [...] "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on himself, but on us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{second part}} {{involves}} {{a set of}} conversational questions, e.g. [...] ".. why <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> loved, why {{in my whole life}} <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> desired anything except You, Jesus my God?..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{criticism}} of Kejriwal's {{style of leadership}} continued with National Executive member Yogendra Yadav's letter to his party members, in which he claimed the members were [...] "falling prey to personality cult". He said [...] "Let me reiterate that Arvind bhai is no ordinary leader {{and there are no}} two opinions about his continuing as the national convener; nor <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> doubted his status as first among equals within the party's leadership. The real question is whether there are limits to personal discretion of the leader." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bachmann has {{replied that}} [...] "the {{intention}} of the letters was to outline the serious national security concerns I had and ask for answers to questions regarding the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical group's access to top Obama administration officials". In a July 19 interview with radio and TV show host Glenn Beck, Bachmann repeated and expanded her allegations, accusing Ellison of having [...] "a long record of being associated with the Council on American–Islamic Relations and with the Muslim Brotherhood". Ellison replied that [...] "I am not now, nor <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> been, associated with the Muslim Brotherhood." ...|$|E

In his book P.S. Jack Paar, he recalled doing utility duty at WGAR in 1938 when Orson Welles broadcast his famous simulated alien invasion, The War of the Worlds, over the CBS network (and its WGAR affiliate). Attempting to calm possible panicked listeners, Paar announced, [...] "The world is not coming to an end. Trust me. When <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> lied to you?" ...|$|E

60|$|Ordinarily Dan is the swiftest of boatmen. To-day he was {{slower than}} {{molasses}} {{and all he}} did went wrong. What he said about the luck was more than melancholy. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no way to gauge my own feelings because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never had such an experience before.

2500|$|Allan {{eventually}} {{lost the}} case on 5 August 1992. The judge found that Channel 4's allegations had not defamed Allan, {{although he did not}} rule on whether or not there had been an affair. The outcome received major media attention in South Africa and the United Kingdom, appearing {{on the front page of}} seven major newspaper such as The Times, Daily Telegraph, The Independent and The Guardian. Reports later emerged that Allan was considering an appeal and that Terre'Blanche was considering suing the broadcaster for libel. Following the verdict, Allan reiterated her stance [...] "I am not, nor <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> been, involved with Terre'Blanche". Taki Theodoracopolous paid £5, 000 for the court records and gave them to Allan as he believed she had [...] "been mugged".|$|E
2500|$|In Basel, Holbein's legacy {{was secured}} {{by his friend}} Amerbach and by Amerbach's son Basilius, who {{collected}} his work. The Amerbach-Kabinett later formed {{the core of the}} Holbein collection at the Kunstmuseum Basel. Although Holbein's art was also valued in England, few 16th-century English documents mention him. Archbishop Matthew Parker (1504–75) observed that his portraits were [...] "dilineated and expressed to the resemblance of life". At the end of the 16th century, the miniature portraitist Nicholas Hilliard spoke in his treatise Arte of Limning of his debt to Holbein: [...] "Holbein's manner <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> imitated, and hold it for the best". No account of Holbein's life was written until Karel van Mander's often inaccurate [...] "Schilder-Boeck" [...] (Painter-Book) of 1604.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is ironic}} that an {{acclaimed}} biblical novel, one that would rival the Bible in popularity during the Gilded Age, {{was inspired by a}} discussion with a noted agnostic and written by an author who was never a member of any church. Its publication prompted speculation about Wallace’s faith. Wallace claimed that when he began writing Ben-Hur, he was not [...] "in the least influenced by religious sentiment" [...] and [...] "had no convictions about God or Christ", but he was fascinated by the biblical story of the three Magi's journey to find Jesus, king of the Jews. After extensive studies of the Bible and the Holy Land, and well before he had completed the novel, Wallace became a believer in God and Christ. In his autobiography Wallace acknowledged:In the very beginning, before distractions overtake me, I wish to say that I believe absolutely in the Christian conception of God. As far as it goes, this confession is broad and unqualified, and it ought and would be sufficient were it not that books of mine—Ben-Hur and The Prince of India—have led many persons to speculate concerning my creed ... I am not a member of any church or denomination, nor <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> been. Not that churches are objectionable to me, but simply because my freedom is enjoyable, and I do not think myself good enough to be a communicant.|$|E
