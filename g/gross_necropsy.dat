Between 24 and 27 months postinoculation, 3 animals became recumbent and were euthanized. <b>Gross</b> <b>necropsies</b> revealed emaciation in 2 animals and a large pulmonary abscess in the third. Brains were examined for protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting and for scrapie-associated fibrils (SAFs) by negative-stain electron microscopy. Microscopic lesions in the brain were subtle in 2 animals and absent in the third case. However, all 3 animals were positive for PrPres by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, and SAFs were detected in 2 of the animals. An uninoculated control animal euthanized during the same period did not have PrPres in its brain. These are preliminary observations from a currently in-progress experiment. Three years after the CWD challenge, the 10 remaining inoculated cattle are alive and apparently healthy.

50|$|In pigs T. suis egg {{production}} is sporadic, complicating diagnosis by fecal flotation.

40|$|Abstract: Most of {{the methods}} used to deflight birds have one or more disadvantages, {{including}} impermanence, poor cosmetic appearance, or impairment of breeding function. We hypothesized that transection of the tendon of the supracoracoideus muscle at its insertion on the proximal humerus would impair a bird’s ability to raise the affected wing and thus result in flightlessness. The purpose of this project was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of unilateral or bilateral surgical tenectomy of the supracoracoideus muscle in deflighting cockatiels and pigeons. Six pigeons (Co-lumba livia) and 9 cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) were included in the study. Three cockatiels were included in a sham group, and 3 birds of each species were included in a unilateral or bilateral tenectomy group. The birds in the sham group did not have flight difficulties at any time after surgery. Three cockatiels and 1 pigeon in the unilateral tenectomy group were flying within 3 – 6 weeks, respectively, after surgery. A ligament instead of a tendon was inadvertently transected in 2 of the pigeons in the unilateral group. These pigeons were able to fly the day after surgery. We did not euthanize these birds to confirm this suspicion. In the bilateral tenectomy groups, 1 of 2 cockatiels and 2 of 3 pigeons were eventually able to fly short distances within 4 to 6 months after surgery. In the same groups, 1 cockatiel died several hours after surgery and 1 pigeon was eutha-nized 6 weeks after surgery. The pigeon never regained its ability to right itself when placed on its back. <b>Gross</b> <b>necropsies</b> in both birds confirmed that the tendons of the supracoracoideous muscles had been transected. None of the birds undergoing unilateral or bilateral tenectomy had normal dorsal extension of the affected wing, but each was able to fly well enough to escape if taken outdoors. We concluded that neither unilateral nor bilateral supracoracoideus tenectomy is an ef-fective technique for deflighting cockatiels or pigeons...|$|R

40|$|Historically, little {{consideration}} {{has been}} given to the occurrence, ecology or conservation of the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in temperate New Zealand. Located geographically at the southern boundary of the distributional range of green turtles in the southwestern Pacific, reports of this species in New Zealand are often overlooked as occasional visitors or stragglers incidentally carried by ocean currents. This convention may be reasonable when considering the temperature constrained distribution of this poikilothermic marine reptile. Despite this, green turtles have been reported in New Zealand waters for more than 100 years, yet no study has undertaken any in depth investigation as to their occurrence in this region. Therefore, this thesis investigated the presence of green turtles in New Zealand waters to test the hypothesis that their occurrence is ephemeral and incidental. Opportunistic data and samples collected between 1895 and 2013 was collated, reviewed and analysed to investigate several lines of empirical enquiry, including spatio-temporal distribution, population structure, genetic origin, diet composition and anthropogenic effects. Sighting, stranding, and incidental capture revealed a year round presence of post-pelagic immature juveniles to large sub-adult green turtles across northern New Zealand (ca. 34 °- 38 ° S). Such occurrence exists despite sea surface temperatures averaging only 14 C during austral winters. The aggregation exhibited a female:male sex ratio of 1. 7 : 1 which is similar to that reported from proximate warm temperate foraging grounds in eastern Australia. Size frequency data indicated that green turtles recruit to neritic habitats of the North Island at ca. 40. 8 cm curved carapace length. This reflects a natural postoceanic settlement pattern rather than oceanic-phase stragglers incidentally blown ashore by storm and other stochastic events. Supporting this rationale for natural recruitment, diet component data demonstrates that once green turtles settle into New Zealand’s nearshore coastal habitats, they transition to a benthic foraging strategy. Notably, green turtles in New Zealand do not ontogenetically transition from omnivory to obligate herbivory with age, but instead consume a variable diet of primarily macroalgae and benthic macro invertebrates. Overall, the confirmation of feeding in New Zealand substantially extends the southern foraging limit for green turtles in the Pacific Ocean. Genetic analyses of ~ 770 base pair sequences of mitochondrial (mt) DNA was conducted on 42 stranded green turtles to characterize the genetic structure of this aggregation. Results identified 15 haplotypes including one orphan haplotype from widely dispersed green turtle stocks across the western, central, and eastern Pacific Ocean. When compared to other regional nesting rookeries and foraging grounds, the New Zealand aggregation exemplified its unique composition, predominantly due to the large proportion of haplotypes from the endemic eastern Pacific clade. These results provide a genetic link to east Pacific stocks in the southwestern Pacific; identifying previously undefined regional connectivity and trans-oceanic dispersal for eastern Pacific green turtles. In order to assess potential human impacts, <b>gross</b> <b>necropsies</b> were conducted on green turtles found stranded in northern New Zealand between 2007 and 2013. Anthropogenic effects predominantly associated with the ingestion of plastic marine debris were identified as the likely cause for the majority of strandings in the North Island. Propeller strike and incidental capture in recreational fisheries were further shown to impact green turtles, particularly for turtles inhabiting neritic habitats adjacent to densely populated urban centres of northeastern New Zealand. Overall, data presented here supports the hypothesis that New Zealand northern neritic habitats provide a transitional developmental habitat for immature green turtles at the edge of their range in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Genetic analysis reveals this aggregation is unique when compared to other regional foraging grounds, exhibiting links to discrete genetic stocks from across the Pacific Ocean. In addition, the cause of the exponential increase in records observed over time remains unclear, therefore warrants further research and monitoring of this endangered marine reptile; particularly in light of climate-mediated environmental change presently experienced in the region...|$|R
