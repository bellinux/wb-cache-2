Self-evidently, {{the most effective}} communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the denotational to the connotational, the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. {{the nature of the}} medium, the modality of the medium, the style, e.g. academic, literary, genre fiction, etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a literal representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a metaphorical or allegorical <b>interpretats</b> diachronically. Distinctions of class or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an accent or as a dialect) or written (i.e. in sentences or in SMS format), the place of residence (see Americanisms), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating customs as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of socialisation is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an ideological quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current attitudes and beliefs. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs.The other code forms rely upon knowledge held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of vocabulary and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and ideological codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by Arnold Schoenberg and a piece of bubblegum pop, and a painting by Rembrandt and a comic book by Frank Miller, etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes.In communication research and media research, the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} areas of {{interest}} in task-based language learning and teaching (TBLT) has been the psycholinguistically-oriented strand, which explores {{the way in which}} task design may interact with second language (L 2) learners` cognitive response in creating distinct opportunities for L 2 learning and use. The main appeal of TBLT ideas is that a language task is presented as a manageable and, at the same time, powerful tool of instruction and research. What is necessary, however, is a clear understanding of the manner in which different task characteristics might affect learners` performance and development. There are two major theoretical frameworks which provide an account of the purported effects of task features on L 2 learning and use. These theoretical models have been developed by Peter Robinson (the Cognition Hypothesis. Robinson, 2011 a) and Peter Skehan (the Trade-off Hypothesis, Skehan, 1998, 2009). The main construct of interest in both models is the construct of task complexity. Skehan and Robinson define this construct in a slightly different ways and they also make somewhat different predictions about the effects that task complexity might have on L 2 products and processes. Robinson`s and Skehan`s predictions have been put to the empirical test and this research has produced mixed results. In addition, as the models have been created to account primarily for oral production, it is still an empirical question whether or not the predictions made by the two models can also be applied to written performance. In other words, it is still unknown whether or not task complexity produces the same effects in speech and in writing. Moreover, mode (oral versus written) by itself may constitute an important task feature that can condition language use and learning opportunities. At a more general level, it is also the case that current understanding of the idiosyncrasy of the language-learning potential of oral and written tasks is limited. Given this state of affairs, the objective of the current dissertation is twofold. Our first aim (operationalized as our first research question) is to explore whether or not L 2 linguistic performance is different when the same task is performed in speech and in writing. Our second aim (corresponding to our second research question) is to investigate any potential effects of increasing task complexity in oral production as compared to written production. In terms of task complexity manipulations, we employed the Cognition Hypothesis as a theoretical framework and we specifically investigated the impact of the resource-directing variable of reasoning demands on L 2 performance, which was operationalized as complexity, accuracy and time on task. To answer our research questions, we conducted a study with 78 participants who were Catalan/Spanish learners of English as a foreign language. Half of the participants performed the simple and complex versions of an argumentative, instruction-giving task orally, the other half did it in writing. In the analysis, we compared speakers` and writers` performance in terms of linguistic (lexical and structural) complexity, propositional complexity (operationalized as idea units), accuracy, and time on task. Our results revealed marked differences between oral and written production. Thus, we found that speakers produced more idea units, while writers achieved higher scores for subordination, mean length of analysis-of-speech units, lexical diversity, extended idea units, and time on task. As for the effects of task complexity, the participants’ written production showed more variation between the complex and the simple versions of the task. Changes in the written production also showed a better fit to the theoretical predictions advanced in the Cognition Hypothesis. Una de les línies principals de l’àrea de l’ensenyament basat en les tasques pedagògiques (TBLT) és la línia psicolingüística. Aquesta línia explora com el disseny de les tasques interactua amb la resposta cognitiva dels aprenents creant diverses oportunitats per l’ús i aprenentatge de la llengua. La modalitat (oral i escrita) també pot constituir un característica de la tasca que pot influir amb l’ús de la llengua i les oportunitats d’aprenentatge. És important destacar que hi ha una manca coneixement sobre la singularitat del potencial de l’aprenentatge de les tasques orals i escrites. Aquesta dissertació té dos objectius. El primer objectiu és explorar si la producció lingüística és diferent en una tasca oral i escrita. El segon objectiu és comparar els efectes de la complexitat cognitiva de la tasca en la producció oral i escrita. Per complir aquests dos objectius s’ha dut a terme un experiment amb 78 participants (natius catalans i castellans) dels quals estaven aprenent anglès com a segona llengua. La meitat dels participants han realitzat les versions simple i complexa de la tasca de manera oral i la meitat restant ha realitzat les mateixes tasques per escrit. Hem trobat que els participants que han fet la tasca de manera oral han produït més idees però cal esmentar que els participants que ho han fet de manera escrita han produït textos amb més subordinació, diversitat lèxica, idees més complexes, unitats lingüístiques més llargues i amb un temps més llarg per l’execució de la tasca. En relació amb els efectes de la complexitat cognitiva de la tasca hem trobat que en la producció escrita havia més varietat entre la versió simple i complexa de la tasca.

40|$|The {{relationship}} of the blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal to its underlying neuronal activity is still poorly understood. Combined physiology and functional MRI experiments suggested that local field potential (LFP) is a better predictor of the BOLD signal than multiunit activity (MUA). To further explore this relationship, we simultaneously recorded BOLD and electrophysiological activity while inducing a dissociation of MUA from LFP activity with injections of the neuromodulator BP 554 into the primary visual cortex of anesthetized monkeys. BP 554 is a 5 -HT 1 A agonist acting primarily on the membrane of efferent neurons by potassium-induced hyperpolarization. Its infusion in visual cortex reliably reduced MUA without affecting either LFP or BOLD activity.

After deriving hypotheses from this master status characterization f gang membership, we estimate statistical models for gang and nongang members to determine whether different factors are used in processing and adjudicating each. The results provide some support for the characteriza-tion of gang membership asa master status. We discuss alternative expla-nations for the findings and their implications for public policy on gang prosecution and criminal processing. Officials ' react ions to cr ime and deviance have been approached f rom a var iety of theoret ical perspectives, but none have generated more controversy than the interact ionist perspect ive. F rom this viewpoint, the very definit ion of deviant is problematic; formal ef-forts at social control are said to {{do more harm than}} good through the processes of public degradat ion, retrospect ive <b>interpretat</b> ions, ident i ty t ransformat ion, and the subsequent onset of secondary de-viance.

40|$|Margarite is {{a common}} rock-forming dioctahedral mica, found in many low- to medium-grade {{metamorphic}} rocks. To faci l i tate petrogenetic <b>interpretat</b> ion of various observed assem-blages involving margarite, a complete elucidation of i ts compatibit i ty relat ions in the system CaO-AlrO. -SiOr-HrO is a necessary f irst step. Applying the methods of experimental and theoretical phase equil ibr ia, the phase relat ions of margarite in the above system have been deciphered. I t is found that the commonly observed assemblage margarite * quartz is stable to a maximum Pgr 6 of 8. 6 kbar, within a temperature range of 300 to 560 'C. This explains why quartz * margarite is restricted in nature to low- and medium-grade crustal metamorphic rocks. At PH 2 o in excess of 7 to 8. 6 kbar, the assemblage quartz * margarite {{gives way to the}} high-pressure assemblage zoisite * kyanite. This is in agreement with the repeatedly reported zoisite * kyanite assemblage from many greenschist to amphibolite facies eclogites. Further-more, if asr 6 in the equilibrium fluid is reduced to 0. 7 due to the presence of other inert gas species, zoisite * kyanite will be stabilized to as low z Ptotar as 6. I kbar. The assemblage quartz + margarite may, therefore, be regarded as an indicator of low- to moderate-pressure reqimes of rock metamorohism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Water stable {{isotopes}} {{are currently}} measured in polar ice cores. The long records of olgO and 00 provide un ique infonnation {{on the past}} polar temperature while the combination of (') 180 and 3 D constrains {{the evolution of the}} oceanic evaporative regions. Recently, new analytical developments have made it possible 10 measure with high precision a new isotopic ratio in water, 5170. As for 5 D and 5180, the combination of 5170 and 51 S 0 shows a high dependence with the climatic condit ions during evaporation. Based on measurements of the differellt isotopic ratios in Antarctica surface snow. we show that while the combination of 5180 and 5 D in the so-called d-excess displays variation with local climatic conditions in the polar regions in addition to the influence of the evaporative regions, the combination of a 170 and 51 S 0 in the so-called 110 m., [...] is not modified during the air mass transportation above the polar regions. Th is makes 170 clI. cnl a simpler parameter than d-excess to constrain the evolution of the ocean ic evaporative regions. Finally, records of d-excess and 170 CXC.
