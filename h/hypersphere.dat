25|$|An {{important}} {{practical application}} of covering spaces occurs in charts on SO(3), the rotation group. This group occurs widely in engineering, due to 3-dimensional rotations being heavily used in navigation, nautical engineering, and aerospace engineering, {{among many other}} uses.

Discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931, it is an influential early example of a fiber bundle. Technically, Hopf found a many-to-one continuous function (or [...] "map") from the -sphere onto the -sphere such that each distinct point of the -sphere comes from a distinct circle of the -sphere [...] Thus the -sphere is composed of fibers, where each fiber is a circle—one for each point of the -sphere.|$|E

Here, we consider 3 -dimensional indefinite affine <b>hyperspheres,</b> i. e. S= H Id (and thus S is trivially preserved). First we solve an algebraic problem. We determine the non-trivial stabilizers G of a traceless cubic form on a Lorentz-Minkowski space R^ 3 _ 1 under {{the action of the}} isometry group SO(1, 2) and find a representative of each SO(1, 2) /G-orbit. Since the affine cubic form is defined by h and K, this gives us the possible symmetry groups G and for each G a canonical form of K. Next, we classify <b>hyperspheres</b> admitting a pointwise G-symmetry for all non-trivial stabilizers G (apart from Z_ 2). Besides well-known <b>hyperspheres</b> (for Z_ 2 x Z_ 2 resp.
