40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of Earth's <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> depends critically {{on whether it}} is stably stratified or unstably stratified. We propose here a general analysis of the thermal evolution of the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Whether the geotherm in the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is superadiabatic or not depends on the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> solidification rate, on the thermal diffusivity of iron at <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> conditions, and on {{the ratio of the}} Clapeyron slope to the adiabatic gradient in the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> The temperature field within the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> can be destabilizing - and could drive convection - if the growth rate of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is large enough. The effect of radiogenic heating is probably small, and, perhaps surprisingly, can even stabilize the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> against convection. The uncertainties are such that it is not possible at present to conclude about the likelihood of thermal convection in the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> but recent estimates of the Core Mantle Boundary (CMB) heat flux and <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> conductivity favour convection. Thermal convection is more likely early in the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> history, a consequence of the secular decrease in cooling rate of the core. In addition, solidification-induced partitioning of the light elements may induce a stable density stratification within the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> We develop a numerical model of thermo-chemical convection in a growing <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> which couples the evolution and {{dynamics of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> with the thermal and compositional evolution of the outer core. Melting and crystallization associated with deformation of the <b>Inner</b> <b>Core</b> Boundary (ICB) would be of importance for the style of convection if the viscosity is large, but we focus here on the case of low viscosity for which phase change associated with dynamic topography at the ICB is expected to play a secondary role. In this regime, convection is typical of high Rayleigh number internally heated convection, with cold plumes falling from the ICB. Several possible scenarios can lead to a layered <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> either because of cessation of thermal convection due to the decrease in cooling rate of the core, or because of a compositional stratification which can confine convection in the deep <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> or stabilize the whole <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> For each of these scenarios, it is possible to find plausible sets of parameters (<b>inner</b> <b>core</b> age, viscosity, magnitude of the compositional stratification) for which the radius at which convection stops corresponds to the radius of the seismically inferred innermost <b>inner</b> <b>core...</b>|$|R

Thus, new techniques to observe different types of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> waves are imperative to improve data coverage. Here, we detail our method for detecting exotic <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> phases such as PKJKP and PKIIKP, using <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> compressional waves as proof of concept.

In this paper, we study in details the dynamics of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> thermal convection when dynamically induced melting and freezing of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> boundary (ICB) are taken into account. If the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is unstably stratified, linear stability analysis and numerical simulations consistently show that the translation mode dominates only if the viscosity η is large enough, with a critical viscosity value, of order 3 10 ^ 18 Pas, depending on the ability of outer core convection to supply or remove the latent heat of melting or solidification. If η is smaller, the dynamical effect of melting and freezing is small. Convection takes a more classical form, with a one-cell axisymmetric mode at the onset and chaotic plume convection at large Rayleigh number. [ [...] . ] Thermal convection requires that a superadiabatic temperature profile is maintained in the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> which depends on a competition between extraction of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> internal heat by conduction and cooling at the ICB. <b>Inner</b> <b>core</b> thermal convection appears very likely with the low thermal conductivity value proposed by Stacey & Davis (2007), but nearly impossible with the much higher thermal conductivity recently put forward. We argue however that the formation of an iron-rich layer above the ICB may have a positive feedback on <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> convection: it implies that the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> crystallized from an increasingly iron-rich liquid, resulting in an unstable compositional stratification which could drive <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> convection, perhaps even if the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is subadiabatic.

40|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> {{boundary}} {{marks the}} phase transition between the solid <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> and the fluid outer core. As {{the site of}} <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> solidification, the boundary provides insight into the processes generating the seismic structures of the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> In particular, it may {{hold the key to}} understanding the previously observed hemispherical asymmetry in <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> seismic velocity, anisotropy, and attenuation. Here we use a large PKiKP-PcP amplitude ratio and travel time residual data set to investigate velocity and density contrast properties near the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> boundary. Although hemispherical structure at the boundary has been proposed by previous <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> studies, we find no evidence for hemispheres in the amplitude ratios or travel time residuals. In addition, we find that the amplitude ratios are much larger than can be explained by variations in density contrast at the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> boundary or core-mantle boundary. This indicates that PKiKP is primarily observed when it is anomalously large, due to focusing along its raypath. Using data in which PKiKP is not detected above the noise level, we calculate an upper estimate for the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> boundary (ICB) density contrast of 1. 2 kg m - 3. The travel time residuals display large regional variations, which differ on long and short length scales. These regions may be explained by large-scale velocity variations in the F layer just above the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> boundary, and/or small-scale topography of varying magnitude on the ICB, which also causes the large amplitudes.

40|$|The {{suggestion}} that the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> of the Earth is liquid and is the seat of a strong magnetic field is examined. Contrary to expectations of a magneto-hydrodynamic rigidity for the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> it is shown that a liquid <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> with a strong magnetic field should not transmit shear waves. The absence of the phase PKJKP in seismic records is favourable to the hypothesis of a strong magnetic field in a liquid <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> If the jump in P wave velocity at the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> boundary {{is due to a}} magnetic field, the strength of the field must be of the order of 5 x 106 G whether the field geometry is toroidal or random. A strong toroidal field leads to an apparent ellipticity of the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> No such ellipticity is observed, so that if the field in the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is toroidal, it must be less than 5 x 105 G.

Recent body wave studies also indicate that this fast direction may be more attenuating, and interpret this anisotropic attenuation in terms of anisotropic scattering due to <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> texturing. Here we use the Earth's normal modes to study the attenuation anisotropy of both compressional and shear waves in the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> As normal modes have wavelengths several orders of magnitude longer than estimates of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> grain size, any attenuation anisotropy quantified using normal modes must reflect the anisotropy of intrinsic (viscoelastic) attenuation of the crystalline <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> alloy.

We investigate the effect of an initial texture resulting from solidification texturing at the ICB. In the present <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> the deformation rate in the shallow shear layer is large and can significantly alter the solidification texturing, but the solidification texture acquired early in the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> history can be preserved in the deeper part. Using elastic constants from ab initio calculations, we predict different maps of anisotropy in the modern <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> A model with both solidification texturing and subsequent deformation in a stratified <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> produces a global anisotropy in reasonable agreement with seismological observations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have {{investigated}} the upper bounds on the possible presence of radiogenic heat sources in the inner core of the Earth, using both steady state and transient models, built during this work. Necessary theory for this and model descriptions are collected into appendices {{at the end of}} this work. In addition, the published literature is reviewed for various formation scenarios, modelling of the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> theoretical and experimental values of relevant thermodynamic parameters. A general expression for the upper thermodynamical bounds on the initial heat source abundance at onset of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> soldification is derived, which in the range of the published values of the thermodynamical parameter space yields upper bounds of 0. 20 ± 0. 15 wt% initial abundance of  40 K, the most favoured radiogenic candidate in the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Alternatively the expression can be used to set an upper limit to the age of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> given that we know the present abundance of heatsources and thermal parameters. E. g. assuming a heat transfer coefficient of k = 80 W m− 1 K− 1, a melting temperature of iron of  5500 K at the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> boundary, and a value of the thermodynamical Grüneisen parameter of  γth,ICB = 1. 5, it is found that if the core is older than 0. 9 Gyr the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> 40 K abundance has to be lower than 0. 142 wt% (the constraint set by cosmochemical arguments) and if the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is older than 2. 52 Gyr the upper bound is less than 0. 058 wt% (upper limit as set by high pressure experiments). Several geotherms for the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> in subspaces of the parameter space are also presented. A comparison between the steady state and transient models is also performed, with the result that steady state models generally underestimates the temperatures and are not suitable for the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> geotherm, mainly due to the transient nature of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> formation and evolution.  Finally the nickel-silicide/georeactor <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> model, as proposed by Herndon is investigated. It is found that this would generate a large molten region at the centre of the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> which has not been observed today. Hence it is concluded that a georeactor can not be operational at the centre of the Earth today...|$|R

The existence of an <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> would induce a wobble of the planet which, if excited, could be seen in polar motion, i. e. in the motion of the instantaneous rotation axis in a frame tied to the planet. In this paper, we examine the consequences of an atmospheric excitation of that mode and of the classical Chandler wobble. The presence of an <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> induces also a free <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> nutation and consequently a resonance in the nutations of the planet.

40|$|Earth’s <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> {{is known}} to consist of {{crystalline}} iron alloyed {{with a small amount}} of nickel and lighter elements, but the shear wave (S wave) travels through the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> at about half the speed expected for most iron-rich alloys under relevant pressures. The anomalously low S-wave velocity (v_S) has been attributed to the presence of liquid, hence questioning the solidity of the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Here we report new experimental data up to core pressures on iron carbide Fe_ 7 C_ 3, a candidate component of the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> showing that its sound velocities dropped significantly near the end of a pressure-induced spin-pairing transition, which took place gradually between 10 GPa and 53 GPa. Following the transition, the sound velocities increased with density at an exceptionally low rate. Extrapolating the data to the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> pressure and accounting for the temperature effect, we found that low-spin Fe_ 7 C_ 3 can reproduce the observed v_S of the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> thus eliminating the need to invoke partial melting or a postulated large temperature effect.

We present evidence for significant temporal variability in the amplitude of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> reflected phase PKiKP for an exceptionally high quality earthquake doublet, observed post-critically at the short period Yellowknife seismic array (YK), which occurred in the South Sandwich Islands within a ten year interval (1993 / 2003).

40|$|The Earth's <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> plays a {{vital role}} in the {{dynamics}} of our planet and is itself strongly exposed to dynamic processes as evidenced by a complex pattern of elastic structure. To gain deeper insight into the nature of these processes we rely on a characterization of the physical properties of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> which are governed by the material physics of its main constituent, iron. Here we review recent research on structure and dynamics of the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> focusing on advances in mineral physics. We will discuss results on core composition, crystalline structure, temperature,and various aspects of elasticity. Based on recent computational results, we will show that aggregate seismic properties of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> can be explained by temperature and compression effects on the elasticity of pure iron, and use single crystal anisotropy to develop a speculative textural model of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> that can explain major aspects of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> anisotropy.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{systematic}} survey of numerical geodynamo simulations where the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> {{is allowed to}} differentially rotate in the longitudinal direction {{with respect to the}} mantle. We focus on the long-term behaviour of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation, on timescales much longer than the overturn time of the fluid outer core, including the steady component of rotation. The <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is subject to viscous and magnetic torques exerted by the fluid outer core, and a gravitational restoring torque exerted by the mantle. We show that the rate of steady <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation is limited by the differential rotation between spherical surfaces that the convective dynamics can sustain across the fluid outer core. We further show that this differential rotation is determined by a torque balance between the resistive Lorentz force and the Coriolis force on spherical surfaces within the fluid core. We derive a scaling law {{on the basis of this}} equilibrium suggesting that the ratio of the steady <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation to typical angular velocity within the fluid core should be proportional to the square root of the Ekman number, in agreement with our numerical results. The addition of gravitational coupling does not alter this scaling, though it further reduces the amplitude of <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation. In contrast, the long-term fluctuations in <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation remain proportional to the fluid core angular velocity, with no apparent dependency on the Ekman number. If the same torque balance pertains to the Earth's <b>core</b> conditions, the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation then consists in a very slow super rotation of a few degrees per million years, superimposed over large fluctuations (at about a tenth of a degree per year). This suggests that the present-day seismically inferred <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation is a fragment of a time-varying signal, rather than a steady super rotation. For the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> rotation fluctuations not to cause excessive variations in the length-of-day, the strength of the gravitational coupling between the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> and the mantle must be smaller than previously published values. We finally explore how the torque balance which we observe in our models could be altered in planetary cores, yielding possibly larger values of the steady rotation...|$|R

We find that at pressures of the Earth's solid <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> (330 - 364 GPa) two compounds are stable - Fe 2 S and FeS. In equilibrium with iron, only Fe 2 S can exist in the <b>inner</b> <b>core.</b> Using the equation of state of Fe 2 S, we find {{that in order to}} reproduce the density of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> by adding sulfur alone, 10. 6 - 13. 7 mol. % (6. 4 - 8. 4 wt. %) sulfur is needed. Analogous calculation for silicon (where the only stable compound at <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> pressures is FeSi) reproduces the density of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> with 9. 0 - 11. 8 mol. % (4. 8 - 6. 3 wt. %) silicon. In both cases, a virtually identical mean atomic mass M in the range 52. 6 - 53. 3 results for in the <b>inner</b> <b>core,</b> which is much higher than M = 49. 3 determined for the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> from Birch's law. For oxygen (where the relevant stable oxide at conditions of the <b>inner</b> <b>core</b> is Fe 2 O) we find the matching concentration in the range 13. 2 - 17. 2 mol. % (4. 2 - 5. 6 wt. %), which corresponds to M in the range 49. 0 - 50. 6.
