5|$|During the 1920s the British {{steadily}} expanded {{control over}} the South Sudan. The Deputy governor of Mongalla, Major R.G.C. Brock, estimated that he <b>had</b> <b>added</b> 50,000 Toposa and related people to {{the eastern half of}} his province, a somewhat inflated figure.|$|E
5|$|The most {{striking}} sign {{of this was}} his mode of forming a board of trustees; for, {{instead of the usual}} effort to tie up the organization forever in some sect, party or clique, he had named the best men of his town — his political opponents as well as his friends; and <b>had</b> <b>added</b> to them the pastors of all the principal churches, Catholic and Protestant.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May and into early June, ships {{carrying}} troops and war supplies continued to arrive at Quebec. By June 2, Carleton <b>had</b> <b>added</b> the 9th, 20th, 29th, 53rd and 60th Regiments of Foot, along with General John Burgoyne, to his command. Also arriving in the fleet were Hessian troops from Brunswick commanded by Baron Riedesel.|$|E

5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but {{it became clear that}} the public was interested in the animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons <b>had</b> <b>added</b> kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1965 and November 1968, {{aircraft}} of the U.S. Air Force {{had flown}} 153,784 attack sorties against North Vietnam, while the Navy and Marine Corps <b>had</b> <b>added</b> another 152,399. On 31 December 1967, the Department of Defense announced that 864,000 tons of American bombs {{had been dropped}} on North Vietnam during Rolling Thunder, compared with 653,000 tons dropped during the entire Korean War and 503,000 tons in the Pacific theater during the Second World War.|$|E

To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. University Hall, Slocum Library, extensions to the Monnett campus, and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.|$|E

5|$|Donaldson {{turned down}} Brentford's {{contract}} offer, {{and signed a}} two-year contract with their 2014–15 Championship rivals Birmingham City, to begin on 1 July 2014 when his Brentford contract expired. He made his debut as a second-half substitute in the opening-day defeat at Middlesbrough, opened the scoring as Birmingham beat Cambridge United 3–1 at St Andrew's in the League Cup, and collected Wes Thomas's through ball to run on and score in a 2–2 home draw with Ipswich Town on 19 August 2014. Although attracting praise for his general play, Donaldson was disappointed with his lack of goals; {{by the end of}} October 2014, he <b>had</b> <b>added</b> only one more.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of Snow White, work had continued on the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series of shorts. Mickey Mouse switched to Technicolor in 1935, by which time the series <b>had</b> <b>added</b> several major supporting characters, among them Mickey's dog Pluto and their friends Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, Goofy, and Pluto would all be appearing in series of their own by 1940, and the Donald Duck cartoons eclipsed the Mickey Mouse series in popularity. The Silly Symphonies, which garnered seven , ended in 1939.|$|E
5|$|From {{a base of}} {{territory}} in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth {{and south of the}} River Oykel, the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south. By the 12th century, the kings of Alba <b>had</b> <b>added</b> to their territories the English-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of Gaelic-speaking Galloway and Norse-speaking Caithness; {{by the end of the}} 13th century, the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders. However, processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very different in the later Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, a {{landmine}} exploded {{near the}} south {{aisle of the}} cathedral, resulting in {{the roof of the}} nave collapsing and the shattering of the windows. Sir Charles Nicholson was hired to rebuild the roof, and made the decision to remove the altarpiece that Rossetti <b>had</b> <b>added</b> to the north aisle. In 1949, Nicholson was replaced with George Pace of York, who in coordination with the dean at the time, Glyn Simon, saw a number of improvements in the modern style, though many fittings were clearly still influenced by the Gothic.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Cosby's only {{contract}} was with Jell-O, {{but by the}} end of the year he <b>had</b> <b>added</b> two more endorsements. By August, Cosby began promoting E. F. Hutton & Co. with a series of print and television advertisements, and comedy concerts. The company had been accused of fraud and needed a spokesperson who was well-liked. Soon after Cosby's commercials aired, the company merged with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. In late December, he added J. Walter Thompson agency account Kodak Colorwatch System photographic processing system to his list. The estimated $10 million contract included commercials featuring Cosby to run in print, on television, as point of sale, and in promotional programs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. At the other end, Morris {{continued}} {{to take advantage}} of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia <b>had</b> <b>added</b> 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt <b>had</b> <b>added</b> the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuq Zengi, Atabeg of Mosul, <b>had</b> <b>added</b> to {{his rule}} in 1128 Aleppo, {{the key to}} power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and Damascus. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their {{attention}} towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129. Damascus, ruled by the Burid Dynasty, later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140; the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam {{was outraged}} when it {{discovered}} after {{a pair of}} shows in Chicago, Illinois in March 1994 that ticket vendor Ticketmaster <b>had</b> <b>added</b> a service charge to the tickets. Following the tour, the band brought a lawsuit against Ticketmaster that accused them of being a monopoly whose anticompetitive practices allowed markup prices of more than 30%. The band's intention was to get ticket prices lowered for its fans. Pearl Jam's plans for a 1994 summer tour were cancelled {{as a result of}} a Ticketmaster boycott.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resumption}} of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the crease at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit of quick runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists <b>had</b> <b>added</b> 51 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, taking more than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Australia <b>had</b> <b>added</b> {{only nine}} {{runs on the}} third morning when Miller fell for 31. Four runs later, Morris fell for 51, leaving Australia 139/5. Barnes came in, despite having {{collapsed}} in the nets due to the lingering effects of the blow to his chest. He made a painful single before the pain forced him back to hospital. Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon fell. Lindwall came into bat at 172/6 with Australia facing {{the prospect of the}} follow on. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled, leaving Australia 208/7, five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs. During his innings, Lindwall was given a series of bouncers by Edrich. One of the short-pitched balls hit Lindwall in the hand, evoking cheers from the crowd. Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers, taking 4/81 and 3/53 respectively.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, {{the main}} road {{southeast}} from Klamath Falls, still unimproved in California, headed southeast to State Highway Route 28 (now SR 299) at Canby rather than south to Bieber. There travelers could head east on Route 28 to Alturas and south on the present US 395 (not a state highway north of Susanville until 1933) towards Reno. The California state legislature passed a law in 1939, providing for state takeover of the Canby-Oregon road if the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Public Roads were to construct and pave it. The road was in fact mostly paved by mid-1939, and under construction or completed by mid-1940, when Oregon Route 58 opened, continuing the corridor northwest from Klamath Falls. In 1943 the legislature gave it the Route 210 designation; Oregon <b>had</b> <b>added</b> the short connecting Hatfield Highway to its state highway system in 1937.|$|E
