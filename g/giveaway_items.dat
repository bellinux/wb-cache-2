40|$|Comprehensive sex {{education}} is a determinant of sexual health outcomes and healthy sexual/reproductive behaviors. The need for engaging, accessible, inclusive {{sex education}} conducted by community health workers is necessary to combat larger national {{issues such as the}} rising rates of sexually transmitted infections. After conducting summer research where I interviewed health educators about what makes health education programs successful, I planned, implemented, and created a sex education program at Scripps College. The event covered the topics of female anatomy, sexually transmitted infections, safer sex/barrier methods, and consent/communication in sexual relationships. The presentation mainly consisted of a PowerPoint that was supplemented with an interactive activity, a raffle and <b>giveaway</b> <b>items,</b> demonstrations of various barrier methods, and a question-and-answer session at the end. Through an evaluative survey, I received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback that indicated that many students learned new information and were likely to make concrete changes to their sexual/reproductive choices because of the program. The most common critical feedback requested that this program be repeated in more depth and cover additional topics such as conception and female orgasm...|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} the European Commission with a comprehensive overview of channels through which EU citizens, {{and in particular}} young people, {{are exposed to the}} marketing of tobacco products and e-cigarettes. The study investigates the reality of tobacco advertising and marketing in a representative sample of EU Member States. The detailed evidence provided in this report will shed light on how current EU- and national- level regulation of tobacco and e-cigarette advertising is working in practice. Exposure is measured both by looking at actual advertising spend, what advertising activity is occurring in different channels and looking at what advertising citizens recall, as measured through a citizens' survey. These are complemented by a survey of national experts and a review of secondary data. We examine exposure to advertising through a wide range of channels including print, outdoor, TV and radio, online, sponsorship and corporate social responsibility. Strategies for selling tobacco at point of sale are also assessed, including a review of the different kind of retailers, such as specialised retailers (tobacconists), retail outlets (including supermarkets) and vending machines. Where information exists, we assess the extent to which young people in particular are exposed to this marketing. The report takes into account the regulatory context at EU and national levels, given that certain forms of advertising (e. g. billboards, point of sale) are still allowed in some Member States. The report covers the following work packages: * Work package 1 : Overview of advertising strategies * Work package 2 : Printed media * Work package 3 : Internet and mobile applications * Work package 4 : Billboards, posters and other types of advertising outside the home * Work package 5 : TV and radio (electronic cigarettes) and product placement (all products) * Work package 6 : Points of sale, sample, <b>giveaways</b> and promotional <b>items</b> * Work package 7 : Sponsoring, corporate responsibility, brand stretching and imitation products * Work package 8 : Compilation of the key forms of advertising, promoting and sponsorship that EU citizens are exposed to.
