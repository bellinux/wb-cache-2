The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as table beer are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools.|$|R

The aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) level in raw materials varied from 0. 31 to 14. 85 μg kg - 1, while the fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) level (only in maize grit) varied from 1146 to 3194 μg kg - 1. The concentration in finished <b>beer</b> <b>ranged</b> from 0. 0015 to 0. 022 μg l - 1 for AFB 1 and from 37 to 89 μg l - 1 for FB 1; the other aflatoxins and fumonisin B 2 were not found in beer samples. The average percentages of toxins recovered in finished beer, referring to the amounts contained in raw materials, were 1. 5 ± 0. 8 % for AFB 1 and 50. 7 ± 4. 7 % for FB 1. These results were mainly due to the different solubility of the two mycotoxins during the mashing process.
