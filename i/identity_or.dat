5|$|In 2009, President Obama {{signed into}} law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which {{contained}} in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton {{signed into law}} the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender <b>identity,</b> <b>or</b> disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.|$|E

5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate <b>identity,</b> <b>or</b> brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church at {{the time}} faced {{difficulty}} retaining converts. Some Javanese, who had converted as students, returned to Islam after reentering society and facing social ostracism. In a 1935 meeting with other Jesuits, Soegijapranata blamed the problem {{on the lack of}} a united Catholic <b>identity,</b> <b>or</b> sensus Catholicus, as well as few intermarriages between native Catholics. Soegijapranata opposed marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics. He counselled young Catholic couples before marriage, believing that these unions helped unite the Catholic families in the city, and continued to write for Swaratama, again serving as its editor in chief. In 1938, he was chosen to advise the Society of Jesus, coordinating Jesuit work in the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without <b>identity</b> <b>or</b> culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong {{represents}} to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering. Since 2011, his repertoire {{has taken on a}} political dimension.|$|E

5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence <b>identity,</b> <b>or</b> the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E
