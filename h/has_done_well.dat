Once more, the voice speaks to Isaac's mother. It states she <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>well,</b> but it still {{questions}} her devotion, and tells her to sacrifice her son. She obliges, grabbing a butcher's knife {{from the kitchen and}} walking to Isaac's room. Isaac, watching through a sizable crack in his door, starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor hidden under his rug and jumps in, just before his mother opens his bedroom door. Isaac then puts the paper he was drawing onto his wall, which becomes the title screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} the Tasmanian waratah provide ample nectar and hence are a food source for bird {{visitors}} to the garden. The species can be propagated by seed, though seedlings may succumb to damping off. Growing in a natural shady location delays flowering by two to four weeks, while growing in a cooler conditions (due either to latitude or altitude) can delay flowering by up to six weeks. Pruning flower heads can promote subsequent growth of leaves and branches. It grows best in a cool climate with ample water and good drainage, and <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>well</b> in cultivation in England. The Royal Horticultural Society gave it an Award of Merit in 1934 and a First Class Certificate in 1938. The relationship between light duration and intensity, temperature, vegetative growth and flower production is poorly known. Yellow forms in cultivation were originally propagated from a plant found on Mount Wellington.|$|E

The winner of the test match series play in the higher league the following season, and the loser in the lower league.|$|E

25|$|He took 2 for 15 in {{the first}} match to give the Royals a {{controlled}} start against Barisal Burners – a 33-run win. Two more tight spells were followed by his first significant contributions with the bat. In a big chase against Chittagong Kings, Nabi's sense of occasion came forth. His 43 wasn't smash and grab as they chased 173 runs to win, but a more measured effort that gave his side their best win in the tournament's first phase. He had a lull {{in the next four}} games before picking up two three-wicket hauls against the Kings and the Khulna Royal Bengals.

25|$|The Liberal Party of Canada <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>well</b> in the Maritimes in {{the past}} because of its interventionist policies. The Acadian Peninsula region of New Brunswick, long {{dependent}} upon seasonal employment in the Gulf of St. Lawrence fishery, tends {{to vote for the}} Liberals or NDP for this reason. In the 1997 federal election, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's Liberals endured a bitter defeat to the PCs and NDP in many ridings as a result of unpopular cuts to unemployment benefits for seasonal workers, as well as closures of several Canadian Forces Bases, the refusal to honour a promise to rescind the Goods and Services Tax, cutbacks to provincial equalization payments, health care, post-secondary education and regional transportation infrastructure such as airports, fishing harbours, seaports, and railways. The Liberals held onto seats in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, while being shut out of Nova Scotia entirely, the second time in history (the only other time being the Diefenbaker sweep). In 2015 the Liberals won every seat in The Maritimes, defeating Conservative and NDP incumbents.|$|E

25|$|There, {{they meet}} {{a woman named}} Alexandra (Mayumi Yanagisawa/Jeannie Elias). She tells them she {{is the owner of}} the Palace, and the moon-person they fought is called Sirus, and is only a child; an orphan whom Alexandra adopted. However, because of the evil inside him, he has {{forgotten}} that time. She asks them to restore the garden of the Palace to try to remind Sirus of his old life. They do so, and confront Griffon, who experiences a memory of Sirus lamenting how humans have nearly destroyed the world fighting for the atlamillia, and musing that things would be better if humans didn't exist. These memories weaken Griffon, and Max and Monica defeat him. He turns back into Sirus, and a Dark Element (Hiroshi Iwasaki/Cam Clarke) rises out of his body, calling the Star of Oblivion. The Element reveals that it was born from Sirus's hatred for humans, and plans to rule over the destroyed planet. Max and Monica defeat the Element, helped by Sirus, who is mortally wounded. Before he dies, he remembers who he really is – the Guardian of the Stars, with the power to stop the Star of Oblivion. He does so, and Alexandra appears, telling him he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>well.</b> He thanks Max and Monica for saving him, and then dies, re-joining Alexandra in the garden. Max and Monica discuss how Griffon never really existed, but was instead an evil created in the heart of humans. At Kazarov, they say goodbye, vowing never to forget one another. Elena also says goodbye to Max as Paznos returns to its own time.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2004–05 campaign, May re-joined Colchester United on {{a two-month}} loan deal. He {{impressed}} {{in a friendly}} match against Premier League side Charlton Athletic, scoring in a 2–2 draw, and this resulted in Phil Parkinson bringing May back to Layer Road for a second time. May started the season making four late substitute appearances as Colchester started the campaign by winning three of their four opening fixtures. He started his first game in a 4–1 home victory over Doncaster Rovers on 28 August 2004. He scored his first goal for Colchester in September 2004, scoring the club's third goal in a 3–1 away victory at Bournemouth. Ten days later, May scored again in Colchester's 2–1 victory over Premier League side West Bromwich Albion, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute and scoring from a [...] "goalmouth scramble deep into extra time". In October 2004, May's loan deal was extended for a further month. Colchester manager Phil Parkinson stated — [...] "We've extended the deal because he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>well</b> and scored one or two vital goals for us. He is still developing but he {{has the potential to}} keep improving and he is an excellent lad to have around". After Colchester's 1–1 draw at Blackpool on 16 October 2004, May and Colchester team-mate Craig Fagan were charged by the Football Association after [...] "a brawl broke out late in the game following an off-the-ball incident" [...] — with May being charged with violent conduct. Two days later, it was announced that May would serve a three-match suspension, with Colchester being fined £6,000 after failing to control their players. As a result of his three-game ban, May made his last appearance for Colchester as a 74th-minute substitute in a 2–1 home defeat to Wrexham on 19 October 2004. He made 15 appearances during his three-month loan spell at Colchester, scoring twice. In December 2004, May signed for Brentford on a one month's loan deal, having previously spent the 2003–04 season with the club. After playing in the club's FA Cup draw with Hinckley United, he scored in a 2–0 win over Luton Town two days later when he [...] "touched home Kevin O'Connor's near post cross". His loan spell was subsequently extended for a further month in January 2005. May provided assists in away victories at Luton Town and Port Vale respectively, and his loan was again extended for another month in February 2005 – with Brentford manager Martin Allen [...] "delighted" [...] with May's development. May returned to Millwall in March 2005, having scored one goal in 16 appearances during his loan spell at Brentford. He made eight appearances for Millwall towards the latter stages of the 2004–05 season, scoring one goal – a penalty in a 4–3 home win against Crewe Alexandra on 9 April 2005 – in a game that Millwall had thrown away a three-goal lead before May's goal proved to be the winner.|$|E
