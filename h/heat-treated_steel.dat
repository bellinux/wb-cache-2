5000|$|The {{reality of}} static trench warfare in World War I created {{a need for}} short, handy close-combat weapons {{that could be used}} in the {{confines}} of a trench. With pistols in short supply, a variety of knives and other stabbing weapons were created or issued to troops serving in the trenches. Originally most of these weapons were fabricated in the field from readily available materials such as metal stakes, but soon factory-made examples of knuckle knives and push daggers appeared at the front, and were used by both sides in the conflict. In Britain the Robbins-Dudley Co. of Dudley, Worcestershire, a metalworking concern, was one of the first commercial producers of specialised wartime knuckle-knives and push daggers for private sale to individual soldiers and officers. [...] The typical Robbins-Dudley push dagger - referred to as a 'punch knife' by its maker - utilised an aluminium 'knuckle'-type handle cast onto a 3.625-in.

5000|$|The Model 99 rifle is {{a single}} shot bullpup rifle that debuted in 1999. Its primary market was long range {{competitive}} target shooters and in 2001 a shooter set a world record at 1,000-yards with the M99 by shooting a 5-shot group which measured 4.09″. The M99 features a hard-core construction, 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion, match-quality trigger design, <b>heat-treated</b> <b>steel</b> M1913 rail, match grade barrel, and S-7 tool steel bolt. It has three quick assembly pins, allowing it to be assembled or disassembled {{without the use of}} tools. The Model 99 is very accurate because of its heavy contour barrel. With the [...]416 round, the accuracy and increased velocity compared to [...]50 BMG enables greater long range precision. The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. To make the rifle very reliable and easy to maintain, the Model 99 has just three moving parts: the extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly. For bench rest shooting, the bi-pod can be detached easily. The design of the trigger is virtually maintenance free. The barrel is locked into the extrusion by being hydraulically pressed, allowing the user to mount a rifle scope on it. The steel gun barrel and the aluminum extrusion surround the cartridge, making the firearm safer.|$|E

Uniaxial tensile tests over the temperature range of - 190 Ã‚Â°C to 60 Ã‚Â°C {{were used to}} identify crack nucleation sites, whether these cracks nucleate at early stages of loading or just prior to fracture, and whether crack growth is continuous. Additionally, electron probe microanalysis and electron back scattered diffraction were used to characterise fracture nucleation sites and microcracks in annealed A 533 B steel; and Charpy impact tests and electron probe microanalysis were used to investigate fracture nucleation site properties in <b>heat-treated</b> 4340 <b>steel.</b> These results were then compared with the low temperature fracture mechanisms observed in as-received bainitic A 533 B steel. This study found that at the lowest test temperatures both spheroidised A 533 B <b>steel</b> and <b>heat-treated</b> 4340 <b>steel</b> fail by 'quasi-cleavage' while as-received A 533 B steel fails by 'true transgranular cleavage'. Quasi-cleavage fracture surfaces are characterised by voids separating planar facets.

50|$|The Accuracy International {{receiver}} {{is bolted}} with four screws and permanently bonded with epoxy {{material to the}} aluminium chassis, and was designed for ruggedness, simplicity and ease of operation. To this end, the heavy-walled, flat-bottomed, flat-sided receiver is a stressed part, machined in-house by AI from a solid piece of forged carbon steel. AW rifles are supplied in two action lengths—standard AW (short) and long SM (magnum). The six bolt lugs, arranged in two rows of three, engage a <b>heat-treated</b> <b>steel</b> locking ring insert pinned inside the front bridge of the action. The ring can be removed and replaced to refresh headspace control on older actions. The AW system cast steel bolt has a 0.75 in diameter combined with gas relief holes in a 0.785 in diameter bolt body and front action bridge allowing high-pressure gases a channel of escape {{in the event of}} a cartridge-case head failure. Against penetrating water or dirt the bolt has milled slots, which also prevent freezing or similar disturbances. Unlike conventional bolt-action rifles, the bolt handle is bent to the rear, which eases the repeating procedure for the operator and reduces the contour of the weapon. The action cocks on opening with a short, 60 degree bolt throw and has a non-rotating (fixed) external extractor and an internal ejector. Firing pin travel is 0.26 in to keep lock times to a minimum. Finally, an 11 mm integral dovetail rail located above the receiver is designed to accommodate different types of optical or electro-optical sights. As an option, a MIL-STD-1913 rail (Picatinny rail) can be permanently pinned, bonded and bolted to the action, providing a standard interface for many optical systems.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, in Europe, {{from the}} pre-Roman period on, the rings {{composing}} {{a piece of}} mail would be riveted closed to reduce the chance of the rings splitting open when subjected to a thrusting attack or a hit by an arrow. Up until the 14th century European mail was made of alternating rows of round riveted rings and solid rings. Sometime during the 14th century European mail makers started to transition from round rivets to wedge shaped rivets but continued using alternating rows of solid rings. Eventually European mail makers stopped using solid rings and almost all European mail was made from wedge riveted rings only with no solid rings. Both were commonly made of wrought iron, but some later pieces were made of <b>heat-treated</b> <b>steel.</b> Wire for the riveted rings was formed by either of two methods. One was to hammer out wrought iron into plates and cut or slit the plates. These thin pieces were then pulled through a draw plate repeatedly until the desired diameter was achieved. Waterwheel powered drawing mills are pictured in several period manuscripts. Another method was to simply forge down an iron billet into a rod and then proceed to draw it out into wire. The solid links would {{have been made by}} punching from a sheet. Guild marks were often stamped on the rings to show their origin and craftsmanship. Forge welding was also used to create solid links, but there are few possible examples known; the only well documented example from Europe is that of the camail (mail neck-defence) of the 7th century Coppergate helmet. Outside of Europe this practice was more common such as [...] "theta" [...] links from India. Very few examples of historic butted mail have been found and it is generally accepted that butted mail was never in wide use historically except in Japan where mail (kusari) was commonly made from butted links.|$|E

To accomplish this objective, hot isothermal compression tests on 304 L SS specimens with semi-solid heat treatment and conventional annealing heat treatment have been carried out within a temperature range of 1273 - 1473 K and strain rates ranging from 0. 01 to 1 s(- 1). The dynamic flow behavior of this steel in its conventional heat-treated condition and semi-solid heat-treated condition has been characterized in terms of strain hardening, temperature softening, strain rate hardening, and dynamic flow softening. Extensive microstructural investigation has been carried out to corroborate the results obtained from the analysis of flow behavior.
