5|$|According to Hussein's {{account of}} the events, Abu Nuwar and the Free Officers had planned for the Bedouin-dominated First Infantry Regiment in Zarqa to {{participate}} in a training exercise in the desert without ammunition to render it unavailable for <b>Hussein</b> to use against a planned anti-government demonstration scheduled to be held by Nabulsi on 14 April. <b>Hussein</b> was still wary of Nabulsi due to an alleged intercept of a message from Nasser imploring Nabulsi to resist his dismissal from the premiership. <b>Hussein</b> was informed of the Free Officers' alleged plot by Sharif Naser and Bedouin officers from Zarqa on the evening of 13 April. The incident coincided with a delivery by Abu Nuwar of an ultimatum to Prime Minister Said al-Mufti (Nabulsi's successor) warning <b>Hussein</b> to appoint a government reflecting the will of the elected parliament or face an army revolt. Al-Mufti apparently broke down emotionally in Hussein's presence, prompting the latter to inquire from Abu Nuwar about the ultimatum, to which Abu Nuwar professed his surprise. <b>Hussein</b> then brought Abu Nuwar along with him to inspect the scene at Zarqa, where <b>Hussein</b> was told by loyalist officers from Zarqa that rumors of his death had provoked heavy clashes between his loyalists and those of Abu Nuwar and that only the physical presence of <b>Hussein</b> would {{put an end to the}} fighting. Moreover, <b>Hussein</b> was told that Rashid and Ma'an Abu Nuwar (a distant cousin of Abu Nuwar) had been ordered to Amman to besiege the royal palace and arrest <b>Hussein.</b>|$|E
5|$|As ADC, Abu Nuwar {{was a major}} {{influence}} over then-20 year old <b>Hussein</b> and was constantly at his side, advising <b>Hussein</b> to dismiss Glubb and sever ties with the British. <b>Hussein</b> was also influenced by other Arab nationalist officers and personalities, including his cousin Zaid ibn Shaker, and the increasingly anti-imperialist and Arab nationalist political atmosphere in the country. As a sign of his increasing nationalism and {{as a means to}} quiet political opposition to his rule, <b>Hussein</b> decided to dismiss Glubb. He coordinated with Abu Nuwar and other Free Officers to ensure that his impending dismissal of Glubb would not result in a revolt by the latter's supporters within the Arab Legion. Thus, on 28 February 1956, Abu Nuwar was instructed to ready his troops, and he subsequently posted Free Officers at the Amman Airport, the major army base at Zarqa and in the vicinity of Glubb Pasha's Amman residence. After Abu Nuwar's positions were confirmed to him, <b>Hussein</b> conferred with his cabinet and dismissed Glubb on 1 March. Glubb complied with the order and departed Jordan the following day. <b>Hussein</b> then promoted Abu Nuwar to major-colonel and appointed Major General Radi Annab to Glubb's former position as {{chief of staff of the}} Arab Legion, which was concurrently renamed the Jordanian Armed Forces.|$|E

5|$|In late 1956, {{parliamentary}} elections in Jordan resulted in major victories for Arab nationalist and other left-leaning parties. <b>Hussein</b> subsequently appointed Suleiman Nabulsi, an Arab nationalist, socialist {{and one of}} the leading pro-Nasser MP-elects, as prime minister in October. Roughly coinciding with Nabulsi's appointment, the British, French and Israelis launched a tripartite invasion of the Suez Canal and the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, mainly in response to Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company among other reasons. <b>Hussein</b> {{declared a state of emergency}} and his opposition against the invasion and agreed to Egyptian chief of staff Abdel Hakim Amer's request for Jordanian military intervention. To that end, <b>Hussein</b> instructed Abu Nuwar to immediately execute Amer's order to launch Operation Beisan, which entailed a Jordanian-Syrian armored invasion of the Israeli coastal plain, which was seen as Israel's most vulnerable region due to the short length between the coast and the Jordanian-held West Bank. However, Abu Nuwar viewed the operation as far too risky for the Jordanian army and advised <b>Hussein</b> to await Syria's adherence to the plan; Egypt, Syria and Jordan had formed a defense pact days before the Israeli occupation of Sinai on 29 October.|$|E

5|$|Saddam <b>Hussein</b> {{claimed that}} Aflaq had {{converted}} to Islam {{prior to his}} death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion {{he had taken the}} first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous members of his family as a tool used by Saddam <b>Hussein</b> to disassociate Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of <b>Hussein</b> was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the Green Zone.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Black September, Abu Nidal began {{accusing the}} PLO of cowardice over his Voice of Palestine {{radio station in}} Iraq for having agreed to a ceasefire with <b>Hussein.</b> During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, Abu Nidal joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji Allush and Abu Daoud (leader of the Black September Organization {{responsible}} for the 1972 Munich Massacre), calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against King <b>Hussein.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Greater Amman Municipality {{has been}} {{investing}} towards making {{the city a}} better place, {{through a number of}} initiatives. 'Green Amman 2020' was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a green metropolis by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is green space. In 2015, (GAM) and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 different locations, including Wakalat Street, Rainbow Street, The Hashemite Plaza, Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Centre, Al <b>Hussein</b> Cultural Center, Al <b>Hussein</b> Public Parks and others.|$|E
5|$|While {{the real}} Saddam <b>Hussein</b> was {{on trial for}} {{genocide}} charges in 2006, Matt Stone joked that the U.S. military was showing the movie repeatedly to the former dictator {{as a form of}} torture. Parker and Stone were also given a signed photo of <b>Hussein</b> by the American soldiers. In 2011, Time called South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut the sixth greatest animated feature of all-time.|$|E
5|$|Abdullah was {{succeeded by}} his son Talal, who would soon abdicate due to illness in favour of his eldest son <b>Hussein.</b> Talal {{established}} the country's modern constitution in 1952. <b>Hussein</b> ascended to the throne in 1953 {{at the age of}} 18. Jordan witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period. The 1950s were a period of political upheaval, as Nasserism and Pan-Arabism swept the Arab World. On 1 March 1956, King <b>Hussein</b> Arabized the command of the Army by dismissing a number of senior British officers, an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country. In 1958, Jordan and neighbouring Hashemite Iraq formed the Arab Federation {{as a response to the}} formation of the rival United Arab Republic between Nasser's Egypt and Syria. The union lasted only six months, being dissolved after Iraqi King Faisal II (Hussein's cousin) was deposed by a bloody military coup on 14 July 1958.|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar {{spent much}} of his time in exile between Syria and Egypt {{organizing}} opposition to <b>Hussein</b> and the monarchy, all the while maintaining his innocence in the Zarqa incident. He returned to Jordan in 1964 after being pardoned by <b>Hussein</b> as part of the latter's broader reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition. In 1971, Abu Nuwar was made ambassador to France and he was later appointed to the Senate of Jordan's parliament in 1989. He died from blood cancer at a London hospital at age 66, one year after the publication of his memoirs, A Time of Arab Decline: Memoirs of Arab Politics (1948–1964).|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with <b>Hussein</b> led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources of foreign aid to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against <b>Hussein,</b> and the dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by <b>Hussein</b> against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Al-Talaba {{returned}} to winning ways under {{the management of}} Jamal Ali in the 1988–89 season, which was played in a different format to previous seasons. They finished fourth in the Baghdad Group, just ahead of Al-Shorta, {{to qualify for the}} final tournament, where they finished second in Group 1, behind Al-Zawraa, to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, Al-Talaba defeated Al-Tayaran 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. In the final, Al-Talaba faced their rivals, Al-Rasheed, at the Al-Shaab Stadium. The match ended 1–1 at full time with their goal scored by Ali <b>Hussein.</b> It went to penalties where <b>Hussein</b> Saeed missed his penalty and enabled Al-Rasheed to win 5–4. That season, Al-Talaba also finished as runners-up in the Al-Intisar Cup, behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya.|$|E
5|$|By 25 September, the Jordanian army {{achieved}} dominance, and {{two days}} later Arafat and <b>Hussein</b> agreed to a ceasefire in Amman. The Jordanian army inflicted heavy casualties on the Palestinians—including civilians—who suffered approximately 3,500 fatalities. After repeated violations of the ceasefire from both the PLO and the Jordanian Army, Arafat called for King <b>Hussein</b> to be toppled. Responding to the threat, in June 1971, <b>Hussein</b> ordered his forces to oust all remaining Palestinian fighters in northern Jordan, which they accomplished. Arafat {{and a number of}} his forces, including two high-ranking commanders, Abu Iyad and Abu Jihad, were forced into the northern corner of Jordan. They relocated near the town of Jerash, near the border with Syria. With the help of Munib Masri, a pro-Palestinian Jordanian cabinet member, and Fahd al-Khomeimi, the Saudi ambassador to Jordan, Arafat managed to enter Syria with nearly two thousand of his fighters. However, due to the hostility of relations between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad (who had since ousted President Salah Jadid), the Palestinian fighters crossed the border into Lebanon to join PLO forces in that country, where they set up their new headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Following recognition, Arafat {{established}} {{relationships with}} a variety of world leaders, including Saddam <b>Hussein</b> and Idi Amin. Arafat was Amin's best man at his wedding in Uganda in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Mahathir was {{appointed}} as a Minister in Tun Razak's Cabinet. He became the Deputy Prime Minister {{just two years}} later, under Tun <b>Hussein</b> Onn, who had succeeded Tun Razak upon the latter's sudden death.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan <b>Hussein</b> on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad <b>Hussein</b> Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan <b>Hussein,</b> is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, serious {{divisions}} {{emerged in}} the Jordanian state over reactions to the Eisenhower Doctrine, which ostensibly aimed to stem Soviet expansion in the Middle East, but was viewed by Arab nationalists as a neo-colonialist ploy to control the region. Nabulsi and Foreign Minister Abdullah Rimawi, a Baathist, led the camp opposing the doctrine {{as a threat to}} Arab sovereignty and as means to control the region's oil assets and support Israel, while <b>Hussein</b> publicly embraced the doctrine as a preventive measure against growing communist influence in the country. Prior to these disagreements, Nabulsi had been clamping down on communist literature and influence in the press (the communists were generally opposed by Arab nationalists), whilst attempting to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union (USSR) without Hussein's knowledge. To that end, he dispatched Abu Nuwar to Moscow in February 1957 to serve as an initial contact with the Soviets. Later, Nabulsi publicly declared his intention to establish relations with the USSR and pursue a political union with Egypt and Syria, and requested from <b>Hussein</b> a confirmation of his dismissal of several royalist officials. <b>Hussein</b> responded by forcing Nabulsi to resign on 10 April 1957.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{appointed}} Sadat and <b>Hussein</b> el-Shafei as {{his vice}} presidents in December 1969. By then, relations {{with his other}} original military comrades, namely Khaled and Zakaria Mohieddin and former vice president Sabri, had become strained. By mid-1970, Nasser pondered replacing Sadat with Boghdadi after reconciling with the latter.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 2013, Dahir Adan Elmi was {{appointed}} Chief of Army at a transfer ceremony in Mogadishu, where he replaced Abdulkadir Sheikh Dini. Abdirisaq Khalif <b>Hussein</b> {{was appointed}} as Elmi's new Deputy Chief of Army.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1914, Abbas Helmi II was deposed by the United Kingdom {{while he}} was on a visit to Vienna due to his anti-British stance. The British severed Egypt's nominal ties to the Ottoman Empire, thus ending the country's status as a khedivate. Prime Minister <b>Hussein</b> Rushdi Pasha served as acting head of state until Abbas Helmi II's half-uncle <b>Hussein</b> Kamel was chosen as the country's new monarch. For a brief while, the British had {{considered}} putting an end to the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and installing Aga Khan III as ruler. <b>Hussein</b> Kamel took the title of Sultan of Egypt (preceded by the untranslatable style of Sa Hautesse), thereby putting him on an equal footing with the Ottoman Sultan. However, the end of nominal Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt did not result in genuine independence; the Sultanate of Egypt was a British protectorate where real power lay in the hand of the High Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1951, King Abdullah I {{was shot}} three times by a Palestinian gunman {{as he entered}} the mosque, killing him. His {{grandson}} Prince <b>Hussein,</b> was at his side and was also hit, though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet.|$|E

5|$|After {{achieving}} {{their first}} league title, Al-Talaba succeeded in winning {{it again in}} the 1981–82 season under Jamal Salih {{in his second term}} as team manager.

5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, {{and he did not}} authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. So, there are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son <b>Hussein</b> has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E
5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday <b>Hussein,</b> in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam <b>Hussein,</b> Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|At the 1991 Madrid Conference, Jordan {{agreed to}} {{negotiate}} a peace treaty sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union. The Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace was signed on 26 October 1994.
