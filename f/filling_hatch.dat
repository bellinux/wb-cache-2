5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): this tank is {{described}} in many sources as early version of the T-26 mod. 1933. But in reality this is the Finnish war-time modernization (Finnish tactical number Ps163–16) of a hull from KhT-26 flame-throwing tank (which can be identified by rivets for mounting of a burning mixture tank, rivets for hinges of a <b>filling</b> <b>hatch</b> {{on the left side}} and a welded drain port on the right side behind a front track bogie) with a mounted riveted turret with a small rear niche from the early BT-5 light tank.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided apart from curved decking behind the cockpit. The hopper had a <b>filling</b> <b>hatch</b> immediately {{in front of}} the cockpit and a sliding gate and distributor below. It had a 27 cu ft ( [...] 0.76 m3) capacity. The Ag-1 had a wide span (17 ft 9 in; 5.41 m), rectangular tailplane and an angular fin and rudder, the latter reaching {{down to the bottom of}} the fuselage and fitted with a trim tab. Under it, at the extreme fuselage was a steerable tailwheel. It was powered by an air-cooled 225 hp (168 kW) Continental E225 flat-six engine mounted well forward and low in the nose. This initially drove a fixed pitch, two blade propeller though there were plans to replace it with a variable pitch one.|$|E

2500|$|With {{these figures}} Gleizes {{attempts}} to present, {{under the most}} simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), {{the creation of a}} spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken {{on the part of the}} artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are <b>filled</b> with <b>hatching</b> espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is [...] "a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.|$|R

Black painted decoration covers the exterior surface (except for the base). The design is based around six nested seven-pointed stars centered on {{the mouth of the}} pot. Each segment of each star has 2 - 3 triangles extending either up or down from it. On the first star, the triangles have a <b>hatched</b> <b>fill.</b> The next star has black-fil...|$|R

2500|$|Fish Hawks {{main deck}} was <b>filled</b> with <b>hatching</b> {{equipment}} {{to allow her}} to serve as a floating hatchery for American shad, striped bass, mackerel, and herring. A pump supplying 10,000 gallons (37,854 liters) of water per hour and two 500-gallon (1,893-liter) distribution tanks fed the equipment. Fertilized fish eggs were placed in 36 hatching cones, each capable of hatching 200,000 American shad eggs, and feed valves regulated the current through the cones to keep the eggs gently in motion so they would not mat or settle to the bottom. Fish Hawk also had 18 hatching cylinders [...] each capable of holding 250,000 eggs [...] with wire gauze bottoms; the cylinders were suspended from beams hanging over the sides of the ship and partially submerged, with nine on each side. Cam machinery caused the cylinders to rise gently and drop more rapidly for about eight inches (20cm), which made the eggs circulate freely without settling on the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Northern {{map turtles}} breed {{in the spring}} and fall. Most mating takes place in deep waters. The nesting period lasts from May to July. Unshaded sites with sandy soil are highly preferred. The female usually chooses well-drained areas for {{depositing}} the eggs. The nest cavity is dug with the hind feet. The size of the clutch is between six and 20. The eggs are oval, about 3.2 cm long, and have a flexible shell. After the eggs are laid, the cavity is <b>filled.</b> They <b>hatch</b> after 50 to 70 days of incubation, and most hatchlings emerge in August to September. When a nest hatches late, the northern map turtle hatchlings have been known to overwinter in the nest. The female usually lays two or more clutches in one breeding season. The sexes of the young are determined by the temperature. At 25 °C, incubation produces a majority of males, whereas 30-35 °C yields more females.|$|R

Ford released a rebadged version which was mechanically the same although different bumpers, headlights and bonnet were fitted, badged as the Ford Laser Lynx in Japan and Australia, and the Aztec in Taiwan. This model was only available as the Ford Laser-Lynx in the Australian market, as Mazda already had the 323 Astina <b>Hatch</b> <b>filling</b> the gap for a hatchback in the Mazda range.

40|$|The {{evidence}} {{appeared to}} suggest that the use of hypnosis in childbirth: decreases analgesia requirements during labour; decreases oxytocin requirements during labour and, increases the incidence of spontaneous vaginal birth. A research gap was identified that the Hypnosis Antenatal Training for Childbirth (HATCh) Trial was designed to <b>fill.</b> The <b>HATCh</b> Trial was a comprehensive, high-quality, randomised trial that included 448 pregnant women in late pregnancy. It was designed to assess the efficacy of a short, three-session, standardised hypnosis intervention in late pregnancy. The HATCh study findings show that, unlike in all but one previous study, this hypnosis intervention in the third trimester was ineffective in reducing analgesia requirements during childbirth. The increased incidence of induction required in hypnosis groups when compared with controls was unexpected and suggests that hypnosis may have an effect in the non-pharmacological inhibition of spontaneous labour. Subgroup analysis suggested that hypnosis may reduce analgesia requirements when supplemented by yoga. The addition of the HATCh Trial results has substantially increased the heterogeneity of the systematic review. Systematic review sub-group analyses, according to the timing of the hypnosis training during pregnancy, suggest that training in the third trimester is ineffective in reducing analgesia requirements during labour and childbirth. However hypnosis training commencing early in pregnancy, either in the first or second trimester, may decrease pharmacological analgesia use during childbirth. Further research is required to investigate why hypnosis might inhibit the spontaneous onset of labour and how this effect might be negated, minimised or utilised. Further research is also required to investigate the optimal timing to commence antenatal hypnosis training, the number of sessions and the types of suggestions that might be most effective. Yoga may be a useful adjunct to the hypnosis intervention and should be researched further as a sole technique and together with antenatal hypnosis training during pregnancy. There is a clear need for high quality trials where hypnosis training occurs before the 3 rd trimester. Ideally, training after the 3 rd trimester should be compared with antenatal hypnosis training before the 3 rd trimester. Thesis (Ph. D.)

5000|$|A theory {{advanced}} {{to explain the}} disappearance of the Waratah is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a rogue wave, in the ocean off the South African coast. Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the Waratah, with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo <b>hatches,</b> <b>filling</b> the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area. This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between Richards Bay and Cape Agulhas. This theory also stands up if the Waratah is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy - several ships around the Cape of Good Hope have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as Melanie Schulte (a German ship lost in the Atlantic Ocean) [...] and MV Derbyshire (a British bulk carrier sunk in the Pacific Ocean) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.|$|R
