40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how {{the presence of}} an untaxed informal sector can sharply lower the cost of <b>environmental</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> policy. The mechanism involves substitution between formal and informal labor supply: <b>energy</b> or <b>environmental</b> <b>taxes</b> can improve the efficiency of the tax system by drawing activity into the formal sector. Our result applies to broad classes of corrective taxes and we first present it in a simple analytical framework. We then investigate its magnitude in a simulation model using the case of an <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> in the U. S., where the informal sector is relatively small. Even so, we find the cost of <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> is negative for abatement up to 6 % and substantially reduced for large policies. Developing countries provide an important extension: they have much larger informal sectors {{but at the same time}} include the potential for substitution into informal fuels. We model these countervailing features and show that the welfare enhancing effect typically dominates, making the efficiency improvements even greater than in the U. S. case...|$|R

On this empirical basis, recurring patterns in the global spread of environmental policy innovations are identified and linked to specific causal mechanisms through which this change occurs. In particular, the paper demonstrates how {{and to what extent}} non-obligatory diffusion, legal harmonization and coercive imposition matter as mechanisms of global environmental policy convergence...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} European {{countries}} have introduced {{a variety of}} environmental taxes. A common characteristic of their implementation is the inclusion of exemptions and tax relief, in particular for (some sectors of) manufacturing industry. This paper analyses the pattern and motivation of exemptions as they have developed in Western European countries, making clear {{the difference between the}} nominal and effective tax rates once the exemptions have been taken into account. The principal motivation for exemptions relates to concern about competitiveness. While particular environmentally-intensive sectors may have some grounds for concern, even these might be able to achieve cost-effective environmental improvements, such that their competitive position is not over-disadvantaged, while for an economy structured like the UK's, an environmental tax plus rebate scheme, sometimes called an ecological tax reform, would be likely to yield benefits in terms of competitiveness. The exemptions usually run counter to the environmental economic logic of using environmental taxes to internalise social costs and give economic signals that are based on the full costs of production, and they are likely to increase the costs of achieving a given level of emission reduction. With little justification for them also on the grounds of competitiveness, it would therefore be undesirable on both economic and environmental grounds for them to remain a feature of the implementation of environmental taxes in the future.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} 'traditional' (non-environmental) efficiency {{consequences and}} {{environmental effects of}} two <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> policies: a tax on fossil and synthetic fuels based on Btu (or energy) content and a tax on consumer purchases of gasoline. It uses a model that uniquely combines attention to details of the U. S. tax system with a consolidated treatment of U. S. energy use and pollution emissions. On traditional efficiency grounds, each of the <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> emerges as more costly to the economy than increases in personal or corporate income taxes of equal revenue yield. Simulation experiments indicate that the excess costs of <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> are due partly to their relatively narrow tax base. The Btu tax's application to gross output (as compared with net output under an income tax) serves to expand its excess costs; in contrast, the gasoline tax's focus on consumption (as opposed to income) tends to mitigate its excess costs. On the environmental side, we find that for each of eight major air pollutants considered, <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> induce emissions reductions that are at least nine {{times larger than the}} reductions under the income tax alternatives. Overall, this study indicates that the Btu and gasoline taxes considered are inferior to the alternatives on narrow efficiency grounds but superior on environmental grounds. Whether the <b>environmental</b> attractions of <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> are large enough to offset their relatively high non-environmental costs remains an open question. ...|$|R
50|$|The 1973 {{oil crisis}} {{strengthened}} Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. Since then, electricity has been generated mostly from hydropower and nuclear power. The {{use of nuclear}} power has been limited, however. Among other things, the accident of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (United States) prompted the Riksdag to ban new nuclear plants. In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power. Politicians have made announcements about oil phase-out in Sweden, decrease of nuclear power, and multibillion-dollar investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The country has for many years pursued a strategy of indirect taxation {{as an instrument of}} <b>environmental</b> policy, including <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> in general and carbon dioxide taxes in particular. Sweden was in 2014 a net exporter of electricity by a margin of 16 TWh; the production from windpower mills had increased to 11.5 TWh.|$|R

In contrast to earlier empirical studies which analyse the distributional effects of <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> on the uses of household income, this paper focuses on their macroeconomic relationship with income sources. Using a panel of 34 OECD countries from 1995 to 2011, the paper shows that in the absence of explicit tax revenue recycling mechanisms there is a positive, although modest, relationship between the share of revenues from <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> in GDP and the Gini coefficient, which is the adopted measure of income inequality.

Second, <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> have a total effect that combines both direct and indirect effects: in addition to directly increasing the price of <b>energy</b> goods, <b>energy</b> <b>taxes</b> also indirectly increase the price of all other goods in proportion to the energy used to produce them.

40|$|Malaysia, as a {{small and}} {{developing}} country, must reduce carbon emissions because the country {{is one of the}} top CO 2 -emitting countries in the ASEAN region. Therefore, the current study implements two environmental tax policies; carbon and <b>energy</b> <b>taxes,</b> in order to examine the impacts of these policies on the reduction of carbon emission in the whole of the economy by applying a computable general equilibrium model. Since the whole of the government revenue from these tax policies is transferred to all household and labor types through two schemes, a lump sum tax, and a labor tax, respectively, it is assumed that there is revenue neutrality in the model for the government. The findings from simulated scenarios indicate that the carbon tax policy is the more efficient policy for reducing CO 2 emission, in both transferring schemes, while its impact on macroeconomic variables is almost lower than the equivalent <b>energy</b> <b>tax.</b> The carbon tax is more effective than the <b>energy</b> <b>tax</b> for Malaysia to achieve 40 % carbon reduction target in comparison with its 2005 level. The carbon tax, compared to the <b>energy</b> <b>tax,</b> also leads to more decrease in consumption of fossil fuels.
