40|$|Introduction: The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), {{first of}} all, {{identifies}} dangerous modes {{in a process}} and, then, provides proper control measures that are required to reduce the level of risk. This study aims to investigate the risk level {{before and after the}} implementation of control measures in an edible oil factory. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an edible oil factory in Tehran, Iran. The FMEA technique was used to identify failure modes related to equipment that existed in five units of this factory. After that, in all units, Risk Priority Numbers of all the processes were assessed {{on the basis of the}} FMEA method. With regard to the Risk Priority Number (RPN), some control measures were taken to reduce the risk of events. After nine months, risk assessment was repeated, and primary and secondary RPNs were compared with each other to investigate the effects of interventions. Results: The results showed that the highest probability of danger was related to the <b>installation</b> <b>unit.</b> The probability of danger in this unit before and after interventional actions was 4. 5 and 3. 25 respectively and the highest degree of severity was related to tool production. The marginal homogeneity test showed the positive effect of control measures on the risk level in the factory. There was a significant inference between before- and after-data in RPN in the unit tool production, neutralization unit, and <b>installation</b> <b>unit.</b> The Tests of Repeated Measure showed that there was a statistically significant inference between before- and after-data in the total average of RPN criterion (pvalue < 0. 001). Conclusion: It can be concluded that the high risk level in the factory units was reduced after the application of interventional corrective measures. These actions have been useful. It can be mentioned that the FMEA has been successfully able to identify and control the level of risk in this factory.  ...|$|E

40|$|The {{model of}} {{ministry}} developed in this dissertation {{is intended to}} demonstrate how military hospital chaplains can respond more qualitatively {{to the needs of}} patients and care providers at Martin Army Community Hospital at Fort Benning, in Columbus, Georgia. Fort Benning, is an <b>installation</b> <b>unit</b> of the United States Army. The model calls for the implementation of a Volunteer Training Program that builds on the skills and experience of active and reserve duty chaplains, {{as well as those of}} laity and spouses, to conduct pastoral ministry and visitation. This project grew out of a drastic need to assist chaplains in the Department of Ministry and Pastoral Care in ensuring adequate coverage for patients and care providers at the Hospital. The model seeks to establish a “Ministry of Presence,” i. e., to have so many trained volunteers available throughout the Hospital that the care needs of patients at any given time do not go unmet. Historically, the Unit Ministry Team has been hampered in its efforts to provide adequate coverage for the ministry and pastoral care needs of patients and care providers. This situation resulted primarily from the fact that excessive meetings, conferences, miscellaneous duty requirements. and other low-priority tasks consumed a disproportionate amount of the Ministry Team members’ time. While some effort was made to reduce the number of non-essential functions, duties that were not directly related to pastoral care still constituted ma] or distractions and prevented the Unit Team’s members from attending to the more essential tasks of ministering to the needs of patients. The implementation of the Volunteer Training Program brought relief to the overwhelmed Unit Ministry Team in the form of an “army” of volunteers who were trained to function as chaplains. The presence of support staff allowed the chaplaincy staff to attend to other tasks and helped ensure that a trained and caring person was available when needed. The Program is an intensive experience structured around one week of instruction, readings, simulated counseling sessions, role-playing visitations, writing verbatim reports, peer review, and dialogue-feedback sessions with a volunteer supervisor. The training gave active and reserve duty chaplains additional experience in hospital ministry and fulfilled the basic requirements for continuing education units for lay person. Overall, the Volunteer Training Program was successful in that it enhanced the presence of trained chaplain’s volunteers and ensured that the care needs of patients were meant. The Program precipitated an increased awareness of the importance of pastoral care and a greater sensitivity to the need for hospital ministry. In addition, this Program inspired chaplains at other military hospitals to consider such a program for the hospitals at which they are stationed. Most importantly, the Volunteer Training Programsignificantly improved the capacity of the Department of Ministry and Pastoral Care at Martin Army Community Hospital to provide effective pastoral ministry and patient care...|$|E
