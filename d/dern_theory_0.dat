40|$|We {{consider}} ADE-type (2, <b>0)</b> <b>theory</b> on {{a family}} of flat six-tori endowed with flat Sp(4) connections coupled to the R-symmetry. Our main objects of interest are {{the components of the}} `partition vector' of the theory. These constitute an element of a certain finite dimensional vector space, carrying an irreducible representation of a discrete Heisenberg group related to the 't Hooft fluxes of the theory. Covariance under the SL_ 6 (Z) mapping class group of a six-torus amounts to a certain automorphic transformation law for the partition vector, which we derive. Because of the absence of a Lagrangian formulation of (2, <b>0)</b> <b>theory,</b> this transformation property is not manifest, and gives useful non-trivial constraints on the partition vector. As an application, we derive a shifted quantization law for the spatial momentum of (2, <b>0)</b> <b>theory</b> on a space-time of the form R x T 5.
