5|$|Its two {{drivers are}} a 180mm paper woofer and a 35mm soft-domed tweeter. The woofer's diaphragm, {{weighing}} 3.7g, is manufactured from a <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> of pressed pulp paper. Unconventionally, it is formed into conical shape not through moulding or pressure, but by curling and then gluing the two ends together.

5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E

5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E

25|$|Compared with {{a single}} paraboloid, using two partial troughs has {{important}} advantages. Each trough is a , which can be made simply by bending a <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> of metal. Also, the light that reaches the targeted cooking pot is directed approximately downward, which reduces the danger of damage to the eyes of anyone nearby. On the other hand, there are disadvantages. More mirror material is needed, increasing the cost, and the light is reflected by two surfaces instead of one, which inevitably increases the amount that is lost.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene and {{polyolefin}} pellets are extruded {{and combined}} {{to create a}} molten polymer, which consists of a 37.5µm thick polypropylene sheet sandwiched between two 0.1µm polyolefin sheets, creating a thin film 37.7µm thick. This is gravity fed through a snap cooling brass mandrel, reheater, blown into a large bubble using air pressure and temperature, and collapsed {{at the base of}} the four-storey chamber into a <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> by convergence rollers, and the sheet is then slit.

A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a <b>flat</b> <b>sheet.</b> A Fresnel lens can also capture more oblique light from a light source, thus allowing the light from a lighthouse equipped with one, to be visible over greater distances.|$|E
25|$|Transducer {{technologies}} employed much less commonly for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and Plasma-ionisation. The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter {{from one of}} the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models both used a <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> of film which limited the maximum volume of air that could be moved. Currently TakeT produce a piezoelectric film headphone which is shaped not unlike an AMT transducer but which like the driver Precide uses for their headphones, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.|$|E

In the tropics where sunlight falls more directly, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over near the poles, the temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice at its freezing point. Its salinity makes this lower than freshwater's, usually about [...] These temperature differences contribute to the continuous circulation of water through the sea. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics; as the water becomes denser, it sinks. The cold water in the deep sea moves back towards the equator before welling up again to the surface. Deep seawater has a temperature between [...] {{in all parts of the}} globe. In freezing seas, ice crystals begin to form on the surface. These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil. In calm conditions, frazil will freeze into a thin, <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> called nilas, which thickens as new ice forms in the sea beneath it. In turbulent waters, frazil instead join together into larger flat discs known as [...] "pancakes". These slide over and under one another to form floes. During these processes, salt water and air are trapped amid the ice. Nilas forms with a salinity around 12–15‰ and is grayish in color but grows fresher over time: after a year, it is bluish and closer to 4–6‰ saline.|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} forming is in {{relation}} to two things, the flow and stretch of material. [...] As a die forms a shape from a <b>flat</b> <b>sheet</b> of metal, {{there is a need}} for the material to move into the shape of the die. [...] The flow of material is controlled through pressure applied to the blank and lubrication applied to the die or the blank. [...] If the form moves too easily, wrinkles will occur in the part. [...] To correct this, more pressure or less lubrication is applied to the blank to limit the flow of material and cause the material to stretch or set thin. [...] If too much pressure is applied, the part will become too thin and break. [...] Drawing metal requires finding the correct balance between wrinkles and breaking to achieve a successful part.|$|E

(At the point of the circle when you are moving parallel to the axis, there is no inward acceleration. At the point, the velocity is along the cylinder's bend, the inward acceleration is maximum.) [...] This is the (Euclidean) normal component. The covariant derivative component is the component parallel to the cylinder's surface, and is the same as that before you rolled the sheet into a cylinder.|$|E

This process, called marvering, forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a stainless steel or iron rod called a punty [...] for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and/or to finalize the top.|$|E
