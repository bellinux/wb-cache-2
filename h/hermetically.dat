5|$|After these {{experimental}} killings, Nebe {{thought of}} remodelling a vehicle with a <b>hermetically</b> sealed cabin for killing. The carbon monoxide from the vehicle's exhaust would be channelled into the sealed cabin {{in which the}} victims stood. He discussed {{the technical aspects of}} the idea with a specialist from Kripo's Technology Institute and together they brought the proposal before Heydrich, who adopted it.|$|E
25|$|Many Hermetic, or <b>Hermetically</b> influenced, groups exist today. Most of {{them are}} derived from Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, or the Golden Dawn.|$|E
25|$|Compressors used in {{refrigeration}} {{systems are}} {{often described as}} being either hermetic, open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and motor drive are situated {{in relation to the}} gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a hermetic is <b>hermetically</b> sealed compressor, while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a semi-hermetic compressor.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1986, Infinia Corporation began {{developing}} both {{highly reliable}} pulsed free-piston Stirling engines, and thermoacoustic coolers using related technology. The published design uses flexural bearings and <b>hermetically</b> sealed Helium gas cycles, to achieve tested reliabilities exceeding 20 years. As of 2010, the corporation had amassed more than 30 patents, {{and developed a}} number of commercial products for both combined heat and power, and solar power.|$|E
25|$|The {{part of the}} Barbara Pit mine {{where the}} killings took place was <b>hermetically</b> sealed. The rest was put into {{operation}} on 1 November 1945 and produced coal until 1992. There is no written data about the massacre in Yugoslav archives. In May 1947, a 32-year-old pregnant woman {{was sentenced to death}} on spying charges, as she claimed that Yugoslav authorities executed POWs at Brežice, Košnice and Huda Jama.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 the Declaration of Independence was {{displayed}} at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. On March 3, 1877, it was returned to the library where it was kept on view until 1894 when it was <b>hermetically</b> sealed in a locked steel cabinet in the library along with the original signed copy of the Constitution. The documents were not shown to anyone without {{the approval of the}} Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|A further {{impediment}} to {{reliability of the}} early devices was the diffusion of water vapour from the body fluids through the epoxy resin encapsulation affecting the electronic circuitry. This phenomenon was overcome by encasing the pacemaker generator in a <b>hermetically</b> sealed metal case, initially by Telectronics of Australia in 1969 followed by Cardiac Pacemakers Inc of Minneapolis in 1972. This technology, using titanium as the encasing metal, became the standard by the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|The {{snapping}} of {{the leaves}} {{is a case of}} thigmonasty (undirected movement in response to touch). Further stimulation of the lobe's internal surfaces by the struggling insects causes the lobes to close even tighter (thigmotropism), sealing the lobes <b>hermetically</b> and forming a stomach in which digestion occurs over a period of one to two weeks. Leaves can be reused three or four times before they become unresponsive to stimulation, depending on the growing conditions.|$|E
25|$|Force 136 {{was also}} active in more {{conventional}} military-style operations behind Japanese lines in Burma. Such an operation could comprise {{a group of}} up to 40 infantry with officers and a radio operator, infiltrating Japanese lines on intelligence and discretionary search and destroy missions. Such missions, which could last several weeks (supplied by C47 transport aircraft) kept close wireless contact with operational bases in India, using high-grade ciphers (changed daily) and <b>hermetically</b> sealed wireless/morse sets.|$|E
25|$|A {{reed switch}} is an {{electrical}} switch {{consisting of two}} ferromagnetic and specially shaped contact blades (reeds) positioned in a <b>hermetically</b> sealed glass tube with a gap between them and in a protective atmosphere. Operated by an applied magnetic field, reed switches are used as reed relays, automotive sensors, robotics sensors, security sensors and are found in many toys and games. The reed switch was invented in 1936 by W. B. Elwood at Bell Telephone Laboratories.|$|E
25|$|The sample {{suspended}} in a suitable medium {{is placed in}} a <b>hermetically</b> closed metabolic chamber. The mitochondria are brought into defined “states” by the sequential addition of substrates or inhibitors. Since the mitochondria consume oxygen, the oxygen concentration drops. This change of oxygen concentration is recorded by an oxygen sensor in the chamber. From {{the rate of the}} oxygen decline (taking into account correction for oxygen diffusion) the respiratory rate of the mitochondria can be computed.|$|E
25|$|In {{collaboration}} with the pro-Cubist writer, poet, and critique Paul Dermée, Ozenfant and Jeanneret founded the avant-garde journal L'Esprit Nouveau, published from 1920 to 1925. In the last issue, Jeanneret, under the pseudonym Paul Boulard, writes of how {{the laws of nature}} were manifested in the shape of crystals; the properties of which were <b>hermetically</b> coherent, both interiorly and exteriorly. In La peinture moderne, under the title Vers le crystal, Ozenfant and Jeanneret liken the properties of crystals with the true Cubist, whose œuvre tends toward the crystal.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors form {{the bulk of}} the {{electrolytic capacitors}} used in electronics because of the large diversity of sizes and the inexpensive production. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors, usually used in the SMD version, have a higher specific capacitance than the aluminum electrolytic capacitors and are used in devices with limited space or flat design such as laptops. They are also used in military technology, mostly in axial style, <b>hermetically</b> sealed. Niobium electrolytic chip capacitors are a new development in the market and are intended as a replacement for tantalum electrolytic chip capacitors.|$|E
25|$|For x-ray, {{gamma ray}} and {{electron}} irradiation, shielding is required when the foods are being irradiated. This {{is done to}} protect workers and the environment outside of the chamber from radiation exposure. Typically permanent or movable shields are used. In some gamma irradiators the radioactive source is under water at all times, and the <b>hermetically</b> sealed product is lowered into the water. The water acts as the shield in this application. Because of the lower penetration depth of electron irradiation, treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes is not possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, Russian Alexander Lodygin invented an {{incandescent}} light bulb and obtained a Russian patent in 1874. He used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver, <b>hermetically</b> sealed, and filled with nitrogen, electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed. Later {{he lived in the}} US, changed his name to Alexander de Lodyguine and applied and obtained patents for incandescent lamps having chromium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, molybdenum and tungsten filaments, and a bulb using a molybdenum filament was demonstrated at the world fair of 1900 in Paris.|$|E
25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are <b>hermetically</b> sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may prevent vacuum glazing from being used when the temperature differential is too great. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35°C.|$|E
25|$|The Space Pen, {{also known}} as the Zero Gravity Pen, is a pen that uses {{pressurized}} ink cartridges and is claimed to write in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, over wet and greasy paper, at any angle, and in extreme temperature ranges. The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks. A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas. The thixotropic ink in the <b>hermetically</b> sealed and pressurized reservoir is claimed to write for three times longer than a standard ballpoint pen. In 1965, the space pen was invented and patented by Paul C. Fisher. After two years of testing at NASA, the space pen was first used during the Apollo 7 mission in 1968.|$|E
25|$|The SS built three {{extermination}} {{camps in}} occupied Poland specifically for Operation Reinhard: Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. They were fitted with identical mass killing installations disguised as communal shower rooms. In addition, gas chambers {{were developed in}} 1942 at the Majdanek concentration camp, and at AuschwitzII-Birkenau. In German-occupied USSR at the Maly Trostinets extermination camp shootings were used to kill victims in the woods. At the Chełmno extermination camp victims were killed in gas vans whose redirected exhaust fed into sealed compartments {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. They were utilized in Trostinets as well. Neither of these two camps had international rail connections therefore the trains used to stop at the nearby ghettos in Łódź and in Minsk respectively. From there, the prisoners were taken by trucks to die. At Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor the killing mechanism consisted of a large internal-combustion engine delivering exhaust fumes to gas chambers through pipes. At Auschwitz and Majdanek, the gas chambers relied on Zyklon B pellets of hydrogen cyanide, poured through vents in the roof from cans sealed <b>hermetically.</b>|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors are {{constructed}} with two metal foils (current collectors), each coated with an electrode material such as activated carbon, which {{serve as the}} power connection between the electrode material and the external terminals of the capacitor. Specifically to the electrode material {{is a very large}} surface area. In this example the activated carbon is electrochemically etched, so that the surface of the material is about a factor 100,000 larger than the smooth surface. The electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an insulator to protect the electrodes against short circuits. This construction is subsequently rolled or folded into a cylindrical or rectangular shape and can be stacked in an aluminum can or an adaptable rectangular housing. Then the cell is impregnated with a liquid or viscous electrolyte of organic or aqueous type. The electrolyte, an ionic conductor, enters the pores of the electrodes and serves as the conductive connection between the electrodes across the separator. Finally the housing is <b>hermetically</b> sealed to ensure stable behavior over the specified lifetime.|$|E
500|$|A second, smaller {{monument}} {{was placed}} over the alleged site of Myles Standish's grave in 1893. [...] Two exhumations of Standish's remains were undertaken in 1889 and 1891 to determine {{the location of the}} Captain's resting place. [...] A third exhumation took place in 1930 to place Standish's remains in a <b>hermetically</b> sealed chamber beneath the grave-site monument. His burial site is located in Myles Standish Burial Ground in Duxbury.|$|E
500|$|Two days later, Nebe and Widmann {{carried out}} another killing experiment: five {{psychiatric}} patients from Mogilev {{were placed in}} a <b>hermetically</b> sealed room, with pipes leading to the outside. At first, exhausts from a passenger vehicle were vented into the room, so that the carbon monoxide would kill those inside. However, this method failed to kill the patients, so a truck was added; the patients were dead within 15 minutes. Nebe and Widmann concluded, that killing with explosives was impractical, while gassing [...] "held promise", as vehicles were readily available, and {{could be used as}} needed.|$|E
500|$|After {{delivering}} Cavador to Viktoria, Garrett steals a Servant mask {{to learn}} about a Mechanist technology called a [...] "Cultivator". Meanwhile, Karras hides inside the Mechanist cathedral in preparation for his plan. Garrett and Viktoria learn {{that it is the}} Cultivators inside Servant masks which emit red vapor, or [...] "rust gas". Karras had provided Servants to nobles with gardens in order to set off an apocalyptic chain reaction. Viktoria plans to lure the Servants into the <b>hermetically</b> sealed Mechanist cathedral before Karras activates their masks, but Garrett believes this to be too dangerous and leaves. Viktoria goes to the cathedral alone and dies while filling it with plants, and Garrett completes her plan, killing Karras in the rust gas. Afterward, Garrett is approached by a Keeper who explains that Karras' scheme and Viktoria's death had been prophesied. Garrett demands to know the rest of the Keepers' prophecies as the game ends.|$|E
500|$|Meiklejohn became Amherst College's {{president}} in 1912. Meiklejohn developed {{a legacy of}} autocratic treatment of faculty, drastic overspending, and that of a college <b>hermetically</b> detached from demands of the outside world. He was ousted after lying about faculty appointments, whereupon he opened the Experimental College at the University of Wisconsin, a two-year Great Books program with readings from ancient Greece and modern America. There, too, he treated the program as unaccountable to outside influence, and did not produce reports of their work or build rapport with the outside Wisconsin community. The program quickly closed for reasons attributed to Meiklejohn's obstinance and not programatic design. Meiklejohn then opened a Great Books adult education program in San Francisco where students similarly self-governed and led their own education. As funding dissipated {{at the outset of}} World War II, the students chose to shutter the school before [...] "compromising" [...] their ideals. Meiklejohn became an advocate of free speech as an absolute right differentiated from physical action. His stances on this and democracy influenced the United States Supreme Court and the aims of UNESCO.|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the obelisk would be 40ft² (12m²) square and [...] high. It then would reduce to 32ft² (9m²) square and rise [...] The next segment would be 22ft² (6m²) and would rise [...] to become 6ft² (1.8m²) at the top. The total height would be [...] In the {{pedestal}} there would be 300ft² (91m²) of floor space. Harvey's books, explaining 20th-century civilization, as well as a world globe, a bible, encyclopedias, and newspapers, were to be placed inside two vaults and <b>hermetically</b> sealed in glass. Harvey also wanted to place in this large room: [...] "numerous small items now used in domestic and industrial life, from the size of a needle and safety pin up to a Victrola." [...] It was estimated that the construction would use 16,000 bags of cement, 30,000ft³ (850m³) of sand, 58,000ft³ (1,642m³) of gravel, and tons of corrugated steel reinforcement. The Portland Cement Association donated the service of one of its experts, who pronounced that the Pyramid would not deteriorate or suffer from erosion and would last for over a million years. To prevent water in the valley from interfering with the foundation and to shore up the low knoll to support the heavy Pyramid, Harvey constructed a [...] long retaining wall of stone and concrete.|$|E
2500|$|Those using liquid {{electrolytes}} do {{not have}} a life time specification. (When <b>hermetically</b> sealed) ...|$|E
2500|$|Tantalum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte {{do not have}} wear-out failures so {{they do not have}} a lifetime specification in the sense of non-solid aluminum {{electrolytic capacitors}}. Also, tantalum capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, the [...] "wet tantalums", do not have a lifetime specification because they are <b>hermetically</b> sealed and evaporation of electrolyte is minimized.|$|E
2500|$|Although low to {{moderate}} air flow {{is important for}} producing a good-quality aged raw pu'er, it is generally agreed by most collectors and connoisseurs that raw pu'er tea cakes older than 30 years should not be further exposed to [...] "open" [...] air since it {{would result in the}} loss of flavors or degradation in mouthfeel. The tea should instead be preserved by wrapping or <b>hermetically</b> sealing it in plastic wrapping or ideally glass.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Agni-5 is {{specially}} tailored for road-mobility," [...] explained Avinash Chander, Director, ASL. [...] "With {{the canister}} having been successfully developed, all India's future land-based strategic missiles will be canisterised as well." [...] The missile will utilise a canister {{and will be}} launched from it. Made of maraging steel, a canister must provide a <b>hermetically</b> sealed atmosphere that preserves the missile for years.

2500|$|Southey's major failing is that, with {{a spirit}} of free inquiry that he cannot {{suppress}} in himself, he attempts to suppress free inquiry in others. Yet, even in Southey's political writings, Hazlitt credits him as refraining from advocating what might be practised by [...] "those whose hearts are naturally callous to truth, and whose understandings are <b>hermetically</b> sealed against all impressions but those of self-interest". He remains, after all, [...] "a reformist without knowing it. He does not advocate the slave-trade, he does not arm Mr. Malthus's revolting ratios with his authority, he does not strain hard to deluge Ireland with blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{function}} of the vacuum vessel {{is to provide a}} <b>hermetically</b> sealed plasma container. Its main components are the main vessel, the port structures and the supporting system. The main vessel is a double walled structure with poloidal and toroidal stiffening ribs between [...] shells to reinforce the vessel structure. These ribs also form the flow passages for the cooling water. The space between the double walls will be filled with shield structures made of stainless steel. The inner surfaces of the vessel will act as the interface with breeder modules containing the breeder blanket component. These modules will provide shielding from the high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion reactions and some will also be used for tritium breeding concepts.|$|E
2500|$|Emil Isac's {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} modernist literature in Romanian-speaking areas was pioneering: deemed [...] "the first 'modernist' Transylvanian poet" [...] by critic Gheorghe Grigurcu, he was also called [...] "a [...] exception {{on the other side of}} the Carpathians" [...] by literary historian Paul Cernat. Reviewing his own political battles, the poet identified such support for innovation with the rejection of isolationism: [...] "I write these words, these consoled, gentle, tired words, after a violent campaign. And I am tranquil when noting that I was right after all, in maintaining that, to us Romanians, modernism is the only force that may lead to a victory. [...] The world is not aware of us, because our nationalism has sealed us <b>hermetically</b> in front of all propitious influences." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} {{variant of}} potato chips exists {{in the form of}} [...] "potato sticks", also called shoestring potatoes. These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A hickory-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the vending machine name [...] "Hickory Sticks". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in <b>hermetically</b> sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). Reckitt Benckiser was a market leader in this category under the Durkee Potato Stix and French's Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.|$|E
2500|$|Despite its {{popularity}} {{from in the}} late Mesoamerican period into the early colonial period, few vestiges with this technique survive into the 21st century. [...] One {{reason for this is}} the care needed to maintain the pieces. It is important to know the characteristics of each type of feather to use and preserve them correctly. The best feathers to use are those that have been molted, as they have less organic materials and less likely to deteriorate. [...] A feather object can last indefinitely if it is preserved in a <b>hermetically</b> sealed case of inert gas, with a fixed humidity, darkness and low temperature. However, this renders the piece unobservable. These objects can be exhibited in galleries, museums and private collections with minimal decay if temperature and humidity are controlled and light kept to a minimum.|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{constructor}} of Sputnik 1 at OKB-1 was Mikhail S. Khomyakov. The satellite was a [...] diameter sphere, assembled {{from two}} hemispheres that were <b>hermetically</b> sealed with o-rings and connected by 36 bolts. It had {{a mass of}} [...] The hemispheres were 2mm thick, and were covered with a highly polished 1mm-thick heat shield made of aluminium-magnesium-titanium AMG6T alloy ("AMG" [...] is an abbreviation for [...] "aluminium-magnesium" [...] and [...] "T" [...] stands for [...] "titanium"; the alloy is 6% magnesium and 0.2% titanium). The satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by the Antenna Laboratory of OKB-1 led by Mikhail V. Krayushkin. Each antenna {{was made up of}} two whip-like parts: [...] in length, and had an almost spherical radiation pattern, so that the satellite beeps were transmitted with equal power in all directions, making reception of the transmitted signal independent of the satellite's rotation.|$|E
2500|$|Much later, in 1768, an Italian {{priest and}} {{scientist}} Lazzaro Spallanzani proved experimentally that heat killed bacteria, {{and that they}} do not reappear if the product is <b>hermetically</b> sealed. In 1795, a Parisian chef and confectioner named Nicolas Appert began experimenting with ways to preserve foodstuffs, succeeding with soups, vegetables, juices, dairy products, jellies, jams, and syrups. He placed the food in glass jars, sealed them with cork and sealing wax and placed them in boiling water. In that same year, the French military offered a cash prize of 12,000 francs for a new method to preserve food. [...] After some 14 or 15 years of experimenting, Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810. Later that year, Appert published L'Art de conserver les substances animales et végétales (or The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances). This was the first cookbook of its kind on modern food preservation methods.|$|E
