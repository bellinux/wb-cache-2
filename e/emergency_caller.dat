50|$|Since 2001, {{authorities}} have implemented project E911, which tries to automatically associate a location with {{the origin of}} calls to 9-1-1 emergency services. In 2006, the Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG 9-1-1) initiative was introduced. The purpose of the initiative is to afford any <b>emergency</b> <b>caller</b> the opportunity to use any communication means for connection to the emergency services operator, which in turn can receive location data from fixed and mobile phones, as well as automatic sensor-activated devices in case of accidents. In 2010, the system was tested and has become widely implemented.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand 111 service {{uses the}} Android Emergency Location Service {{to provide a}} mobile callers {{probable}} location; depending {{on a number of}} environmental conditions this could be as precise as 4 meters using the GNSS capabilities of an Android mobile phone. The location of mobile callers using Apple and other types of mobile phones uses statistical analysis to derive the callers probable location based on the cell tower connecting the emergency call (this is not triangulation as triangulation requires multiple cell towers which is not the norm for rural areas) with an accuracy of 1+ kilometer. All location data is only be held for 60 minutes and is then deleted to comply with the regulated conditions of use of <b>emergency</b> <b>caller</b> location information as set by the NZ Privacy Commissioner.|$|E
40|$|After an {{emergency}} call is completed (terminated either prematurely by the <b>emergency</b> <b>caller</b> or normally by the call taker), the call taker may {{feel the need}} for further communication. For example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call taker having sufficient information about the current state of an accident victim. A call taker may trigger a callback to the <b>emergency</b> <b>caller</b> using the contact information provided with the initial emergency call. This callback could, under certain circumstances, be treated like any other call and, as a consequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an answering machine. The IETF emergency services architecture specification already offers a solution approach for allowing Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) callbacks to bypass authorization policies in order to reach the caller without unnecessary delays. Unfortunately, the specified mechanism only supports limited scenarios. This document discusses shortcomings of the current mechanisms and illustrates additional scenarios where better-than-normal call treatment behavior would be desirable. We describe a solution based on a new header field value for the SIP Priority header field, called "psap-callback", to mark PSAP callbacks...|$|E

30|$|The answers of {{operators}} {{in the emergency}} response centres showed that the accident location is sometimes mislocated by the <b>emergency</b> <b>caller,</b> and that quite often the rescue units ask for additional information. eCall could provide accurate location information so that these sorts of problems can be avoided in the future, and rescue operations could proceed faster than is currently the case if caller is located based on the approximate location of the cellular phone. Because the percentage of long delays was substantial in accidents involving only vehicles for which the current system is not designed, {{it is suggested that}} eCall for motorcycles, mopeds etc. should be introduced as soon as possible. It seems obvious that the benefits of doing so would be remarkable if the reliability of the system were the same as, or better than, that for four-wheelers.|$|E

We investigated the linguistic features of the prompt “okay, tell me exactly what happened” in relation to the format (report vs. narrative) of the caller’s response. In addition, we compared calls with report vs. narrative responses in the length of response and time to dispatch.

3000|$|Our {{ability to}} {{determine}} the direction-of-arrival of a transmitted signal via antenna arrays has improved dramatically in recent years. The invention of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariant techniques (ESPRIT) algorithms enabled performance exceeding the resolution limit prescribed by the array dimensions (so-called [...] "super-resolution"). Applications include localization and tracking of airborne, undersea, or ground-based targets, civilian search and rescue operations, <b>emergency</b> <b>caller</b> location via cell towers, precision aircraft navigation and landing, characterization and modeling of spatial/temporal channels, and future location-based services in cellular networks. Angle estimation becomes especially challenging when multipath, interference, array miscalibration, or source correlation is encountered. Most textbook treatments of this topic cover only one-dimensional (1 D) angle estimation, implying that the source's movement {{takes place in the}} plane of the array. The extension to two-dimensional (2 D) AOA (azimuth and elevation) is not only necessary for many real-world applications, but introduces new problems and challenges that do not occur in the 1 D case. Furthermore, angular measurements may be combined with other modalities, such as Doppler, delay, delay-difference, polarization, received power, etc., necessitating a multi-dimensional (M-D) approach to direction-finding, location determination, or parametric MIMO channel modeling. Relevant problems involve so-called [...] "pair matching" [...] or [...] "parameter association" [...] between sets of independently obtained arrival angles or other parameters, complexity reduction in approaches requiring M-D search, and non-planar array design. Furthermore, the above techniques and problems can be applied to radar, acoustic localization, and nuclear magnetic resonance or acoustic imaging.|$|E
30|$|In {{accidents}} involving a four-wheel motor vehicle and an unprotected road user, the notification delays were shorter than in multi-vehicle accidents. In other words, {{there is not}} a great deal of scope for eCall to shorten the delay. However, it is assumed that there might be some benefits in terms of improved location information, as the driver could generate a manual emergency call that is much easier than giving specific location information while in shock from the accident. Overall, the responses of the operators showed that eCall can improve the location information, as the information provided by <b>emergency</b> <b>callers</b> is frequently imperfect. This finding is in line with many other evaluations (e.g. [14]).|$|R

50|$|In the U.S. the FCC {{requires}} that all carriers meet certain criteria for supporting location-based services (FCC 94-102). The mandate requires 95% of handsets to resolve within 300 meters for network-based tracking (e.g. triangulation) and 150 meters for handset-based tracking (e.g. GPS). This {{can be especially}} useful when dialing an emergency telephone number - such as enhanced 9-1-1 in North America, or 112 in Europe - so that the operator can dispatch emergency services such as emergency medical services, police or firefighters to the correct location. CDMA and iDEN operators have chosen to use GPS location technology for locating <b>emergency</b> <b>callers.</b> This led to rapidly increasing penetration of GPS in iDEN and CDMA handsets in North America {{and other parts of}} the world where CDMA is widely deployed. Even though no such rules are yet in place in Japan or in Europe the number of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handset models is growing fast. According to the independent wireless analyst firm Berg Insight the attach rate for GPS is growing rapidly in GSM/WCDMA handsets, from less than 8% in 2008 to 15% in 2009.|$|R

Basic 911 allows people within a given locality to access specialized call-takers and ambulance dispatchers using the single telephone number 911. Enhanced 911 is characterized by telecommunications equipment and information technology which identifies the location of <b>emergency</b> <b>callers.</b> We begin by exploring the distribution of 911 systems among counties in the U. S., showing that this locally provided service responds to income and political factors as well as population and density of a county. Then, using a database of cardiac patients in Pennsylvania in 1995, {{we are able to}} characterize some of the productivity efforts of 911 services. We show that Enhanced 911 reduces response times, which in turn reduce mortality. Further, we find that the pre-hospital system interacts with the allocation of patients to hospitals in several ways. First, patient severity affect the allocation of patients to high-technology hospitals. Second, conditional on the availability of advanced cardiac care facilities, counties with 911 systems allocate cardiac patients to hospitals with better technology. Finally, hospitals with more advanced emergency and cardiac technology treat a higher share of cardiac patients who make use of the pre- hospital system. ...|$|R
