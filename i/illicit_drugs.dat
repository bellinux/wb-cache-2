5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs,</b> including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{complications}} {{are associated}} with a bad prognosis. Examples are hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation), lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures. Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years (in children, younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, family environment, social support systems and financial circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs,</b> and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E
5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E

A drug illicitly produced in one country often ends up in another country, changing hands many times in different countries. This international nature of <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> traffic warrants effective and concerted international action to fight it. Since the harms of drug abuse and the problems of <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> traffic {{came to the attention of}} the international community in the early part of this century, efforts have been exerted to establish and improve an international legal framework to provide principles and guidelines for effective national and international action in the control of drugs and the fight against <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> traffic.

Summary The advent of the Internet has created opportunities for the global exchange of information and purchase of goods and services. However, it has also facilitated the creation of online <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> markets and forums in which drug-related information can be exchanged between users. Bruno, Poesiat & Matthews (2013) reported that illicit drug-specific search terms (such as cocaine, ecstasy, hallucinogens and high) were used, on average, 39, 700 times per month in the Google search engine in Australia. Examining {{access to and}} the extent of engagement with the Internet in illicit drug-using populations may provide an indication of the extent to which the online <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> market is usurping the physical <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> market.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: HIV {{infection}} and <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use are each associated with diminished cognitive performance. This {{study examined the}} separate and interactive effects of HIV and recent <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use on verbal memory, processing speed, and executive function in the multicenter Women's Interagency HIV Study. METHODS: Participants included 952 HIV-infected and 443 HIV-uninfected women (mean age = 42. 8, 64 % African-American). Outcome measures included the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised and the Stroop test. Three drug use groups were compared: recent <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> users (cocaine or heroin use in past 6 months, n = 140), former users (lifetime cocaine or heroin use but not in past 6 months, n = 651), and nonusers (no lifetime use of cocaine or heroin, n = 604). RESULTS: The typical pattern of recent drug use was daily or weekly smoking of crack cocaine. HIV {{infection and}} recent <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use were each associated with worse verbal learning and memory (P < 0. 05). Importantly, there was an interaction between HIV serostatus and recent <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use such that recent <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use (compared with nonuse) negatively impacted verbal learning and memory only in HIV-infected women (P < 0. 01). There was no interaction between HIV serostatus and <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use on processing speed or executive function on the Stroop test. CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between HIV serostatus and recent <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use on verbal learning and memory suggests a potential synergistic neurotoxicity that may affect the neural circuitry underlying performance on these tasks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Statistics {{from the}} National Trauma Data Bank imply that {{discretionary}} blood alcohol and urine drug testing is common. However, {{there is little}} evidence to determine which patients are appropriate for routine testing, based on information available at trauma center arrival. In 2002, Langdorf reported alcohol and <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> rates in Trauma Activation Patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This is a retrospective investigation of alcohol and <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> rates in consecutive St. Elizabeth Health Center (SEHC) trauma patients. SEHC Trauma Activation Patients are compared with the Langdorf Activation Patients and with the SEHC Trauma Nonactivation Patients. Minimum Rates are positive tests divided by total patients (tested and not tested). Activation patients: The minimum alcohol rates were: SEHC 23. 1 %, Langdorf 28. 2 %, combined 24. 8 %. The minimum <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> rates were: SEHC 15. 7 %, Langdorf 23. 5, combined 18. 3 %. The minimum alcohol and/or <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> rates were: SEHC 33. 4 %, Langdorf 41. 8 %, combined 36. 2 %. Nonactivation patients: The SEHC minimum alcohol rate was 4. 7 % and the minimum <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> rate was 6. 0 %. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> rates were significantly greater for Trauma Activation Patients, when compared to Nonactivation Patients. At minimum, Trauma Activation Patients are likely to have a 1 -in- 3 positive test for alcohol and/or an <b>illicit</b> <b>drug.</b> This substantial rate suggests that Trauma Activation Patients, a readily discernible group at trauma center arrival, are appropriate for routine alcohol and <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> testing.
