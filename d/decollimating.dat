40|$|In {{the rainbow}} schlieren apparatus, a {{continuously}} graded rainbow filter {{is placed in}} the back focal plane of the <b>decollimating</b> lens. Refractive-index gradients in the test section thus appear as gradations in hue rather than irradiance. A simple system is described wherein a conventional color CCD array and video digitizer are used to quantify accurately the color attributes of the resulting image, and hence the associated ray deflections. The present system provides a sensitivity comparable with that of conventional interferometry, while being simpler to implement and less sensitive to mechanical misalignment...|$|E
40|$|A large-aperture {{interferometer}} was {{devised by}} adding a local-reference-beam-generating optical system to a schlieren system. Two versions of the interferometer are demonstrated, one employing 12. 7 cm (5 in.) diameter schlieren optics, the other employing 30. 48 cm (12 in.) diameter parabolic mirrors in an off-axis system. In the latter configuration a cylindrical lens is introduced near the light source to correct for astigmatism. A zone plate is a satisfactory <b>decollimating</b> element in the reference-beam arm of the interferometer.

40|$|Numerical {{analysis}} and experimental {{results are presented}} to define a method for quantitatively measuring the temperature distribution of a spherical diffusion flame using Rainbow Schlieren Deflectometry in microgravity. First, a numerical analysis is completed to show the method can suitably determine temperature {{in the presence of}} spatially varying species composition. Also, a numerical forward-backward inversion calculation is presented to illustrate the types of calculations and deflections to be encountered. Lastly, a normal gravity demonstration of temperature measurement in an axisymmetric laminar, diffusion flame using Rainbow Schlieren deflectometry is presented. The method employed in this paper illustrates the necessary steps for the preliminary design of a Schlieren system. The largest deflections for the normal gravity flame considered in this paper are 7. 4 x 10 (- 4) radians which can be accurately measured with 2 meter focal length collimating and <b>decollimating</b> optics. The experimental uncertainty of deflection is less than 5 x 10 (- 5) radians...|$|E
40|$|Extragalactic jets {{in active}} galactic nuclei (AGN) {{are divided into}} two {{morphological}} types, namely Fanaroff-Riley I (FRI) and Fanaroff-Riley II (FRII). The former show <b>decollimated</b> structure at the kiloparsec scales and {{are thought to be}} decelerated by entrainment within the first kiloparsecs of evolution inside the host galaxy. The entrainment and deceleration can be, at least partly, due to the interaction of jets with stellar winds and gas clouds that enter in the jet as they orbit around the galactic centre. In this contribution, I review recent simulations to study the dynamic effect of entrainment from stellar winds in jets and the direct interaction of jets with gas clouds and stellar winds. I also briefly describe the importance of these interactions as a possible scenario of high-energy emission from extragalactic jets.

40|$|Jets in low-luminosity radio {{galaxies are}} known to {{decelerate}} from relativistic speeds on parsec scales to mildly or sub-relativistic speeds on kiloparsec scales. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this effect, including strong reconfinement shocks {{and the growth of}} instabilities (both leading to boundary-layer entrainment) and mass loading from stellar winds or molecular clouds. We have performed a series of axisymmetric simulations of the early evolution of jets in a realistic ambient medium to probe the effects of mass loading from stellar winds using the code Ratpenat. We study the evolution of Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI) jets, with kinetic powers L_j ∼ 1. e 41 - 1. e 44 erg/s, within the first 2 kpc of their evolution, where deceleration by stellar mass loading should be most effective. Mass entrainment rates consistent with present models of stellar mass loss in elliptical galaxies produce deceleration and effective decollimation of weak FRI jets within the first kiloparsec. However, powerful FRI jets are not decelerated significantly. In those cases where the mass loading is important, the jets show larger opening angles and <b>decollimate</b> at smaller distances, but the overall structure and dynamics of the bow-shock {{are similar to those of}} unloaded jets with the same power and thrust. According to our results, the flaring observed on kpc scales is initiated by mass loading in the weaker FRI jets and by reconfinement shocks or the growth of instabilities in the more powerful jets. The final mechanism of decollimation and deceleration is always the development of disruptive pinching modes.

40|$|We present {{preliminary}} {{results from a}} deep (600 ks) Chandra observation of the hot interstellar medium of the nearby early-type galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A). We find a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas ∼ 3. 5 kpc from the nucleus spanning a 120 ^∘ arc. The temperature of the gas is 0. 60 ± 0. 05 and 0. 68 ± 0. 10 keV, interior and exterior to the discontinuity, respectively. The elemental abundance is poorly constrained by the spectral fits, but if the abundance is constant across the discontinuity, there is a factor of 2. 3 ± 0. 4 pressure jump across the discontinuity. This would imply that the gas is moving at 470 ± 100 km s^- 1, or Mach 1. 0 ± 0. 2 (1. 2 ± 0. 2) relative to the sound speed of the gas external (internal) to the discontinuity. Alternatively, pressure balance could be maintained {{if there is a}} large (factor of ∼ 7) discontinuity in the elemental abundance. We suggest that the observed discontinuity is the result of non-hydrostatic motion of the gas core (i. e. sloshing) due to the recent merger. In this situation, both gas motions and abundance gradients are important in the visibility of the discontinuity. Cen A is in the late stages of merging with a small late-type galaxy, and a large discontinuity in density and abundance across a short distance demonstrates that the gas of the two galaxies remains poorly mixed even several hundred million years after the merger. The pressure discontinuity may have had a profound influence on the temporal evolution of the kpc-scale jet. The jet could have <b>decollimated</b> crossing the discontinuity and thereby forming the northeast radio lobe.

40|$|We {{consider}} a self-similar force-free wind flowing {{out of an}} infinitely thin disk located in the equatorial plane. On the disk plane, {{we assume that the}} magnetic stream function P scales as P∝ R^ν, where R is the cylindrical radius. We also assume that the azimuthal velocity in the disk is constant: v_ϕ = Mc, where M< 1 is a constant. For each choice of the parameters ν and M, we find an infinite number of solutions that are physically well-behaved and have fluid velocity ≤ c throughout the domain of interest. Among these solutions, we show via physical arguments and time-dependent numerical simulations that the minimum-torque solution, i. e., the solution with the smallest amount of toroidal field, is the one picked by a real system. For ν≥ 1, the Lorentz factor of the outflow increases along a field line as γ≈ M(z/) ^(2 -ν) / 2 ≈ R/R_ A, where is the radius of the foot-point of the field line on the disk and R_ A=/M is the cylindrical radius at which the field line crosses the Alfven surface or the light cylinder. For ν < 1, the Lorentz factor follows the same scaling for z/ < M^- 1 /(1 -ν), but at larger distances it grows more slowly: γ≈ (z/) ^ν/ 2. For either regime of ν, the dependence of γ on M shows that the rotation of the disk plays a strong role in jet acceleration. On the other hand, the poloidal shape of a field line is given by z/≈ (R/) ^ 2 /(2 -ν) and is independent of M. Thus rotation has neither a collimating nor a <b>decollimating</b> effect on field lines, suggesting that relativistic astrophysical jets are not collimated by the rotational winding up of the magnetic field.

40|$|Microgravity fluid physics {{experiments}} frequently measure {{concentration and}} temperature. Interferometers {{such as the}} Twyman Green illustrated have performed full-field measurement of these quantities. As with most such devices, this interferometer uses a reference path that is not common with the path through the test section. Recombination of the test and reference wavefronts produces interference fringes. Unfortunately, {{in order to obtain}} stable fringes, the alignment of both the test and reference paths must be maintained to within a fraction of the wavelength of the light being used for the measurement. Otherwise, the fringes will shift and may disappear. Because these interferometers are extremely sensitive to bumping, jarring and transmitted vibration, they are typically mounted on optical isolation tables. Schlieren deflectometers or the more recent Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors also measure concentration and temperature in laboratory fluid flows. Ray optics describe the operation of both devices. In a schlieren system, an expanded, collimated beam passes through a test section where refractive index gradients deflect rays. A lens focuses the beam to a filter placed in the rear focal plane of the <b>decollimating</b> lens. In a quantitative color schlieren system, gradients in the index of refraction appear as colors in the field of view due to the action of the color filter. Since sensitivity {{is a function of the}} focal length of the <b>decollimating</b> lens, these systems are rather long and filter fabrication and calibration is rather difficult. A Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor is an array of small lenslets. Typical diameters are on the order of a few hundred microns. Since these lenslets divide the test section into resolution elements, the spatial resolution can be no smaller than an individual lenslet. Such a device was recently used to perform high-speed tomography of heated air exiting a 1. 27 cm diameter nozzle. While these wavefront sensors are very compact, the limited spatial resolution and the methods required for data reduction suggest that a more useful instrument needs to be developed. The category of interferometers known as common path interferometers can eliminate much of the vibration sensitivity associated with traditional interferometry as described above. In these devices, division of the amplitude of the wavefront following the test section produces the reference beam. Examples of these instruments include shearing and point diffraction interferometers. In the latter case, shown schematically, a lens focuses light passing through the test section onto a small diffracting object. Such objects are typically either a circle of material on a high quality glass plate or a small sphere in a glass cell. The size of the focused spot is several times larger than the object so that the light not intercepted by the diffracting object forms the test beam while the diffracted light generates a spherical reference beam. While this configuration is mechanically stable, phase shifting one beam with respect to the other is difficult due to the common path. Phase shifting enables extremely accurate measurements of the phase of the interferogram using only gray scale intensity measurements and is the de facto standard of industry. Mercer and Creath 2 demonstrated phase shifting in a point diffraction interferometer using a spherical spacer in a liquid crystal cell as the diffracting object. By changing the voltage across the cell, they were able to shift the phase of the undiffracted beam relative to the reference beam generated by diffraction from the sphere. While they applied this technology to fluid measurements, the device shifted phase so slowly that it was not useful for studying transient phenomena. We have identified several technical problems that precluded operation of the device at video frame rates and intend to solve them to produce a phase-shifting liquid crystal point-diffraction interferometer operating at video frame rates. The first task is to produce high contrast fringes. Since the diffracted beam is much weaker than the transmitted beam, interferograms have poor contrast unless a dye is added to the liquid crystal to reduce the intensity of the undiffracted light. Dyes previously used were not rigorously characterized and suffered from hysteresis in both the initial alignment state of the device and the electro-optic switching characteristics. Hence, our initial effort will identify and characterize dyes that do not suffer from these difficulties and are readily soluble in the liquid crystal host. Since the ultimate goal of this research is to produce interferometers capable of phase shifting at video frame rates, we will quantify the difference in switching times between ferroelectric and nematic liquid crystals. While we have more experience with nematic crystals, they typically switch more slowly than ferroelectric cells. As part of that effort, we will investigate the difference in the modulation of the interferograms as a function of the type of liquid crystal in the cell. Because the temporal switching response of a liquid crystal cell is directly related its thickness, we intend to explore techniques required to produce cells that are as thin as possible. However, the cells must still produce a total phase shift of two pi radians...|$|E
