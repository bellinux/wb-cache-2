50|$|Traditionally {{known in}} the United States as the <b>imported</b> <b>cabbage</b> <b>worm,</b> now more {{commonly}} the cabbage white, the caterpillars are bluish-green, with tiny black pints, a black ring around the spiracles, and a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow middorsal line. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less visible to predators. Although the larval instars have not been fully studied, different instars are easily differentiated simply by comparing sizes, especially the head alone. During {{the first and second}} instar the head is entirely black; third instar has the clypeus yellow {{but the rest of the}} head black. In the fourth and fifth instar, there is a dark greenish-yellow dot behind each eye but with rest of the head black. However, the color of the caterpillar head does not necessarily indicate specific instar, as the time of color change is not fixed. In the larval stage, the small white can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, kale, radish, broccoli, and horseradish. The larva is considered a serious pest for commercial growth of cabbage and other Brassicaceae.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Relay strip-cropping {{combines}} two vegetation management tactics, under-sowing and strip-management. In {{this study}} conducted from 1994 though 1997, a cover crop seed-mixture containing oats (Avena sativa L. var. "Monida"), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), annual ryegrass (Lolium multflorum Lam.), and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) was broadcast over established broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) 32 days after planting. The broccoli was planted, under-sown, and harvested in sections alternated with strips of cover crop. The cover crop relay provided tillage and pesticide refuges for beneficial insects without taking land out of broccoli production. Relay strip-cropping increased the abundance {{and diversity of}} ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), spiders (Araneae), harvestmen (Opiliones: Phalangiidae), lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and damsel bugs (Heteroptera: Nabidae) in the cropping system; however, this did not always result in increased natural enemies in the broccoli. Arthropod species varied significantly in their propensity to leave the non-crop vegetation and move into the broccoli. Movement of the lady beetle Coccinella septempunctata L. from the cover crop strips into the broccoli may have depressed aphid populations in 1996. The non-crop vegetation may {{have served as a}} sink rather than a source for Nabis species and appeared to reduce their density in the broccoli growing nearby. There was no evidence that background vegetation surrounding the broccoli reduced colonization by winged aphids. The density of the cabbage flea beetle Phyllotreta crucferae Goeze was lower in the broccoli relay compared with the clean-tilled broccoli. The number of third instar <b>imported</b> <b>cabbage</b> <b>worm</b> Pieris rapae (L.) and cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) was reduced on broccoli leaves and harvested buds in the relay strip-cropping system compared with the clean-tilled system. The number of diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L.) pupae was higher in the clean-tilled broccoli; percent parasitism of the pupae was similar in the two cropping systems. Although reduction in broccoli contamination associated with relay strip-cropping was significant, the residual insect contamination was unacceptable for commercial broccoli production. Relay strip-cropping may be useful for preventing soil erosion and protecting water quality. Relay strip-cropping may be a useful component of an integrated pest management program...|$|E

40|$|The green {{caterpillar}} of the Large <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Worm</b> Pieris rapae, {{with its}} narrow orange or yellow dorsal stripe, {{emerges from the}} soil for two to four weeks in order to feed on the leaves of many different species of cabbages. It then returns underground to reappear 15 days later as a white butterfly. An understanding of this life-cycle shows how the pest can be controlled {{without the use of}} chemicals. The first step is to practice crop rotation by alternating carrots or maize, for example, with cabbages. The caterpillars are then starved of their food source. By turning over the soil around the cabbage plants several times, both at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the season, the caterpillars are desiccated through exposure to air. If some escape they can be retrieved manually and destroyed. The butterflies can be controlled by using a sticky, yellow trap placed in the middle of the crop, or they can be discouraged by cultivating plants that have a strong and, to the butterflies, unpleasant, odour (onion, garlic, sage, mint, cinnamon). Other non-chemical means of control include the use of a garlic concoction made with crushed garlic cloves (five cloves to four litres of water) or by macerating neem seeds (two handfuls of crushed seed to ten litres of water over 12 hours) or even by scattering a mixture of one part salt to two parts flour on the plants after rain. The caterpillars gorge themselves on this mixture and become so bloated that they die. Another strong ally is a small wasp which lays its eggs among those of the Large <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Worm</b> and on which the young wasps feed. Wasps can be attracted by planting, for example, mint or parsley, but insecticides must be avoided because the wasps are particularly sensitive to them. However, with this array of weapons ranged against the pest, chemicals should be unnecessary.

50|$|Compsilura concinnata (tachinid fly; order Diptera) is a {{parasitoid}} {{native to}} Europe that {{was introduced to}} North America in 1906 to control the population of an exotic forest, univoltine, gypsy moth named Lymantria dispar.

It attacks over 200 host species, mainly insects from the Orders: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Since this parasite has the opportunity to attack many different types of hosts, the biological control has spilled over from the intended forest systems into other areas like agricultural fields affecting cabbage pests like the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia) and the <b>cabbage</b> <b>worm</b> (Pieris rapae) as well as native, non-pest insects.

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportConsumers, retailers, and growers of {{bedding plants}} (spring flowers and {{vegetable}} starts) {{are concerned about}} the use of neonicotinoid pesticides and their impact on pollinator health. In some locations consumers demand that greenhouse growers stop the use of certain pesticides. This demand has reached greenhouse growers and spurred interest in the use of biocontrol in New York’s Capital Region. The goal of this implementation project was to provide an understanding of the challenges and benefits of using biocontrol in greenhouse production to the major players in the bedding plant industry: consumers, growers, and educators. Specifically, I hoped to improve retailer and grower biocontrol communication to consumers, give consumers knowledge of biocontrol, and increase grower confidence applying biocontrol products. Biocontrol demonstration was implemented at the Schenectady County Horticulture Education Center (SCHEC) where educational workshops were held to explain what the biocontrol agents are, the packaging they arrive in, understand the complexity of biocontrol systems, and ask questions. Demonstrations focused on the biocontrol of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae sp. and Sciaridae sp.), and green peach aphids (Myzus persicae).

Growers must protect their crop from these pests by any means available. Presently, pesticides are the most widely used and effective means of crop protection. However, total reliance upon pesticides, to the exclusion of other control tactics, can be inefficient. Strict adherence to pesticides and regular repetitive spraying may result in: increased pest resistance to pesticides; detrimental effects on non-target organisms; environmental pollution; potential hazard to the pesticide applicator, farm worker, and consumer; spiraling treatment costs; and uneconomical use of energy. Since processing cabbage (for sauerkraut) need not be cosmetically perfect, a certain amount of leaf damage by Lepidoptera or diseases is acceptable. This allows growers to treat sauerkraut cabbage less often than fresh market cabbage (approximately 4 vs 8 sprays/field/season, respectively). Since the return per acre of processed cabbage is considerably less than that of fresh market cabbage ($ 736 and $ 3, 500, respectively), sauerkraut growers must be more economical in their crop protection practices...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the operation and}} results of a vegetable market information and consultation system (MICS), set up between 2002 and 2005 in Hanoi, to address marketing problems faced by vegetable farmers. A MICS is a market information system (MIS) combined with debates organised among farmers, traders, and development agents to reach common visions and strategies on marketing. Information collected {{in the first years}} relating to indicators of origin and supply deficits was disseminated to farmers and extension agents through newsletters and consultation meetings. The process then focused on making daily prices available, as requested by the farmers. The system was based on a network of contact traders and dissemination was by television. The workshops made it possible to reach a consensus for market opportunities arising from periods of supply deficit for some vegetables and how {{to take advantage of this}} situation, especially for tomatoes and <b>cabbage</b> <b>imported</b> from China during the rainy season, which presented some quality differences compared to the local products. With regards to price information, the majority of farmers and traders, surveyed by a quick-impact appraisal, stated they had access through television on a regular basis and that they used price information mostly to bargain with traders. Back up for a permanent ''safe'' vegetable producer and trader association was one of the outputs of the MICS. Our experience shows that price dissemination was easier to sustain (with the involvement of the public sector) than the consultation workshops, generally due to low local capacity in terms of meeting facilitation and the present weakness of extension services and sector organisations.
