5000|$|The Assembly of States Parties is {{required}} to [...] "take into account {{the need for the}} representation of the principal legal systems of the world, <b>equitable</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>representation</b> and a fair representation of female and male judges. They shall take into account the need to include judges with legal expertise on specific issues, including, but not limited to, violence against women and children." [...] Thus, there are voting requirements established which require at least six judges to be female and at least six to be male. Additionally, each regional group of the United Nations has at least two judges. If a regional group has more than sixteen states parties this leads to a minimum voting requirement of three judges from this regional group. Therefore, from the Statute's entry into force for the Maldives on 1 December 2011, all regional groups can claim a third judge.|$|E

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} impact of {{sovereign}} countries in global financial governance. It uses the methodology of international political economy that studies the interaction between political and economic processes in the international arena. It shows the dualistic nature of international financial institutions, which, on the one hand, represent intergovernmental organizations and, on the other hand, are financial institutions with financial goals. The author investigates the principles of sovereign equality, <b>equitable</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>representation</b> and equal (parity) representation of groups of countries with distinct interests in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Group of 20 (G 20) and Financial Stability Board (FSB). The IMF’s decision-making mechanism is shown in detail, including its executive board and the recent redistribution of quotas among member states, with special attention on the formula for calculating quotas, its criticism and possible reform. The article shows the major causes of reducing {{the impact of}} the IMF and the formation of a new, globally distributed system of financial governance. The article shows the hierarchy (by function as well as by country representativeness) of the system of global financial governance, established by 2010. It discusses the leadership of countries according to quantity and to key indicators (revenues, assets and market capitalization) of global systemically important financial institutions (banks and insurance company). Based on countries’ membership in the G 7 and the G 20, the FSB, IMF, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and Bank for International Settlements countries are designated as at the core, semi-periphery or periphery of the international financial system {{in the context of the}} world systems theory. The influence of the technical elite, prevailing in the international financial sector, as well as the qualitative composition (education) of its members are revealed. The article concludes that there is significant polarization in the international financial system (core and the so-called marginal majority). Unlike the IMF, the newly created global financial institutions of the G 20 and FSB fully comply with the principles of <b>equitable</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>representation</b> and parity representation of states with distinct interests...|$|E

The article {{presents}} the short {{evolution of the}} Court of Justice of the European Union. The author focuses on the resent (2015) amendment of the Statute of the Court of Justice of European Union, which {{increased the number of}} the judges in the General Court. The article aims - to analyze the reform of the General Court, to reveal the reasons of the reform, to review the discussions held in the EU institutions during decision-making process, to disclose the Court of Justice and the General Court's position concerning the implementation of the reform. The article raises the question: whether the amendment of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which provides that every Member State should have two judges in the General Court, is the most consistent with the needs of the General Court. In the historical development of the EU the main reasons for reforming the Court of Justice always has been an increasing number of cases in these courts. For the reform the European Union Court of Justice of 2015 the European Union was preparing gradually. Already in the Lisbon Treaty the supranational EU institutions were empowered to make the amendments of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Already {{at the start of the}} reform of the General Court it was rejected to establish a specialized court giving priority to the increasing the number of judges of the General Court. It was argued that the appointment of additional judges of the General Court would be faster and more flexible process than the establishment of a specialized court. The creation of specialized colleges of the General Court would provide the key advantage of a specialized court. The decisive factor to have two judges in the General Court was the individual interest of each Member State to appoint the same number of judges as other Member States, although the President of the Court of Justice stated that <b>equitable</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>representation</b> is not the most important criterion to ensure that court's effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|Much {{ecological}} research {{relies on}} existing multispecies distribution datasets. Such datasets, however, can vary considerably in quality, extent, resolution or taxonomic coverage. We {{provide a framework}} for a spatially-explicit evaluation of <b>geographical</b> <b>representation</b> within large-scale species distribution datasets, using the comparison of an occurrence atlas with a range atlas dataset as a working example. Specifically, we compared occurrence maps for 3773 taxa from the widely-used Atlas Florae Europaeae (AFE) with digitised range maps for 2049 taxa of the lesser-known Atlas of North European Vascular Plants. We calculated the level of agreement at a 50 -km spatial resolution using average latitudinal and longitudinal species range, and area of occupancy. Agreement in species distribution was calculated and mapped using Jaccard similarity index and a reduced major axis (RMA) regression analysis of species richness between the entire atlases (5221 taxa in total) and between co-occurring species (601 taxa). We found no difference in distribution ranges or in the area of occupancy frequency distribution, indicating that atlases were sufficiently overlapping for a valid comparison. The similarity index map showed high levels of agreement for central, western, and northern Europe. The RMA regression confirmed that <b>geographical</b> <b>representation</b> of AFE was low in areas with a sparse data recording history (e. g., Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine). For co-occurring species in south-eastern Europe, however, the Atlas of North European Vascular Plants showed remarkably higher richness estimations. <b>Geographical</b> <b>representation</b> of atlas data can be much mor...|$|R
