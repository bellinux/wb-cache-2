Hutchinson (1863) reported the case of a man aged 24 with congenital syphilis who had suffered bilateral interstitial keratitis at the age of 6; both eyes had deeply cupped and atrophic optic discs and iridectomy failed to control the glaucoma. Hutchinson believed that the glaucoma was due to the interstitial keratitis. Fuchs (1899) said that "an increase of tension is but rarely observed, and, when it is, sometimes occurs years after the inflammation has run its course". de Schweinitz (1916) stated that "secondary glaucoma may develop, with deep cupping of the disc", but gave no interval. Kraupa (1934) reported three cases of late glaucoma following interstitial keratitis. Schulmann (1934) described glaucoma 4 years after bilateral interstitial keratitis.

40|$|Technological {{improvements}} shifted sequencing from low-throughput, work-intensive, gel-based {{systems to}} high-throughput capillary systems. This {{resulted in a}} broad use of genomic resequencing to identify sequence variations in genes and regulatory, as well as extended genomic regions. We describe a software package, novoSNP, that conscientiously discovers single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion-deletion polymorphisms (INDELs) in sequence trace files in a fast, reliable, and user-friendly way. We compared the performance of novoSNP with that of PolyPhred and PolyBayes on two data sets. The first data set comprised 1028 sequence trace <b>files</b> obtained from <b>diagnostic</b> mutation analyses of SCN 1 A (neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit type I gene). The second data set comprised 9062 sequence trace files from a genomic resequencing project aiming at {{the construction of a}} high-density SNP map of MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau gene). Visual inspection of these data sets had identified 38 sequence variations for SCN 1 A and 488 for MAPT. novoSNP automatically identified all 38 SCN 1 A variations including five INDELs, while for MAPT only 15 of the 488 variations were not correctly marked. PolyPhred detected far fewer SNPs as compared to novoSNP and missed nearly all INDELs. PolyBayes, designed for the sequence analysis of cloned templates, detected {{only a limited number of}} the variations present in the data set. Besides the significant improvement in the automated detection of sequence variations both in diagnostic mutation analyses and in SNP discovery projects, novoSNP also offers a user-friendly interface for inspecting possible genetic variations...|$|R
40|$|Aims and {{background}} Liver biopsy {{contribute to the}} diagnostic evaluation of abnormal liver enzyme tests of unclear etiology, after a thorough history, biochemical, serological, and imaging investigation have failed to elucidate a diagnosis. However, liver biopsy is an invasive investigation carrying risk of complications and does not always lead to a diagnosis or a change in management. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the outcome and diagnostic contribution of liver biopsy in order to gain a better understanding of its use as a diagnostic tool. Methods All histological findings of liver biopsies performed in the hospital of Deventer (Deventer Ziekenhuis) between 1999 and 2009 were retrospectively examined and reinforced with electronic medical <b>files</b> of patients. <b>Diagnostic</b> contribution was evaluated in those which were performed for diagnostic reasons. Complications of all liver biopsies were inventoried and investigated whether or not they were performed on diagnostic grounds. Relations between different variables and complications, diagnostic contributions and change of management were analysed with the Chi-square test and de Fisher exact test. Results 198 liver biopsie records were studied of which 105 (53, 0 %) were performed for diagnostic purposes. Complications occurred with 6. 6 % (n= 13) of all liver biopsies. These complications occurred with liver biopsies which were performed for diagnostic reasons (5. 6 %) and investigation of liver lesions (1. 0 %). In 10, 5 % of all diagnostic liver biopsies there were complications. An increased risk of all complications was significant for all patients who underwent a diagnostic liver biopsie to investigate abnormal liver enzyme values (p= 0. 017). A diagnostic contribution was found in 60, 0 % of al liver biopsies. Only 18. 1 % of the cases led to a change in management of medication. 31. 4 % of the liver biopsies led to lifestyle recommendations or change of liver test monitoring, and 29. 5 % of the liver biopsies led to unchanged management. There was no significant connection found between diagnostic value of liver biopsy and a change in management (p= 0, 256). Conclusions Liver biopsies have a very limited diagnostic value for management of patients with elevated liver enzyme tests of unclear etiology after biochemical, serological and imaging investigation. There was no significant connection between change in management and a liver biopsie which contributes to the diagnosis. There is a significant increase in risk of complications for these patients and restraint of liver biopsy for this group of patients is emphasized by this study. Pragmatic management of patients with elevated liver enzyme values of unclear etiology after biochemical, serological and imaging investigation seems as effective as performing liver biopsy. ...|$|R
40|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) cytology {{is accepted}} for diagnosing malignant tumours in adults. However, {{it has been}} slow in gaining acceptance among paediatricians and has only been used at some centres in the routine diagnosis of childhood tumours. The aims of this thesis were to study 1 : the diagnostic accuracy of FNA cytology and II: the usefulness of immunocytochemistry (IC) and molecular techniques to aid the diagnosis of cytomorphology of the small round cell tumours (SRCTs) in childhood. This is a retrospective study and the patients were retrieved from <b>diagnostic</b> <b>files</b> from the units of Paediatric Oncology and Cytology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm. Patient records, cytological and histological slides were reviewed. Fresh or archival FNA material was used for IC and molecular techniques. These included image cytometry (ICM) for DNA content, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for 1 p deletion and N-myc amplification in neuroblastic tumours (NT), and interphase FISH for the diagnostic EWS gene (22 q 12) rearrangement in Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours (pPNET). FNA cytology correctly diagnosed and classified 85 / 94 patients (90. 4 %) with SRCTs at primary disease into lymphoma (27 / 27 : B-cell lymphoma 9 / 9; lymphoblastic lymphoma 8 / 8; Ki- 1 anaplastic large cell lymphoma 2 / 2; Hodgkin's disease 6 / 6; leukemic lymphadenopathy 2 / 2), rhabdomyosarcoma (16 / 20), NT (21 / 24), and Ewing's sarcoma/pPNET (21 / 23). Therapy was based on FNA diagnosis alone together with clinical stage in 57 of 94 patients (60. 6 %) after primary work-up. Surgery for diagnosis was in these cases obviated. Forty-one FNAs correctly diagnosed relapse in 29 and excluded relapse in 12 cases. There was no false positive or negative diagnosis of malignancy. The INA material was insufficient for evaluation in one case each of ganglioneuroma, rhabdomyosarcoma and necrotic neuroblastoma, respectively (2. 2 % of 135 aspirations). All three patients with false primary diagnoses and four with a closest diagnosis of small round cell sarcoma (including 2 relapses) were diagnosed without IC or with aid of a limited panel of immunomarkers. Vimentin and MIC 2 were unexpectedly immunostained in tumour cells on INA material from NT, but not in corresponding surgical specimens. Different preparation and fixation techniques may explain the findings. Sixty-two molecular analyses in 18 NTs on fresh (n = 34) or archival (n = 28) FNA specimens were evaluated by ICM for DNA content (n = 20), interphase FISH for chromosome 1 or 2 number (n = 11), 1 p status (n = 16), and N-myc status (n = 15) and resulted in informative results of prognostic importance in 60 (97 %). FISH on aspirated interphase tumour cells from 20 Ewing's sarcoma/pPNETs demonstrated the diagnostic EWS rearrangement in 18 cases (90 %) using fresh (6 / 7) or archival (12 / 13) specimens. Conclusions: FNA cytology combined with a panel of immunomarkers allows a conclusive diagnosis that allows therapeutic decisions {{in children and adolescents}} with lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastic tumours and Ewing's sarcoma/pPNET. It is possible to use interphase FISH and ICM on FNA specimens for prognostic characterisation in neuroblastic tumours and diagnostic purposes in Ewing's sarcoma/pPNET.

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{benefits}} and applications of computers and multimedia systems in post-mortem examination practice and, more in particular, {{in the definition of}} data collection protocols. We examined issues concerning the different aims of autopsy (e. g. diagnostic, scientific, educational, legal), and found that the pathologist s main duty is to acquire a large amount of data in the best possible way. However, despite the will to carry out detailed post-mortem examinations, many pathologic anatomy services face objective difficulties in doing so, especially due to understaffing, lack of time and high costs. The Institute for Pathologic Anatomy of the University of Genoa has developed software for data handling and for outcome reporting, a particularly important aspect in fetal-perinatal diagnosis. The system consists of a relational database in a client-server environment (Fourth Dimension) with two integrated parts. The first part, with unrestricted access, contains patients 'personal data, including gender, age, time and date of death, hospital department of origin, person and department requiring the post-mortem examination, hour and time of autopsy, pathologist s name, and clinical diagnosis of death. Using a scanner, a copy of the autopsy application is also filed, together with the patient's medical <b>file</b> and any <b>diagnostic</b> images useful to document the case history. The second part of the information system is accessible by pathologists only, and contains the autopsy report. This part is organized to balance two different needs: it allows sufficient space and freedom for autopsy description while providing guidelines for presentation of the report. The structure of the conventional autopsy protocol has been maintained, with subdivisions for all the organs and apparatuses according to topographic criteria. Before this part, a section is dedicated to external cadaver examination and anthropometric data; weight, shape, volume and texture are described for each organ, together with external and cut-surface features. A third section allows the examiner to report other observations not requested previously, while a final section is also provided for the epicrisis and for the formulation of the final diagnosis, the same as that reported in the first form. The database is coupled with an interactive system for collecting voice comments, thereby replacing the need for tape-recorders in the autopsy room. The user can recall a dictation window, dictate a text, check spelling and insert additional text. The database is also coupled to an image acquisition system, on the assumption that moving images allow a more faithful documentation of reality. Therefore, all rooms in which autopsies are carried out on fetuses or neonates have been equipped with a fixed camera linked to a monitor and a video-recorder. A PCB, used for image digitalization, recognizes up to 16 000 000 different colors. Guided by dedicated software, image files are transferred to a computer and then saved with the autoptic report. The database can be consulted and queried in two principal ways: by key words in the contents or main disease descriptions, or by individual words or phrases contained within the complete text of the reports. The present database system for autopsy reporting has proved itself useful in a pathological anatomy service. The combined presence of images and texts renders the system useful also as a research tool. By linking to a Web site dedicated to pathologic anatomy, {{it will be possible to}} display online rare cases involving diagnostic difficulties. The system offers great advantages for present and retrospective diagnostics, as well as for research and education purposes...|$|R
40|$|Version 1. 0 ! This release {{has been}} a long time coming and brings with it some fairly major {{improvements}} in speed, report filesize and report performance. There's also a bunch of new modules, more options, features and a whole lot of bug fixes. The version number is being bumped up to 1. 0 for a couple of reasons: MultiQC is now (hopefully) relatively stable. A number of facilities and users are now using it in a production setting and it's published. It feels like it probably deserves v 1 status now somehow. This update brings some fairly major changes which will break backwards compatibility for plugins. As such, semantic versioning suggests a change in major version number. Breaking Changes For most people, you shouldn't have any problems upgrading. There are two scenarios where you may need to make changes with this update: 1. You have custom file search patterns Search patterns have been flattened and may no longer have arbitrary depth. For example, you may need to change the following: fastqc: data: fn: 'fastqc_data. txt' zip: fn: '*_fastqc. zip' to this: fastqc/data: fn: 'fastqc_data. txt' fastqc/zip: fn: '*_fastqc. zip' See the documentation for instructions on how to write the new file search syntax. See search_patterns. yaml for the new module search keys and more examples. 2. You have custom plugins / modules / external code To see what changes need to applied to your custom plugin code, please see the MultiQC docs. Module updates: Adapter Removal - new module! AdapterRemoval v 2 - rapid adapter trimming, identification, and read merging BUSCO - new module! New module for the BUSCO v 2 tool, used for assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness. Cluster Flow - new module! Cluster Flow is a workflow tool for bioinformatics pipelines. The new module parses executed tool commands. RNA-SeQC - new module! New module to parse output from RNA-SeQC, a java program which computes a series of quality control metrics for RNA-seq data. goleft indexcov - new module! Thanks to @chapmanb and @brentp goleft indexcov uses the PED and ROC data <b>files</b> to create <b>diagnostic</b> plots of coverage per sample, helping to identify sample gender and coverage issues. SortMeRNA - new module! Written by @bschiffthaler New module for SortMeRNA, commonly used for removing rRNA contamination from datasets. Bcftools Fixed bug with display of indels when only one sample Cutadapt Now takes the filename if the sample name is - (stdin). Thanks to @tdido FastQC Data for the Sequence content plot can now be downloaded from reports as a JSON file. FastQ Screen Rewritten plotting method for high sample numbers plot (~ > 20 samples) Now shows counts for single-species hits and bins all multi-species hits Allows plot to show proper percentage view for each sample, much easier to interpret. HTSeq Fix bug where header lines caused module to crash Picard New RrbsSummaryMetrics Submodule! New WgsMetrics Submodule! CollectGcBiasMetrics module now prints summary statistics to multiqc_data if found. Thanks to @ahvigil Preseq Now trims the x axis to the point that meets 90 % of min(unique molecules). Hopefully prevents ridiculous x axes without sacrificing too much useful information. Allows to show estimated depth of coverage instead of less informative molecule counts (see details). Plots dots with externally calculated real read counts (see details). Qualimap RNASeq Transcript Profile now has correct axis units. Thanks to @roryk BamQC module now doesn't crash if reports don't have genome gc distributions RSeQC Fixed Python 3 error in Junction Saturation code Fixed JS error for Junction Saturation that made the single-sample combined plot only show All Junctions Core MultiQC updates: Change in module structure and import statements (see details). Module file search has been rewritten (see above changes to configs) Significant improvement in search speed (test dataset runs in approximately half the time) More options for modules to find their logs, eg. filename and contents matching regexes (see the docs) Report plot data is now compressed, significantly reducing report filesizes. New [...] ignore-samples option to skip samples based on parsed sample name Alternative to filtering by input filename, which doesn't always work Also can use config vars sample_names_ignore (glob patterns) and sample_names_ignore_re (regex patterns). New [...] sample-names command line option to give file with alternative sample names Allows one-click batch renaming in reports New [...] cl_config option to supply MultiQC config YAML directly on the command line. New config option to change numeric multiplier in General Stats For example, if reports have few reads, can show Thousands of Reads instead of Millions of Reads Set config options read_count_multiplier, read_count_prefix and read_count_desc Config options decimalPoint_format and thousandsSep_format now apply to tables as well as plots By default, thosands will now be separated with a space and. used for decimal places. Tables now have a maximum-height by default and scroll within this. Speeds up report rendering in the web browser and makes report less stupidly long with lots of samples Button beneath table toggles full length if you want a zoomed-out view Refactored and removed previous code to make the table header "float" Set config. collapse_tables to False to disable table maximum-heights Bar graphs and heatmaps can now be zoomed in on Interactive plots sometimes hide labels due to lack of space. These can now be zoomed in on to see specific samples in more detail. Report plots now load sequentially instead of all at once Prevents the browser from locking up when large reports load Report plot and section HTML IDs are now sanitised and checked for duplicates New template available (called sections) which has faster loading Only shows results from one module at a time Makes big reports load in the browser much more quickly, but requires more clicking Try it out by specifying -t sections Module sections tidied and refactored New helper function self. add_section() Sections hidden in nav if no title (no more need for the hacky self. intro +=) Content broken into description, help and plot, with automatic formatting Empty module sections are now skipped in reports. No need to check if a plot function returns None! Changes should be backwards-compatible Report plot data export code refactored Now doesn't export hidden samples (uses HighCharts export-csv plugin) Handle error when git isn't installed on the system.
