40|$|Abstract:- New timing {{issues have}} been raised by Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), which implies new {{phenomena}} generating <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> compared to those well known in legacy networks based on the Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH). First, this paper reviews the bit and byte synchronization processes {{that take place in}} a SDH transmission chain: the mapping of PDH tributaries into SDH frames, the re-synchronization of Virtual Containers (VCs) in intermediate nodes, the demapping of PDH tributaries from SDH frames. Then, this paper reviews the main causes of <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> in a SDH transmission chain, by outlining the different phenomena that may affect the phase of the tributaries transported. First, the diurnal and annual wander due to variations of environmental conditions (temperature) is considered. Then, the <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> caused by inclusion of additional bits in the mapping of tributaries into STM frames, by bit justification and by pointer justification is addressed. Finally, real measurement results of phase hits caused by AU 4 pointer adjustments on a commercial SDH system are also provided, to provide experimental support to the general treatise. Key-Words:- digital communication, jitter, pointer, SDH, SONET, synchronization, wander. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} thesis presents {{results obtained}} from both numerical simulation and laboratory experimentation (both {{of which were}} {{carried out by the}} author). When data is propagated along an optical transmission line some timing irregularities can occur such as timing <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> phase <b>wander.</b> Traditionally these timing problems would have been corrected by converting the optical signal into the electrical domain and then compensating for the timing irregularity before converting the signal back into the optical domain. However, this thesis posses a potential solution to the problem by remaining completely in the optical domain, eliminating the need for electronics. This is desirable as not only does optical processing reduce the latency effect that their electronic counterpart have, it also holds the possibility of an increase in overall speed. A scheme was proposed which utilises the principle of wavelength conversion to dynamically convert timing irregularities (timing <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> phase <b>wander)</b> into a change in wavelength (this occurs on a bit-by-bit level <b>and</b> so timing <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> phase <b>wander</b> can be compensated for simultaneously). This was achieved by optically sampling a linearly chirped, locally generated clock source (the sampling function was achieved using a nonlinear optical loop mirror). The data, now with each bit or code word having a unique wavelength, is then propagated through a dispersion compensation module. The dispersion compensation effectively re-aligns the data in time and so thus, the timing irregularities are removed. The principle of operation was tested using computer simulation before being re-tested in a laboratory environment. A second stage was added to the device to create 3 R regeneration. The second stage is used to simply convert the timing suppressed data back into a single wavelength. By controlling the relative timing displacement between stage one and stage two, the wavelength that is finally produced can be controlled.

40|$|The {{short-term}} <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> longer-term <b>wander</b> of {{the frequency}} sweep profile of a Vernier-Tuned Distributed Bragg Reflector (VT-DBR) laser at 1550 nm used in optical coherence tomography (OCT) and other sensing applications is characterized in this work. The VT-DBR has demonstrated success in source-swept OCT (SSOCT), performing both intensity and phase-sensitive OCT. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate one of the unique aspects of the VT-DBR laser that makes it successful in OCT: the stability of the linear optical frequency sweep. A highly stable linear optical frequency sweep implies benefits for further fiber sensing applications including fiber Bragg grating and spectroscopy sensors. Short-term jitter measurements of the optical frequency sweep are taken using a 3 -cavity 100 GHz free spectral range solid etalon, an athermal fiber Bragg grating, a molecular-based gas absorption reference cell, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. These four optical filters are used to convert time fluctuations into intensity fluctuations that can be measured by high speed optical receivers. Short term jitter values on the order of 0. 5 – 0. 6 pm RMS (63 – 82 MHz RMS) are typical values in the VT-DBR lasers systems characterized in this work. This level of jitter is compelling for OCT and fiber-sensing applications. Longer-term wander is characterized using a multiple-gas absorption reference cell. The long term stability and temperature insensitivity of the absorption cell is ideal for long-term wander characterization of the laser frequency sweeps. Wander values on the order of 2. 6 pm of wavelength shift over an 8 hour time frame are reported in this work. The slope {{of the frequency}} versus time function of the laser sweep, on the order of 100 MHz/sample, is found to deviate by no more than 0. 03 % over the same 8 hour time frame. Both the long term wavelength shift and consistency of the slope indicate that these sources will perform well in OCT and fiber sensing applications. Mechanisms responsible for short-term <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> longer- term wavelength wander likely include contributions from the laser source itself and from the high speed electronic drive circuitry that creates the wavelength ramp. Investigation of ambient temperature’s influence on the wavelength wander is also highlighted in the work...|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{high-frequency}} jitter or low-frequency wander {{can create}} problems within synchronous transmission systems {{and must be}} kept within limits to ensure reliable network operation. The emerging Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) introduces additional challenges for <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> attenuation equipment (called desynchronizers) when used to carry payloads from the existing Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH), such as the DS 3. The difficulty is primarily due to the large phase transients resulting from the pointer-based justification technique employed by SONET (called Pointer Justification Events or PJEs). While some previous desynchronization techniques consider the buffer level in their control actions, none has explicitly considered wander generation. Instead, compliance with jitter, wander, and buffer-size constraints have typically been met implicitly [...] through testing and tuning of the Phase Locked Loop (PLL) controller. We investigated a fuzzy/rule-based solution to this desynchronization/constraint-satisfaction problem. But rather than mapping the input state to an action, as is done in standard fuzzy logic, our controller maps a state and a candidate action to a desired result. In other words, this control paradigm employs prediction to evaluate which {{of a set of}} candidate actions would result in the 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 predicted performance. Before the controller could predict an action 2 ̆ 7 s affect on buffer and wander levels, appropriate models were required. The model of the buffer is simply the integral of the frequency difference between the input and output of the PLL, and a novel MTIE Constraint Envelope technique was developed to evaluate future wander performance. We show that a predictive knowledge-based controller is capable of achieving the following three objectives: (1) Reduce jitter implicitly by avoiding unnecessary frequency changes such that the jitter limits specified in relevant standards are met, (2) Explicitly satisfy both buffer-level and wander (MTIE) constraints by trading off performance in one to meet the hard limit of the other, (3) When both buffer-level and wander constraints are in danger of violation and cannot be satisfied simultaneously, maintain the preferred constraint by sacrificing the other. We also show that the computation required for this control algorithm is easily within the reach of modern microprocessors...|$|E

40|$|Instrumental {{acoustic}} voice {{analysis is}} a widely used clinical assessment technique to assist differential diagnosis, documentation and evaluation of treatment for voice disorders. However recent reports criticise an unsatisfactory {{reliability and validity of}} acoustic assessments. The present work examines confounding factors associated with the usual clinical measurement procedure and how their influence might be reduced. Further, it was investigated what <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer indicate, and how this could be applied in voice clinics. In a routine clinical voice assessment the individuals` speaking voice SPL and F 0, gender and the vowel significantly influence both <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer. Differences in habitual voice SPL have by far the strongest influence, which may even underlie gender effects. It was shown for the first time, that clinical <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer measurements might be considerably improved when patients phonate at a predefined level of 85 dBA (10 cm distance) without control of F 0, and always use the vowel /a/. In healthy adults <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer were not associated with perceptual voice irregularity. However clinical measurements in a variety of voice tasks showed that <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer were always lower in higher voice intensities. Also in vocally healthy teachers increased voice SPL and F 0 after a working day were associated with lower <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer. Higher voice SPL is accompanied by increased vocal fold tone, which might result in more regular voice vibration patterns and thereby in lower <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer values. From a clinical perspective this would be highly relevant information, especially in patients with impaired vocal fold tone regulation such as in functional or neurogenic voice disorders. Future research should clarify sources of <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer and revise current normative values considering the proposed assessment protocol and gender. This might establish the clinical potential of instrumental acoustic voice analysis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>jitter,</b> shimmer, <b>and</b> noise acoustically {{characterize}} all voice signals, their perceptual {{importance in}} naturally produced pathological voices {{has not been}} established psychoacoustically. To determine the role of these attributes {{in the perception of}} vocal quality, listeners were asked to adjust levels of <b>jitter,</b> shimmer, <b>and</b> the noise-to-signal ratio in a speech synthesizer, so that synthetic voices matched naturally produced tokens. Results showed that, although listeners agreed well in their judgments of the noise-to-signal ratio, they did not agree with one another in their chosen settings for <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer. Noise-dependent differences in listeners' ability to detect changes in amounts of <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer implicate both listener insensitivity and inability to isolate <b>jitter</b> <b>and</b> shimmer as separate dimensions in the overall pattern of aperiodicity in a voice as causes of this poor agreement.
