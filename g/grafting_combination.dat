40|$|Physiological, biochemical, {{metabolite}} {{changes and}} {{gene expression analysis}} of greenhouse tomato (Solanum lycopersicumL.) were investigated in two grafting combinations (self-grafted ‘Ikram’ and ‘Ikram’ grafted onto interspecific hybrid rootstock ‘Maxifort’), with and without arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), exposed to 0 and 25 µM Cd. Tomato plants responded to moderate Cd concentration by decreasing yield and crop growth parameters due to the accumulation of Cd in leaf tissue, inhibition of the PS II activity, reduced nutrients translocation, and also to the oxidative stress as evidenced by enhanced hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) generation, ion leakage and lipid peroxidation. AM inoculation significantly enhanced the metal concentration in shoots and reduced growth and yield. The Ikram/Maxifort combination induced higher antioxidant enzymes, higher accumulation of proline and reduction of lipid peroxidation products. This suggests {{that the use of}} Maxifort rootstock in tomato has a high reactive oxygen species scavenging activity since lower H 2 O 2 concentrations were observed in the presence of Cd. The higher crop performance of Ikram/Maxifort in comparison to Ikram/Ikram combination was also due to the improved nutritional status (higher P, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn) and increased availability of metabolites involved in cadmium tolerance (phytochelatin PC 2 and fructans inulins).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{change of}} grape (Vitis vinifera) harvest from summer to winter through double pruning {{management}} has improved the fine wine quality in southern Brazil. High altitude, late cul-tivar and <b>grafting</b> <b>combination</b> {{all need to}} be investigated to optimize this new viticulture manage-ment. For this purpose, this study was carried out during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons in a high altitude region {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil, using eight grafting combinations for five year old Cabernet Sauvignon vines. The stem water potential, photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were not affected by rootstock type. The rootstocks IAC 766 and 101 - 14 induced, respectively, the highest and lowest vegetative vigor in Cabernet Sauvignon, as shown by leaf area and pruning weight. In the 2011 growing season, the leaf chlorophyll contents were increased in IAC 766, whereas vines grafted onto 101 - 14 accumulated more leaf starch, prob-ably due to reduced vegetative and reproductive growth. In general, rootstocks K 5 BB, 1045 P, SO 4 and IAC 766 had the highest yield as compared to 1103 P and 101 - 14. Berries from the grapevine with the highest yield did not differ in pH, total soluble solids and acidity. The root-stocks did not influence the anthocyanins and total phenols in both growing seasons. Quality parameters were better in the 2011 than in the 2012 growing season due to better climatic conditions, mainly less rainfall. The best performance of Cabernet Sauvignon was achieved when grafted onto K 5 BB, 1045 P, SO 4 and IAC 766 rootstocks...|$|E

40|$|Fruit {{tree species}} {{rootstock}} selection {{is a most}} important problem for fruit growing sector which is distinguished by {{relatively short period of}} life and premature perishing of many trees. Varieties affinity to different rootstocks determinates the rate of successful union between scion and rootstock and is the basis for the longevity of grafted trees. During grafting phenolic compounds from the cut surface cells oxidize and produce necrotic layer isolating the surfaces. Young xylem of which don’t specialize from the cambium, callus cells formed from the xylem medular ray and seconder shell cells destroy the necrotic layers on the cut surface. Then, the cavity between rootstock and scion is filled and re-establish the connection between them. After this stage, the transport of water and nutrients through the grafting area occurs. So, it is important for a successful grafting to know the anatomical development between tissue of scion and rootstock after grafting. This research was aimed to determine the anatomical structure of graft union in some <b>graft</b> <b>combinations</b> of plum using chip-budding grafting technique. The study was carriedout in USAMV Iasi experimental farm in 2008. In the study there were used four scion varieties and Prunus cerasifera as rootstock.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a posidonia-based compost as a soilless growing medium component for the cultivation of tomato. Beached residues of posidonia (20 % in weight) and green wastes were composted. The compost, alone (Compost 100 %) or mixed with perlite at the rate of 50 % in volume (Per-Comp 50 : 50), was used as growing medium and compared with traditional perlite (Perlite 100 %). Tomato plants (cv. ‘Ikram’ ungrafted, ‘Ikram’ grafted onto ‘Beaufort’ and ‘Ikram’ grafted onto ‘Arnold’) were grown in the three growing media. A complete nutrient solution (EC = 1. 7 dS/m; pH = 5. 0) was used for fertigation. A system composed by EC 5 soil moisture sensors, a data logger and a rely controller, and tensiometers to check water potential was used to manage fertigation, with the aim to maintain easily available water. Forty five days after transplanting, the plants grown in 100 % compost as well as in the compost/perlite mix resulted in higher growth. Leaf area, total fresh and dry weight increased with increasing amounts of compost in the substrate. The tomato yield in Compost 100 % and Per-Comp 50 : 50 treatments resulted higher than Perlite 100 %, in terms of weight and number of fruits (15 and 7 %, respectively).

40|$|The {{initiation}} {{and development}} of legume nodules induced by compatible Rhizobium species requires a complex signal exchange involving both plant and bacterial compounds. Phytohormones have been implicated in this process, although in many cases direct evidence is lacking. Here, we characterize the root and nodulation phenotypes of various mutant lines of pea (Pisum sativum) that display alterations in their phytohormone levels and/or perception. Mutants possessing root systems deficient in gibberellins (GAs) or brassinosteroids (BRs) exhibited a reduction in nodule organogenesis. The question of whether these reductions represent direct or indirect effects of the hormone deficiency is addressed. For example, the application of GA {{to the roots of}} a GA-deficient mutant completely restored its number of nodules to that of the wild type. Grafting studies revealed that a wild-type shoot or root also restored the nodule number of a GA-deficient mutant. These findings suggest that GAs are required for nodulation. In contrast, the shoot controlled the number of nodules that formed in <b>graft</b> <b>combinations</b> of a Bk-deficient mutant and its wild type. The root levels of auxin and GA were similar among these latter <b>graft</b> <b>combinations.</b> These results suggest that BRs influence a shoot mechanism that controls nodulation and that the root levels of auxin and GA are not part of this process.

Misting did not alter the relative effects of the different <b>graft</b> <b>combinations</b> on leaf area. WT scions had the greatest leaf area and lowest whole plant transpiration rate irrespective of the rootstock, implying that shoot ABA biosynthesis was sufficient to account for a WT shoot phenotype. In WT scions, the rootstock {{had no effect on}} detached leaf ethylene evolution or xylem concentrations of ABA or the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC). In flc scions, although the WT rootstock suppressed stomatal conductance of individual leaves, there was no detectable effect on whole plant transpiration rate.

WT rootstocks increased xylem ABA concentration in flc scions (relative to flc self-grafts) up to 3 -fold, and resulted in xylem ACC concentrations and detached leaf ethylene evolution similar to WT scions.

In <b>graft</b> <b>combinations</b> between cells of Acetabularia mediterranea (reed) and Acicularia Schenckii (acic) the expression of the reed phosphatase is dominant over acic phosphatasc. There is good evidence that in such grafts the preexisting acic phosphatase is converted on the molecular level via an intermediate form to the reed phosphatase. This conversion can be initiated by the transplantation of a med cell nucleus to an anucleate acic cell, but will also take place in grafts between anuclcate reed and anuclcate aeic cells, indicating that the direct participation of a cell nucleus is not required. An incomplete conversion of acic phosphatase, which terminates at the intermediate stage, is induced in acie cells by injection of a concentrated homogenatc of reed cytoplasm. A similar partial conversion occurs in vitro in a mixture of homogcnates from reed and acic cells. Subcellular particles, such as chloroplasts or mitochondria, can be removed from the homogenatcs by centrifugation without impairing the reactions leading to the intermediate phosphatase type. Experimental evidence suggests that the transformation of phosphatase types is enzymatically catalyzed and may involve the conjugation of small molecules with the phosphatasc protein. It was shown, however, that sialic acid is not involved, since the incubation of reed or acic homogenates with neuraminidase did not modify the electrophoretic mobility of either enzyme type.

Although grafting has a long history in research, only in the past decade has it been applied extensively to the Arabidopsis model. This chapter compares the main Arabidopsis grafting methods now available and describes seedling grafting in detail. Information is also provided on grafting of other common research model species, together with outlines of some successful applications...|$|R
40|$|Soil-born {{diseases}} often {{cause problems}} in vegetable forcing; {{this is because}} growers use greenhouses {{for the longest time}} possible. During the years several solutions have been found to displace chemical control. Grafting is a possible chemical free solution that shows several changes in plants thanks to the vigorous rootstock. In this study we examined the effect of grafting on the yield and fruit characteristics in tomato cultivar. Lemance F 1 was used as scion and Beaufort as rootstock. Earliness, total yield, fruit weight and number of each <b>graft</b> <b>combination</b> were recorded. Moreover, the main fruit components such as Brix°, carbohydrate, acid and the carbohydrate/acid ratio were analysed. We harvested more yield from the grafted plants. The increase of yield was mainly caused by higher average fruit weight. Brix ° and carbohydrate content were lower in the fruits on grafted plants than on ungrafted ones but {{there was no significant difference}} in acid content...|$|R
40|$|Crosses between {{common bean}} genotypes from {{different}} centres of origin {{can result in}} F 1 plants with dwarfing that is severe enough to prevent formation of F 2 seed. This hybrid dwarfness is controlled by two complementary genes, Dl- 1 and Dl- 2. The dominant alleles at both loci must be present to cause dwarfing, and an increased dose of either allele increases {{the severity of the}} dwarfing. Since dwarfing restricts crossing among gene pools, it holds interests for bean breeding and studies of bean evolution and physiology. Results of grafting studies are described which confirm the previously reported dependance of dwarfing on independent root and shoot effects, and further show that grafting may be used to characterize genotypes for presence of the Dl- 1 and Dl- 2 alleles and to produce normal shoots in plants which otherwise would have been dwarfed. In the first experiment, two carriers each of Dl- 1 and Dl- 2 and a non-carrier were grafted reciprocally; of the 25 combinations, only the four combinations of Dl- 2 -carrying shoots with Dl- 1 -carrying roots produced dwarfing. In a second experiment, 11 carriers of Dl- 1 and 9 of Dl- 2 were grafted to Dl- 1 roots and Dl- 2 shoots. Although most <b>graft</b> <b>combinations</b> where Dl- 1 roots were combined with Dl- 2 shoots resulted in dwarfed plants, 10 genotypes showed mixed responses or otherwise did not respond as expected. Further experiments confirmed the occurrence of materials giving mixed responses or showing dwarfing irrespective of the <b>graft</b> <b>combination.</b> While <b>grafting</b> has utility as a screening tool, results should be interpreted with caution. There remains a need to determine whether the unexplained results reflect effects of additional alleles or genes affecting the dwarfing response. Grafting was used successfully to obtain normal F 1 shoots, and ultimately, to produce F 2 seed after two cycles of backcrossing (BC 2) for four crosses which otherwise would have given dwarfed plants. Segregation of dwarfed and normal plants in progeny rows of F 2 plants derived from the BC 2 populations showed 1 : 3 ratios, this being consistent with the reported inheritance. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Grafting is {{regarded}} as a promising tool to broaden the temperature optimum of elite tomato cultivars. However, suitable low-temperature tolerant tomato rootstocks are not yet available and its breeding is hampered by a lack of variation in low-temperature tolerance within the cultivated tomato. In this study, therefore, the impact of grafting tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill. cv. Moneymaker, Sl) onto the rootstock of a cold-tolerant high-altitude accession of a related wild species (Solanum habrochaites LA 1777 Humb. & Bonpl., Sh) was examined at different combinations of optimal (25 degrees C) and/or suboptimal (15 degrees C) air/root-zone temperatures (RZT), i. e. 25 / 25, 25 / 15, 15 / 25 and 15 / 15 degrees C. Self-grafted tomato plants were used as controls. Both scion/rootstock combinations, Sl/Sl and Sl/Sh, were grown hydroponically and compared for biomass production and partitioning, plant morphology, carbohydrate partitioning and leaf C and N status. Grafting tomato onto Sh increased the relative growth rate of shoots with 26 and 11 % at 25 / 15 and 15 / 15 degrees C, respectively. This increase could be attributed to stimulation of the leaf expansion rate. <b>Graft</b> <b>combinations</b> with Sh rootstocks were characterized by higher root mass ratios, particularly at 15 degrees C RZT. Suboptimal RZT strongly reduced the relative growth rate of Sl roots but not of Sh. This was correlated to differences in inhibition of root elongation. In contrast to tomato grafted onto Sh, leaf total C and total N concentrations increased in self-grafted tomato plants in response to 15 degrees C RZT. The increase in leaf total C concentration of Sl/Sl <b>graft</b> <b>combinations</b> at 15 degrees C RZT could be ascribed largely to starch accumulation. This study illustrates that growth of vegetative tomato plants at suboptimal temperature is for a significant part inhibited by its poor root development. Grafting tomato onto a low-temperature rootstock provides an alternative tool to reduce, in part, the grow-limiting effects of suboptimal RZ temperature on the shoot. To improve the low-temperature tolerance of existing commercial tomato rootstocks, S. habrochaites LA 1777 appeared to be a valuable germplasm pool. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Graft {{incompatibility}} is {{a phenomenon}} associated with complex physiological, biochemical, and genetic interactions between scion and rootstock. The main objective of this work {{was to assess the}} role of cyanogenic glycosides (CGs), amygdalin and prunasin, in the graft incompatibility of Prunus and possible biochemical effects in compounds of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Graft compatibility, amygdalin and prunasin content, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, total phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity, were studied in different <b>graft</b> <b>combinations</b> (Chimarrita/Capdeboscq; Chimarrita/Tsukuba 1; Chimarrita/Umezeiro; Maciel/Capdeboscq; Maciel/’Tsukuba 1; Maciel/Umezeiro) and ungrafted genotypes. The results indicate that there was graft incompatibility of Chimarrita and Maciel cultivars grafted into Umezeiro rootstock. Combinations identified as incompatible showed higher prunasin concentration and phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL) activity in rootstock and greater concentration of total phenolics compounds and antioxidant activity in scion and rootstock. The results indicate that large differences in CGs concentration, especially prunasin, can be the graft incompatibility cause between Prunus persic. and P. mume. The prunasin concentration may be considered a promising marker to predict graft compatibility between P. persica and P. mume...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} particulate can-cellous bone impaction <b>grafting</b> in <b>combination</b> with total hip arthroplasty (THA) for acetabular reconstruction in patients with posttraumatic arthritis and bone loss after acetabular fractures. MethodsTotally 15 consecutive cases with unilateral acetabular fracture were treated with bone impaction <b>grafting</b> in <b>combination</b> with THA in our department. There were 10 males and 5 females with mean age of 48. 2 years (ranging from 36 to 73 years). Eight cases had the fracture at left hips, 7 at right hips. The average age at injury was 28 years (ranging from 18 to 68 years). The mean follow-up period was 4. 3 years (ranging from 2 to 7 years). ResultsCompared with mean 42 points (ranging from 10 to 62) of the preoperative Harris score, the survival cases at the final follow-up had mean 84 points (ranging from 58 to 98). One patient had mild pain in the hip. No revision of the acetabular or femoral component was undertaken during the follow-up. Normal rotational centre of most hips was recovered except 2 cases {{in which it was}} 0. 8 mm higher than that in opposite side. All of them had a stable radiographic appearance. Progressive radiolucent lines were observed in I, III zones in 2 cases. One patient had a nonprogressive radiolucent line in zone III. The cup prosthesis was obvi-ously displaced (6 mm) in one patient, but had not been revised. ConclusionParticulate cancellous bone impaction <b>grafting</b> in <b>combination</b> with THA as a biological solution is an attractive procedure for acetabular reconstruction in patients with posttraumatic arthritis and bone loss after acetabular fracture, which can not only restore acetabular bone stock but also repair normal hip anatomy and its function...|$|R
