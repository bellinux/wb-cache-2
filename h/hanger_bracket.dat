50|$|While bolts {{are commonplace}} in rock and gym {{climbing}} {{there is no}} universal vocabulary to describe them. Generally, a bolt hanger or a fixed hanger {{is a combination of}} a fixed bolt and a specialized stainless steel hanger designed to accept a carabiner, whereas in certain regions a bolt runner or a carrot describes a hangerless bolt (where the climber must provide their own <b>hanger</b> <b>bracket</b> and sometimes lock nut). A ring bolt has a loop on one end so it presents as a U-shape embedded in the wall.|$|E

This paper mainly {{presents}} {{those aspects}} about electrically driven hunting cart design as follows: the main structure design including {{the designs of}} the cart frame, the <b>hanger</b> <b>bracket</b> and the axle; the overall modeling design including the designs of the shaping and the color; the virtual design including the major methods and steps {{of it and the}} content of electrically drive hunting cart design as well...|$|E

This is {{an analysis}} of the stress distribution in the side members of commercial vehicle chassis frames under the effects of the previously little studied longitudinal loads which may act on a truck chassis through spring hanger brackets. The structure analysed is a model chassis frame consisting of channel section side members and four cross members with different joint connections. The developed theories are incorporated into a special purpose finite element program which may be used in the preliminary stages of chassis frame design. Although the program is only used for the longitudinal load case in this thesis, it is generally applicable for other chassis load cases, including torsion, bending,. [...] etc and combination of these. The theoretical results obtained from the program and the finite element analysis on complete chassis frame models are validated against experiments performed on a strain-gauged chassis frame model constructed with the same dimensions and constructional details as the finite element models with the appropriate loading and boundary conditions. Suggestions for the optimum design and attachment positions for components such as spring <b>hanger</b> <b>bracket</b> which may apply longitudinal loads to the side members of the chassis frame are discussed {{from the point of view}} of longitudinal loadings...|$|E

50|$|The 2003 SV650s also {{supported}} some first generation parts (like the rearsets and radiator). The subframe is also angled up higher than 2004+ models. The different subframe has year-specific parts, {{such as the}} rider seat, plastic frame covers, exhaust <b>hanger</b> <b>brackets</b> and passenger pegs.|$|R

50|$|With {{the help}} of the supplier, a special high tensile steel alloy was {{developed}} to lighten the frame. Tubular and channel section cross members were bolted to the frame side-members. Spring <b>hanger</b> <b>brackets</b> were also bolted to the frame, utilizing the cross members where possible. Cummins and Perkins diesel engines were used.|$|R
50|$|The {{consortium}} {{has made}} arrangements with the National Railway Museum for {{the supply of}} surviving British Railways drawings to members. From time to time, members recreate 'lost' drawings by reverse-engineering from existing components. Many of those lost drawings are for LMS designed components that were adopted without alteration. Examples being certain Brake <b>Hanger</b> <b>Brackets</b> and Flexible Stretcher Brackets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frame of}} the ICF bogie is a {{fabricated}} structure made up of mild steel. Main sub-assemblies of bogie frame viz. side frames, transoms, headstocks, longitudinal forms the skeleton of the bogie frame. The sub assemblies are fabricated from flanges, webs, channels and Ribs by welding process. Various types of brackets are welded to the frame {{for the purpose of}} primary and secondary suspension arrangement, alternator suspension arrangement and brake rigging arrangement. Various <b>brackets</b> viz. brake <b>hanger</b> <b>brackets,</b> brake lever <b>hanger</b> <b>brackets,</b> brake cylinder fixing brackets, anchor link brackets, bolster spring suspension brackets, alternator suspension brackets, belt tensioning bracket/s, axle box guides, suspension straps are welded on the bogie frames. It involves 40 meters (app.) of welding in a single conventional bogie frame. Based on load carrying capacity per axle, the conventional bogie frames are grouped into two types. They are 13 ton bogie frame and 16 ton bogie frame. 13 ton bogie frames are being used in the bogies of all non-AC mainline coaches and 16 ton bogie frames are being used in bogies of all AC coaches, power cars and diesel multiple unit trailer coaches. EMU Motor Coach type bogie frames, a different design of bogie frame is being used in all coaches of Electric Multiple Units (EMU) and all self-propelled coaches (motor coaches ...|$|R
50|$|Up-N-Away was {{the name}} of a down-sliding bath/shower door {{manufactured}} by Unitspan Architectural Systems, Inc. The bathtub shower doors had vertical tracks instead of horizontal, and closed downward rather than sideways. There were no channel tracks {{on the side of the}} bathtub; this enabled the entire side to be free when the doors were open. This design was also to make the side of the tub always clean as well as comfortable to sit on when bathing a child. The down-sliding doors were counterbalanced to be kept up and out of the way for an elegant look, but slid to lower positions for showering. Within the vertical track channels, the lower left and right edge of each sliding door attached to counterweighted ropes with nylon <b>hanger</b> <b>brackets.</b> The downward-closing bath shower doors aimed to solve the disadvantages of conventional, sideways-sliding doors to provide more convenience, relaxation and luxury. They were at first marketed on a store- or factory-to-consumer basis, with do-it-yourself installation required.|$|R

2500|$|American {{practice}} {{for many years}} was to use built-up bar frames, with the smokebox saddle/cylinder structure and drag beam integrated therein. In the 1920s, {{with the introduction of}} [...] "superpower", the cast-steel locomotive bed became the norm, incorporating frames, spring <b>hangers,</b> motion <b>brackets,</b> smokebox saddle and cylinder blocks into a single complex, sturdy but heavy casting. André Chapelon developed a similar structure, welded instead of cast, causing a 30% saving in weight for the 2-10-4 locomotives, the construction of which was begun then abandoned in 1946.|$|R
