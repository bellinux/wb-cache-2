The exterior was dilapidated and covered in a black coating.The architect Eugène Millet, a pupil of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, was given the job of restoring the château to hold the planned National Museum of Antiquities in 1855 and was told to remove all traces of the cells that the Ministry of War had installed when it {{was used as a}} prison. In 1857 he reported that all the partitions forming the cells and dungeons had been demolished {{and the rest of the}} chateau had been cleaned.Construction work began in 1862 with the destruction of the West pavilion. Millet's goal was to restore the building to its state as it was under Francis I of France.Eugène Millet died in Cannes on 24 February 1879.The restoration was continued by Auguste Lafollye and Honoré Daumet, and finally completed in 1907.|$|E
50|$|Yordas Cave is a solutional cave {{formed in}} Lower Carboniferous limestone. Yordas Beck {{normally}} sinks {{at the top}} of the gorge, and reappears from a passage near the top of Yordas Pot. From the base of the shaft it follows the passage down to the Chapter House waterfall, before disappearing in confined passages at the end of the Main Chamber. In flood conditions a lake can rise in the Main Chamber up to 2 m deep, before the water is able to flow out of the show cave entrance. The underground stream next appears in Kingsdale Master Cave, and it resurges at Keld Head 2.7 km down the valley. The Main Chamber is several hundred thousand years old, and was formed by solution under phreatic conditions before the Kingsdale valley had formed and allowed it to drain. The square profile of the chamber has resulted from rock collapses from joints. A number of different <b>false</b> <b>floors</b> which may still be seen clinging to the walls indicate that the cave was subject to cycles of deposition and re-excavation during the recent ice ages.|$|E

Dangerous spikes, <b>false</b> <b>floors</b> and ancient booby traps test the archaeologist's skills before he attempts to make a getaway with the golden idol. The stunt show then moves on to the busy and audience-participant filled streets of Cairo. Indy and Marion watch street acrobats before events take a turn for the worse and a massive fight scene breaks out. The Cairo street scene concludes with Indy shooting at a Jeep loaded with explosives, producing a fiery conclusion. The final scene of the stunt show recreates the action-packed sequence in which Indy and Marion try to stop the Nazis from flying the Ark to Berlin; the reenactment is complete with a scaled-down version of a German Luftwaffe aircraft with symbols imitating the swastika (actual swastikas were used in the show up until the 2000s). Indy fights a large German mechanic while Marion mans the aircraft's machine gun, blowing away everything in sight.

40|$|Excessive floor {{vibration}} due {{to human}} activities is of growing concern {{due to the}} increase in use of lighter and high-strength materials for long span floors. This problem is exacerbated in office buildings due to the reduction in inherent damping associated with modern fit outs. Excessive floor vibratiom are often realised after the completion of construction or following a change of use of the floor. The main cause of uncertainty in design or vibration assessment of floors is damping. There are few optiom for rectifying floor with excessive vibrations. These include increasing stiffoess, which is often not practical or increasing damping. This paper presents an innovative passive viscoelastic damper to reduce floor vibratiom. This damper can be easily tuned to the fundamental frequency of the floor and can be designed to achieve various damping values. The damper can be sufficiently small to fit within ceiling cavities or under <b>false</b> <b>floors...</b>|$|E
40|$|Preliminary to an {{investigation}} of the water balance of tsetse flies some experiments were carried out to determine the effect of humidity on general activity. Observa-tions previously made on this aspect of behaviour (Jack, 1939; Mellanby, 1936) have been too cursory to admit of general conclusions.

40|$|Pre-programmed {{mechanisms}} of motor control {{are known to}} influence the gain of artificially evoked stretch reflexes. However, their interaction with stretch reflexes evoked {{in the context of}} unimpeded natural movement is not understood. We used a landing movement, for which a stretch reflex {{is an integral part of}} the natural action, to test the hypothesis that unpredicted motor events increase stretch reflex gain. The unpredicted event occurred when a <b>false</b> <b>floor,</b> perceived to be solid, collapsed easily on impact, allowing the subjects to descend for a further 85 ms to a solid floor below. Spinal stretch reflexes were measured following solid floor contact. When subjects passed through the <b>false</b> <b>floor</b> en route to the solid floor, the amplitude of the EMG reflex activity was double that found in direct falls. This was not due to differences in joint rotations between these conditions. Descending pathways can modify H- and stretch-reflex gain in man. We therefore manipulated the time between the <b>false</b> and real <b>floor</b> contacts and hence the time available for transmission along these pathways. With 30 ms between floors, the enhancement of the reflex was extinguished, whereas with 50 ms between floors it reappeared. This excluded several mechanisms from being responsible for the doubling of the reflex EMG amplitude. It is argued that the enhanced response is due to the modulation of reflex gain at the spinal level by signals in descending pathways triggered by the false platform. The results suggest the future hypothesis that this trigger could be the absence of afferent signals expected at the time of <b>false</b> <b>floor</b> impact and that salient error signals produced from a comparison of expected and actual sensory events may be used to reset reflex gains...|$|R

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{vibrations}} {{can occur in}} floor systems due to excitation from human activities such as walking and aerobics. In building floors, excessive vibrations are generally not a safety concern for building floor systems but a cause of annoyance and discomfort. Excessive vibrations typically occur in: (a) light weight floors; (b) floor systems with low stiffness where the floor dominant natural frequency {{is close to the}} excitation frequency; and (c) floors with low damping. While the floor mass and stiffness are normally constant during the life of the structure and can be estimated {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, damping is more difficult to predict because it is mostly associated with non-structural components such as partitions, <b>false</b> <b>floors,</b> suspended ceilings and ducts as well as furniture such as filing cabinets and bookshelfs. Current trends in the building industry associated with using lightweight materials, long-span open-plan floors and adoption of the electronic office, give rise to the importance of understanding floor vibrations and specifically damping. This paper provides a summary of factors affecting floor vibrations and discusses available damping systems which can be used to reduce vibration levels in floor systems...|$|E
40|$|Prestressing and {{the advent}} of high {{strength}} materials enable the construction of more slender floor slabs with lower values of natural frequency and damping. Under certain circumstances, the vibrations due to forcing frequencies of normal human activities can be annoying to the occupants. Since the occupants are both the source and the sensor, the vibration cannot be isolated and must be controlled by the structural system. At present, there is a limited knowledge about the overall dynamic characteristics of such concrete slabs, including contributions from individual structural and non-structural components. An extensive programme of modal testing on a slender one-way spanning 50 % scaled post-tensioned concrete slab is described. Testing was performed using electromagnetic shaker, instrumented hammer, heeldrop, and walking excitations, to determine full floor dynamic characteristics. The tests investigated the effect on vibration performance of the level of prestress, and of various non-structural additions, including vibration absorbers and effect of occupants. It was found that an increase in prestressing force increases natural frequency and decreases damping due to closing up of microcracks. A model is presented to reflect these changes in terms of effective second moment of area. Cantilever partition tests showed energy to dissipate by swaying, and full-height partitions were seen to act as line supports leading to a significant stiffening of the slab. Analytical models are derived for both forms of partitions. Tests with <b>false</b> <b>floors</b> showed a significantly higher increase in slab damping when the floor panels rested on the pedestals, as opposed to being rigidly fixed to them. Although the addition of viscoelastic screed layers were not seen to have great effect in damping, an analytical model is derived which shows the advantages of using such layers. A TMD system was designed and installed on the floor, using plywood sheets, which led to a reduction in vibration response by as much as 80 %. A theoretical model is derived to represent the TMD results and a design criterion is suggested. Finally, the effect of human-structure interaction is investigated. An analytical model shows the natural frequency of the body to be 10. 43 Hz with a damping of 50 %. Results are also reported of tests on a full-scale field slab, confirming some of the findings of the model slab experiments. Broadly, the results show that contrary to popular belief, merely the presence of non-structural components does not necessarily enhance the dynamic behaviour of the system. The design of these components and nature of their installation are important factors affecting their contribution to the overall floor vibrational behaviour...|$|E
