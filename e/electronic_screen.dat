5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an <b>electronic</b> <b>screen</b> they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an <b>electronic</b> <b>screen</b> rather than through light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an <b>electronic</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
5|$|OXO or Noughts and Crosses is a {{video game}} {{developed}} by A S Douglas in 1952 for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of noughts and crosses. It {{was one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. Douglas programmed the game as part of a thesis on human-computer interaction for the University of Cambridge. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and had three small cathode ray tube screens to display the state of the memory; Douglas re-purposed one screen to demonstrate portraying other information to the user, such as the state of a noughts and crosses game. After the game served its purpose, it was discarded on the original hardware but later successfully reconstructed. OXO, along with a draughts game by Christopher Strachey completed around the same time, is one of the earliest known games to display visuals on an <b>electronic</b> <b>screen.</b> Under some definitions, it thus may qualify as the first video game, though other definitions exclude it due to its lack of moving or real-time updating graphics.|$|E
40|$|SummaryParticipant {{recruitment}} is {{an important}} process in successful conduct of randomized controlled trials. To facilitate enrollment into a National Institutes of Health–sponsored clinical trial involving patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), we developed and prospectively validated an automated <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> tool based on boolean free-text search of admission notes in electronic medical records. During a 2 -week validation period, all patients admitted to prespecified general medical services were screened for eligibility by both the <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> tool and a COPD nurse. Group discussion was the gold standard for confirmation of true-positive results. Compared with the gold standard, <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> yielded 100 % sensitivity, 92 % specificity, 100 % negative predictive value, and 72 % positive predictive value. Compared with traditional manual <b>screening,</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> demonstrated time-saving potential of 76 %. Thus, the <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> tool accurately identifies potential study subjects and improves efficiency of patient accrual for a clinical trial on COPD. This method may be expanded into other institutional and clinical settings...|$|R

5|$|Tennis for Two is {{considered}} under some definitions {{to be the}} first video game. Other candidates with stronger candidacies from a technological standpoint include the 1947 cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, though it did not run on a computing device; the 1950 Bertie the Brain, the earliest known game to run on a computer, though it used light bulbs for a display; and OXO and a draughts game by Christopher Strachey in 1952, the earliest digital computer games to display visuals on an <b>electronic</b> <b>screen.</b> Tennis for Two, though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games, has the distinction of being the earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes. Prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate the computing power of the underlying machine, {{with the exception of the}} non-computer based cathode-ray tube amusement device. This, therefore, makes Tennis for Two the first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in the early history of video games.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} weigh {{stations}} {{are unable to}} keep pace with current truck traffic levels. In response, state enforcement agencies are compelled to seek capacity enhancements for the weigh stations. One response is to increase physical capacity by adding a ramp weigh-in-motion (WIM) scale, a sorter and a bypass lane. <b>Electronic</b> <b>screening,</b> on the other hand, is a feasible option for increasing capacity without expanding physical infrastructure of the weigh station. This study compares the impact of these two alternatives in terms of travel time savings and enhanced productivity for a selected high traffic weigh station using a simulation model. The results indicate that physical expansion could improve a weigh station efficiency to some extent in a shorter amount of time than <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> programs. <b>Electronic</b> <b>screening,</b> how-ever, eliminates a weigh station inefficiencies gradually but permanently when the number of transponder-equipped trucks increase significantly...|$|R

500|$|Bertie {{was created}} {{only three years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and while non-visual games had been developed for research computers such as Alan Turing and Dietrich Prinz's chess program for the Ferranti Mark 1 at the University of Manchester, Bertie was the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. Bertie is considered under some definitions in contention for the title of the first video game. [...] While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while Bertie did not feature an <b>electronic</b> <b>screen</b> it did run on a computer. Another special-purpose computer-based game, Nimrod, was built in 1951, while the software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were in 1952 the first computer games to display visuals on an <b>electronic</b> <b>screen</b> rather than light bulbs.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{abundance}} of studies addressing the impact of Electronic Health Records on patient care and billing, little data exists surrounding the specific impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> tools. Additionally, developmental and behavioral screening has been chronically overlooked and {{is an area of}} active concern for improvement of patient care nationwide. STUDY AIM: To determine if an <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> tool improves the percentage of pediatric patients who receive routine mandatory screening tests for identification of possible developmental and behavioral conditions. METHODS: This is a retrospective, longitudinal study using billing data from the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M. D. School of Medicine Pediatric Clinic to analyze clinician compliance with routine developmental and behavioral screening tests required at particular ages for well child exams. The data retrieved consisted of three billing codes connected to routine screening tests (ASQ, MCHAT, Edinburgh, PSC- 17) between the years of 2013 to 2017. Using this data, we calculated the proportion of patients who received appropriate screening tests at the required age of administration. RESULTS: This study is on-going while the <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> tool is being implemented in the clinic. Preliminary results will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention and treatment of developmental and behavioral conditions in children is key to improving outcomes. Thus, early identification of such conditions is paramount, and this is often done by administering developmental and behavioral screening tests. This study will show whether or not <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> tools prove helpful in ensuring that developmental screeners are administered, thus improving early identification of developmental and behavioral conditions in children...|$|R

500|$|Douglas {{used the}} EDSAC to {{simulate}} {{a game of}} noughts and crosses, also called tic-tac-toe, and display {{the state of the}} game on the screen. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Douglas did not give the game a name beyond [...] "noughts and crosses"; the name OXO first appeared as the name of the simulation file created by computer historian Martin Campbell-Kelly while creating a simulation of the EDSAC several decades later. Around the same time that OXO was completed, Christopher Strachey expanded a draughts program he had originally written in 1951 and ported it to the Ferranti Mark 1, which showed the state of the game on a CRT display. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an <b>electronic</b> <b>screen,</b> though it is unclear which of the two games was displayed first. As it ran on a computing device and used a graphical display, OXO is considered under some definitions to be a contender for the first video game, though under others it does not due to its lack of moving graphics or graphics which update continuously.|$|E

40|$|Screening {{for nuclear}} {{reactions}} in metal {{plays an important}} role in enhancing reaction cross sections in the ultra-low energy region. A simple extrapolation of the screening potential down to the thermal energy region from the keV beam experiment predicts the occurrence of “cold fusion ” D+D reactions. In the present work, results so far obtained in low-energy beam experiments will be overviewed and the origin of the screening potential will be discussed: both <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> and ionic screening. For ionic screening we have studied nuclear reactions in liquid metal which can be regarded as a low-temperature dense plasma. In such a condition, the classical ions contribute to the screening more strongly than the quantum electrons do. Results on the 7 Li+p and 6 Li+d reactions with liquid Li target will be shown. The effects of the solid-liquid phase transition are clearly seen in these reactions. It can be concluded that the ionic Debye screening is much stronger than the <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> in low-temperature dense plasmas. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an economic analysis on the application of three principal ITS/CVO technologies to the mid continent corridor: <b>electronic</b> credentialing, <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> and <b>electronic</b> border crossings. The mid-continent corridor is defined as Interstate Highway 35 (I- 35) from Duluth, Minnesota to Laredo, Texas. The analysis corridor includes the international border crossing at the Laredo. Current baseline data for weigh station, permitting, credentialing, and international border crossing activities were collected for the corridor states. Additional data were collected on accidents and overweight citations in the vicinity of weigh stations for the Iowa segment of the corridor. A methodology was developed to identify and estimate the potential benefits and costs relating to the implementation of <b>electronic</b> credentialing, <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> and <b>electronic</b> border crossing technologies in the corridor states. Benefits and costs were estimated on a corridor wide basis for a ten year analysis period. Total benefits of electronic credentialing ranged from $ 25 to $ 50 million and total costs were estimated at $ 19 to $ 38 million. Benefits from the implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>screening</b> were estimated at $ 49 to $ 59 million, while costs were estimated at $ 7 to $ 23 million. Benefits at the international border were significantly higher at $ 721 to $ 1, 373 million while costs were estimated at $ 1. 9 to 8. 5 million. The analysis indicates that the corridor states and the motor carriers that operate in them may benefit from the implementation of the ITS/CVO technologies.
