The system may be regarded as a society of agents where in principle anyone can sexually interact with any other one in the population. Different social behaviors are reflected in a distribution of sexual attitudes ranging from the more conservative to the more promiscuous. This is measured by what we call the promiscuity parameter. In terms of this parameter, we find a critical behavior for the evolution of the disease. There is a threshold below what the epidemic does not occur. We relate this critical value of the promiscuity to what epidemiologist call the basic reproductive number, connecting it with the other parameters of the model, namely the infectivity and the <b>infective</b> <b>period</b> in a quantitative way.

The pattern of contacts between hosts is described by a class of dyadic independence exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs), whereas the transmission process that runs over the network is modeled as a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) epidemic. We fit these models to very detailed data from the 1861 measles outbreak in Hagelloch, Germany.

40|$|African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is a vector-borne {{viral disease}} that affects both {{domestic}} and wild pigs. The primary natural hosts of ASFV is the warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), while the primary vector is the soft tick (Ornithodoros porcinus porcinus) [2, 3]. A warthog recovers from infec-tion within two to three weeks, acquiring a lifelong immunity thereafter. Hence, the infective warthogs are typically the neonatals. Due to the short <b>infective</b> <b>period</b> of the warthogs, the virus persists mainly in the tick popu-lation. Warthogs inhabit burrows that are often infested with ticks during farrowing season. If the tick population is infected, the virus levels are am-plified {{by the presence of}} the neonatals in the burrow. We propose a model consisting of two sets of PDE’s: the first for the tick population (suscepti-ble and infective) and the second for the warthog population (susceptible, infective, recovered). In order to capture the epidemiological dynamics cor-rectly, the tick population is age-structured, while the warthog population is epidemiological state-structured.

Plants of cucumber, tomato, sweet pepper, lupin, anthurium, Cucurbita ficifolia, C. maxima and two lines from crosses between C. maxima and C. moschata were grown in thick root disease (TRD) -infested nutrient solutions containing the TRD agent. Plants from each species or line, except anthurium, developed TRD symptoms. Growth of diseased plants, except those of the line C. maxima ×C. moschata RS 841, was significantly reduced compared with the nondiseased controls. Two weeks after infestation, by adding TRD-affected nutrient solution to fresh nutrient solution, the presence of the infective TRD agent was shown in each of the nutrient solutions in which the plants had been grown, including anthurium. No infective TRD agent could be shown in nutrient solution that had not been in contact with roots of living plants. The minimum pH for thick root formation was shown to be between 5 · 0 and 5 · 5.

40|$|Background. On July 7, 2014 Florida Department of Health Palm Beach County {{received}} {{a report of}} a patient that had symptoms consistent with chikungunya fever but denied history of travel outside the USA. On July 17, 2014 the CDC declared this {{as one of the}} first chikungunya virus disease cases acquired in the continental United States. Methods. Cases were identified through active and passive surveillance. A field investigation was conducted. All homes within 100 meters of the autochthonous case-patient were visited, residents were interviewed, symptomatic or asymptomatic persons were identified. Risk factors were evaluated; blood samples were obtained from willing participants. An environmental assessment was conducted. Results. By October 4, 2014, through active surveillance four autochthonous cases with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection were identified in Palm Beach County, FL. 78 households were visited. No additional symptomatic or asymptomatic persons were identified. A total of eight asymptomatic individuals associated with the first case were tested and none were positive for CHIKV. The field teams identified mosquito-breeding sites on all of the interviewed properties and drained and covered the stagnant water. None of the potential breeding sites contained larvae currently. No CHIKV infections were found to be associated to any of the autochthonous cases. Conclusions. There was no clear epidemiological link established through geo-spatial relationships during incubation and <b>infective</b> <b>periods</b> among imported and/or autochthonous case-patients. Isolation of case-patients during the viremic phase likely diminished transmission risk among household members and local community members. Public Health Implication.

B. burgdorferi, the causative agent of this disease, circulates among wildlife vertebrate hosts and Ixodes tick vectors but may sometimes infect humans. Its natural enzootic cycle usually occurs as follows: The larval/nymphal stage tick feeds on an infected host. During this engorgement, the spirochetes reach the tick gut and stay confined to it. After the tick molts into the next developmental stage, it finds a second host. The new bloodmeal triggers the spirochetes to multiply within the gut and traverse the gut endothelium in a highly organized manner.

Of a total of 1, 400 frogs examined over 60 months (5 years), 38 % were found to be infected with G. vitellinophilum, and the intensity of infection was 1 - 15 trematodes per frog.

40|$|Herd history. A {{cluster of}} 19 abortions {{occurred}} in April and May 1994 on a seasonal dairy farm of 277 cows in Taranaki. Lesions consistent with neosporosis {{were seen in}} several foetuses. The age of the aborting cows ranged from 2 to 12 years. Pregnant rising 2 -year-old heifers had been grazed off the main farm on a "run-off" until returning in May, when they were replaced on the "run-off" by the rising 1 -year-old calves. None of these pregnant heifers aborted. Methods. Sera were obtained from all calves (n = 32), 32 of 33 pregnant heifers, 59 of 60 3 - 4 year-old cows and 101 of 150 older cows, plus all cows that had aborted. Sera were tested using an indirect fluorescent antibody assay. Non-aborting cattle sera were screened at 1 : 400, and further dilutions were tested from 15 aborted cows. Results. The percentages of seropositive cattle were: 32 % of the calves, 3 % of the heifers, 31 % of the younger cows and 27 % of the older cows. The proportion of seropositive heifers was significantly lower (p 0. 05). Of the 15 cows that aborted, and for which further dilutions were tested, nine had titres of 1 : 12 800, four had titres of 1 : 6400, one had a titre of 1 : 1600 and one had a titre of 1 : 400. Twenty cows were the dams of pregnant heifers. Six of these cows were seropositive but all their offspring were seronegative. Fifteen aborting cows were held over to the following year when 13 became pregnant and calved normally. There were only two to three abortions in the whole herd in this following year. Conclusion. These results suggest that either a point-infection occurred sometime in early 1994 with an <b>infective</b> <b>period</b> short enough so that the heifers did not get infected {{when they returned to}} the main farm, or some factor precipitated a recrudescence of latent infection with a subsequent rise in titres in about 29 % of the animals on the mam farm only.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The {{effects of}} soil moisture, mineral {{nutrition}} and temperature on the susceptibility of peas to inoculation with bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) by the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulz.) were investigated {{along with three}} vector-virus relationships. In addition, a comparative study was made of two methods of evaluating susceptibility of slants to inoculation with virus by aphids. A more accurate method of estimating plant susceptibility to inoculation with virus by aphids is proposed. With this method, the aphid is allowed to probe only once on a test plant rather than spending; its entire <b>infective</b> feeding <b>period</b> on the plant. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the susceptibility of plants grown in very moist soil and the susceptibility of plants grown in very dry soil even though the plants in the dry soil were strikingly dwarfed. Additions of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to the soil at the time of planting had no effect on the susceptibility of Lincoln and Perfected Wales peas to inoculation with BYMV by aphids even though these treatments resulted in large increases in the amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil and plants. The addition of calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese and zinc chelates to the soil had no effect on the susceptibility of Lincoln peas to inoculation with BYMV by aphids. There was an increase in susceptibility of Lincoln peas to inoculation with BYMV by aphids with decrease in preinoculation temperature over a range of 15 ° to 36 ° C. Regression analysis indicated the increase was linear and amounted to approximately a six percent increase in susceptibility for each degree centigrade decrease in temperature. Plants grown at postinoculation temperatures below 24 ° were less susceptible than plants grown at 246. Plant susceptibility was greater at a postinoculation temperature of 30 ° than at 24 °. Initial work indicated the effects of preinoculation and postinoculation temperatures were not additive. No significant differences in virus transmission were found for aphids with acquisition probes in the 11 - to 45 -second range. Increase in test probe time resulted in increase in virus transmission over a 6 - to 60 -second range, the major increase occurring after 35 seconds. In an experiment on the retention of BYMV by feeding aphids, the transmission decreased from an initial level of 74...|$|R
5000|$|Pigs get {{infected}} with A. suum by ingesting infectious parasite eggs that {{are present in}} the environment. The larvae of Ascaris complete two moults within the egg and therefore, the larvae emerging from the egg is not a second stage larva (L2) as was previously presumed, but rather a third stage larva (L3) covered by a loosened L2 cuticle. The larvae hatch from the egg inside the intestines and subsequently start their migration through the body of the pig. First they penetrate the intestinal wall {{at the level of the}} caecum/colon [...] and use the mesenterial blood veins to migrate to the liver. After borrowing their way through the liver tissue, they again use the efferent blood stream to carry them to the lungs. There, they get stuck in the capillaries surrounding the lungs and they penetrate the lung alveoli. It takes approximately 7 days to reach the lungs. Once the larvae are inside the lung, they migrate up the respiratory tree and are eventually coughed up and swallowed by the host to reach the small intestine again as soon as 10 days after infection. There, the larvae undergo their first molt inside the host to reach the L4 stage by day 14 post infection. Around day 25 post infection they develop into the L5 stage. Worms reach adulthood 6 weeks after infection and when both female and male worms {{are present in the}} same host, fertilized eggs are produced and secreted by the female worm. These eggs are then excreted together with the faeces. After an incubation <b>period,</b> <b>infective</b> stage larvae develop in the eggs and are ready to cause infection in a new host.|$|R
40|$|Five M. rhesus fatally {{infected}} with {{yellow fever virus}} ran varied and typical courses, death occurring from 82 hours to 10 days after infecting. Batches of A. aegypti were fed daily on each monkey and specimens of blood injected into other animals. By mosquito transfer, the virus {{was found to be}} circulating in the peripheral blood 1 or 2 days after the infecting and the same interval before the onset of fever; in one instance, mosquitoes became infectious by feeding on a monkey 12 hours after its inoculation. Mosquitoes continued to acquire infectivity during the febrile period and for 1 day thereafter, except in one instance when death occurred during fever which prevented post-febrile testing. By subinoculation of blood, the disease was transferred before and after, as well as during the same interval as in mosquito transmission. In one of two attempts, the virus was carried by this means as early as 12 hours after the donor animal was infected. Following {{the first day of the}} post-febrile period, blood transmissions were irregularly fatal beyond the <b>period</b> <b>infective</b> for mosquitoes. These results point to a remarkably rapid multiplication of the virus in the animal host, in one case a blood subinoculation (0. 5 cc.) being successful at the first test 24 hours after the donor monkey was bitten by only 2 A. aegypti. The regular acquisition of infectivity by mosquitoes fed during the incubation period is of especial interest in indicating the infectivity of human cases for mosquitoes before the appearance of clinical symptoms. This offers one explanation for the insidious propagation of epidemics of yellow fever and should be useful in the institution of control activities during an outbreak of this disease...|$|R
50|$|The {{patterns}} of autoinfection highlight mother-son mating and the sex ratio. Female biased broods are favored, involving mother-son matings and accessibility to haplodiploids. Colonization {{is accomplished by}} immature stages and female bias is favored at low colonization densities by the fact that, unlike isolated males, isolated females are not lost to the gene pool because they can mate with their parthenogenetically produced sons. In the M. Adamson and D. Ludwig model, colonization was found to occur before mating and male progeny have no fitness unless they colonize a host that contains a female. The ability of a female to produce songs with which to mate is potentially central to the colonization process. This conclusion was specifically called to attention through the case of G. batrachiensis. Using, in pinworms, mother-son matings {{are not expected to}} occur commonly in this life cycle since a female's progeny must leave the host. However, in G. batrachiensis, a second mode of reproduction has developed that makes mother-son matings possible: the method by which females produce two types of eggs, thin and thick shelled, as explored in detail in the earlier sections of this article. Once again, thin-shelled eggs contain well developed larvae that hatch at deposition and develop in the same host as the mother; thick shelled eggs are deposited in the two to four stage of cleavage and must pass to the external environment before they are <b>infective.</b> The colonizing <b>period</b> in G. batrachiensis lasts about three months. During a three year study, the number of adult worms in hosts in late fall varied between 3 and 12. If colonization is assumed to be a random process, then the mean interval between colonizations varied between 9 and 35 days with a mean of 17, which corresponds to the period a female requires to reach reproductive age. Hence, early colonists may often reach reproductive maturity in isolation from others of the opposite sex even though, {{by the end of the}} colonization period, hosts typically contain a dozen worms. Males mature about twice as fast as females, and this lessens the delay in reproduction associated with mating with a son. Brood sex ratio is skewed in G. batrachiensis. In a sample of 234 females, 205 of 296 embryos in thick-shelled eggs were diploid and would develop as females.|$|R
40|$|Quatro isolados do vírus do mosaico da berinjela (EMV - "eggplant mosaic virus" - grupo tymovírus) foram armazenados a partir de extratos foliares de hospedeiras com sintomas sistêmicos. Os virus EMV-Al (isolado de Abelia), EMV-Sc (isolado da Escócia), -ts (estirpe-padrão) e VNBT (vírus da necrose branca do tomateiro), que induzem sintomas em Chenopodium amaranticolor, C. murale, C. quinoa (Família Chenopodiaceae) Datura stramonium, Lycopersicon esculentum e Nicotiana glutinosa (Solanaceae), foram conservados em extratos destas plantas, à temperatura ambiente, em geladeira e em congelador. A infectividade dos vírus, em diferentes períodos de armazenamento, foi testada em plantas de datura e glutinosa, para se determinar a longevidade in vitro. Constatou-se que, quando guardados em baixas temperaturas,os extratos preservam por mais tempo a infectividade dos vírus. No caso de datura e glutinosa, por exemplo, resultados positivos foram obtidos até 413 e 282 dias de armazenamento, respectivamente, em congelador. Entretanto, com relação às espécies de Chenopodium testadas, mesmo alguns extratos recém-preparados conduziram a resultados negativos, confirmando a presença de inibidores de infecção viral nestas plantas. Das três espécies, é sugerida a utilização apenas de C. quinoa para o preparo de extratos visando preservar estes vírus e, assim mesmo, por um período relativamente curto (entre 53 e 80 dias). A avaliação geral dos resultados mostra que, para os tymovírus estudados neste trabalho, é possível conservar a infectividade através da técnica de armazenamento de extratos foliares de plantas sistemicamente infectadas. Four {{isolates}} of EMV (eggplant mosaic virus - tymovirus group) were {{preserved in}} crude extracts from systemically-infected plants. EMV-Al (Abelia strain), EMV-Sc (Scottish strain), EMV-ts (type-strain) and TWNV (tomato white necrosis virus) which induce symptoms in Chenopodium amaranticolor, C. murale, C. quinoa (Family Chenopodiaceae), Datura stramonium, Lycopersicon esculentum and Nicotiana glutinosa (family Solanaceae) plants were maintened in leaf extrats obtained from these species. The extracts were kept at room temperature, at about 5 +C and at about 20 +C. Sap containing viruses were periodically inoculated in test-plants (datura and glutinosa) {{in order to}} determine the longevity in vitro. It was verified that viruses remained <b>infective</b> for longer <b>periods</b> if extratcs were kept at low temperatures as compared with those maintained at room temperature. In the case of sap juice from datura and glutinosa plants, EMV isolates remained infective respectively up to 413 and 282 days at about - 20 +C. However, many negative results were obtained with Chenopodium species even when freshly prepared leaf juice were used. This fact may be understood by the presence of virus inhibitors in these plants. Only C. quinoa is a valuable host to be used to preserve four EMV isolates, although for a short period (more than 53 and less than 80 days). The present paper reports the successful use of keeping infected leaf juices for preserving the infectivity of some tymoviruses...|$|R
