A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain massage therapy was better than no {{treatment}} for pain only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short-term.</b> There was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain massage therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short-term.</b> The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines have robust {{efficacy}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> {{management of}} {{generalized anxiety disorder}} (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall. According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), benzodiazepines {{can be used in}} the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> low {{carbohydrate}} diets appear {{better than}} low fat diets for weight loss. In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} {{with the fact that}} a Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other aircraft are kept circling until larger aircraft are parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. It {{is for this reason that}} plans to relocate the airport are so important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short-term</b> scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E
