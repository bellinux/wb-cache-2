Any United States or West Virginia state flag purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used. To honor the death of law-enforcement officers within the state, the West Virginia Code permits the draping of the state flag over the coffin at no cost, upon the request of the next-of-kin.|$|E

The cost of the new line is estimated at 9,244,200,000 kuna (approx. 1.6 bil USD). The project will include the modernisation of the current Botovo-Zagreb line and a construction of a completely new line between Zagreb and Rijeka.|$|E

Reported issues are increasing the quality of domestic products, adaptation by domestic suppliers to the Iranian consumer tastes and marketing. As part of the resistive economy, the Supreme Leader of Iran has urged Iranians to consume more domestic products over imported ones.|$|E
25|$|During spinal shock, {{the bladder}} is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock <b>has</b> <b>passed,</b> <b>a</b> spinally {{mediated}} voiding reflex ensues, {{although there is}} no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers. Some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs, provoking a mild mass reflex. In some instances, the voiding reflex becomes hyperactive. Bladder capacity is reduced and the wall becomes hypertrophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder. The reflex hyperactivity is made worse, and may be caused, by infection in the bladder wall.|$|E

25|$|The 1927 Law on Using National Waters (Ley Vigente de Aprovechamiento de Aguas Nacionales) was a {{major step}} for Honduras in water {{resource}} management (WRM). This law however, did not recognize multi-sectoral uses of water, therefore, water use in each WRM sector became regulated by their own respective sectoral law. Furthermore, major institutions such as SANAA, CONASA, and ERSAPS have operational functions in both water and sanitation services. As of August 2009, Honduras <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new General Water Law with a National Water Authority to provide regulation and oversight to institutions responsible for distinct sectors of water resource management.

25|$|The School serves 176 {{students}} in grades 9-11. The school is operated in partnership with Eastern University. Selected students enrolled in Science and Discovery High School earn college credits while earning credits towards high school graduation. Students receive instruction from college professors on the school's campus. Students receive extra help through tutoring during and after school using computer assisted programs such as Achieve 3000 (reading) and Apangea for mathematics. In September 2011, students staged a walkout in protest over several grievances, including class size and unqualified teachers. According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education report, the school has 16 Non‐Highly Qualified Teachers and 6 with emergency certification. In Pennsylvania, a Highly Qualified teacher is one who: (1) holds full certification, (2) has at least a bachelor's degree, (3) has completed a content area major, (4) <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> content area test, and (5) has completed teacher education coursework In 2009–10, enrollment was 176 pupils.

25|$|In 1997, the Cultural Affairs Department of Chief Dull Knife College {{applied to}} the Administration for Native Americans for an {{approximately}} $50,000 language preservation planning grant. The department wanted to use this money to assess {{the degree to which}} Cheyenne was being spoken on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Following this, the department wanted to use the compiled data to establish long-term community language goals, and to prepare Chief Dull Knife College to implement a Cheyenne Language Center and curriculum guide. In 2015, the Chief Dull Knife College sponsored the 18th Annual Language Immersion Camp. This event was organized into two weeklong sessions, and its aim was to educate the younger generation on their ancestral language. The first session focused on educating 5-10 year olds, while the second session focused on 11- to 18-year-olds. Certified Cheyenne language instructors taught daily classes. Ultimately, the camp provided approximately ten temporary jobs for fluent speakers on the impoverished reservation. The State of Montana <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> law that guarantees support for tribal language preservation for Montana tribes. Classes in the Cheyenne language are available at Chief Dull Knife College in Lame Deer, Montana, at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, and at Watonga High School in Watonga, Oklahoma.|$|E
