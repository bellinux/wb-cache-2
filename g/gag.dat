5|$|Raj appealed {{before the}} court against the <b>gag</b> order imposed on him, stating {{that he had to}} move around {{different}} places in Maharashtra for propounding the philosophy of his party and that such an order was an infringement of his 'fundamental rights'. On 22 February, the court dismissed his appeal to re-track the extension of the <b>gag</b> order passed against him, following which MNS started a signature campaign to get support against the <b>gag</b> order. According to MNS, Maharashtrian actors Nana Patekar and Shreyas Talpade had shown support in opposing the <b>gag</b> order, along with actors Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty. Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty, however, later denied the MNS's claim. This move by MNS prompted the police to serve a show cause notice to Raj, asking him why the <b>gag</b> order should not be extended.|$|E

40|$|Glutaraldehyde {{crosslinked}} bovine pericardium {{has been}} used for fabrication of bioprosthetic heart valves as well as cardiac patches for soft tissue repair. However, calcification and limited mechanical stability result in shortened life for the prostheses. Previous research has shown that glutaraldehyde crosslinking does not stabilize glycosaminoglycans (<b>GAGs)</b> and that <b>GAGs</b> are lost from porcine bioprosthetic heart valves[1]. Bovine pericardial tissue is composed of an amorphous network of collagen and elastin fibers, proteoglycans, and <b>GAGs.</b> The <b>GAGs</b> of bovine pericardium include dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronan [2]. It is hypothesized that Glut does not stabilize <b>GAGs</b> in pericardium and loss of <b>GAGs</b> {{may play a role in}} the degenerative failure of pericardial valves.

In his pamphlet A New <b>Gag</b> for an Old Goose (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New <b>Gag</b> for the New Gospel, Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination, the doctrine that salvation and damnation were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as Arminians – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines {{had been one of}} the few sources of support for Charles's proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled Appello Caesarem, in 1625 shortly after the old king's death and Charles's accession. To protect Montagu from the stricture of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins <b>Gag</b> and Env. <b>Gag</b> proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
40|$|Skeletal {{integrity}} is tightly {{regulated by the}} activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts that are both {{under the control of}} extracellular glycosaminoglycans (<b>GAGs)</b> through their interactions with endogenous growth factors and differentiation-promoting ligands. Receptor activator of NF-kappa-B ligand (RANKL), which is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related protein that is critical for osteoclast formation, is produced by osteoblasts and further modulated by certain types of <b>GAGs.</b> Using unfractionated osteoblast-derived <b>GAGs</b> that reflect the complex tissue microenvironment within which osteoclasts reside, we demonstrate that these <b>GAGs</b> block the osteoclastogenic activity of RANKL. Furthermore, RANKL significantly reduces extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activity, a putative suppressor of osteoclastogenesis, but osteoblast-derived <b>GAGs</b> eliminate the inhibitory effects of RANKL on ERK activity. Notably, while imposing an anti-osteoclastic effect, these <b>GAGs</b> also enhanced the proliferation of osteoblasts. Thus, the osteoblast microenvironment is a potent source of <b>GAGs</b> that promote bone anabolic activities. The anti-osteoclastogenic and osteoblast-related mitogenic activities of these <b>GAGs</b> together may provide a key starting point for the development of selective sugar-based therapeutic compounds for the treatment of osteopenic disorders...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Gagging</b> Problem Assessment (GPA) is an {{instrument}} to evaluate dental <b>gagging.</b> Although the GPA seemed to be reliable and valid in a pilot study, a replication study with more subjects was needed. Based on the pilot study, {{the number of items}} was reduced, resulting in the revised version of the GPA (GPA-R). The aims of this study were to replicate the reliability of the GPA-R and to investigate the correlation between dental <b>gagging</b> and general anxiety. Dental <b>gagging</b> patients (n= 59) were compared with a control group (n= 17) at t 0 and 3 weeks later. The <b>gagging</b> group' also filled in the SCL- 90 anxiety scale. Gagging-specific homogenous domains and internal consistency were determined. Stability and distinguishing capacity of the GPA-R were assessed. SCL- 90 -Anxiety scores were compared with standard values in a non-clinical population. The GPA-R patient part was able to reliably discriminate between the absence or the presence of dental <b>gagging.</b> However, the reliability of the GPA-R-dentist part was insufficient. The GPA-R seems to be sensitive to subtle differences in acts of the dentists. To overcome these problems, more detailed and explicit instructions on how to use the GPA-R should be formulated and more specific <b>gagging</b> stimuli should be included. The <b>gagging</b> group' reported fear of choking' significantly more often than the control group (P= 0008).

40|$|International audienceHighlights Glycosaminoglycans play a {{key role}} in the {{cellular}} uptake of the cationic peptide PACAP. PACAP binding to <b>GAGs</b> induces a random coil-to-α-helix conformational conversion. PACAP α-helix is necessary for efficient internalization mediated by cell surface <b>GAGs.</b> Abstract Glycosaminoglycans (<b>GAGs)</b> contribute to the cellular uptake of cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). However, molecular details about the contributions of <b>GAGs</b> in CPP internalization remain unclear. In this study, we examined the cellular uptake mechanism of the arginine-rich CPP pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). We observed that the uptake efficacy of PACAP is dependent on the expression of cell surface <b>GAGs.</b> As the binding of PACAP to sulfated <b>GAGs</b> induced a random coil-to-α-helix conformational conversion, we investigated the role of the helical formation in PACAP internalization. Whereas this secondary structure was not crucial for efficient internalization in GAGs-deficient cells, PACAP α-helix was essential for GAGs-dependent uptake...|$|R

40|$|Amyloidosis is {{a protein}} folding {{disorder}} in which normally soluble proteins are deposited extracellularly as insoluble fibrils, impairing tissue structure and function. Charged polyelectrolytes such as glycosaminoglycans (<b>GAGs)</b> are frequently found {{associated with the}} proteinaceous deposits in tissues of patients affected by amyloid diseases. Experimental evidence indicate that they can {{play an active role}} in favoring amyloid fibril formation and stabilization. Binding of <b>GAGs</b> to amyloid fibrils occurs mainly through electrostatic interactions involving the negative polyelectrolyte charges and positively charged side chains residues of aggregating protein. Similarly to catalyst for reactions, <b>GAGs</b> favor aggregation, nucleation and amyloid fibril formation functioning as a structural templates for the self-assembly of highly cytotoxic oligomeric precursors, rich in β-sheets, into harmless amyloid fibrils. Moreover, the <b>GAGs</b> amyloid promoting activity can be facilitated through specific interactions via consensus binding sites between amyloid polypeptide and <b>GAGs</b> molecules.

Little is known about the neuronal mechanism of severe <b>gagging,</b> because severe <b>gagging</b> is difficult to induce in animal experiments. In a recent study the authors reported that pulse train stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) at high frequency can be used to induce severe <b>gagging</b> in decerebrate rats. The present study was focused on the roles of NK_ 1 and NMDA receptors in severe <b>gagging</b> and the influence that the receptor antagonists may exert on this process. Intravenous administration of WIN 51708, NK_ 1 receptor antagonist, significantly diminished the probability of the induction of severe <b>gagging</b> elicited by 3 sets of pulse train of the SLN at intervals of 1. 7 sec (100 Hz, 0. 3 ms, 50 pulses, n= 7). Similarly, MK- 801, NMDA receptor antagonist, significantly diminished the probability of the induction of severe <b>gagging</b> (n= 9). These results suggest that the neural circuits of severe <b>gagging</b> elicited by SLN stimulation could involve both NK_ 1 and NMDA receptors.
