With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, {{and then you}} {{question}} <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> go round this emotional circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E
25|$|They say it's a {{government}} takeover of health care, a big lie just like Goebbels. You say it enough, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie and eventually, people believe it. Like blood libel. That's {{the same kind}} of thing. The Germans said enough about the Jews and the people believed <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> had the Holocaust. You tell a lie over and over again. And we've heard on this floor, government takeover of health care.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E

500|$|The film {{relied on}} subtext, {{requiring}} the actors to [...] "read between the lines" [...] {{for a number}} of their scenes. Most of the sentiments are understated, and Burshtein avoided having any of the characters break down or openly become angry when pressured. Yaron described a scene between Yochay and Rivka as her favorite, saying, [...] "I think it's {{because there is so much}} pain there; it touches you the most when people feel something and try to hide <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> see it." ...|$|E

Despite King's statement, [...] "Eyes of the Insane" [...] won Slayer their first Grammy award. The Slayer guitarist has also stated; [...] "I like playing 'Jihad' because I'm back changing my guitars, and Jeff starts it and he starts it quietly so {{you can hear the}} fans go crazy about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can't always hear that {{at the beginning of a}} song." ...|$|E

500|$|After a stint {{with the}} {{short-lived}} Army Service Training Program, Groza was sent with the 96th Infantry Division {{to serve as}} a surgical technician in Leyte, Okinawa, and other places in the Pacific theater in 1945. The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded.

500|$|Chesnutt shopped {{the album}} around to record companies, but they mistook {{it for a}} demo and {{rejected}} it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He {{said in an interview}} for Vibe at the time, [...] "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience I had in my bedroom? To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> love it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do." [...] In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go! ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about <b>it?</b> <b>And,</b> <b>you</b> remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E

When asked why the song was remixed, Hugo replied with, [...] "We wanted something with more of a straight-ahead, club-bumping beat, just a different take on it. We like to remix, dismantle, take apart shit {{and put it back}} together. It's just like a Rubik's Cube: When you can't solve it, you just break <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> put it back together." [...] Williams added, [...] "We think that 'Everyone Nose' in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way, so I just wanted to go and do something different." ...|$|E

Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle.

500|$|With an {{estimated}} digitalisation budget of 75million (valued at about US$1.7 million in 2010), Mayabazar {{was released in}} colour on 30 January 2010 in 45 Andhra Pradesh theatres. The colourised version was distributed by R. B. Choudary under his production banner, Super Good Films. Nageswara Rao, Gummadi Venkateswara Rao, Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy and Sita were the only cast members still alive {{for the release of}} the digitally remastered version. The colour version received positive reviews and was commercially successful. M.L. Narasimham of The Hindu called the new version [...] "laudable, but the soul was missing", adding, [...] "Get a DVD of the original (Black & White) movie, watch <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will agree with ANR [...] who while talking about Mayabazar once exclaimed, 'What a picture it was!'".|$|E

500|$|The film {{opened in}} 3,929 theaters in the United States and Canada on May 16, 2008. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG. To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When you sit down and you're watching <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these things because you're essentially making the film for yourself.

500|$|In 1973, {{while still}} grieving {{the loss of}} her daughter, Rice took a {{previously}} written short story and turned it into her first novel, the bestselling Interview with the Vampire. She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in Dracula's Daughter: [...] "It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that feeling when writing Interview With the Vampire. I didn't do a lot of research." [...] After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, [...] "What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> go crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{joke about}} Mulder wanting Richard Gere {{to appear in}} the movie stemmed from the fact that Duchovny's acting was often {{compared}} to Gere's. Duchovny decided to turn the idea into a joke, saying, [...] "we used to always have the joke on set that when they do the movie it's going to be Richard Gere and Jodie Foster [...] So I originally wrote the teaser for Richard Gere and Jodie Foster and I just started to think about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> know, it's so much funnier with Garry and Téa." [...] The episode featured several uncredited celebrity cameos. During the premiere of the movie, Duchovny's Return to Me costars Minnie Driver and David Alan Grier appear as members of the audience. In addition, Chris Carter, the show's creator, made a cameo during the theater scene. The appearance was his second in the series.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> buy it. And why not? The song's lovely.|$|E
500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I had not really shopped it much, because sometimes {{you do not want to}} come out of the bag before it's right. People do not really get <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|Leading Marine officers, however, {{were not}} all of the same opinion. Cushman, the new III MAF commander, {{supported}} Westmoreland (perhaps wanting to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt). Other concerns raised included the assertion that the real danger to I Corps was from a direct threat to Quang Tri City and other urban areas; that a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration, since NVA troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh; that the base was too isolated and that the Marines [...] "had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations". Additionally, Shore argues that the [...] "weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous." [...] Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander 3rd Marine Division) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous. [...] "When you're at Khe Sanh, you're not really anywhere. You could lose <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> really haven't lost a damn thing." ...|$|E
