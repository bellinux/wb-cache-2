40|$|BACKGROUND: Urinary mercury (U-Hg) {{excretion}} is {{a commonly}} used biomarker for mercury exposure from dental amalgam restorations. OBJECTIVES: Our {{goal was to}} determine the most efficient measure <b>of</b> dental <b>amalgam</b> exposure for use in analyses concerning U-Hg in children. METHODS: We analyzed time-sensitive longitudinal amalgam exposure data in children randomized to amalgam restorations (n = 267) during the 5 -year New England Children’s Amalgam Trial. We calculated 8 measures <b>of</b> <b>amalgam,</b> evaluating current versus cumulative exposure, teeth versus surfaces, and total versus posterior occlusal amalgams. Urine samples collected during follow-up years 3 – 5 were analyzed for mercury excretion. Multivariate models for current and cumulative U-Hg excretion estimated associations between exposures and U-Hg. RESULTS: At the end of follow-up, the average (± SD) cumulative exposure was 10. 3 ± 6. 1 surfaces and 5. 7 ± 2. 9 teeth ever filled with amalgam, corresponding to 30 ± 21 surface-years. Amalgam measures and U-Hg were moderately correlated. <b>Of</b> <b>amalgam</b> exposure measures, the current total <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> surfaces was the most robust predictor of current U-Hg, whereas posterior occlusal surface-years was best for cumulative U-Hg. In multivariate models, each additional amalgam surface present was associated with a 9 % increase in current U-Hg, and each additional posterior occlusal surface-year was associated with a 3 % increase in cumulative U-Hg excretion (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: One single measure <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> exposure is insufficient. Studies of cumulative effects <b>of</b> mercury from <b>amalgam</b> exposure in children are likely to have improved validity and precision if time-sensitive amalgam exposure measures are used. In contrast, simple counts <b>of</b> current <b>amalgam</b> fillings are adequate to capture amalgam-related current U-Hg...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this article}} is to assess the {{attitude}} of senior dental students of college of dentistry, Al Quds University towards placement of direct restorative materials in posterior teeth. Amalgam is used conventionally in restoration of posterior teeth while the use of resin composites is on rise for the same purpose. The esthetic concern of the patients and safety concerns about use <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> are changing the conventional trends of posterior teeth restoration. Some dental schools have even declined the use <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> in their institutions. But the properties <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> such as its high strength and less wear over a period of time are still making it the best alternative for the posterior teeth restoration. This study was conducted to evaluate the attitude of the dental students towards the use <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> and resin composites in restoration of posterior teeth. A 20 items online questionnaire was sent to 82 fifth year dentistry students of Al Quds University. Out of them 69 students responded with a response rate of 84. 1 %. The questions involve influences of various factors on the choice of material for posterior teeth restoration. The size of the cavity is found to have almost equal influence in both the cases. Esthetic demand and patient’s choice also affect the choice of material strongly. Age of the patient doesn’t seem to affect much on the material choice. Moisture control was found critical in case of composite restoration. Patient’s pregnancy seems to strongly influence in case <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> restoration due to the safety concerns regarding the same. As per this study, the students seem to choos...|$|R

Restorative dentistry restores the function of the teeth and their surrounding structures. Patients may need dental restorative procedures due to disease, trauma, and esthetics purposes. The most prevalent dental disease is caries, which is treated by the removal of bacteria and the placement of a restorative material. This thesis aims to determine if the use <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> restoration should be discontinued in the United States. To determine if dental amalgam restorations should be discontinued the safety and <b>of</b> <b>amalgam,</b> composite, and ceramic materials will be evaluated. The objective is to review the current literature to determine if the use <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> is unethical and if composite and ceramic restorations can serve as a proper alternative. Restorative materials have been used for over 170 years and the contents in these materials have been very controversial. The first record <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> placement was in 659 AD in China through Material Medica. Since then, new advancements and different compositions have varied to increase the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> restorations. Composite restorations became popular in the early 1960 's and have drastically improved and are now comparable in compressible strength to amalgam restorations and are placed in posterior teeth. Porcelain, ceramics has been used in dentistry since the 1800 's and has advanced through fabrication and cementation techniques. One fabrication technique of interest is the utilization of CEREC CAD/CAM systems. This system has also evolved and is now on its third generation; its original design included fabricated inlays and onlays only. Now, The CAD/CAM has evolved to fabricate inlays, onlays, crowns, and veneers. The use <b>of</b> dental <b>amalgam</b> has been shown through many studies to be safe and has an unmatched longevity record. Composites and porcelain ceramics are also successful to varying degree but do not have the longevity found with amalgam. These studies, demonstrates the use <b>of</b> <b>amalgam</b> in the United States is ethical, successful, cost effective, and should not be discontinued...|$|R
