40|$|Abstract. In {{ultrasonic}} welding of fiber reinforced thermoplastic, <b>heat</b> is <b>generated</b> by <b>means</b> of interfacial friction at the interface to be bonded and internal friction of the polymer chains. A finite element model, using ANSYS software, {{was developed to}} calculate the transient temperature profile in glass fiber reinforced polypropylene joint in the transverse direction during {{ultrasonic welding}}. The {{results showed that the}} temperature in the joint increased with increasing weld time. With higher weld pressure, the temperature of molten point of polyprolylene can be reached within a shorter weld time. The weld map obtained from the finite model was in agreement with the results obtained experimentally...|$|R

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for measuring the}} rate of heat production by mixing in fermentation systems has been developed. The <b>heat</b> <b>generated</b> by mixing and lactose metabolism during the continuous production of single cell protein from cheese whey lactose was calculated using a heat balance equation. The technique quantified the heat produced in and lost from the fermentation system. Most of the <b>heat</b> <b>generated</b> by mixing in the cell-free system (98. 93 %) was lost with exhaust gas while a very small amount (1. 07 %) was lost through the fermenter lid, wall, and bottom. The <b>heat</b> <b>generated</b> by mixing was significant (19. 69 %) of the total <b>heat</b> <b>generated</b> in the fermentation system with an active yeast population present) and, therefore, cannot be ignored in heat balance calculations. About 30. 38 % of the total <b>heat</b> <b>generated</b> in the reactor was lost through the coolant showing the need for jacked fermenter for continuous operation. A yeast population size of 986 million cells. mL- 1 and a lactose removal efficiency of 95. 6 % were observed. About 88. 5 % of the lactose consumed was used for growth. A yield of 0. 77 g(wb) cells. g- 1 lactose was achieved. The heat released by unit biomass was 2. 82 kJ. g- 1 cells...|$|R

In this paper, the spindle’s thermal {{characteristics}} of CNC milling machine in steady state and transient state are analyzed by using ANSYS, the temperature field and thermal deformation field are obtained. After {{a number of}} tests are done in different working conditions, the temperature and thermal deformation changes of spindle are measured in every working condition. Combing the FEM analysis with test’s results, the thermal deformation of spindle from starting to reach thermal balance on CNC milling machine is discussed, some suggestions are presented to improve the process precision of CNC milling machine.

40|$|FEM (Finite Element Method) {{has been}} widely used to solve {{temperature}} in hot rolling. The heat gen-erating rate of electromagnetic field has been discussed {{in order to improve}} the efficiency and accuracy in the solution of induction heating. A new <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> rate model was proposed and derived from the calculated results by FEM software in consideration of work frequency, source current density, and the air gap between induction coil and slab. The calculated distribution of <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> rate in the skin depth by the model is satisfying and reliable compared with that of FEM software. Then, the mathematic model of the <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> rate model is considered as the density of heat reservoir to solve the temperature in induction heating. Moreover, the temperature evolution of slab in induction heating from a hot rolling plant has been solved by the developed FE code and the calculated temperature has a good agreement with the measured value. Therefore, the <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> rate model is suitable and efficiency to solve the temperature in induction heating by FEM...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the numerical {{results of the}} heat transfer from <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> wire at different conditions by finite element method. The parametric effects on heat transfer were investigated. The varied parameters included ambient conditions, {{as well as the}} shape of the cross-section. The numerical results show that the type of the medium where the <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> wire immerges has strong effects on the heatdissipation rate. As the size of the diameter the heat dissipation to the ambient is decreased. The effects of free convection conditions on the wire surface are also significant. However, the effect of the shape of the cross-section is not very strong. The results presented in this paper provide useful information for the application of <b>heat</b> <b>generating</b> wire...|$|R
