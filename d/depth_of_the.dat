5|$|The optical <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thebe gossamer ring {{is about}} 3, which {{is three times}} lower than the Amalthea gossamer ring, but the total mass of the dust is the same—about 107–109kg.

In the Thebe extension the parameter q may be even smaller.|$|E
5|$|The γ ring is narrow, {{optically}} {{dense and}} slightly eccentric. Its orbital inclination is almost zero. The {{width of the}} ring varies in the range 3.6–4.7km, although equivalent optical depth is constant at 3.3km. The normal optical <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> γ ring is 0.7–0.9. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the γ ring disappeared, which means it is geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The width and normal optical <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> γ ring show significant azimuthal variations. The mechanism of confinement of such a narrow ring is not known, {{but it has been}} noticed that the sharp inner edge of the γ ring is in a 6:5 resonance with Ophelia.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
5|$|Back in Kristiansund, Løvold {{started working}} {{with the idea of}} {{building}} a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland. He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. The local press dubbed him the fixed link general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|E

The game was widely praised by reviewers, primarily for its story, art direction, narration, and music. Opinions were mixed on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gameplay, though the variety of options in the combat system was praised.
