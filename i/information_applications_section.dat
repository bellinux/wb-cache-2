40|$|Every news medium makes mistakes. No {{matter if}} {{the origin of the}} mistake is the {{information}} source or the journalist, a trustworthy medium always notifies of the mistake and corrects it. This thesis deals with these corrections on the example of the Czech News Agency to represent the news agencies. The theoretical grounds for the thesis are: to define the demands of news coverage, to present the specifics of the news coverage by news agencies, to offer relatively complex analysis of the work with the sources of journalistic <b>information.</b> The <b>application</b> <b>section</b> of the thesis analyses the corrections as published in the Czech News Agency's service during {{the first three months of}} the 2011 calendar year. These corrections are categorized by several keys: by the nature of the corrected mistake, by the affiliation of the corrected mistake to the specific agency service and by the priority of the corrected mistake. The results of the analysis serve a practical purpose to journalists because they show them which type of corrections is the most common for a specific kind of the news coverage. I assume that the majority of mistakes is corrected (or at least that none of the types of mistakes and none of the kinds of the news coverage is neglected more often than the others when correcting the mistakes), and [...] ...|$|R

As a result, the security risks that face geographical <b>information</b> <b>applications</b> are also increasing. In this paper, a secured framework is proposed. The proposed framework's goal is, providing a fine grained access control to web-based geographic <b>information</b> <b>applications.</b> A case study is finally applied to prove the proposed framework feasibility and effectiveness.

40|$|A torsor under a k-group scheme G on {{a variety}} X over a number field k imposes a descent {{obstruction}} against the existence of rational points on X. We discuss the finite descent obstruction, that is for all such torsors under finite k-groups G, in view of a local-global interpolation property for sections of the fundamental group short exact sequence of X/k. There are applications to the Brauer-Manin obstruction, to the descent obstruction by torsors under linear groups, and to the birational version of Grothendieck's section conjecture over number fields. In particular, we obtain examples of families of curves over number fields, such that the birational section conjecture is true in a non-trivial way.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} current {{features}} {{of state and}} proprietary traveler <b>information</b> <b>applications,</b> elements of good design and usability, human factors issues regarding visual and cognitive distraction, and makes recommendations {{for the next generation}} of Minnesota’s traveler <b>information</b> <b>application,</b> MN 511. Traveler information systems were created to serve drivers by providing accurate information about traffic and road conditions before drivers began their trip. The advancement of cellular telephones provided a new opportunity for drivers to access traffic and road information en-route, but introduced considerable cognitive distraction on drivers navigating the complex phone trees. The evolution of traveler information systems onto smartphone applications has eased the cognitive demand previously imposed by phone tree systems, but has shifted the demand to drivers’ visual resources. The dichotomy between state-funded 511 travel <b>information</b> <b>applications</b> and proprietary traveler <b>information</b> <b>applications</b> is primarily determined by the features each contains. The common features included in the current proprietary traveler <b>information</b> <b>applications</b> provide insight into the opportunities for future iterations of MN 511 mobile applications. The MN 511 application can continue to improve by incorporating select features from proprietary applications, such as voice commands, route guidance, saved places, and travel time estimates, while taking into account cognitive workload and visual distraction. This is important because publicly funded traveler <b>information</b> <b>applications</b> have a greater responsibility, compared to proprietary applications, to account for distraction and ensure the safety of its users...|$|R
