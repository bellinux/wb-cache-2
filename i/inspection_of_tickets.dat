A party of four together--mother, father, and two daughters-- blundered in, all greatly excited. [...] "It's all right, Ma--you let me," [...] {{said one of the}} daughters, hitting her mother's bonnet with a handbag she struggled to put in the rack. Miss Winchelsea detested people who banged about and called their mother [...] "Ma." [...] A young man travelling alone followed. He was not at all [...] "touristy" [...] in his costume, Miss Winchelsea observed; his Gladstone bag was of good pleasant leather with labels reminiscent of Luxembourg and Ostend, and his boots, though brown, were not vulgar. He carried an overcoat on his arm. Before these people had properly settled in their places, came an <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> and a slamming of doors, and behold! they were gliding out of Charing Cross Station on their way to Rome.|$|E
60|$|I {{had noticed}} a {{peculiar}} Aeolian harp-like cry {{that ran through}} the whole train as we settled to rest at last after a long run--an almost sigh of infinite relief, a musical sigh that began in C and ran gradually up to F natural, which I think most observant travelers have noticed day and night. No railway official has ever given me a satisfactory explanation of it. As the car, in a rapid run, is always slightly projected forward of its trucks, a practical friend once suggested {{to me that it}} was the gradual settling back of the car body to a state of inertia, which, of course, every poetical traveler would reject. Four o'clock the sound of boot-blacking by the porter faintly apparent from the toilet-room. Why not talk to him? But, fortunately, I remembered that any attempt at extended conversation with conductor or porter was always resented by them as implied disloyalty to the company they represented. I recalled that once I had endeavored to impress upon a conductor the absolute folly of a midnight <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets,</b> and had been treated by him as an escaped lunatic. No, there was no relief from this suffocating and insupportable loneliness to be gained then. I raised the window-blind and looked out. We were passing a farm-house. A light, evidently the lantern of a farm-hand, was swung beside a barn. Yes, the faintest tinge of rose in the far horizon. Morning, surely, at last.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} Japanese surcharges, {{compared}} with other train systems, is that they often require a separate ticket. Thus, if riding the shinkansen, for instance, rather than purchasing a single shinkansen ticket, one purchases two tickets: a fare ticket (乗車券) for the distance traveled, and an additional shinkansen ticket (shinkansen special express ticket) to allow one to ride the shinkansen for that distance, rather than ordinary trains. Since express trains are not separated by special gates from ordinary trains, express service requires manual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> by a conductor, and express tickets can be purchased from the conductor. In short, the fare ticket allows access to the train platforms at entrance and exit, where it is inspected by the gate or attendant at the station, while the express ticket allows one to ride an express train over the interval and is inspected by a conductor on the train.|$|E

6000|$|He had {{no doubt}} that {{everything}} needful had been done. Chief Inspector Heat knew, of course, thoroughly the business of man-hunting. And these were the routine steps, too, that would be taken {{as a matter of course}} by the merest beginner. A few inquiries amongst the ticket collectors and the porters of the two small railway stations would give additional details as to the appearance of the two men; the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the collected <b>tickets</b> would show at once where they came from that morning. It was elementary, and could not have been neglected. Accordingly the Chief Inspector answered that all this had been done directly the old woman had come forward with her deposition. And he mentioned the name of a station. “That’s where they came from, sir,” he went on. “The porter who took the tickets at Maze Hill remembers two chaps answering to the description passing the barrier. They seemed to him two respectable working men of a superior sort—sign painters or house decorators. The big man got out of a third-class compartment backward, with a bright tin can in his hand. On the platform he gave it to carry to the fair young fellow who followed him. All this agrees exactly with what the old woman told the police sergeant in Greenwich.” ...|$|R

50|$|The station {{attendant}} generally sells passenger tickets {{through a}} ticket window and posts the train schedules, while the train conductor or driver handles collection and validation <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> in most cases.

50|$|Tickets to {{the festival}} are, notably, free (except the small booking fee which was {{introduced}} from the 2012 event onwards) but are usually now restricted to one pair per person. Prior to 2006, a ticket booth {{would be set}} up in an easy location in {{the centre of the}} hosting city, and anybody who wished to obtain a pair <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> would queue up, before a Radio 1 DJ gave them out (pairs <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for the Saturday given away on a Saturday and on the following day for the Sunday), on a first-come first-served basis. The theory there was that the majority <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> would go to local residents, as people from further away would not make the journey. However, as more and more 'non-local' residents came to the giveaways, and the capacity at the events grew year-on-year, it was decided that a different system was needed. From 2006, therefore, pairs <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> have been given away through an online lottery. People wishing to attend register on the BBC Radio 1 website and pairs <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> are then randomly allocated and given out. In order to make sure that those who live locally get the majority <b>of</b> <b>tickets,</b> the applications are split into categories of 'local postcodes' and 'other postcodes' and the majority <b>of</b> the <b>tickets</b> (usually 95%) are reserved for the former.|$|R
