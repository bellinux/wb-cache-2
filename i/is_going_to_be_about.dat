I've been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> a different one of these social demons." ...|$|E

6000|$|And may I say (as I {{can read}} nothing, if I read it at all, save {{in the light}} of how one would one's self proceed in {{tackling}} the same data!) just two other things? One is that I think your material suffers a little {{from the fact that the}} reader feels you approach your subject too immediately, show him its elements, the cards in your hand, too bang off from the first page--so that a wait to begin to guess what and whom the thing <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> doesn't impose itself: the ante-chamber or two and the crooked corridor before he is already in the Presence. The other is that you don't give him a positive sense of dealing with your subject from its logical centre. This centre I gathered to be, from what you told me in Rome (and one gathers it also from the title,) the consciousness of Eleanor--to which all the rest (Manisty, Lucy, the whole phantasmagoria and drama) is presented by life. I should have urged you: [...] "Make that consciousness full, rich, universally prehensile and stick to it--don't shift--and don't shift arbitrarily--how, otherwise, do you get your unity of subject or keep up your reader's sense of it?" [...] To which, if you say: How then do I get Lucy's consciousness, I impudently retort: [...] "By that magnificent and masterly indirectness which means the only dramatic straightness and intensity. You get it, in other words, by Eleanor." [...] "And how does Eleanor get it?" [...] "By Everything! By Lucy, by Manisty, by every pulse of the action in which she is engaged and of which she is the fullest--an exquisite--register. Go behind her--miles and miles; don't go behind the others, or the subject--i.e. the unity of impression--goes to smash." [...] But I am going too far--and this is more than you will have bargained for. On these matters there is far too much to say. This makes me all the more sorry that, in answer to your kind invitation for the last of this month, I greatly fear I can't leave home for several weeks to come. I am in hideous backwardness with duties that after a long idleness (six full months!) have awaited me here--and I am cultivating [...] "a unity of impression!" [...] In October with joy.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the new}} direction the series would be taking, Silvio Horta told E!'s Kristin Dos Santos at an ABC press meeting for its show runners, [...] "This season <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> growing up. We aren't {{going to be doing}} anymore child-like storylines. It <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> moving Betty forward." [...] He then added more details to MediaWeek about the changes: [...] "On Ugly Betty I think we started to veer a little too much into the romantic storyline, where it started to really become the show. And it started to just get away from what I originally wanted to do and where we originally started, which was about a girl making it in the city and her work life. So we're trying to refocus that back. But there's always temptation and you want to explore it. You want {{to have the opportunity to}} explore it. And the second you start getting too involved in it, it's like any plot line. You go in; it's very hard to get out and it takes a little longer." [...] He later revealed that the audience would see a more evolving Betty: [...] "Betty will solve a crime. Inject Botox. Get attacked by an animal. Throw a Wilhelmina mannequin down a flight of stairs. And that's just the first three episodes." ...|$|E

[...] He won the seat with a 17% swing as Labor suffered one of the worst defeats in its history, taking a seat that had since 1912 only ever fallen to the conservatives for one term following the 1957 Labor split and for one term during the Great Depression.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005, which {{requires}} all public transport services in Ontario to become accessible by 2025, the TTC began to make its streetcar system wheelchair accessible on August 31, 2014, when the first two new low-floor Flexity Outlook streetcars entered service on 510 Spadina line. The new streetcars have also been used on 509 Harbourfront line since March 29, 2015 as well as the new 514 Cherry streetcar line when it launched on June 19, 2016. The new streetcars will be rolled out onto 11 other streetcar lines (as more arrive and enter service), replacing the CLRV and ALRV streetcars by 2024. Former TTC manager David Gunn has criticized the new streetcar order: [...] "Oh, and they’re not accessible. The floor height is about a foot. You won’t be able to load a wheelchair on the street. There will be ramps, but the floor height <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> a foot. The ramps will be too steep." ...|$|E

Jackman also revealed that Mangold and he had begun speaking of potential ideas, adding, [...] "... Jim Mangold and I were literally on the phone last night talking about ideas but there is no script and no writer yet so it's a way off." [...] Mangold would later reveal that Jackman was very involved in developing the story, saying, [...] "Hugh and I have been friends for almost twenty years now, and he was there every step of the way. For Hugh and I, the first goal was to construct something more intimate. Hugh often brought up The Wrestler and Unforgiven as examples. I used those references as well as others. I pitched to both Hugh and the studio that I had an idea for an extremely bloody, existential Little Miss Sunshine." ...|$|E
