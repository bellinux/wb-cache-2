25|$|The {{production}} of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from corn or sugar beets or palm/vegetable oils, particularly if cane bagasse {{is used to}} produce heat and power for the process. Furthermore, if biofuels are used for crop production and transport, the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol <b>energy</b> <b>unit</b> can be very low. EIA estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology, the well-to-wheels CO2 emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{electric}} vehicle applications, batteries for stationary storage do not suffer from mass or volume constraints. However, {{due to the}} large amounts of energy and power implied, the cost per power or <b>energy</b> <b>unit</b> is crucial. The relevant metrics to assess the interest of a technology for grid-scale storage is the $/Wh (or $/W) rather than the Wh/kg (or W/kg). The electrochemical grid storage was made possible thanks {{to the development of}} the {{electric vehicle}}, that induced a fast decrease in the production costs of batteries below $300/kWh. By optimizing the production chain, major industrials aim to reach $150/kWh by the end of 2020. These batteries rely on a Li-Ion technology, which is suited for mobile applications (high cost, high density). Technologies optimized for the grid should focus on low cost and low density.|$|E

25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, <b>energy</b> <b>unit</b> with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The SJ 107 can equip {{a variety}} of weapons, ranging from {{conventional}} armaments such as a machine gun and a rocket launcher to more exotic weaponry such as a laser gun and [...] "erosion gun". While most weapons use ammunition, some run off of the suit's power supply. The energy decreases over time, and can be charged by picking up batteries or using an <b>energy</b> <b>unit.</b> When the energy is critically low, the suit's driving power, radar and energy-based weapons become impaired. The game ends if the SJ 107 suit either takes too much damage or runs out of power.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{recommendations}} for the quantity of water required for maintenance of good health suggested that 6–8 glasses of water daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. However {{the notion that a}} person should consume eight glasses of water per day cannot be traced to a credible scientific source. The original water intake recommendation in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council read: [...] "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods." [...] More recent comparisons of well-known recommendations on fluid intake have revealed large discrepancies in the volumes of water we need to consume for good health. Therefore, to help standardize guidelines, {{recommendations for}} water consumption are included in two recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) documents (2010): (i) Food-based dietary guidelines and (ii) Dietary reference values for water or adequate daily intakes (ADI). [...] These specifications were provided by calculating adequate intakes from measured intakes in populations of individuals with “desirable osmolarity values of urine and desirable water volumes per <b>energy</b> <b>unit</b> consumed.” ...|$|E

50|$|Significant {{sources of}} energy include oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and biomass (primarily the burning of wood). Other energy sources include geothermal, wind, photovoltaic, and solar thermal. The various <b>energy</b> <b>units</b> {{commonly}} used to measure these sources (e.g., joules, BTUs, kilowatt hours, therms) are only somewhat familiar to the general public, and their relationships can be confusing. These common <b>energy</b> <b>units</b> are sized for everyday activities (a joule is the energy required to lift a small apple one metre vertically). For regional, national, and global scales, larger <b>energy</b> <b>units,</b> such as the exajoule, the billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE) and the quad are used. Derived by multiplying the small common units by large powers of ten these larger units pose additional conceptual difficulties for many citizens.|$|R

We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it." [...] In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb US$47.4billion in securities and assume US$45.5billion in trading liabilities. Lehman's attorney Harvey R. Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said [...] "the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be US$1.29billion, including US$960million for Lehman's New York headquarters and US$330million for two New Jersey data centres. Lehman's original estimate valued its headquarters at US$1.02billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at US$900million." [...] Further, Barclays will not acquire Lehman's Eagle <b>Energy</b> <b>unit,</b> but will have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. Finally, Lehman will retain US$20billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays. Barclays had a potential liability of US$2.5billion to be paid as severance, if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days.|$|E
