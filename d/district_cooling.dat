40|$|AbstractIn recent years, the {{operation}} planning of <b>district</b> heating and <b>cooling</b> plants has been arousing interest {{as a result}} of development of cooling load prediction methods for <b>district</b> heating and <b>cooling</b> systems. In this paper, we formulate an operation planning problem of a <b>district</b> heating and <b>cooling</b> plant as a nonlinear 0 – 1 programming problem. Realizing that there does not exist an efficient exact solution method and the problem involves hundreds of variables, we propose an approximate solution method using genetic algorithms for the formulated nonlinear 0 – 1 programming problem. Furthermore, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for an operation planning problem of an actual <b>district</b> heating and <b>cooling</b> plant...|$|R
25|$|The Southampton District Energy Scheme was {{originally}} built to use just geothermal energy, but now also uses {{the heat from}} a gas fired CHP generator.

25|$|Sweden {{provides}} an alternative example where the heating market is deregulated. In Sweden {{it is most}} common that the ownership of the district heating network is not separated from the ownership of the cogeneration plants, the <b>district</b> <b>cooling</b> network or the centralized heat pumps. There are also examples where the competition has spawned parallel networks and interconnected networks where multiple utilities cooperate.|$|E
25|$|Heating is {{the most}} obvious application, but solar cooling can be {{achieved}} for a building or <b>district</b> <b>cooling</b> network by using a heat-driven absorption or adsorption chiller (heat pump). There is a productive coincidence that the greater the driving heat from insulation, the greater the cooling output.
