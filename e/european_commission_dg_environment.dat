This paper gives {{a description of the}} project's experimental approach and an overview of the main results regarding the effects of agricultural practices (i. e. conventional, CT, versus reduced tillage, RT) on surface conditions affecting wind erosion, the mobilisation of soil particles in the saltation layer and the atmospheric emission of fine dust into the suspension layer. The characterisation of the soil surface showed that soil erodibility by wind under RT was lower than that under CT. Though strong Cierzo wind events occurred during the experimental period, only a limited amount of material was available for wind erosion mainly due to soil crusting, a common feature in the area. In spite of this, saltation transport flux was measured at CT plots for different erosion episodes. Also, significant vertical emission of dust was observed only in the CT plot. Finally, the sandblasting efficiency calculated in the present experiment could be interpreted {{as the result of a}} higher binding energy for the particles of the silt loam experimental soil compared to soils with a lighter texture.

Urban sprawl is widespread in Europe: in a growing number of cities, population and employment in central areas is declining while increasing rapidly in suburban and peripheral areas and this induces a high level of car use and, usually, congestion on roads with access to city centres. To limit the damage caused by urban sprawl in terms of congestion, air pollution and energy consumption, many European cities are implementing (or planning to implement) suburban public transport services, such as heavy or light rail. But by improving accessibility, they create an incentive for a new wave of urban sprawl. Therefore, in parallel with these new public transport services, accompanying measures have to be elaborated and implemented, in order to prevent and mitigate the sprawl phenomenon. SCATTER is a project under the <b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>DG</b> Research, "Energy, <b>Environment</b> and Sustainable Development Programme" and is part of the LUTR projects cluster.

30|$|Within this framework, the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment (EPLCA 2014), {{developed}} by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the <b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> and <b>DG</b> <b>Environment,</b> represents the reference point for data and methods that are essential to implementing life-cycle-based approaches. While the information contained within the EPLCA relates mainly to the EU, it is extending its reach to the global level (several international contributors have already joined, and others are about to join). The Platform promotes the availability of data and information, {{with a focus on}} coherence and quality assurance. Although the methodology is developing at a fast pace, particularly with regard to the requirements of the <b>European</b> <b>Commission,</b> the lack of coherent, quality-assured life cycle data and studies still represents a major challenge to the mainstream use of LCA and associated environmental footprint methods in the business and policy sectors. Since its first release in 2006, the European Life Cycle Database (ELCD, developed under the EPLCA framework and managed by the JRC) gathers life cycle inventory (LCI) data from EU business associations (members of the advisory group of the EPLCA) and other sources for information on key materials, energy carriers, transport, and waste management. Most of the respective datasets are officially provided and approved by the industry associations involved. Many datasets have been revised and reviewed against the ILCD’s Entry-Level Requirements (<b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> JRC, Institute for Environment and Sustainability (2010 a)), and others are currently under review. This enabled the ELCD 3.0 (ELCD 2014) database (launched in 2013) {{to become one of the}} first nodes of the Life Cycle Data Network (LCDN 2014; Recchioni et al. 2014), which was officially launched in February 2014. The datasets were reviewed against the ILCD Entry-Level Requirements in order to provide users with useful information on data quality, including minimum documentation and methodological consistency across datasets, and to ensure the availability of reliable data to be used in LCA studies. In a spirit of continuous improvement, the JRC will carry out a background analysis of key (energy) datasets of the ELCD in order to identify opportunities for improving the quality of the data. This paper describes the methodological approach that was used to carry out the analysis of the data quality of the energy datasets included in the current version of the ELCD. This method does not aim to compare the overall quality of existing databases, but to point out the possible strengths of third-party databases with regard to data quality ratings (DQRs), in order to improve the quality of datasets included in the ELCD. Although the DQR evaluation, which was carried out against the ILCD Handbook criteria, can lead to lower average DQR scores for third-party databases that are compiled using different approaches, particular strong points in terms of data quality can be highlighted and used as an example for the improvement of the ELCD.|$|R

All the elements required for these ecosystem services depend on soil, and soil biodiversity {{is the driving force}} behind their regulation. With 2010 being the international year of biodiversity and with the growing attention in Europe on the importance of soils to remain healthy and capable of supporting human activities sustainably, now is the perfect time to raise awareness on preserving soil biodiversity. The objective of this report is to review the state of knowledge of soil biodiversity, its functions, its contribution to ecosystem services and its relevance for the sustainability of human society. In line with the definition of biodiversity given in the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Convention, soil biodiversity can be defined as the variation in soil life, from genes to communities, and the variation in soil habitats, from micro-aggregates to entire landscapes.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{combined}} exposure to noise, {{air pollution and}} chemicals has raised recently the interest of several bodies of the <b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> such as <b>DG</b> <b>Environment,</b> <b>DG</b> SANCO and DG Research {{in the context of}} the EC 7 th Framework Programme. There are open questions whether prevailing environmental concentrations of air pollutants and chemicals can lead to ototoxic health impacts. Therefore this issue needs to be thoroughly explored and investigated to help the EC to revise the existing standards and guidelines concerning combined exposure to noise, air pollutants and chemicals. The aim of the workshop was to review and discuss the existing scientific evidence whether prevailing environmental exposures to single and concomitant agents together with noise could lead to ototoxic or other health impacts. The final aim was to identify the research needs and to give recommendations for research and policy making in the EU level. It was agreed that research in the future should be focused on really established combinations (high correlations) and interactions (known effect) with main perspective on the traffic bundle of exposure. It was also discussed and agreed upon that the best knowledge exists on the health effects due to combined exposure to noise and solvents or heavy metals in occupational environments, especially on most of the auditory and non-auditory effects. Possible factors that may have confounding or aggravating effects on the results of noise studies were identified. Such factors are: age, gender, smoking, obesity, alcohol, socio-economic status, occupation, education, family status, active military, experience, hereditary disease, medication, medical status, race and ethnicity, physical activity, noisy leisure activities, stress reducing activities, diet & nutrition, housing condition (crowding), and residential status. Research priorities and recommendations for the future. The highest priority was given to issues related to research on noise and outdoor air pollutants. This is due to the fact that it may concern the largest population compared to the other stressors in this analysis and there is some evidence of serious health outcomes such as cardiovascular effects. The next priority was given to the research on the effects of noise and solvents in occupational settings and to research on noise and organophosphates. In the future research, priority should be given to: 1. evaluation of existing data collections whether re-analyses are possible with respect to combined exposure from traffic sources (road, rail and air), 2. analyses of existing data concerning noise and other stressors interactions in both occupational and environmental settings, 3. detailed assessment of combined exposures to noise, vibrations and PM, CO, NOx, and VOCs with specific studies in urban areas and, especially, cardiovascular health endpoints should be studied as priority health endpoints, 4. identification of causal mechanisms through careful review of toxicological experimental studies.

The study, commissioned by the <b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>DG</b> <b>Environment)</b> to a European consortium led by the RIVM, provides a basis for priority setting for European environmental policy planning {{in support of the}} sixth Environmental Action Programme. This programme follows up the current fifth Environmental Action Programme called "Towards Sustainability". The analysis is based on an examination of the cost of avoided damage, environmental expenditures, risk assessment, public opinion, social incidence and sustainability. The study incorporates information on targets, scenario results, and policy options and measures, including costs and benefits. The following main conclusions emerged from the results. According to current trends, the European Union will be successful in reducing pressures on the environment if all existing policies are fully implemented and enforced. However, damage to human health and ecosystems can be substantially reduced with accelerated policies. The implementation costs of these additional policies will not exceed the environmental benefits and the impact on the economy will be manageable. This means that future policies will have to focus on least-cost solutions and follow an integrated approach. Nevertheless, these policies will not be adequate for achieving all policy objectives. The major problems remaining are the excess load of nitrogen in the ecosystem, exceedance of air quality guidelines (especially for particulate matter), noise nuisance and biodiversity loss...|$|E

The focus was on new knowledge that came available since the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC TAR, 2001). The present report does not pretend to provide information with the status of the IPCC. The experts anyway agreed that the following statements are robust, hence that they are not likely to change as scientific uncertainties are further reduced: • the increase of the atmospheric aerosol concentration since pre-industrial times (1750) has resulted globally in a cooling, which magnitude is significant when compared with the warming due to greenhouse gases (GHG). • the probability that the climate sensitivity is in {{the upper part of the}} range proposed by the IPCC TAR, i. e. larger than 2. 5 °C for a doubling of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, is therefore higher. • reductions of black carbon and organic matter emissions from fossil fuel combustion (diesel in particular) would be beneficial for human health and would very likely counter-act partially the warming expected from ongoing reductions in sulfate and nitrate aerosols. • in order to stabilize CO 2 equivalent concentrations there is an urgent need to reduce CO 2 emissions, however the potential of reducing non-CO 2 greenhouse gases, in particular CH 4 and tropospheric ozone, should be explored as well...|$|E

40|$|Several recent {{publications}} reflect {{debate on}} the issue of “endocrine disrupting chemicals” (EDCs), indicating that two seemingly mutually exclusive perspectives are being articulated separately and independently. Considering this, a group of scientists with expertise in basic science, medicine and risk assessment reviewed the various aspects of the debate to identify the most significant areas of dispute and to propose a path forward. We identified four areas of debate. The first is about the definitions for terms such as “endocrine disrupting chemical”, “adverse effects”, and “endocrine system”. The second is focused on elements of hormone action including “potency”, “endpoints”, “timing”, “dose” and “thresholds”. The third addresses the information needed to establish sufficient evidence of harm. Finally, the fourth focuses on the need to develop and the characteristics of transparent, systematic methods to review the EDC literature. Herein we identify areas of general consensus and propose resolutions for these four areas that would allow the field to move beyond the current and, in our opinion, ineffective debate.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{initiatives}} {{in the market}} capable to assess some aspects of sustainability for roads (mainly environmental). For instance, in America {{it should be noted}} the Greenroads, Envision and Invest certification systems. In Europe, it must be highlighted some sustainability assessment systems such as Ceequal in UK as well as rating and awards scheme for civil engineering or many tools to evaluate CO 2 and Carbon Footprint, for example, the Dutch CO 2 Performance Ladder. However, a complete evaluation of sustainability has not been implemented yet as a consequence of that some approaches do not cover all life cycle phases or all sustainability pillars. What is more, {{there is a lack of}} regulation in terms of a framework for sustainability assessment of civil constructions, for instance, CENTC 350 is still under development In addition, there are regional peculiarities which are not always considered in the evaluation systems and sometimes there are some stakeholders refusing the idea of road comparison. The EC by means of the Joint Research Centre (DG-JRC) is developing the Green Public Procurement Criteria (GPP) for design, construction and maintenance of roads, as useful method for the pre-selection criteria for contractors and for ensuring compliance of performance. This paper summarizes the new sustainability certification system for roads named “LCE 4 ROADS”, under development as part of the FP 7 project: “Life Cycle Engineering approach to develop a novel EU-harmonized sustainability certification system for cost-effective, safer and greener road infrastructures”. LCE 4 ROADS will integrate by a Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) approach, all the aspects of sustainability (Environmental, Economic, Social, Technical) to asses roads projects and works (both new construction and rehabilitation/maintenance) with the final goal of creating a holistic and EU-harmonized methodology to increase the sustainability roads. The certification system developed is based on current EN and ISO standards for sustainability in construction (EN 15804) and LCA and LCC (ISO 14040 - 44 and ISO 15686) and considers previous developments from other research projects like MIRAVEC, EVITA, COST 354 among others. Key aspects at European level like the adaptation and resilience to Climate Change and the implementation of freight corridors (the so called TEN-T: Trans European Transport Network) will be considered in this new certification system. With the goal of refining the certification system and the parameters and key performance indicators to be considered, it should be mentioned that LCE 4 ROADS has been already presented to different key stakeholders such as:•National and Regional Road Authorities in six EU countries (France, The Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Poland) and in Turkey (The Turkish Ministry of Transport (KGM) is partner of the FP 7 Project). •The <b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>DG</b> Research, <b>DG</b> <b>Environment,</b> <b>DG</b> JRC, and DG Move-Transport) •Sectorial Platforms and Associations like the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), The European Road Federation (ERF), the Spanish Construction Technology Platform (mirror of the European ECTP) among others. The US Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is also interested in this topic and is working closely to the FP 7 project team (the EC selected the project to collaborate with the most important transport research center in America). The feedback received for future implementation from the key stakeholders has been taken into consideration to modify the scope of the certification system, the phases covered and the certification moments. This system, together with a guide for application and a multi-criteria software tool to be developed could be really useful for future procurement and GPP processes in Europe...|$|R

40|$|The {{circular}} economy is rapidly rising up political and business agendas. In contrast to today’s largely linear, ‘take-make-use-dispose’ economy, a {{circular economy}} represents a development strategy that enables economic growth while aiming to optimise {{the chain of}} consumption of biological and technical materials. A deep transformation of production chains and consumption patterns is envisaged to keep materials circulating in the economy for longer, re-designing industrial systems and encouraging cascading use of materials and waste. Although there are some elements of circularity such as recycling and composting in the linear economy (see Figure E 1) where progress needs to be maintained, a circular economy goes beyond the pursuit of waste prevention and waste reduction to inspire technological, organisational and social innovation across and within value chains (see Figure E 2). There are already several policies in place and activities underway that support a circular economy; however there remain a range of untapped opportunities, costs to be avoided and obstacles {{to be addressed in}} order to accelerate the move towards a circular economy in the EU. Against this backdrop, the <b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>DG</b> <b>Environment)</b> launched a Scoping study to identify potential circular economy actions, priority sectors, material flows & value chains.

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that a {{consortium}} of NGOs has {{played a significant role}} in shaping the market for, and restricting the use of, biofuels as an alternative to conventional fuels for road transport in Europe. This paper considers why a number of NGOs (Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, RSPB, Friends of the Earth) have chosen to enter the biofuels debate, and how they have variously developed policy, agreed a political campaign, and exercised political influence, in a key area of the world's response to major global climate change: how to reduce the carbon footprint of transport. We found that in many cases the development of NGO policy has been driven more by narrow political opportunities for influence than by broader and more coherent policy responses to global climate change or economic development, or indeed rigorous assessment of the scientific evidence. The research provides evidence of how NGO policies and lobbying significantly affected biofuel policy changes, review processes, target reductions, and sustainability regulation in the UK and in Europe. We consider that politically instituted markets, such as the one for biofuels, are examples of the emergence of new forms of governance of capitalist political economies facing a novel and pressing combination of drivers (climate change, energy security, resource constraints, and sustainable land-use). Politically instituted markets open up possibilities for political intervention from non-governmental or party-political actors, in ways that other markets do not. If political shaping of markets by NGOs becomes more widespread, issues of democratic legitimacy and public scrutiny will become ever more pressing. The paper is based on in-depth interviews with senior scientific directors and policy-makers in five NGOs, and of senior officials in UK government departments and the <b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>DG</b> <b>Environment</b> and DG Transport and Energy).

40|$|The {{economic}} {{assessment of}} priorities for a European environmental policy plan focuses on twelve identified Prominent European Environmental Problems such as climate change, chemical risks and biodiversity. The study, {{commissioned by the}} <b>European</b> <b>Commission</b> (<b>DG</b> <b>Environment)</b> to a European consortium led by RIVM, provides a basis for priority setting for European environmental policy planning {{in support of the}} sixth Environmental Action Programme as follow-up of the current fifth Environmental Action Plan called 'Towards Sustainability'. The analysis is based on an examination of the cost of avoided damage, environmental expenditures, risk assessment, public opinion, social incidence and sustainability. The study incorporates information on targets, scenario results, and policy options and measures including their costs and benefits. Main findings of the study are the following. Current trends show that if all existing policies are fully implemented and enforced, the European Union will be successful in reducing pressures on the environment. However, damage to human health and ecosystems can be substantially reduced with accelerated policies. The implementation costs of these additional policies will not exceed the environmental benefits and the impact on the economy is manageable. This requires future policies to focus on least-cost solutions and follow an integrated approach. Nevertheless, these policies will not be adequate for achieving all policy objectives. Remaining major problems are the excess load of nitrogen in the ecosystem, exceedance of air quality guidelines (especially particulate matter), noise nuisance and biodiversity loss. This report is one of a series supporting the main report: European Environmental Priorities: an Integrated Economic and Environmental Assessment. The areas discussed in the main report are fully documented in the various Technical reports. A background report is presented for each environmental issue giving an outline of the problem and its relationship to economic sectors and other issues; the benefits and the cost-benefit analysis; and the policy responses. Additional reports outline the benefits methodology, the EU enlargement issue and the macro-economic consequences of the scenarios. This report documents the Acidification, Eutrophication and Tropospheric Ozon issue...|$|E
