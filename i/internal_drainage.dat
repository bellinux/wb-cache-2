40|$|In an {{experiment}} mimicking a severe surgical trauma by deliberate renal ischemia, the postoperative outcome in jaundiced rats was studied. Intervention studies were performed with preoperative oral lactulose (to reduce endotoxin toxicity) or preoperative <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage.</b> Compared to control, obstructive jaundice in rats significantly reduced survival time (p less than 0. 001) and enhanced renal impairment (p less than 0. 001) after renal ischemia. Preoperative supportive therapy of jaundiced rats with oral lactulose increased survival time (p less than 0. 01) {{but did not}} reduce deterioration of renal function. Preoperative <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> proved to be superior, with a significant reduction of renal impairment (p less than 0. 001) and an improved survival time (p less than 0. 001). Our experiments provide further evidence that obstructive jaundice increases the complication rate following major surgical procedures. Based on our results in rats, we suggest that in obstructive jaundice preoperative <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> is the supportive therapy of choice. However, if adequate drainage is not possible, oral treatment with lactulose may help reduce postoperative complication...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} {{of the effect of}} {{cholestasis}} on host immunity. This study evaluates lymphocytic responsiveness to PHA and LPS mitogen and to allogeneic F 344 antigen in Sprague-Dawley rats 21 days following bile duct ligation and 31 days following relief of jaundice by <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage.</b> Serum bilirubin level was significantly elevated in the bile duct ligated animals at Day 21 (P less than 0. 001) and thereafter returned to preoperative levels following <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage.</b> Results demonstrate depressed responsiveness to PHA (P less than 0. 001) and allogeneic F 344 antigen in vivo (P less than 0. 04) and in vitro (P less than 0. 02) in bile duct ligated animals as compared to sham, sham pair-fed, and normal control rats. The observed deficiency in responsiveness to T-cell-dependent mitogen and antigen cannot be explained on the basis of complicating nutritional, renal, or infective factors. Subsequent <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> results in some improvement in T-cell responsiveness in the bile duct ligated group although recovery is not complete. B-Lymphocytic response to LPS mitogen is not affected by bile duct ligation. We conclude that cholestasis subsequent to extrahepatic biliary obstruction per se results in impairment of cell-mediated immunity in vivo. This impairment is partly reversible by <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage.</b> In vitro B-cell function {{does not appear to be}} affected in this model.

5|$|Following summer floods of 1997 and the {{prolonged}} flooding of 1999-2000 the Parrett Catchment Project was formed, partly {{funded by the}} European Union Regional Development Fund, by 30 organisations, including British Waterways, Campaign to Protect Rural England, Countryside Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Kings Sedgemoor and Cary Vale <b>Internal</b> <b>Drainage</b> Board (now part of Parrett <b>Internal</b> <b>Drainage</b> Board), Levels and Moors Partnership, National Farmers Union, Sedgemoor, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council, Taunton Deane and Wessex Water. They aim to tackle twelve areas, which, when combined, will make {{a significant contribution to}} reducing the adverse effects of flooding. These include the conversion of arable land, adoption of the Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) approach to controlling rainwater runoff from developed areas, dredging, raising riverbanks and improving pumping facilities. Further studies of the possible beneficial effects of woodland in reducing flooding have also been undertaken.|$|E
5|$|Despite all the improvements, serious {{flooding}} {{occurred in}} 1999 when {{the bank of}} the drain was breached near Pinchbeck.

The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding for the work was not available, and so no work was done at the time.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} has resided {{with a number of}} legal bodies in the past. The first was the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, who were {{established}} by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Statute of Sewers dated 1531. The lower river was also covered by the Rye Harbour Commissioners, after they were established by Act of Parliament in 1731. In 1872, the Board of Conservators for the River Rother was created to manage and protect stocks of fish in the river. As in many parts of Britain, the rights and duties of these various bodies competed and overlapped, and by the early twentieth century, the situation was chaotic. An attempt to resolve the confusion was made in 1930, with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, under which 47 catchment areas were established, and a Catchment Board was then created for each one, with overall responsibility for that area. Thus the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board was created. While the board had overall responsibility, local management of rivers and drainage was under the control of <b>Internal</b> <b>Drainage</b> Boards, and the transition was eased by reconstituting Commissioners of Sewers as <b>Internal</b> <b>Drainage</b> Boards, {{under the terms of the}} act.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: During {{last three}} decades interventional {{radiology}} became most powerfull tool in palliative treatment of patients with malignant biliary stenosis. CASE REPORT: We report a case of 62 -year-old patient with malignant biliary obstruction caused by recidivant tumor of common bile duct remnant with infiltration of previously created hepaticojejunostomia. Biliary decompression was achieved by placement of two self-expanding metallic stents. DISCUSSION: In presented patient, due to previous surgery percutaneous approach was mandatory. Also, considering the unresectability of recidivant lesion and poor prognosis, definitive, preferable <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> was to be achieved. Therefore the placement of metallic self-expanding stent was the therapeutic method of choice. CONCLUSION: The aim of percutaneous minimally invasive radiological interventions is to achieve effective biliary decompression with <b>internal</b> bile <b>drainage</b> if possible...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{influence}} of preoperative <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> and {{various types of}} total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on the healing of a colon anastomosis in 50 jaundiced rats was investigated. Jaundice was induced by division and ligation of the common bile duct. After 5 days a colon anastomosis was made. Ten days thereafter the bursting pressure of the anas-tomosis was measured as an assessment of wound healing. Bursting pressures were significantly lower in jaundiced rats compared with a sham-operated nonjaundiced group. Preoper-ative <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> significantly improved bursting pressure (p < 0. 001) as did preoperative TPN (p < 0. 001).

5|$|Several {{prominent}} {{civil engineer}} considered {{the problems of}} Deeping Fen and the river outfall {{at the end of}} the 1700s. Two reports were produced, one by George Maxwell, and the second by Edward Hare, who had been assisted by William Jessop and John Rennie. They formed the basis for the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains were enlarged through the fen. One of Rennie's recommendations had been to replace the windmills which drove the drainage pumps with a steam pumping station at Pode Hole, but this was not implemented. After reports by Rennie and Thomas Pear in 1815, and by Rennie alone in 1818 and 1820, the provision of steam engines was authorised by an act in 1823. The trustees appointed by the 1801 act continued to manage Deeping Fen until they were replaced in 1939 by the Deeping Fen, Spalding and Pinchbeck <b>Internal</b> <b>Drainage</b> Board, subsequently renamed the Welland & Deepings <b>Internal</b> <b>Drainage</b> Board.|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an <b>internal</b> <b>drainage</b> system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E

5|$|The Environment Agency is the {{navigation}} {{authority for the}} river, which is navigable as far upstream as Crowland, and with very shallow draught to West Deeping Bridge, where further progress is hindered by the derelict lock around the weir. The traditional head of navigation was Wharf Road in Stamford.

5|$|The South Forty-Foot Drain and the Black Sluice pumping station, {{together}} {{with most of}} the side channels which run into the drain are the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Management of the drainage ditches which drain the Fens are the responsibility of the Black Sluice <b>Internal</b> <b>Drainage</b> Board, who maintain 34 pumping stations and three gravity stations in the region. Of these, 21 are situated {{on the banks of the}} Drain, and pump directly into it, while one, the Black Hole Drove pumping station, is constructed over the channel, and acts as a boundary between the part of the Drain managed by the Environment Agency, and that managed by the Drainage Board.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} a {{highland}} carrier, {{as it is}} embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows. Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, and drainage schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water. The pumping station at Westonzoyland was built in 1830, the first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels. It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery, {{and the success of}} the drainage system {{led to the formation of}} <b>Internal</b> <b>drainage</b> boards and the construction of other pumping stations.|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{bile duct}} {{ligation}} (BDL) and <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> on food intake and nutritional status was studied in rats and compared with sham and pair-fed animals.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the total cytochrome P 450 (CYP) content, microsomal mixed-function oxidase (MFO) activity, and expression of mRNAs for various CYP isozymes {{in a simple}} rat model of reversible obstructive jaundice. METHODS: Obstructive jaundice was created in male rats by causing bile duct obstruction with polyester tape. In another group of rats, bile duct obstruction was followed by <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> after releasing the tape. The expression of various CYP isozyme mRNAs was semi-quantitatively assessed by competitive RT-PCR. RESULTS: The total CYP content and microsomal MFO activity showed a significant decrease after biliary obstruction, but returned to respective control levels after biliary drainage. A marked reduction in the expression of CYP 1 A 2, 2 B 1 / 2, 2 C 11, 2 E 1, 3 A 1, and 3 A 2 mRNA was detected during biliary obstruction, while expression increased significantly toward the control level after biliary drainage. Although expression of CYP 4 A 1 mRNA showed no reduction during biliary obstruction, it still increased significantly after biliary drainage. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that not only obstructive jaundice, but also the subsequent <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> may affect regulatory medications of the synthesis of individual CYP isozymes differently...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To verify {{whether the}} ileal {{exclusion}} interferes with {{liver and kidney}} functional changes secondary to extrahepatic cholestasis.

Animals in Group 1 (control) underwent sham laparotomy. The animals of groups 2 and 3 underwent ligation and section of the hepatic duct and were kept in cholestasis for four weeks. Next, they underwent an internal biliary bypass. In Group 3, besides the biliary-enteric bypass, we associated {{the exclusion of the}} last ten centimeters of the terminal ileum and carried out an ileocolic anastomosis. After four weeks of monitoring, blood was collected from all animals of the three groups for liver and kidney biochemical evaluation (albumin, ALT, AST, direct and indirect bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, cGT, creatinine and urea). RESULTS: there were increased values of ALT, AST, direct bilirubin, cGT, creatinine and urea in rats from Group 3 (p < 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effects of cholestatic {{jaundice}} on gut barrier function. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Gut barrier failure occurs in animal models of jaundice. In humans, the presence of endotoxemia indirectly implicates failure of this host defense, but this has not previously been investigated in jaundiced patients. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with extrahepatic obstructive jaundice and 27 nonicteric subjects were studied. Intestinal permeability was measured using the lactulose-mannitol test. Small intestinal morphology and the presence of mucosal immunologic activation were examined in endoscopic biopsies of {{the second part of the}} duodenum. Systemic antiendotoxin core IgG antibodies and serum interleukin- 6 and C-reactive protein were also quantified. Intestinal permeability was remeasured in 9 patients 5 weeks after <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage.</b> RESULTS: The median lactulose-mannitol ratio was significantly increased in the jaundiced patients. This was accompanied by upregulation of HLA-DR expression on enterocytes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue, suggesting immune activation. A significant increase in the acute phase response and circulating antiendotoxin core antibodies was also observed in the jaundiced patients. After <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage,</b> intestinal permeability returned toward normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: A reversible impairment in gut barrier function occurs in patients with cholestatic jaundice. Increased intestinal permeability is associated with local immune cell and enterocyte activation. In view of the role of gut defenses in the modern paradigm of sepsis, these data may directly identify an important underlying mechanism contributing to the high risk of sepsis in jaundiced patients...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the mechanisms of}} Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) action on gut barrier in preoperative and postoperative experimental obstructive jaundice in rats. METHODS: Forty rats were randomly divided into groups of sham-operation, bile duct ligation (BDL), BDL + L. plantarum, BDL + <b>internal</b> biliary <b>drainage</b> (IBD), and BDL + IBD + L. plantarum. Ten days after L. plantarum administration, blood and ileal samples were collected from the rats for morphological examination, and intestinal barrier function, liver function, intestinal oxidative stress and protein kinase C (PKC) activity measurement. The distribution and expression of the PKC and tight junction (TJ) proteins, such as occludin, zonula occludens- 1, claudin- 1, claudin- 4, junction adhesion molecule-A and F-actin, were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: L. plantarum administration substantially restored gut barrier, decreased enterocyte apoptosis, improved intestinal oxidative stress, promoted the activity and expression of protein kinase (BDL vs BDL + L. plantarum, 0. 295 1; 0. 007 vs 0. 349 1; 0. 003, P < 0. 05; BDL + IBD vs BDL + IBD + L. plantarum, 0. 407 1; 0. 046 vs 0. 465 1; 0. 135, P < 0. 05), and particularly enhanced the expression and phosphorylation of TJ proteins in the experimental obstructive jaundice (BDL vs BDL + L. plantarum, 0. 266 1; 0. 118 vs 0. 326 1; 0. 009, P < 0. 05).
