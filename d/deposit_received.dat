40|$|ABSTRACT THE EFFECT OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT: EVIDENCE FROM INDONESIAN PROVINCES DEWANTI CAHYANINGSIH F 0212031 This {{research}} focuses {{to investigate}} the effect of human development on financial development and the moderating effect of local government on the link between human development and financial development. The proxy of human development is Human Development Index (HDI). The financial development has three proxies; the ratio of population to number of bank branches located in province, the ratio of credit released by banks located in province to GDP’s province, and the <b>deposit</b> <b>received</b> by banks located in province to GDP’s province. Local government’s proxy is Indonesia Democracy Index released by BPS. This research uses provincial data of 34 provinces in Indonesia {{during the period of}} 2010 - 2014. This research uses three different types of financial development measurements they are data of all banks (commercial and rural bank), commercial banks, and rural banks. This research use Panel Least Square method estimated using EViews 8. The result is interesting. Generally, it can be concluded that human development has significant and positive correlation to financial development. The moderating effect of local government also is positive and significant.

40|$|Hedge funds {{attempting}} {{to take advantage}} of market-wide liquidity shocks are not limited by opaqueness-caused capital constraints, because banks optimally supply them with backup credit lines. During such shocks, government-protected bank <b>deposits</b> <b>receive</b> inflows that lower a bank’s opportunity cost of lending. The inflows also provide a private signal that helps the bank estimate the timing and magnitude of a shock, thus reducing the information asymmetry constraining hedge funds. The unique combination of exclusive low funding cost and sophisticated information gives banks an advantage in lending to hedge funds...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{mechanisms}} of market discipline in the Mexican deposit market. It tests the hypothesis that low-quality banks pay higher interest rates on <b>deposits,</b> <b>receive</b> fewer <b>deposits,</b> and shift their deposit agreements from long to short term. This hypothesis was assessed with positive evidence in Mexico during the period 1991 – 1996, but was not checked again. This research uses a dynamic panel model and a sample of 37 banks from December 2008 to September 2012 to re-evaluate the market discipline hypothesis. The findings suggest a weak presence of discipline induced by depositors. Principally, market discipline is absent within market sectors.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{functions}} of a bank is to grant loans. Whatever money the bank receives by way of deposits, it lends {{a major part of}} it to its customers by way of loans, advances, cash credit and overdraft. Interest received on such loans and advances is the major source of its income. The banks have a major contribution to the economic development of the country by granting loans to the industrial and agricultural sectors. The banks make loans and advances out of <b>deposits,</b> <b>received</b> from their customers. Most of these deposits are payable on demand. As such the bank owes a greater responsibility to the depositors. Hence he should be extremely careful while granting loans...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intertemporal linear programming model for exploring optimal credit expansion strategies {{of a commercial}} bank {{in the framework of}} dynamic balance sheet management assuming that it is both technically feasible and economically relevant to establish a linear relationship between the bank's credit expansion and the <b>deposits</b> <b>received</b> by the bank induced by the credit expansion process. The inclusion {{of the relationship between the}} credit expansion and the deposits induced thereby in the inter temporal model leads to optimal solutions which run counter to intuitive reasoning. The optimal solution may, e. g., exclude the purchase of investment securities in favor of loans to be granted even in the case where the nominal yield on securities is higher than the yield on loans. The optimal solution may also contain a variable representing the utilization of a source of funds, e. g., funds obtained from the central bank, which implies the payment of a rate of interest on these funds higher than any yield obtained on the bank's portfolio of loans and securities. Since the objective function of the model is the maximization of the difference between the total yield on the securities and loans portfolio and the total interest on the various deposits and other liabilities that the bank obtains, it would be hard to arrive at these results by intuitive reasoning. The explanation for the results obtained is the dynamic relationship between the loans granted and <b>deposits</b> <b>received.</b> This relationship seems to be particularly relevant in Finnish banking due to high market shares for the largest commercial banks. banking, loan management, quantitative budgeting, linear programming...|$|R

6000|$|In {{considering}} the effect {{produced by the}} proceedings of banks in encouraging the excesses of speculation, an immense effect is usually attributed to their issues of notes, but until of late hardly any {{attention was paid to}} the management of their deposits, though nothing is more certain than that their imprudent extensions of credit take place more frequently by means of their deposits than of their issues. Says Mr. Tooke: “Supposing all the <b>deposits</b> <b>received</b> by a banker to be in coin, is he not, just as much as the issuing banker, exposed to the importunity of customers, whom it may be impolitic to refuse, for loans or discounts, or to be tempted by a high interest; and may he not be induced to encroach so much upon his deposits as to leave him, under not improbable circumstances, unable {{to meet the demands of}} his depositors?” ...|$|R

However, this does not occur in the local government banks. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} find out what factors are influencing the decrease of NIM in local government banks. The aim of this study to determine the influence of demand deposits, saving deposits, time <b>deposits,</b> loan <b>received,</b> interbank placement, securities and loans both simultaneously and individually have significant effect on the NIM growth in local government banks. It uses multiple regressions for the analysis. It shows that demand deposits, saving deposits, time <b>deposits,</b> loan <b>received,</b> interbank placement, securities and loans growth simultaneously did not significantly affect the NIM growth in local government banks. Demand deposits, saving deposits, time deposits, interbank placement, loan received and loans growth partially did not affect insignificantly and negatively either.

40|$|The {{development}} of volcanic "ash" studies in New Zealand {{can be traced}} through three broad periods (Jeune 1970). During the late 19 th century the extensive pumice deposits surrounding Lake Taupo received considerable comment (Crawford 1875, Smith 1876 and Cussen 1887). Thomas (1887) recognised a covering of younger andesitic ash from Mts. Tongariro and Ruapehu overlying the pumice from Taupo and in his 1888 report on the eruption of Mt. Tarawera in 1886, Thomas provided a valuable description of the eruption and the deposits resulting from it. Tephra <b>deposits</b> <b>received</b> only cursory attention during the following years until soil surveys initiated {{as part of the}} research effort into bush sickness demonstrated a relationship between incidence of the disease and soil derived from tephra (Aston 1926). Extended soil surveys followed (Granger 1929, 1931, 1937, Taylor 1930, 1933, Grange and Taylor 1931, 1932) during the course of which many important soil forming tephras were named, described and mapped.

Furthermore, most of the building societies have not been operating at appropriate size. We also found that Českomoravská stavební spořitelna, a. s. was the most efficient building society in the Czech Republic according to the both models applied. In order to increase efficiency, we suggest {{reduction in the number of}} external employees and agents or increase of their productivity, more sophisticated products that can outperform the standard services and effective response to changes in the legislature...|$|R
