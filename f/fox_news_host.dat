He engages in these provocations because he is deeply hostile to any coming {{together}} of Muslims and non-Muslims. For him, the fact {{that a majority of the}} British people – Muslim and non-Muslim – oppose the war in Afghanistan is not something to be celebrated, but is something to be feared." [...] Rod Liddle, writing in The Spectator, said: [...] "Anjem Choudray...is one of those thick-as-mince gobby little chancers who could only possibly come from Britain." [...] Conservatives in the United States have also been critical of Choudary. <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Sean Hannity called Choudary [...] "one sick, miserable, evil S.O.B." [...] during a segment on his show discussing the 2011 Egyptian protests.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, {{the video}} for Branch's fourth single [...] "I Am America" [...] was {{released}} on YouTube. Her husband, Michael Branch, wrote the song partly in response to criticism of the Tea Party protests from Democrats, while also drawing on his own difficulties in life. In an interview for Billy Kelly of the Washington Times' Tea Party Report, Branch told how soon after her husband wrote the song he had her quickly learn the lyrics and then recorded her performing the song. She originally felt the song was too confrontational for her, but decided the message was so important that she should record the song. In the music video, footage of Tea Party rallies is interspersed with scenes of Branch singing on a sound stage and kids holding signs containing political messages and scripture. [...] "I Am America" [...] was played on the July 7, 2010, broadcast of Glenn Beck's radio show and a week later <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Bill O'Reilly devoted {{a portion of his}} “Pinheads and Patriots” segment to the song, saying that [...] "for honoring legitimate protest" [...] Branch was a patriot. About 21 days after being uploaded the video had nearly 475,000 views. [...] "I Am America" [...] soon became a popular song with the Tea Party movement and has been described as the movement's anthem. The New York Times described Branch as having a [...] "dynamic presence" [...] on stage when singing the song.|$|E

He owned a video production company in Waltham, Massachusetts, and taught on-air performance at Emerson College in Boston, both until his death. Among his past students are WHDH-TV Channel 7 news anchor Jonathan Hall, <b>Fox</b> 25 morning <b>news</b> <b>host</b> Gene Lavanchy, and Entertainment Tonight correspondent Maria Menounos. He made regular personal appearances, and performed on occasion, including sets at Boston rock clubs in his later years as a special guest. Rex Trailer was also a perennial participant in Natick Massachusetts' annual July 4 parade, in which he rode Goldrush. Trailer’s initial association with the parade ran from 1955 into the early 1980s; Trailer revived the tradition beginning in the early 1990s, continuing it each year until 2012. In 2013, he was named “grand marshal in memoriam” by Natick Friends of the 4th.|$|R
500|$|In 2009, Johnson began {{indicating}} {{interest in}} {{running for president}} in the 2012 election. In the April 20, 2009 edition of The American Conservative magazine, Bill Kauffman told readers to [...] "keep an eye out" [...] for a Johnson presidential campaign in 2012, reporting that Johnson {{had told him that}} [...] "he was keeping his options open for 2012" [...] and that [...] "he may take a shot at the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 as an antiwar, anti-Fed, pro-personal liberties, slash-government-spending candidate—in other words, a Ron Paul libertarian". [...] During a June 24, 2009 appearance on <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> Freedom Watch, <b>host</b> Judge Andrew Napolitano asked Johnson if he would run for president in 2012, to which Johnson responded that {{he thought it would be}} inappropriate to openly express his desires before President Obama is given the opportunity to prove himself, but he followed up that statement by saying [...] "it appears personal freedoms are being shoveled out the window more and more." ...|$|R
40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture the complexity of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode of address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of the "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters of Fox's imagined community, the real power and ideological utility of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode of address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis of how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class. In the second half of the dissertation, I demonstrate the power of this rhetorical approach by showing how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs framed news about the late- 2000 s Recession to fashion a conservative economic agend...|$|R

2500|$|On April 20, 2012, {{a website}} {{operated}} by Barack Obama’s presidential campaign included VanderSloot {{on a list}} of eight major donors to Romney’s campaign whom it described as having [...] "questionable and troubling records on various issues." [...] The site said VanderSloot was [...] "litigious, combative, and a bitter foe of the gay rights movement." [...] VanderSloot made a series of television appearances, in some of which he called for donations to Romney in protest of the list. VanderSloot accused the Obama campaign of targeting him unfairly and said that he went through [...] "living hell" [...] as a result. He told <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Bill O’Reilly that Melaleuca had lost about two hundred customers in the first two weeks after the Obama website's reference to him; Two days later he told the Idaho Statesman that [...] "unbelievable" [...] and [...] "unexpected" [...] national support in the intervening period was turning out to be good for business.|$|E
2500|$|Poplawski was {{a member}} of Stormfront, a white {{supremacist}} website, where he was a frequent visitor and poster. [...] Poplawski had reportedly posted a picture of his tattoo, a [...] "deliberately Americanized version of the iron eagle" [...] to the website, as well as a link to a YouTube video of Congressman Ron Paul discussing with <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Glenn Beck the rumored existence of FEMA-managed concentration camps. [...] Poplawski last logged into Stormfront at 3:32a.m. Saturday, only hours before the shootings. [...] Poplawski also frequently visited and occasionally posted on Alex Jones' Infowars website. One of his frustrations with the site, though, was that it supposedly didn't focus enough on the nefarious roles played by Jews in all these conspiracies. [...] "For being such huge players in the endgame," [...] he observed in a March 29, 2009, posting to Infowars, [...] "too many 'infowarriors' are surprisingly unfamiliar with the Zionists." [...] Among Poplawski's [...] "last few links from MySpace" [...] were a Myers-Briggs personality test, and a psychotherapy chart.|$|E

2500|$|Hours {{after the}} rally finished, Martin Luther King Jr.'s {{personal}} attorney and speechwriter, Clarence B. Jones, {{said he believes}} King {{would not have been}} offended by Beck's rally but [...] "pleased and honored". Jones, a visiting professor at Stanford University, said the Beck rally seemed to be tasteful and did not appear to distort King's message, which included a recommitment to religious values. James Freeman, in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, wrote positively about the rally, remarking that [...] "the day was largely devoted to expressions of gratitude for the sacrifices of U.S. soldiers, for great men of American history like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and for God." [...] He said [...] "you couldn't find a more polite crowd" [...] and remarked that he couldn't find a single piece of trash left on the Mall by attendees. After noting how the crowd refused to boo when Dave Roever gave the closing prayer thanking God for President Obama and members of Congress, Freeman theorized that [...] "between Saturday's crowd in Washington and the tea partiers agitating for limited government, we may be witnessing the rebuilding of the Reagan coalition, the fusion of religious and economic conservatives." [...] <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Bill O'Reilly described it as an [...] "appeal for a return to Judeo-Christian values" [...] and called it [...] "a huge victory for Glenn Beck and Americans who believe that his message of honor and dignity is worthwhile." [...] He also said, [...] "I don't think there's anybody in the country that could have mobilized that many people at this point in time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>host</b> Greg Gutfeld {{injected}} {{himself into}} the Chili Peppers/Patton feud taking shots at the Chili Peppers and Kiedis after Flea posted video of him and Koko the gorilla. Gutfeld said, [...] "As most musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the worst band on the planet. The ape is better than Anthony Kiedis. By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it." [...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I {{received a lot of}} flack from fans all over the world. What I meant to say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [...] the worst band in the universe. I’d like to apologize for that confusion. I want to explain {{that we live in a}} binary universe," [...] he continued. [...] "You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe." [...] Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying [...] "I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all. It's clearly a funny program. It doesn't faze me, not really. I heard that. It's funny. I don't care. They're all welcome to hate us. God bless 'em." ...|$|E
