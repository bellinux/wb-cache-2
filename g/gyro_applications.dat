25|$|Torque can {{be defined}} as the rate of change of angular momentum, {{analogous}} to force. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of neutron stars, the falling cat problem, and precession of tops and <b>gyros.</b> <b>Applications</b> include the gyrocompass, control moment gyroscope, inertial guidance systems, reaction wheels, flying discs or Frisbees and Earth's rotation to name a few. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} gyro {{misalignment}} on the attitude knowledge error (AKE) in a strapdown environment is analyzed. The subject attitude knowledge is defined, and {{the equation of}} motion is derived considering only the initial AKE and the misalignment. These two error sources are shown to be different. The closed-form solution to the equation of motion is presented, and an important theorem concerning the error induced by the initial AKE and misalignment is proven. The observability of misalignment in an ideal update environment where three cases of AKE can be measured simultaneously is examined. The misalignment observability in an infinitesimal field of view line of sight sensor update design is discussed. It is concluded that attitude error in a strapdown <b>gyro</b> <b>application</b> due to <b>gyro</b> misalignment is a conservative function of the attitude only...|$|R

40|$|Double-pass {{forward and}} double-pass {{backward}} erbium-doped super-fluorescent fiber sources(ED-SFSs) were combined in one configuration. A 980 nm laser diode pumped the same erbium-doped fiber from both directions using a coupler {{as a power}} splitter. The double-pass configuration was achieved by coating the fiber end face. Firstly, an optimal fiber length was found to obtain a high stability of output light wavelength with pump power, and then 1530 / 1550 nm wavelength division multiplexing was used for spectrum planarization, which expanded the bandwidth to more than 22 nm. The final step was a test of temperature stability. The {{results show that the}} rate of the central wavelength change kept to below 3. 5 ppm/°C in the range of- 40 to 60 °C and 1 - 2 ppm/°C in the range of 20 - 30 °C. Considering all the three factors of the fiber optic <b>gyro</b> <b>applications,</b> we selected 80 mA as the pump current, in which case the central wavelength temperature instability was calculated as 2. 70 ppm/°C, 3 dB bandwidth 22. 85 nm, spectral flatness 0. 2 dB, output power 5. 17 mW and power efficiency up to 9. 92 %. This experimental result has a significant reference value to the selection of devices and proper design of ED-SFSs for the application of high-precision fiber optic gyroscopes. ? 2011 Chinese Institute of Electronics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{pertains}} to the reduction of measurement errors due to drift in rate gyros used for tracking the position of moving vehicles. In these <b>applications,</b> <b>gyros</b> and odometry are often used to augment GPS when GPS reception is unavailable. Drift in gyros causes the unbounded growth of errors in the estimation of heading, rendering lowcost gyros almost entirely useless in applications that require good accuracy {{for more than just}} a few seconds or minutes. Our proposed method, called “Heuristic Drift Reduction” (HDR), applies a unique closed-loop control system approach to estimate drift in real-time and remove the estimated drift instantaneously from the gyro reading. The paper presents results of experiments, in which a gyro-equipped car was driven hundreds of miles on highways, rural roads, and city streets. HDR reduced the average heading error over all of these drives by one order of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{applications}} are diverse {{in terms of}} the resource requirements, and tend to vary significantly from commercial applications. In order to provide sustained performance, a target high performance computing (HPC) platform must offer a balance between CPU performance to memory, interconnect and I/O subsystems performance. We characterize the system balance requirements for two largescale Office of Science <b>applications,</b> <b>GYRO</b> (fusion simulation) and POP (climate modeling), and develop platformindependent parameterized requirement models. We measure the parallel efficiencies for GYRO and POP on three multiprocessor systems: an SMP cluster (IBM p 690), a shared-memory system (SGI Altix) and a vector supercomputer (Cray X 1). The higher computational intensity and interconnect bandwidth requirements of GYRO result in higher performance efficiencies on the vector platform. At the same time, small message sizes in POP benefit from low MPI latencies of the shared-memory platform. Overall results confirm system balance requirements that are generated by the requirement models. 1...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{execution}} of scientific applications {{requires an understanding}} of how system features impact the performance of the application. Performance models provide significant insight into the performance relationships between an application and the system used for execution. In particular, models can be used to predict the relative performance of different systems used to execute an application. Recently, a significant effort has been devoted to gaining a more detailed understanding of the performance characteristics of a fusion reaction <b>application,</b> <b>GYRO.</b> GYRO is a plasma-physics application used {{to gain a better understanding}} of the interaction of ions and electrons in fusion reactions. In this thesis, we use the well-known Prophesy system to analyze and model the performance of GYRO across various supercomputer platforms. Using processor partitioning, we determine that utilizing the smallest number of processors per node is the most effective processor configuration for executing the application. Further, we explore trends in kernel coupling values across platforms to understand how kernels of GYRO interact.

40|$|The {{control of}} wheeled mobile robots is {{particularly}} challenging {{because of the}} presence of nonholonomic constraints. Modern two-wheeled mobile robot control is further complicated by the presence of one unstable equilibrium point, which requires a continuous stabilization of the intermediate body by means of sensors. In order to simplify the control of these systems, Quasimoro, a novel two-wheeled mobile robot, is proposed. The control of Quasimoro is simplified by means of its mechanical design. The robot is designed for quasiholonomy, a property that simplifies the control of nonoholonomic systems. To further simplify the control, the robot is designed so as to have a stable equilibrium point. A nonholonomic robotic mechanical system that can be rendered quasiholonomic by control is termed, in this thesis, quasiholonomic. This is the case of Quasimoro. This work proposes a model-based design methodology for wheeled mobile robots, intended to decrease the development costs, under which the prototype is built only when the system requirements are fully met. Following this methodology, the proposed robot is then designed and prototyped. The conceptual design of the robot is undertaken by means of a detailed analysis of the most suitable drive systems and their layout. The mathematical model of the robot is formulated in the framework of the Lagrange formalism, by resorting to the concept of holonomy matrix, while the controllability analysis is conducted using modern tools from geometric control. The embodiment design entails the simulation of three virtual prototypes aimed at further simplifying the robot control. To this end, a robot drive system, based on the use of a timing belt transmission and a bicycle wheel, is designed, calibrated and tested. Due to Quasimoro's drive system, the stabilization of the intermediate body, a well-known challenge in two-wheeled mobile robot control, is achieved without the use of additional mechanical stabilizers [...] -such as casters [...] -or of sensors [...] -such as <b>gyros.</b> The intended <b>application</b> of the proposed robot is the augmentation of wheelchair users, a field that tremendously benefits from the cost-effectiveness and control simplification of the system at hand. For purposes of validation, a full-scale proof-of-concept prototype of the robot is realized. Moreover, the robot functionality is demonstrated by means of motion control experiments...|$|R
