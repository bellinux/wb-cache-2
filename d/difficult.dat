In order to apply these results to STCLD, We set up the academic, clumsiness, and behabior areas consist of 40 questionnaires in a tentative plan. In comparison with rate of answering in STCLD, there was a significant difference between Learning <b>Difficulted</b> group and Normal group (t= 8. 22, P< 0. 001). Results support a validity of STCLD, and suggest that the children who showed learning difficulties are in need of special movement activities...|$|R
