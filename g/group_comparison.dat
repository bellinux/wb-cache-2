50|$|When {{there is}} an absence of the {{assumption}} of equivalence, the difference in outcome between the groups that would have occurred regardless creates a form of bias in the estimate of program effects.

5000|$|This type {{of study}} has enabled {{practitioners}} to achieve experimental progress without the overwhelming work of designing a <b>group</b> <b>comparison</b> study. It {{can be very}} effective in confirming causality. This can be achieved in many ways. One {{of the most common}} procedures is the ABA withdrawal experimental design, where the patient problem is measured before a treatment is introduced (baseline) and then measured again during the treatment and finally when the treatment has terminated. If the problem vanished during the treatment it can be established that the treatment was effective. But the N=1 study can also be executed in an AB quasi experimental way; this means that causality cannot be definitively demonstrated. Another variation is non-concurrent experimental design where different points in time are compared with one another. This experimental design also has a problem with causality.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes new {{approaches}} to rank individuals from their <b>group</b> <b>comparison</b> results. Many real-world problems are of this type. For example, ranking players from team comparisons is important in some sports. In machine learning, a closely related application is classification using coding matrices. <b>Group</b> <b>comparison</b> results are usually in two types: binary indicator outcomes (wins/losses) or measured outcomes (scores). For each type of results, we propose new models for estimating individuals ’ abilities, and hence a ranking of individuals. The estimation is carried out by solving convex minimization problems, for which we develop easy and efficient solution procedures. Experiments on real bridge records and multi-class classification demonstrate {{the viability of the}} proposed models.

40|$|The study aims to {{identify}} the pathogenicity of Phytophthora. capsici isolates in major pepper-producing areas in Korea and the inherit genetic pattern of phytophthora blight resistance by inocula. With five kinds of testing materials including ‘Kataguma (Sakata Korea) ’ peppers, a disease-susceptible material, ‘# 308 ’, a phytophthora blight resistance material, ‘CM 334 ’, and their F 1 and F 2, respective isolates of P. capsici obtained from Icheon, Eumseong, Buan, Imsil and Yeongyang regions together with six kinds of peppers’ inoculum including PA- 159 (KACC No. 40482) received from Korean Agricultural Culture Collection were used for inoculation. The disease-susceptible material ‘# 308 ’, the resistant material ‘CM 334 ’ and the non-segregating generation of F 1 represented 4. 94 − 5. 00, 1. 00 − 1. 07, and 1. 01 − 1. 08 phytophthora blight incidence respectively in the <b>group</b> <b>comparison</b> by isolate. This result means that the phytophthora blight resistance was clearly distinguished among testing materials in the <b>group</b> <b>comparison</b> by P. capsici isolate.

Group-level selection is the most extreme form of group competition, where the weaker group ceases to exist, becoming extinct. We implement group-level selection in a controlled laboratory experiment in order to study its impact on human cooperation. The experiment uses variations on the standard linear public goods game. Group-level selection operates through competition for survival: the least successful, lowest-earning groups become extinct, {{in the sense that}} they no longer are able to play the game. Additional control treatments include <b>group</b> <b>comparison</b> without extinction, and extinction of the least successful individuals across groups. We find that group-level extinction produces very high contributions to the provision of the public good, while <b>group</b> <b>comparison</b> alone or individual extinction fail to cause higher contributions.
