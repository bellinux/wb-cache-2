40|$|Background: The {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of diode laser alone and in combination with desensitizing toothpastes in occluding dentinal tubules (both partially occluded and completely occluded tubules) by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Materials and Methods: Fifty human teeth were extracted, cervical cavities were prepared and etched with 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and smear layer was removed to expose the tubules. The teeth were divided into five groups: Group I – Application of NovaMin-formulated toothpaste, Group II – Application of Pro-Argin™-formulated toothpaste, Group III – Application of diode laser in noncontact mode, Group IV – NovaMin-formulated toothpaste followed by laser irradiation, and Group V – Pro-Argin™-formulated toothpaste followed by laser irradiation. After treatment, quantitative analysis of occluded dentinal tubules was done by SEM analysis. Results: The mean values of percentages of total occlusion of dentinal tubules in Groups I, II, III, IV, and V were 92. 73 % ± 1. 38, 90. 67 % ± 1. 86, 96. 57 % ± 0. 64, 97. 3 % ± 0. 68, and 96. 9 % ± 6. 08, respectively.

Before starting with laser therapy, it is important to assess the skin type, the fluence, the pulse duration and the type of laser to be used. Aims: To compare the efficacy and side effects of Diode laser, Neodymium-yttrium aluminum - garnet (Nd: YAG) laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) on 30 female patients of hirsutism. Materials and Methods: Thirty female patients with hirsutism were selected for a randomised controlled study. The patients were divided into three groups of 10 patients each. In <b>group</b> I patients <b>diode</b> laser was used, in group II patients long pulsed Nd: YAG laser was used and in group III, IPL was used. The patients were evaluated and result graded according to a 4 -point scale as excellent, > 75 % reduction; good, 50 - 75 % reduction; fair; 25 - 50 % reduction; and poor, < 25 % reduction in hair density. Results: It was seen that the percentage of hair reduction after two sessions of treatment was maximum (40 %) in the <b>diode</b> laser <b>group,</b> followed by 35 % hair reduction in the Nd: Yag laser group and 10 % hair reduction in the IPL group. The percentage of hair reduction after four sessions of treatment was maximum (64 %) in the <b>diode</b> laser <b>group,</b> followed by 62 % hair reduction in the Nd: Yag laser group and 48 % hair reduction in the IPL group. The percentage of hair reduction after eight sessions of treatment was maximum (92 %) in the <b>diode</b> laser <b>group,</b> followed by 90 % hair reduction in the Nd: YAG group and 70 % hair reduction in the IPL group. Conclusions: To conclude for the Indian skin with dark hairs, the diode laser still stands the test of time. But, since the diode laser has a narrow margin of safety, proper pre and post-procedure cooling is recommended. Although, the side effects of Nd: YAG laser are less as compared to the diode laser, it is less efficacious as compared to the diode laser...|$|R

METHODS: A prospective randomized clinical trial including 62 eyes (50 patients) with untreated, center-involving, clinically significant diabetic macular edema was performed. All patients underwent best-corrected visual acuity determination (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, FAF, optical coherence tomography, microperimetry (macular sensitivity), and fluorescein angiography before and after treatment. Best-corrected visual acuity, optical coherence tomography, microperimetry, and FAF were repeated at 1 -, 3 -, 6 -, 9 -, and 12 -month follow-up examinations. Fluorescein angiography was performed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Before treatment, demographic and macular parameters were not different between the two treatment groups. At 12 months, best-corrected visual acuity remained stable in both groups (P = 0. 41 and P = 0. 82), mean central retinal thickness decreased in both groups (P = 0. 0002 and P < 0. 0001), and mean central 4 degrees and 12 degrees retinal sensitivity increased in the micropulse <b>diode</b> laser <b>group</b> (P = 0. 02 and P = 0. 0075) and decreased in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study group (P = 0. 2 and P = 0. 0026).

Ninety-three patients underwent surgical excision of a benign oral lesion and were followed up for 30 days for pain (0 to 10 visual analogue scale), bleeding, and painkillers’ assumption (yes/no). A blind pathologist evaluated the thermal damage along the cutting margin. Although referred pain was lowest in the BLUE group from day 7 on (p < 0. 05), all patients referred minimum discomfort after surgery. The BLUE group reported minimum bleeding and necessity of sutures (p < 0. 000). The QMR group showed the highest bleeding during surgery (p < 0. 000), while after 14 and 30 days no patient bled.

Results: Both the groups showed a decrease in the pain levels, which was statistically highly significant 1 week post-operatively when compared 24 h post-operatively. There was a statistically highly significant difference in the pain levels between the electrosurgery and the lasers groups after 24 h (P < 0. 001), with the lasers group demonstrating lesser pain and discomfort. Although there was no significant difference between the two groups intraoperatively and 1 week post-operatively on comparison, lesser mean scores were observed for the lasers group. Conclusion: The growing concern for esthetic requires the removal of hyperpigmentated gingival areas to create a confident and pleasant smile, which could be easily attained by using either electrosurgery or lasers. This study concluded that lasers produce lesser pain and discomfort compared with electrosurgery during gingival depigmentation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: To {{investigate}} the ultrastructural changes of dentin irradiated with 980 -nm diode laser under different parameters and {{to observe the}} morphological alterations of odontoblasts and pulp tissue to determine the safety parameters of 980 -nm diode laser {{in the treatment of}} dentin hypersensitivity (DH). Methods: Twenty extracted human third molars were selected to prepare dentin discs. Each dentin disc was divided into four areas and was irradiated by 980 -nm diode laser under different parameters: Group A: control group, 0 J/cm²; Group B: 2 W/CW (continuous mode), 166 J/cm²; Group C: 3 W/CW, 250 J/cm²; and Group D: 4 W/CW, 333 J/cm². Ten additional extracted human third molars were selected to prepare dentin discs. Each dentin disc was divided into two areas and was irradiated by 980 -nm <b>diode</b> laser: <b>Group</b> E: control group, 0 J/cm²; and Group F: 2. 0 W/CW, 166 J/cm². The morphological alterations of the dentin surfaces and odontoblasts were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the morphological alterations of the dental pulp tissue irradiated by laser were observed with an upright microscope. Results: The study demonstrated that dentinal tubules can be entirely blocked after irradiation by 980 -nm diode laser, regardless of the parameter setting. Diode laser with settings of 2. 0 W and 980 -nm sealed exposed dentin tubules effectively, and no significant morphological alterations of the pulp and odontoblasts were observed after irradiation. Conclusions: Irradiation with 980 -nm diode laser could be effective for routine clinical treatment of DH, and 2. 0 W/CW (166 J/cm²) was a suitable energy parameter due to its rapid sealing of the exposed dentin tubules and its safety to the odontoblasts and pulp tissue. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} our recent work at Sandia National Laboratories toward {{engineering}} a physics-based swarm of mobile vehicles for distributed sensing applications. Our {{goal is to}} coordinate a sensor array that optimizes sensor coverage and multivariate signal analysis by implementing artificial intelligence and evolutionary computational techniques. These intelligent control systems integrate both globally operating decision-making systems and locally cooperative information-sharing modes using genetically-trained neural networks. Once trained, neural networks {{have the ability to}} enhance real-time operational responses to dynamical environments, such as obstacle avoidance, responding to prevailing wind patterns, and overcoming other natural obscurants or interferences (jammers). The swarm realizes a collective set of sensor neurons with simple properties incorporating interactions based on basic community rules (potential fields) and complex interconnecting functions based on various neural network architectures, Therefore, the swarm is capable of redundant heterogeneous measurements which furnishes an additional degree of robustness and fault tolerance not afforded by conventional systems, while accomplishing such cognitive tasks as generalization, error correction, pattern recognition, and sensor fission. The robotic platforms could be equipped with specialized sensor devices including transmit/receive dipole antennas, chemical or biological sniffers in combination with recognition analysis tools, communication modulators, and laser <b>diodes.</b> Our <b>group</b> has been studying the collective behavior of an autonomous, multi-agent system applied to emerging threat applications. To accomplish such tasks, research in the fields of robotics, sensor technology, and swarms are being conducted within an integrated program. Mission scenarios under consideration include ground penetrating impulse radar (GPR) for detection of under-ground structures, airborne systems, and plume detection/remediation. We will describe our research in these areas and give a status report on our progress, including simulations and laboratory-based sensor experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple {{automatic}} technique for fault diagnosis in photovoltaic (PV) arrays, {{based on the}} analysis of the an omalies observed in the I-V characteristic. Firstly, the I-V characteristic of the PV array is simulated using Matlab/Simscape tool for different faulty conditions; which is experimentally validated by generating different faults on a PV string installed at the Renewable Energy Laboratory of the University of Jijel (Algeria). Subsequently, we compare the I-V characteristic of the PV string under different faults scenarios, in order to identify the anomalies. Finally, six categories are generated: Normal operation, connection fault, connection fault with shadow effect, partial shadow fault, a group of fault which include shadow effect with faults on bypass diode (open circuit bypass diode, inversed bypass diode, shunted bypass <b>diode),</b> and a <b>group</b> of fault which include: bypass diode fault, cell fault, module fault, and shadow effect with shunted by pass diode fault.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of two types of lasers, the Nd:YAG laser and the 685 -nm diode laser, as dentin desensitizers as well as both the immediate and late therapeutic effects on teeth with gingival recession. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 56 teeth in 14 patients with Miller's class 1 and 2 gingival recession with clinically elicitable dentin hypersensitivity (DH). The patients were divided into two groups: a Nd:YAG-laser-treated group and a 685 -nm <b>diode</b> laser-treated <b>group.</b> DH was assessed by means of an air stimulus, and a visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure DH. The selected teeth in the two groups received laser therapy for three sessions. Teeth subjected to Nd:YAG-laser treatment were irradiated at 1 [*]W and 10 [*]Hz for 60 [*]sec at 1064 [*]nm, and those receiving 685 -nm diode laser treatment were irradiated at 25 [*]mW and 9 [*]Hz for 100 [*]sec. Results: Significant reductions in DH occurred at all time points measured during the three treatment sessions in both treatment groups. Comparing the means of the responses in the three treatment sessions for the two groups revealed that the Nd:YAG laser group had a higher degree of desensitization compared to the other group (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). The immediate and late therapeutic effects of the Nd:YAG laser were more evident than those of the 685 -nm diode laser. Conclusions: Both of these lasers can be used to reduce DH without adverse effects. Desensitization of teeth with gingival recession with the Nd:YAG laser was more effective than with the diode laser. The Nd:YAG laser appears to be a promising new tool for successfully reducing DH...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{survival}} of atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) restorations would be enhanced if near total elimination of cariogenic microorganisms {{could be done}} in the process of cavity cleaning before placing a restoration. Thus, use of disinfecting agents for achieving this goal could herald a new beginning in the field of contemporary dentistry. Aim: To assess and compare the cavity disinfection efficacy of APF gel, Brazilian Propolis, Diode Laser, and 2 % chlorhexidine (CHX). Materials and Methods: The study was a randomized, single blinded, parallel grouped, active controlled trial. Eighty primary molars in 68 children with cavitated dentinal occlusal caries were randomly assigned into four groups (20 teeth each) Group I: APF gel; Group II: Propolis; <b>Group</b> III: <b>Diode</b> Laser, and <b>Group</b> IV: 2 % CHX (control). After cavity preparation using ART procedure, dentinal samples collected before and after disinfection with respective agent of the group. These samples were subjected to microbiological evaluation, for total viable count (TVC) on blood agar, Streptococcus mutans on mutans-sanguis (MS) agar, and Lactobacilli (LB) on Rogosa agar. Results: Intragroup comparison (Wilcoxon signed rank test) showed significant reductions in TVC, MS, and LB counts in all the groups. Pairwise Mann–Whitney test showed APF gel had least bacterial reductions among the agents tested. Conclusion: This study illustrated the need for cavity disinfection.

It {{has been}} {{fabricated}} two <b>groups</b> Cr/n-GaAs Schottky <b>diodes</b> (SDs) by magnetron sputtering technique {{to determine whether}} T 0 anomaly varies in similarly fabricated SDs or not. Firstly, the first <b>group</b> <b>diodes</b> (CrD 1) were inserted into a vacuum chamber to form the Schottky contacts, then the second <b>group</b> <b>diodes</b> (CrD 2) are held in the clean room medium for 3 h before Schottky metal deposition. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the dots of the sample CrD 1 and the dots of the sample CrD 2 were measured in temperature range of 60 - 320 K. The barrier heights increased with increasing temperature in range of 60 K- 160 K, and did not changed in range of 160 - 320 K. Ideality factory values decreased with increasing temperature in range of 60 K- 160 K and changed between 1. 05 - 1. 10 in range of 160 - 320 K. T 0 anomaly values for the dots of the sample CrD 1 were obtained as 13. 9, 11. 20 K and 13. 31 K; and it was obtained the values of 19. 74 and 19. 20 K for the dots of the sample CrD 2. It has been concluded that the T 0 anomaly values for the similarly fabricated diodes almost {{are very close to}} each other within the margins of experimental error. For analyzing effect of thermal annealing, I-V characteristics of one of the first <b>group</b> <b>diodes</b> (CrD 1) has been experimentally investigated in the same temperature range for as-deposited, 200 and 4000 C annealed diodes. The experimental I-V data of the as-deposited and 4000 C annealed diodes obey the traditional thermionic emission (TE) model quite well approximately down to 160 K and 120 K, respectively. The ideality factor and barrier height (BH) values for the 4000 C annealed diode remain unchanged from 320 K down to 120 K, and for the as-deposited diode to 160 K. The departures from ideality at low temperatures have been ascribed to the lateral fluctuations of the barrier height or the presence of the lateral BH inhomogeneity. The BH values of 0. 61 and 0. 74 eV for the as-deposited and 4000 C annealed diodes were obtained at the room temperature, respectively. A Richardson constant value of 9. 83 Acm- 2 K- 2 for the 4000 C annealed Cr/n-GaAs/In Schottky diode is in close agreement with the known value of 8. 16 A/ Acm- 2 K- 2 for n-type GaAs. Furthermore, T 0 anomaly values are 13. 9 and 10. 68 and 5. 35 for the as-deposited and 200 and 4000 C annealed diodes, respectively. Thus, it has been seen that the barrier height homogeneity or the homogeneity of the interface structure increases by 4000 C annealing temperature...|$|R

The study reported here sought to elucidate the benefits and drawbacks of different laser systems {{in the treatment of}} patients with BPH. Methods: The study enrolled 741 patients diagnosed with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH during the period January 2005 to December 2011. The techniques used in the study were photoselective vaporization of the prostate, thulium laser prostatectomy, and diode laser prostatectomy. Patients were assigned to one of three groups according to the type of laser treatment they received. Outcomes were evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life, maximal urinary flow rate, post-voiding residual urine volume, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Results: The baseline characteristics of patients who received diode laser prostatectomy show a significant elevated risk and high American Society of Anesthesiology score (P= 0. 001). Operative time and catheter removal time differed significantly between the three groups (P= 0. 001). No cases were converted to transurethral resection of the prostate intraoperatively due to bleeding (P= 0. 142). Among the three groups, {{there were no significant differences}} in maximal flow rate, lower post-void residual urine, and postoperative PSA level during the entire follow-up period (P< 0. 05). Further, no significant differences in postoperative IPSS, quality of life, or bladder neck contracture (P= 0. 23) were observed. However, a significant difference was observed with regard to prolonged use of Foley catheters and prolonged hospital stay among patients in the <b>diode</b> laser <b>group</b> (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: Laser prostatectomies are effective in dealing with lower urinary tract symptoms. Early subjective functional results (maximal flow rate, IPSS, and post-void residual urine) appeared the same as those obtained following laser prostatectomy. Thus, it appears that lasers are safe and effective as long as the patients are carefully selected for treatment.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{investigate}} using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) the ultrastructural morphological changes of the radicular dentine surface after irradiation with 980 -nm diode laser energy at different parameters and angles of incidence. Background Data: There have been limited reports on the effects of diode laser irradiation at 980 nm on radicular dentin morphology. Materials and Methods: Seventy-two maxillary canines were sectioned and roots were biomechanically prepared using K 3 rotary instruments. The teeth were irrigated with 2 mL of distilled water between files and final irrigation was performed with 10 mL of distilled water. The teeth were then randomly divided into five groups (n = 8 each) according to their <b>diode</b> laser parameters: <b>Group</b> 1 : no irradiation (control); group 2 : 1. 5 W/continuous wave (CW) emission (the manufacturer's parameters); group 3 : 1. 5 W/ 100 Hz; group 4 : 3 W/CW; and group 5 : 3 W/ 100 Hz. Laser energy was applied with helicoid movements (parallel to the canal walls) for 20 sec. Eight additional teeth for each group were endodontically prepared and split longitudinally and irradiation was applied perpendicularly to the root surface.
