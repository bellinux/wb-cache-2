5|$|Dworkin {{later wrote}} that she {{eventually}} {{agreed to help}} smuggle a briefcase of heroin through customs in return for $1,000 and an airplane ticket, thinking that if she was successful she could return home with the ticket and the money, and if caught she would at least escape her ex-husband's abuse by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> The deal for the briefcase fell through, but {{the man who had}} promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and she returned to the United States in 1972.|$|E

She finds Carly and Amber at the airport, who explain that Mark has been using Kate {{as the owner of}} the companies he defrauded from, which would—were his fraud to be discovered—result in her <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> Kate also finds out that Mark has been seeing yet another woman: someone he has met on this trip.

5|$|The Allied {{occupation}} of Japan began soon after. On November 19 the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers issued {{an arrest warrant}} for Matsui on suspicion of war crimes. Matsui was ill with pneumonia {{at the time and}} so was given until March to recover. One of Matsui's final acts before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> was to ask his wife to adopt their longtime maid Hisae as their daughter. He also converted from Shintoism to Buddhism and asked that his wife do the same. On March 6, 1946, he checked himself in to Sugamo Prison.|$|E
5|$|Folkvord {{is the son}} {{of school}} {{principal}} Sverre Folkvord and housewife Eldrid Kjesbu. He finished secondary school earning the examen artium degree in Trondheim and then started studies to become a social worker at the Social School of Trondheim. By 1976 he was the leader of the national Social Agencies Union serving until 1978. In 1982, along with fellow Red Electoral Alliance member Harald Stabell, Folkvord sued Oslo's social-office leading figures, Signe M. Stray Ryssdal and Marit Moe. They accused them of misconduct and of making a false accusation which led to an innocent man <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> These accusations eventually led to a police investigation into the matter. After finding no proof of their accusations, Moe sued Folkvord and Stabell for defamatatory charges made against her, but she abstained from pursuing this in court.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison,</b> but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E

Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline.

Gravano claimed Gotti's defense to consist of Gotti's lawyers portraying Gotti as a peace-loving boss falling all over himself to restrain the kill-crazy Gravano, resulting in a conviction for Gravano and an acquittal for Gotti.|$|E

25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals {{and they have to be}} aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.|$|E
25|$|Portrayed as headstrong, flirty and manipulative, early storylines {{featuring}} Sam {{concentrate on}} her teen elopement {{to the character}} Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). She goes on to feature in storylines about topless modelling, various family crises, relationships, feuds, and a short-lived marriage to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs). Her exit storyline in 2005 {{is the culmination of}} a high-profile storyline that sees the character wrongly imprisoned for Den Watts' (Leslie Grantham) murder. In the on-screen events, Sam is cleared of murder and released, but she flees the country to escape another prison sentence for perverting the course of justice. Her brief return in 2009 sees the character resurrect a relationship with Ricky whilst having an on-off affair with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), being manipulated by her uncle Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) and causing her family to lose a number of their businesses for a second time before finally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> Her return in 2010 and 2016 sees her struggle with motherhood after giving birth to Jack's baby, Ricky (Henri Charles).|$|E

Black was the executive producer for a documentary about Randy Credico entitled Sixty Spins Around the Sun. It calls for the so-called Rockefeller drug laws to be repealed. Black said of it, [...] "They're populating our prisons with people, you know, first time drug offenders—single mothers that {{have a little bit}} of coke end up <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for 20years or something.

After an investigation, a total of five people, including Huston, were convicted, on December 8, 1908, and sentenced to two years in prison for [...] "conspiring with State officials to defraud the State in the erection and furnishing of the Capitol."

50|$|Homer is smugly {{waiting for}} Marge at the ceremony. Marge privately calls Homer, informing him {{she is a}} hostage at a bank robbery. Dwight notices Marge {{on the phone and}} cuts off the call. He then makes a compromise; he will promise to turn himself in as long as Marge {{promises}} to visit him in <b>prison,</b> <b>to</b> which she reluctantly agrees. A nervous Marge returns home. Homer attempts to convince Marge not to visit Dwight in the prison, but Marge wishes to honor her promise and visit him. However, while <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>prison,</b> she makes continuous stops <b>to</b> avoid <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>prison,</b> and misses visiting hours. At the prison, Dwight expectantly waits for Marge. While watching Snake Jailbird chatting with his girlfriend, Gloria, Dwight becomes depressed and then angry, and Marge's guilt begins to get to her while watching a depressing movie about a prisoner who was to be electrocuted. At the same moment, Dwight is breaking out of Springfield Penitentiary (in a parody way of The Shawshank Redemption). He finds Marge's address in a newspaper, and sets out to find her.|$|R
500|$|After this loss, McGovern {{remained}} in the Senate. He was scarred by the enormous defeat, and his wife Eleanor took it even worse; {{during the winter of}} 1972–73, the couple seriously considered moving to England. His allies were replaced in positions of power within the Democratic Party leadership, and the McGoverns did not get publicly introduced at party affairs they attended. On January 20, 1973, a few hours after Richard Nixon was re-inaugurated, McGovern gave a speech at the Oxford Union that talked about the abuses of Nixon's presidency; it brought criticism, including from some Democrats, for being ill-mannered. In order to get past the [...] "bitterness and self-pity" [...] he felt, McGovern forced himself to deal with the defeat humorously before audiences; starting at the March 1973 Gridiron Dinner, he frequently related his campaign misadventures in a self-deprecating fashion, such as saying, [...] "For many years, I wanted to run for the Presidency in the worst possible way – and last year I sure did." [...] Nevertheless, emotions surrounding the loss would remain with McGovern for decades, as it did with some other defeated presidential nominees. Nixon resigned in August 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. McGovern said President Gerald R. Ford's subsequent September 1974 pardon of Nixon was difficult to understand given that Nixon's subordinates were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|E
500|$|Borah {{presented}} his credentials at the Senate {{prior to the}} formal beginning of his first term on March 4, 1907. [...] Until 1933, Congress's regular session began in December, allowing Borah time to participate in two major trials. One of these boosted him to national prominence {{for his role in}} the prosecution of Big Bill Haywood, and the other, with Borah as the defendant, placed him at risk of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> Haywood was tried for conspiracy in the murder of ex-governor Steunenberg, who was killed on December 30, 1905 by a bomb planted on the gate at his home in Caldwell. [...] Borah, who viewed Steunenberg as a father figure, was among the prominent Idahoans who hurried to Caldwell, and who viewed Steunenberg's shattered body and the bloodstained snow. Suspicion quickly fell on a man registered at a local hotel who proved to be Harry Orchard, an explosives expert and assassin. Many labor leaders were embittered against Steunenberg for his actions while in office, and Orchard implicated four of them. [...] The three who could be found, including Haywood, were extradited from Colorado to Idaho in February 1906. As the legal challenges wended through the courts, the case became a campaign issue both for Gooding, who had signed the extradition warrant, and for Borah, who joined the prosecution team and stated that trying the case was more important to him than being sent to the Senate.|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison,</b> aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E
