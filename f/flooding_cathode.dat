40|$|Most of {{the voltage}} losses of proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) {{are due to}} the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction on the cathode and the low oxygen diffusion rate inside the <b>flooded</b> <b>cathode.</b> To simulate the transient <b>flooding</b> in the <b>cathode</b> of a PEMFC, a transient model was developed. This model includes the material conservation of oxygen, vapor, water inside the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and micro-porous layer (MPL), and the electrode kinetics in the cathode catalyst layer (CL). The variation of hydrophobicity of each layer generated a wicking effect that moves water from one layer to the other.

To maintain a good ionic conductivity and performance of a PEM fuel cell, the PEM should be sufficiently hydrated with proper water management. However, <b>cathode</b> <b>flooding</b> resulting from excess water can hinder the transport of reactant and hence decrease the cell performance. For the PEM fuel cell to be commercialized as vehicle or portable applications, the <b>cathode</b> <b>flooding</b> should be minimized during the operation of PEM fuel cell. In this study, a transparent PEM unit fuel cell with an active area of 25 cm 2 was designed and manufactured to allow for the visualization of cathode channel with fuel cell performance characteristics. Two-phase flow due to the electro-chemical reaction of fuel cell was experimentally investigated. The images photographed by CCD camera with cell temperatures (30 – 50 oC) were presented in this study.

High water flow rates through the fuel cell imply extra water feeding at the anode and <b>flooding</b> at the <b>cathode.</b> In the present work, water transport and flooding in the direct methanol fuel cell are investigated through both experimental and modeling analyses and an interpretation of such phenomena is proposed. The model is validated on the experimental data of two different fuel cells in an extensive range of operating conditions.

A 5 cm 2 transparent DMFC has been developed to visualize these phenomena in situ. Two types of membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) based on Nafion ® 112 were used to investigate effects of backing pore structure and wettability on cell polarization characteristics and two-phase flow dynamics. One employed carbon paper backing material and the other carbon cloth. Experiments were performed under conditions of various methanol feed concentrations. The transparent fuel cell was shown to reach a peak power of 93 mW/cm 2 at 0. 3 V, using Toray carbon-paper based MEA under 2 M methanol solution preheated at 85 ◦C. For the hydrophobic carbon paper backing, {{it was observed that}} CO 2 bubbles nucleate at certain locations and form large and discrete bubble slugs in the channel.

40|$|Poor water {{management}} usually leads to {{various degrees of}} flooding in the hydrogen type fuel cell, affecting both the instantaneous performance and the long-term durability of the system adversely. While a lot of fuel cell diagnostic tools exist that could be utilized for the flooding diagnostics, most of these approaches are intrusive, requiring special modification to the fuel cell that affects its integrity, or special equipment (e. g. AC spectrometer) that adds to the complexity and cost of the system, and therefore are {{not considered to be}} a viable solution for the on-board integration of the diagnostic scheme. This paper proposes a model based approach for the fuel cell flooding diagnostics problem, utilizing only the cell current and voltage, and the inlet pressures of the fuel cell as the input signals of the diagnostic scheme.

It can not only provide insights into the development of new PEFC architectures, but also optimize operating conditions for better cell performance. Water balance is critical to the operation of PEFCs, since the membrane needs to attain sufficient water for effective ionic conduction. On the other hand, too much water accumulating in PEFCs would result in mass transport limitations, which is termed as liquid water flooding. In most cases, liquid water flooding occurs in porous diffusion layers and micro gas channels at the same time. This can limit the cell performance and detract the durability of PEFCs. In this talk, I would present the frontiers of numerical modeling of PEFCs with a focus on gas-liquid two-phase transport. In addition, current challenges in numerical modeling of PEFCs will be pointed out, such as validation of two-phase Darcy’s law in gas diffusion layer and interface treatments between adjacent layers (e. g. the interface treatment between gas channel and gas diffusion layer). It also needs to be noted that modeling of liquid water dynamics in gas channels has received much attention due to its importance in water management of PEFCs.

MEAs were prepared by vertically splitting either the anode or cathode carbon cloth into a less hydrophobic part (untreated carbon cloth 'as received') and a more hydrophobic part (carbon cloth impregnated by PTFE dispersion). Both parts were placed side by side to obtain a complete electrode and hot-pressed with a Nation membrane. MEAs with partitioned anode carbon cloth revealed {{no difference between the}} untreated and the hydrophobised part of the cell concerning the fluid and current distribution. The power generation of both parts was almost equal and the cell performance was similar to that of an undivided MEA (110 mW cm(- 2), 300 mA cm(- 2), 70 degrees C). In contrast, MEAs with partitioned cathode carbon cloth showed a better performance for the hydrophobised part, which contributed to about 60 % of the overall power generation. This is explained by facilitated oxygen transport especially in the hydrophobised part of the cathode gas diffusion layer. At an average current density of 300 mA cm- 2, a pronounced <b>flooding</b> of the <b>cathode</b> flow field channels adjacent to the untreated part of GDL led to a further loss of performance {{in this part of the}} cell.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} recently that water <b>flooding</b> in the <b>cathode</b> gas channel has significant effects {{on the characteristics of}} a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. A better understanding of this phenomenon with the aid of an accurate model is necessary for improving the water management and performance of fuel cell. However, this phenomenon is often not considered in the previous one-dimensional models where zero or a constant liquid water saturation level is assumed at the interface between gas diffusion layer and gas channel. In view of this, a one-dimensional fuel cell model that includes the effects of two-phase flow in the gas channel is proposed. The liquid water saturation along the cathode gas channel is estimated by adopting Darcy's law to describe the convective flow of liquid water under various inlet conditions, i. e. air pressure, relative humidity and air stoichiometry. The averaged capillary pressure of gas channel calculated from the liquid water saturation is used as the boundary value at the interface to couple the cathode gas channel model to the membrane electrode assembly model. Through the coupling of the two modeling domains, the water distribution inside the membrane electrode assembly is associated with the inlet conditions. The simulation results, which are verified against experimental data and simulation results from a published computational fluid dynamics model, indicate that the effects of relative humidity and stoichiometry of inlet air are crucial to the overall fuel cell performance. The proposed model gives a more accurate treatment of the water transport in the cathode region, which enables an improved water management through an understanding of the effects of inlet conditions on the fuel cell performance. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Radically different from conventional direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) that use acid proton-exchange membranes and precious metal catalysts, this new DEFC uses alkaline anion-exchange membranes (AEM). We show the performance of AEM DEFCs {{is much better than}} that of PEM DEFCs. To further improve the cell performance, we focus on the understanding of mass transport behaviors through the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and investigating the effect of each MEA component on the cell performance. We show experimentally that the <b>cathode</b> water <b>flooding</b> is still an important issue that affects the cell performance in AEM DEFCs although water is consumed at the cathode. To suppress the <b>cathode</b> water <b>flooding,</b> we investigate the effect of the cathode micro-porous layer on mass transport of water and oxygen and find that the use of a crack-free micro-porous layer can reduce the <b>cathode</b> <b>flooding,</b> hence improve the cell performance. To further understand the water transport through the AEM, we have developed a new method to measure water uptake and transport properties through the AEM. We also investigate the effect of polymer binders in the anode catalyst layer on mass transport of reactants and cell performance. To further enhance the anode mass transport, an integrated anode electrode structure that is composed of a nickel foam layer with thin catalyst films coated onto the skeleton of the foam is proposed and developed, which can significantly improve the cell performance. Finally, with the increased understanding of mass transport phenomena and with the improved MEA design, we show that the peak power density of the AEM DEFC can be as high as 111 mW cm- 2 at 60 ℃...|$|R
40|$|The {{nanoparticles}} of zirconium oxide, sulfated and phosphated zirconia {{were used}} to modify a Nafion membrane {{in order to improve}} its water retention, thermal stability, proton conductivity and methanol permeability {{so that it can be}} used at higher temperatures in fuel cell. These modified Nafion nanocomposite membrane with inorganic nanoparticles have been designed to run at operating temperatures between 120 oC and 140 oC because higher temperature operation reduces the impact of carbon monoxide poisoning, allows attainment of high power density and reduces <b>cathode</b> <b>flooding</b> as water is produced as vapor. The inorganic nanoparticles were incorporated within the Nafion matrix by recast, ion exchange and impregnation methods. The membrane properties were determined by ion exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake, methanol permeability and proton conductivity. The characterization of the inorganic nanoparticles within the nanocomposite membranes was determined by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Brunau-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for structural properties. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) {{were used to}} determine the thermal properties, and the morphological properties were probed by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Pristine ZrO 2, sulfated and phosphated ZrO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized successfully. The particle sizes ranged from 30 nm to 10 nm respectively. The resulted particles were incorporated to a Nafion membrane with good dispersity. The conductivity of the nanocomposite membrane were around 0. 1037 S/cm at 25 oC with a higher water uptake of 42 %. These results were confirmed by the highest IEC value of 1. 42 meg. g- 1 of Nafion/ S-ZrO 2 nanocomposites membrane. These high IEC value may due to the incorporation of superacid S-ZrO 2 nanoparticles which increased the membrane acid property for providing new strong acid site. Chemical EngineeringM. Tech.

40|$|The Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) is a {{promising}} technology as mobile power supply. But methanol is problematic as it permeates through the cell membrane (crossover) and is oxidised with oxygen at the cathode, {{leading to a}} significantly reduced cell voltage and fuel efficiency. Also notable amounts of water pass the membrane. This {{can result in a}} <b>flooding</b> of the <b>cathode</b> leading to reduced cell power or even breakdown of the cell. To understand the internal physico-chemical phenomena, a rigorous dynamic process model is formulated. Key element with respect to mass transport is the membrane. It is a cation exchange polymer with nanopores inside which protons, water and methanol are mobile. In the DMFC the membrane is in contact with a liquid phase (water-methanol solution) on the anode side, and with a gas phase (air) on the cathode side. The common materials (e. g. NAFION by DuPont) exhibit significant differences in their water uptake from liquid and gas phase, and the mass transport parameters show a strong dependence on the water content. Therefore the complex swelling behaviour and the phase equilibria on both sides have to be accounted for. In the presented model mass transport is described using the generalised Maxwell-Stefan equations (dusty fluid model) and an activity model for the mobile components inside the membrane material based on a Flory-Huggins approach. This activity model is also used for the anode side phase equilibrium, whereas for the cathode side phase equilibrium an empirical approach is used based on literature data. Only the binary diffusivities in the membrane and the rate constants of the electrochemical reactions are free parameters, all other model parameters are taken from the literature. Simulation results show good agreement with experimental methanol and water crossover fluxes obtained from a fully automated DMFC miniplant and own DMFCs...|$|R
40|$|Separation of {{different}} electrochemical and ohmic {{contributions to the}} current/voltage U(i) characteristics requires additional experimental techniques like Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The application of EIS is an approach to determine parameters which {{have proved to be}} indispensable for the characterization and development of fuel cell electrodes and electrolyte electrode assemblies. By varying the operating conditions of the fuel cell and by simulation of the measured EIS with an appropriate equivalent circuit, it is possible to split the cell impedance into electrode impedances and electrolyte resistance. Integration in the current density domain of the individual impedance elements enables the calculation of the individual overpotentials in the fuel cell and the determination of the voltage loss fraction. In the presentation examples of EIS applied to different fuel cell systems and operating conditions will be shown: • Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFC) with symmetrical gas supply, with hydrogen and oxygen at different cell potentials • CO poisoning of anode operated with H 2 + 100 ppm CO • Degradation of PEFC during long term test • Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) supplied with hydrogen with different water partial pressures and operated at different temperatures • Oxygen reduction at the cathode of an Alkaline Fuel Cell (AFC) Furthermore, the theory of impedance spectra measured at fuel cells with electrodes changing their state with time e. g. water <b>flooding</b> of the <b>cathode</b> during “dead end” operation mode of the PEFC will be discussed in the presentation. Also first experimental results of locally resolved EIS measured simultaneously on 5 segments of SOFC operated with different fuel gases will be presented and discussed. For the evaluation of the measured impedance spectra a porous electrode model was used. After a brief overview {{of different}} porous electrode models used in literature for fitting experimental data the porous electrode model of Göhr will be discussed in detail. This porous electrode model includes different impedance contributions like impedance of the interface porous layer/pore, interface porous layer/electrolyte, interface porous layer/bulk, impedance of the porous layer and impedance of the pores filled by electrolyte...|$|R
