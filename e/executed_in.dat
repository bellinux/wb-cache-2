50|$|The {{parts of}} the OS {{critical}} to its correct operation <b>execute</b> <b>in</b> kernel mode, while other software (such as generic system software) and all application programs <b>execute</b> <b>in</b> user mode. This fundamental distinction is usually the irrefutable distinction between the operating system and other system software. The {{part of the system}} <b>executing</b> <b>in</b> kernel supervisor state is called the kernel, or nucleus, of the operating system. The kernel operates as trusted software, meaning that when it was designed and implemented, it was intended to implement protection mechanisms that could not be covertly changed through the actions of untrusted software <b>executing</b> <b>in</b> user space. Extensions to the OS <b>execute</b> <b>in</b> user mode, so the OS does not rely on the correctness of those {{parts of the}} system software for correct operation of the OS. Hence, a fundamental design decision for any function to be incorporated into the OS is whether it needs to be implemented in the kernel. If it is implemented in the kernel, it will <b>execute</b> <b>in</b> kernel (supervisor) space, and have access {{to other parts of the}} kernel. It will also be trusted software by the other parts of the kernel. If the function is implemented to <b>execute</b> <b>in</b> user mode, it will have no access to kernel data structures. However, the advantage is that it will normally require very limited effort to invoke the function. While kernel-implemented functions may be easy to implement, the trap mechanism and authentication at the time of the call are usually relatively expensive. The kernel code runs fast, but there is a large performance overhead in the actual call. This is a subtle, but important point.|$|R
50|$|<b>Executing</b> {{instructions}} <b>in</b> parallel (i.e. simultaneously) raises {{problems with}} data dependencies, meaning that some instructions may {{be dependent on}} the results of others, and hence care must be taken to <b>execute</b> <b>in</b> the correct order.|$|R

40|$|This degree project {{describes}} {{a method to}} increase {{the performance of a}} web server by splitting it in two parts, one part <b>executes</b> <b>in</b> ker-nel mode and process requests for static web pages and picture files while requests for dynamic web pages that is generated by executing scripts or contains information from an database is handed over to a web server that <b>executes</b> <b>in</b> user mode.

5|$|Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Allied {{invasion}} of Southern France on 15August 1944.

By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to be <b>executed</b> <b>in</b> August.|$|E
