5|$|The primary {{threats to}} red pandas are direct harvest from the wild, live or dead, {{competition}} with domestic livestock resulting in habitat degradation, and deforestation resulting in habitat loss or fragmentation.

5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>well</b> understood.|$|E
5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>well</b> understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E

5|$|B'alam Nehn (often {{referred}} to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela15 records that he was already ruling Copán by AD504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela16 from Caracol, a site in Belize. The stela dates to AD534, but the text <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>well</b> understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace {{with a number of}} important structures.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{that feature}} {{scandium}} in the oxidation state other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl3 {{is one of}} the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>well</b> understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's career <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>well</b> {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E
