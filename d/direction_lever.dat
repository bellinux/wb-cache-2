Whilst {{this means that the}} signalmen need not communicate with one another before arranging movements into or out of this siding from either end, in practise they would liaise before conducting any unusual movement.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{electrical}} generator (a large dynamo) for the motor permanently {{connected to the}} petrol engine, the early petrol electric controls available were a sprung return throttle pedal (with a hand operated variable latching throttle to set and adjust the idle speed), a brake pedal, a means of steering (wheel, etc) and two usually column mounted levers. One centre off lever operated a three position changeover switch to permit running in either direction, and the other lever operated a wiper across a bank of large high current wire wound resistances which affected the motor and dynamo fields, to give {{the electrical}} effect of gearing. It was (is, {{the author of this}} section has maintained and driven a 1914 TS3 model for over fifteen years as of 2015) very important to set the minimum possible idle speed, or when engaging the direction switch excess load on the system and possible unwanted movement will occur. The resistance [...] "gear" [...] lever is then set to max torque, and then the <b>direction</b> <b>lever</b> set to (say) forward. On releasing the handbrake and pressing the throttle pedal a little the vehicle will glide away smoothly. Giving more throttle and gradually altering the resistance lever will then produce higher speed, with none of the jerking and pauses in acceleration of a gearbox. To stop, the throttle pedal is released, the resistance lever is brought back to [...] "slow speed", the brake applied and as rest is achieved the forward/reverse lever moved to neutral and handbrake applied. There is however NO engine braking available as from a mechanical drive changed into a lower gear, so the system relies totally on the mechanical wheel brakes, which on early chassis applied to the rear axle only.|$|E

40|$|The device {{consists}} of two grab elements, each with a grab jaw section {{and a lever arm}} section. The lever arm sections are charged by a movable power-transmitting element, which is tensioned against the lever arm sections by a tensioner device. An actuator is formed by a piezo adjusting element, which is charged by an electrical control voltage. This lengthens the element in the <b>direction</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm sections, so that it presses against the power-transmitting element, which in turn is driven in the <b>direction</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm sections. This causes the grab jaws to move about joints, and towards each other. ADVANTAGE - Simple to manufacture, modular construction...|$|R
50|$|The {{angle of}} the {{backside}} of the notch is severe (usually 90 degrees or greater {{to the end of}} the lever) so that the lever cannot be pushed up or out of the notch if wheel attempts to turn in the opposite <b>direction.</b> The <b>lever</b> is jammed between the back of the notch and its pivot point, stopping movement in that direction against any force that the materials used can withstand. The wheel has little resistance moving in the direction desired, other than that required to lift or push the lever over the next notch.|$|R

40|$|In two experiments, hungry rats, Rattus norvegicus, {{were present}} in one side of an operant chamber while a conspecific {{demonstrator}} in the adjacent compartment moved a single lever either up or down for a food reward. During a subsequent test session, in which these rats were allowed access to the lever for the first time, all responses were rewarded regardless of their direction. In experiment 1, rats that were prevented from observing the <b>direction</b> of <b>lever</b> movement {{by means of a}} screen showed a reliable demonstrator-consistent response bias, while rats that had observed the <b>direction</b> of <b>lever</b> movement and in addition had access to any odour cues deposited on the lever did not. In experiment 2, each rat observed another rat (the 'viewed' demonstrator) moving a lever either up or down. They were then transferred into the test compartment of a different operant chamber in which another rat (the 'box' demonstrator) had moved the lever {{in the same direction as}} the viewed demonstrator or in the opposite direction. These observer rats showed a reliable preference for their box demonstrator's direction, but responded in the opposite direction to their viewed demonstrator. Taken together, the results of these experiments suggest that directional responding by rats in a vertical movement two-action test is influenced by demonstrator-deposited odour cues in addition to visual experience of a demonstrator's behaviour. Furthermore, while odour-mediated local enhancement gave rise to demonstrator-consistent responding, visual observation of a conspecific appeared to have the reverse effect. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

50|$|The default gearbox layout {{has four}} gears and two groups. The first group however only allows {{the first and}} second gear to be engaged so that the total amount of gears is six; the gearbox lever has a {{six-speed}} H-layout. When shifting from second into third gear, the gearbox automatically switches from the first into the second group. The gearbox lacks a reverse gear, instead, the Unimog has a second gear lever for switching the driving <b>direction.</b> This <b>lever</b> is part of an additional reverse gear unit. When in reverse, due to the gearbox construction, only the first group of the gearbox, that can make use of the first two gears only, can be used. This results in two reverse gears.|$|R

25|$|A force {{applied at}} {{a right angle}} to a lever multiplied by its {{distance}} from the lever's fulcrum (the length of the lever arm) is its torque. A force of three newtons applied two metres from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum.

40|$|Intermediaries are key actors that facilitate, and {{sometimes}} drive, migration {{within and across}} borders. By providing information and extending critical services in many stages of migration and in places of origin, transit and destination, legitimate intermediaries build migrants’ capabilities and expand their range of choice — {{the very essence of}} human development. However their value is, in many cases, overshadowed by the costs they impose on migrants, from charging exorbitant fees to outright abuse of basic human rights. Clearly, there is much room for intervention to shape intermediaries’ operations in more positive <b>directions.</b> Available policy <b>levers</b> are many, from imposing a system of regulation to fostering government-mediated migration. In weighing these policy options, there is rarely a bright line separating legitimate services and reasonable costs on one hand, and exploitative fees or practices on the other. This can be addressed by adopting a framework that recognizes the importance of identifying the nature of scarcity and recognizing how migrants can best overcome the constraints of scarce information, access and employment opportunities. Success will also depend on introducing parallel efforts centered on empowering migrants, monitoring the intermediating industries, building institutional capacity and drafting migration policies that reflect realities on the ground. migration intermediaries, recruitment agencies, regulation, self-regulation, development, migration policy, temporary labor migration...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of different {{states in a}} already existing union or in a new one represents a long-lasting process involving harmonisations on various fields – political, economic, legislative, social, cultural, technological, informational, etc. Besides the {{integration of}} the states and of the different authorities in a common mechanist, the business organizations also have to comply with certain standards and to align to certain procedures. The banking system is not an exception being probably one of the pillars of the economic and financial integration of a state in a union. Banking integration may be considered the process leading to a convergence towards a single market for all products, processes, procedures, standards, transactions from the banking field. All sets of standards, mechanisms and procedures should be observed both by banks, regulation and control bodies, but also by customers. Only in this way one can create the premises for the most favourable banking transactions. The integration of the banking system in a union is determined, conditioned and influenced by a series of factors. Based on the data published by the Bank for International Settlements, the authors carry out a close and pertinent empirical analysis of the banking assets flows between the Eurozone countries in the period 2000 - 2014. The paper also deals with the commitments that the recent economic-financial crisis created on the banking assets flows. The authors resort to regression equations in order to demonstrate the connection between the effects of banking integration and various factors involved (the relative dimension of the country, the significance of the banks in the financial system, the Herfindhal index, the degree of concentration or dispersion of the property on banks, the degree of independence, the tradition of law). In order to measure the level of banking integration of the national bank systems, the indices we used are the degree of openness towards the exterior, the degree of internationalization of the national bank systems in the Eurozone. The results of this research point out a whole series of commitments from a scientific point of view, but also regarding a good practices model which should enhance the synergic integration of the different national banking systems. A part of the outlined conclusions may be oriented towards specific <b>directions</b> and <b>levers</b> in order to modify the national strategyfor the adaptation of a candidate state to the Aquis communautaire...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{that it is possible}} to create laterally differentiated frictional patterning and three-dimensional structures using an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe on the surface of a soft elastic polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The resulting effect of contact mode imaging at low loading forces (< 100 nN), observed in the lateral force mode, revealed a homogeneous pattern on the PDMS surface exhibiting higher friction. With higher loading forces (≪ nN) the effect is non-uniform, resulting in structures with depths on the nanometre scale. The topographic and frictional data revealed stick-slip responses in both the fast (orthogonal to the long axis of the lever) and slow (parallel to the long axis of the <b>lever)</b> <b>directions</b> of probe travel from scanning in a raster pattern. The stick-slip events are manifested in the form of a series of shallow channels spaced evenly apart on the polymer surface. Detailed friction loop analysis acquired during the manipulation process showed that the lateral force changed according to the strength of trapping of the tip with the polymer surface exhibiting significant in-plane deformation due to lateral forces being imposed. An incremental increase in the initial loading force resulted in an increase in in-plane displacement and a greater spacing between the stick lines/channels in the slow-scan direction. A decrease in channel length in the fast-scan direction is also observed as a result of an increase in static friction with normal force, resulting in greater surface deformation and shorter track length for sliding friction. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|All {{members of}} the diverse myosin {{superfamily}} have a highly conserved globular motor domain that contains the actin− and nucleotide−binding sites and produces force and movement 1, 2. The light−chain−binding domain connects the motor domain {{to a variety of}} functionally specialized tail domains and amplifies small structural changes in the motor domain through rotation of a lever arm 3, 4. Myosins move on polarized actin filaments either forwards to the barbed (+) or backwards to the pointed (−) end 5, 6. Here, we describe the engineering of an artificial backwards−moving myosin from three pre−existing molecular building blocks. These blocks are: a forward−moving class I myosin motor domain, a directional inverter formed by a four−helix bundle segment of human guanylate−binding protein− 1 and an artificial lever arm formed by two −actinin repeats. Our results prove that reverse−direction movement of myosins can be achieved simply by rotating the <b>direction</b> of the <b>lever</b> arm 180 °. Most myosins move towards the barbed (+) end of actin filaments, but recent studies have established that at least one member of the family, myosin VI, moves towards the pointed (−) end 5. The structural basis for reverse−direction movement has not been established. Two mechanisms for achieving reversal of myosin motility on the inherently polar actin filament have been suggested. On the basis of direct functional assays, electron microscopy and sequence analysis, Sweeney and co−workers proposed a model whereby reversal is achieved by rotating the lever arm in the opposite direction to conventional myosin lever arm movement 5 (Fig. 1). Ikebe and co−workers, however, measured the motile properties of chimaeric constructs and proposed that the core of the motor domain is the sole determinant of directionality 6...|$|R
40|$|The second {{decade of}} Large Hadron Collider operations, from about 2020 onwards, envisages a {{remarkable}} increase in collider instantaneous luminosity, one {{order of magnitude}} above the project one. This luminosity increase presents several challenges to the LHC experiments. The present tracker of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment must be replaced with a system providing excellent tracking quality at higher luminosities, as well as Tracking Trigger inputs to the existing “Level 0 ” CMS trigger system at the full 40 MHz bunch-crossing rate. The minimal requirements for a Tracking Trigger would be the capability to confirm the presence of high-pT tracks associated with Calorimeter and/or Muon Level 0 triggers. The ability to provide eective isolation criteria may also be required, and would in any case substantially improve the Trigger performance. Maintaining the data rates generated by Tracking Trigger inputs within a manageable bandwidth requires sensor modules able to locally sparsify the data. Measuring at detector module level the track direction in the transverse plane, and hence deriving its transverse momentum, is the most promising solution to provide such a detectorembedded data reduction feature. These so-called “pT-modules” would only transmit to the Level 1 Trigger “stubs”, pairs of correlated hits in two closely separated sensors, derived by tracks with pT above a given threshold. To exemplify, a 2 GeV=c threshold would cut data {{rate of more than}} a factor 10, hence providing a data rate well within the capabilities of present data links. The pT-modules design discussed in this work consists of two, closely spaced segmented silicon sensors, featuring both pattern hit correlation across the module and a single hit position resolution high enough to compute stubs with the required accuracy to resolve track <b>directions</b> despite a <b>lever</b> arm of about only 1 mm. A concept tracker layout, the so-called “Long Barrel”, consisting in an outer tracker completely built out of pT-modules, has been proposed. The Long Barrel Tracker is particularly flexible in simulation studies of Tracking Trigger as it allows for information from several layers of the tracker to be combined in a projective geometry. For this reason, it is meant as a testing ground to compare the performance of dierent designs and configurations. The Long Barrel layout also allows the generation of even more structured trigger objects such as “tracklets”, consisting of pairs of stubs in opportunely paired layers, which can in turn be used as seeds to generate “Level 1 tracks”, including even more stubs. The choice of stacked sensors for pT-modules has been recently strengthened by test beam results obtained with novel prototypes of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors and reported in this thesis. The developement of Tracking Trigger simulations is also presented as a major step towards the design of a realistic trigger-capable tracker upgrade. A particular challenge for the Trigger system is given by leptons produced in many rare processes searched at the LHC. The performance of a Tracking Trigger on final states with leptons will be crucial at very high luminosities and is presented at the and of this document as the natural step forward in the work on the subject...|$|R
