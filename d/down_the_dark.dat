25|$|Learning of the Noldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies {{from his}} {{fortress}} of Angband and attacked Fëanor's encampment in Mithrim. This battle {{was called the}} Battle under the Stars, or Dagor-nuin-Giliath, for the Sun and Moon {{had not yet been}} made. The Noldor managed to win the battle, and destroy Morgoth's armies. Fëanor, still in a great rage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came even within sight of Angband, but was ambushed by a force of Balrogs, with few elves about him. He fought mightily, hewing even after receiving several wounds from Gothmog, captain of the Balrogs. His sons came upon the Balrogs with a great force of elves, and were able to drive them off. However, as Fëanor was being escorted off the battlefield, he knew his wounds were fatal. He cursed Morgoth thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew that his elves, unaided, would never throw <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> towers of Thangorodrim. Nevertheless, he told his sons to keep the oath and to avenge their father. At the moment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to ashes.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an address}} to the nation {{delivered}} from the Oval Office on December 6, 2015, President Obama declared the shooting an act of terrorism, referring to the shooters as having [...] "gone <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> path of radicalization" [...] and embracing a [...] "perverted version of Islam." [...] Obama said that [...] "the threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it" [...] and promised that the United States will [...] "destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us." [...] Obama also outlined the ongoing fight against ISIL (including U.S. airstrikes, financial sanctions, and targeted special operations) and urged Americans to not give in to fear. It was just the third speech from the Oval Office in the seven years of Obama's presidency.|$|E
2500|$|Howling Bells was {{met with}} overall {{positive}} reviews from music critics. It was recognised for its effective combination of elements of pop, country, blues and rock. Niall O'Keeffe of Yahoo! Music noted its depth and range and compared it {{to the music of}} Hope Sandoval. He went on to say, [...] "A debut album couldn't be more sophisticated if it wore a beret and smoked filterless French cigarettes while reading Rimbaud by candlelight." [...] Chris Waugh of ILikeMusic admired Joel's guitar playing, calling it [...] "brilliantly inventive." [...] He also praised the band's ability to write what he called [...] "brooding and killer" [...] verses and choruses. He ended by saying the album was [...] "a truly special debut by a truly special band, and you should let it start seeping into your consciousness now." [...] Richard Hughes of CD Times drew comparisons to My Bloody Valentine, PJ Harvey and a David Lynch movie soundtrack. He warned, [...] "You'll find yourself following their path <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> side of rock 'n roll." ...|$|E
