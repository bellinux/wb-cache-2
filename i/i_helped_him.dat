25|$|<b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him.</b> If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the radar screen. I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this? And I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
500|$|Rindt had met Bernie Ecclestone {{during his}} time at Cooper and the two became friends. Noticing his {{commercial}} talent, Rindt allowed Ecclestone to manage his professional contracts, without ever officially employing him as a manager. Ecclestone said of the relationship: [...] "I was never his manager, we were good friends. <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> with any help he ever needed." [...] After Rindt's accident, it was Ecclestone who carried his bloody helmet back to the pit lane.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight next saw the Colonel in {{the main}} {{dining room of the}} Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the close of his 1915 season. Cody was having breakfast with his wife and McCreight joined them for a chat. McCreight was {{surprised}} at the Colonel’s appearance. He had aged greatly since their last meeting. His hair was a mass of straggling, wispy white and his face was deeply wrinkled. “We talked about Iron Tail's death, and Cody almost wept in his grief. He keenly regretted not receiving my wire, believing as I did that the ailing chief might have recovered among friends at The Wigwam. Tactfully I changed the subject.” “He said that he would go out again for the 1916 season, and hoped to see us at the Wigwam on that roundup. But the old Colonel was about {{at the end of the}} long trail.” [...] McCreight’s last meeting with Buffalo Bill was in 1916. “He went out as promised at the start of the 1916 campaign and I saw him at the end of the last performance. Going to his tent at the rear of the show-grounds, I found him lying on his blankets, with his snowy head resting on his saddle. He was asleep, but roused at once at my greeting. He arose, shook hands, and immediately spoke of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, he said he was going to put a granite stone on the chief's grave, with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento. Cody's voice trembled as he again expressed his great regret at not receiving my telegram that might have saved Iron Tail's life. I was shocked and saddened to observe how feeble he was. <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> to his feet, guided him to his private car and saw him to his berth. I shook hands with him for the last time. Not long after, Buffalo Bill went to his last long sleep.” [...] Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West. Chief Flying Hawk's dear friends Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail had gone to the Sand Hills.|$|E

If I failed to employ in his {{interests}} the short interval of life still left to me, could I doubt (after what I had just read) what the end would be?

6000|$|... "Oh," [...] replied old Mr. Toad, [...] "I'm not afraid. Farmer Brown's boy is {{a friend}} of mine. <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>him</b> in his garden. How to make friends {{is one of the things}} the Great World has taught me." ...|$|R

60|$|The detective {{mounted the}} stairs, and our lamp gleamed upon his shining waterproof. <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> out of it, while Holmes knocked a blaze {{out of the}} logs in the grate.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, {{after you}} came,' said Sophy; 'but I believe <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> to think truth disagreeable. I showed my scorn for his want of boldness, instead of helping him. Think of my having fancied {{he had no}} courage.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'With great {{difficulty}} <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> up a staircase that was but little used, {{and got him}} to the top. Several times he said: [...] "It is of no use; I am wounded to death!" [...] but he still held on.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> in, {{recalled}} {{my address}} with an effort, {{and got in}} also. Something unusual proclaimed itself in my tail-coat pocket, and I felt and discovered a glass ball. With a petulant expression I flung it into the street.|$|E

60|$|He emerged a mottled blue. <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> {{into his}} clothes, {{and he was}} {{fortunate}} enough to find an early cab. The book appeared at Christmas. The critics agreed that the heroine was a delightful creation. Some of them said they would like to have known her.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>him</b> {{accordingly}} as I could and, I may add, {{as far as}} {{the positive}} flutter he had stirred in me suffered. It fitted--it fitted! [...] "If her change is to something other, I suppose then a change back is not quite the exact name for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, father," [...] {{answered}} Dan, promptly.

6000|$|... "Yes. He was mighty {{nervous about}} your coming, and I told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> would <b>help</b> <b>him</b> out. Of course, it didn't worry me none, and so I {{concluded}} I would do it." ...|$|R
