50|$|DETA {{has been}} {{evaluated}} {{for use in}} the Countermine System under development by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, where it would be used to ignite and consume the <b>explosive</b> <b>fill</b> of land mines in beach and surf zones.|$|R
50|$|The {{steel body}} of the grenade has 326 squares pressed into its inside face to produceseparate {{fragments}} when the <b>explosive</b> <b>fill</b> is detonated. The V40 weighed 136 g and was issued primed from the manufacturer. Fuse delay time was four seconds.|$|R
5000|$|An Atomic Weapons Establishment {{is located}} in the parish. Previously a Royal Ordnance <b>Explosives</b> <b>Filling</b> Factory, (see [...] "History" [...] above), it is now known as AWE Burghfield, it is {{responsible}} for the final assembly of Trident mounted nuclear warheads, their in-service maintenance and their eventual decommissioning.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 82 (Mk 82) is an unguided, {{low-drag}} general-purpose bomb, {{part of the}} U.S. Mark 80 series. The <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> {{is usually}} tritonal, though other compositions have sometimes been used.|$|E
50|$|The early 12.5 lb {{shrapnel}} shell at 2500 ft/s caused excessive barrel wear and was unstable in flight. The 1916 16 lb shell at 2000 ft/s proved ballistically superior and was {{better suited to}} a high <b>explosive</b> <b>filling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hei (Type C)This variant has {{a length}} of 15 cm, a {{diameter}} of 10 cm and a weight of 830 grams. The <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> is Picric Acid and has a weight of 690 grams. The color of the sack is yellow.|$|E
50|$|Plan form of {{the final}} layout was greatly {{influenced}} by topography, and the locally contracted architect's ideas. Four <b>explosives</b> <b>filling</b> factories, including that at Banbury, were designed, built and managed by their Managing Directors. Construction of NFFs at Banbury and Perivale were undertaken by the Ministry of Works.|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} which provides predictions for {{the probability of}} initiation of explosion in high <b>explosive</b> <b>filled</b> warheads and in propellant filled rocket motor cases given the impact of compact fragments or of small projectiles. Equations of velocities at which 50 percent of the <b>explosive</b> <b>filled</b> cases will initiate either high or low order are developed for compact fragments, and for projectiles. These data are used to establish the standard deviation of {{the data from the}} 50 percent initiation line. Standard deviation is used to provide predictions of the probability of initiation given the impact velocity and other pertinent parameters using equations and logic which are established in a computer model. This computer model uses fragment material properties and encounter parameters to predict fragment impact initiation, and projectile and casing material properties and encounter parameters to predict projectile impact initiation...|$|R
500|$|A vacuum stable {{chemical}} <b>explosive</b> <b>filled</b> the seismic source mortar ammunition canisters used {{as part of}} the Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments. These explosive experiments investigated the composition of the Lunar mantle during the Apollo Program, analogous to the exploration geophysics practice of mineral prospecting with chemical explosives in [...] "deep seismic sounding" [...] reflection seismology.|$|R
50|$|Ko (Type A)This variant has {{a length}} of 17.3 cm, a {{diameter}} of 11 cm and a weight of 1270 grams. The <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> is RDX/TNA and has a weight of 853 grams. The color of the sack is either white or brown-yellow.|$|E

The <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> {{site was}} {{to the right of}} the railway; the area between the railway and the hedge was the site of ROF Chorley Halt; and {{to the right of the}} hedge is the former Headquarters {{building}} for ROF Chorley.|$|E
5000|$|The National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell, was a World War I United Kingdom Government-owned <b>explosives</b> <b>Filling</b> Factory. Its formal {{title was}} National Filling Factory No. 6. It was located near Chilwell, {{at that time}} a village, in Nottinghamshire {{on the main road}} from Nottingham to Ashby de la Zouch. During the Great War it <b>filled</b> high <b>explosives</b> into some 19 million shells.|$|R
5000|$|A Royal Ordnance <b>Explosives</b> <b>Filling</b> Factory (ROF, no.18). Construction {{began in}} 1940 and {{production}} in 1942, {{and it was}} one of the last six ROFs built during World War II. In 1953 the 'factory was extensively reconstructed for production of missiles. It subsequently became known as [...] "AWE Burghfield", becoming responsible for the final assembly of Trident mounted nuclear warheads, their in-service maintenance and their eventual decommissioning.|$|R
50|$|The AGM-114N Hellfire II, {{first used}} by U.S. forces in 2003 in Iraq, uses a Metal Augmented Charge (MAC) warhead that {{contains}} a thermobaric <b>explosive</b> <b>fill</b> using aluminium powder coated or mixed with PTFE layered between the charge casing and a PBXN-112 explosive mixture. When the PBXN-112 detonates, the aluminium mixture is dispersed and rapidly burns. The resultant sustained high pressure is extremely effective against people and structures.|$|R
5000|$|... 20 mm caliber {{cartridges}} have {{an outside}} bullet diameter and inside barrel diameter of 0.787 in. Projectiles or bullets are typically 75 to(-) 127 mm long. Cartridge cases are typically 75 to(-) 152 mm long. Many {{but not all}} 20 mm rounds have an <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> and detonating fuze.|$|E
5000|$|Composition B, colloquially [...] "Comp B", is an {{explosive}} consisting of castable mixtures of RDX and TNT. It {{is used as}} the main <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> in artillery projectiles, rockets, land mines, hand grenades and various other munitions. [...] It was also used for the explosive lenses in the first implosion-type nuclear weapons developed by the United States.|$|E
5000|$|A {{decision}} was made to remove the bomb's base plate and extract the <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> - Martin was called to carry out this task. After removing the base plate, Martin found that the explosive content was of the solid cast TNT type, which would require steaming at high pressure. The normal process for steaming, by remote control was deemed too risky.|$|E
50|$|Shimose powder (Shimose kayaku) was {{a type of}} <b>explosive</b> shell <b>filling</b> {{developed}} by the Japanese naval engineer Shimose Masachika (1860 - 1911).|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{continuing}} advances of larger caliber guns, greater muzzle velocities, more accurate fire at longer ranges, and more energetic <b>explosive</b> <b>fills</b> of the shells fired demanded drastic improvements in armor protection. Some means {{had to be}} found to integrate armor protection into the total design of the warship (at its inception), and to rationally apply armor protection, to achieve the most efficient use of the hull’s displacement to provide buoyancy to the deadweight of the ship’s armor. [...] "All or nothing" [...] was the design solution.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{produced}} by oxidizing trinitrotoluene (TNT) with a solution of sodium hypochlorite. HNS boasts a higher insensitivity to heat than TNT, and like TNT it is insensitive to impact. When casting TNT, HNS is added at 0.5% to form erratic micro-crystals within the TNT, which prevent cracking. [...] Because of its insensitivity but high explosive properties, HNS is used in space missions. It was the main <b>explosive</b> <b>fill</b> in the seismic source generating mortar ammunition canisters used {{as part of the}} Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea behind}} a gun that could fire spherical {{exploding}} shells but not solid armour-piercing shot was that large projectiles {{capable of carrying}} a large <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> could be fired from comparatively light guns: the 8-inch 68 pounder gun intended to fire solid shot weighed 95 cwt (4,826 kg) compared to the 65 cwt (3,302 kg) of the typical 8-inch shell gun.|$|E
50|$|The PMN-2 mine casing is {{made from}} injection-molded plastic. In general, the color is leaf-green, but {{occasionally}} brown examples may be encountered. The top of the mine has a black rubber X-shaped pressure plate. The filling is an RDX/TNT based explosive that is quite similar to Composition B. As with the PMN-1, the PMN-2 has an unusually large <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> when compared to many other anti-personnel landmines.|$|E
50|$|In {{the army}} industry, Belleville springs are used, for instance, {{in a number}} of landmines e.g. the American M19, M15, M14, M1 and the Swedish Tret-Mi.59. The target (a person or vehicle) exerts {{pressure}} on the belleville spring, causing it to exceed a trigger threshold and flip the adjacent firing pin downwards into a stab detonator, firing both it and the surrounding booster charge and main <b>explosive</b> <b>filling.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{removal from}} service, the silos had {{reusable}} equipment removed by Air Force personnel, and contractors retrieved salvageable metals before destroying the silos with <b>explosives</b> and <b>filling</b> them in. Access to the vacated control centers was blocked off.|$|R
5000|$|Fuzes are {{the devices}} that {{initiate}} an artillery projectile, either to detonate its high <b>explosive</b> (HE) <b>filling</b> or eject its cargo (illuminating flare or smoke canisters being examples). The official military spelling is [...] "fuze". Broadly {{there are four}} main types: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{percentage}} of shell weight {{taken up by}} its <b>explosive</b> <b>fill</b> increased steadily throughout the 20th Century. Less than 10% was usual {{in the first few}} decades; by World War II, leading designs were around 15%. However, British researchers in that war identified 25% as being the optimal design for anti-personnel purposes, based on the recognition that far smaller fragments than hitherto would give a better effect. This guideline was achieved by the 1960s with the 155 mm L15 shell, developed as part of the German-British FH-70 program. The key requirement for increasing the HE content without increasing shell weight was to reduce the thickness of shell walls, which required improvements in high tensile steel.|$|R
50|$|Picratol {{is a high}} {{explosive}} mixture, comprising 52% 'Explosive D' and 48% TNT. It has a detonation velocity of approximately 6,972 metres per second. Picratol has no civilian applications. It was exclusively intended for military use and was especially popular during the Second World War. The basic advantage of Picratol is its insensitivity to shock. As a result, it proved useful as the main <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> in armour-piercing shells and aerial bombs.|$|E
5000|$|The Torpex filling was poured by {{hand into}} {{the base of the}} upturned casing after melting it in [...] "kettles". The final stage of <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> {{required}} that a one-inch layer of pure TNT be poured over the Torpex filling, followed by sealing the base with a 4 in layer of woodmeal-wax composite with three cylindrical recesses fitted with the explosive boosters and into which three chemical time-fuses were inserted when the bomb was finally armed.|$|E
50|$|Pressure of 400 pounds (180 kg) on {{the center}} of the mine or 200 pounds (90 kg) on its edge deforms the {{pressure}} plate compressing a spring, and breaking a shear pin which holds back the spring-loaded striker. Once the striker is released it flips downwards into a percussion cap which fires the adjacent detonator followed by the booster charge and then the main <b>explosive</b> <b>filling</b> of TNT. Most were painted field gray (dark green). From 1943, they were painted dark yellow.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} point-focal {{penetration}} {{led to the}} development of the Vulcan shaped charge system. After initial experiments using the precursor of the Vulcan to inject liquids which reacted hypergolically with the <b>explosive</b> <b>fill</b> of steel cased munitions, Alford realised that a magnesium cone, which was much manageable than the liquids required for hypergolic reaction, formed a jet which ignited as it was formed. This was quickly shown to provide a simple and reliable means of bringing about relatively gentle deflagration of small and large steel cased munitions with only a low probability of causing detonation. Since then a range of projectiles has been developed for the Vulcan for various other applications.|$|R
5000|$|Explosives, such as dynamite, {{can be used}} as crude but {{effective}} sources of seismic energy. For instance, hexanitrostilbene was the main <b>explosive</b> <b>fill</b> in the thumper mortar round canisters used as part of the Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments. Generally, the explosive charges are placed between 20 and 250 ft below ground, in a hole that is drilled with dedicated drilling equipment for this purpose. This type of seismic drilling {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Shot Hole Drilling". A common drill rig used for [...] "Shot Hole Drilling" [...] is the ARDCO C-1000 drill mounted on an ARDCO K 4X4 buggy. These drill rigs often use water or air to assist the drilling.|$|R
5000|$|While this {{technology}} {{does appear to}} provide higher velocities, the main drawback with gaseous or liquid propellants for gun systems is the difficulty in getting uniform and predictable ignition and muzzle velocities. Variance with muzzle velocities affects precision in range, and the further a weapon shoots, the more significant these variances become. If an artillery system cannot maintain uniform and predictable muzzle velocities it will be of no use at longer ranges. Another issue is the survival of projectile payloads at higher accelerations. Fuzes, <b>explosive</b> <b>fill,</b> and guidance systems all must be [...] "hardened" [...] against the significant acceleration loads of conventional artillery to survive and function properly. Higher velocity weapons, like the CLGG, face these engineering challenges as they edge the boundaries of firing accelerations higher.|$|R
