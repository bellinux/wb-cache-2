25|$|Gagool, it appears, {{has already}} sensed what Umbopa soon after reveals: he is Ignosi, the {{rightful}} {{king of the}} Kukuanas. A rebellion breaks out, the Englishmen gaining support for Ignosi {{by taking advantage of}} their foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse to claim that they will black out the moon as proof of Ignosi's claim.

At the end of Game 5, Mutombo memorably grabbed the game-winning rebound and fell to the ground, holding the ball over <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> moment of joy. Mutombo's defensive presence was the key to the upset victory; his total of 31 blocks remains a record for a five-game series.

25|$|The cock {{performs}} {{with his}} wings, alternating wing beats, until he attracts a mate. They {{will go to}} the mating area and he will maintain privacy by driving away all intruders. They graze until their behaviour is synchronized, then the feeding becomes secondary and the process takes on a ritualistic appearance. The cock will then excitedly flap alternate wings again, and start poking on the ground with his bill. He will then violently flap his wings to symbolically clear out a nest in the soil. Then, while the hen runs a circle around him with lowered wings, he will wind <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spiral motion. She will drop to the ground and he will mount for copulation. Common ostriches raised entirely by humans may direct their courtship behaviour not at other ostriches, but toward their human keepers.|$|E
25|$|At Taormina {{they check}} into the San Domenico Palace Hotel where Sandro's {{employer}} Ettore {{and his wife}} Patrizia are preparing for a party. Claudia decides not to attend because she's tired. At the party Sandro checks out the women—recognizing the beautiful aspiring actress Gloria Perkins. Back in the room Claudia is unable to sleep. Noticing that Sandro has not yet returned, she goes downstairs to Patrizia's room to inquire about Sandro. Claudia confesses that she's afraid Anna has returned and that Sandro will return to her. After searching the hotel, Claudia finally discovers Sandro having sex with Gloria Perkins on a couch. Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her onto the hotel terrace where he finds her quietly weeping. Sandro sits down on a bench and says nothing; he too begins to cry. Claudia approaches him, and after hesitating, she places her hand on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gesture of compassion and comfort while {{looking out at the}} snow-covered image of Mount Etna on the horizon.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll be the squaw," [...] cried Mr. May in English, {{breaking}} off and turning round to the company. He perked up <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> odd, parrot-like fashion.

500|$|Nevertheless, Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} care home where Roland lives. When they gently {{ask him about}} the night of the murder, he tells them he had not seen {{anything}} out of the ordinary. He also inadvertently reveals his mathematical prowess by rapidly counting the star designs visible on Scully's blouse; however, his handwriting does not match the fourth sample taken from the whiteboard. The discussion ends when Roland experiences a violent vision and has {{what seems to be a}} fit. Later that night, Roland has another vision in which he sees someone killing Keats. He appears at the lab and murders Keats by submerging <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tank of liquid nitrogen. Keats' frozen body is left to shatter as Roland begins typing at one of the computers.|$|E

Samuel Wells, Montaville Morris and Samuel Black were transported to Fort Hamilton; Morris died at the fort, as did Wells, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> comrade's lap. When informed by the surgeon of his imminent death, Wells requested to speak with Dodge. Wells asked Dodge [...] "if he had behaved like a soldier."

Samuel Black was moved to Fort Defiance, where he lingered for nine days before dying.|$|E

[...] One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, [...] "not yet hanged", offering a $5,000 bounty on <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, [...] "...I must confess {{that the degree of}} their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise." [...] After moving to the U.S., he described the book burnings as a [...] "spontaneous emotional outburst" [...] by those who [...] "shun popular enlightenment," [...] and [...] "more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence." ...|$|E

Chu Twin turns him into an idiot by crushing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> iron <b>head</b> vice.|$|R
500|$|Dewar also {{recorded}} the villagers' {{claims that the}} Ooser {{was brought to the}} door of a [...] in order to scare the local children, and that it was also used to scare adults on some occasions. Knight came across the claim that it was once used to frighten a stable hand, who jumped through a window to escape it, and in doing so [...] "so injured himself that his life was despaired of". Dewar further drew comparisons with the horned masks sometimes worn during Mummers plays. He noted that in a case of a group of Christmas Wassailers at Kingscote, Gloucestershire, a man was [...] "dressed in a sack, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> real bull's face, head and horns complete". Another case highlighted by Dewar was taken from an account provided by G. W. Greening of Dorchester, in which a member of the Bradstock Mummers was dressed as Beelzebub. Given these similarities, Dewar ultimately suggested that the Ooser was [...] "likely enough an off-shoot from the 14th century and later Mummers' plays". The antiquary Frederick Thomas Elworthy expressed the view that the Dorset Ooser was [...] "the probable head" [...] of a hobby horse. The folklorist E. C. Cawte, in his in-depth study of the hobby horse tradition in English folk culture, stated that although both entailed dressing up in an animalistic costume, the Ooser had no clear connection with this tradition.|$|E

60|$|Throwing {{the burden}} before him headlong to the ground, Thorne drew a pistol {{with his left}} hand; and the two shots rung out again, at almost the same instant. Reuben, however, was {{slightly}} the quickest, and this saved his life. His bullet passed through the bush ranger's body, while Thorne's pistol was diverted somewhat from its aim, and the bullet struck Reuben's left shoulder, instead of <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>an</b> instant, he had drawn another pistol.|$|R

Clips of Reznor putting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bucket of water, and an off-screen person using the same bucket to make Reznor wet, were taken by a video camera before filming a performance of the song from Nine Inch Nails as a live band.|$|E
