40|$|Microbeam {{resonant}} {{x-ray scattering}} experiments recently revealed the sequential emergence of electric- field-induced subphases (stable states) with exceptionally large <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> consisting of 12 and 15 smectic layers. We explain {{the emergence of}} the field-induced subphases by the quasimolecular model based on the Emelyanenko-Osipov long-range interlayer interactions (LRILIs) together with our primitive way of understanding the frustration in clinicity using the q E number defined as q E =| [R] ? [L] | / ([R] + [L]); here [R] and [L] refer to the numbers of smectic layers with directors tilted to the right and to the left, respectively, in the <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> of a field-induced subphase. We show that the model actually stabilizes the field-induced subphases with characteristic composite <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> consisting of several blocks, each of which is originally a ferrielectric <b>three-layer</b> <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> stabilized by the LRILIs, but some of which would be modified to become ferroelectric by an applied electric field.

40|$|A magnetotactic bacterium, {{designated}} strain LO- 1, of the Nitrospirae phylum {{was detected}} and concentrated {{from a number}} of freshwater and slightly brackish aquatic environments in southern Nevada. The closest phylogenetic relative to LO- 1 is Candidatus Magnetobacterium bavaricum based on a 91. 2 % identity in their 16 S rRNA gene sequence. Chemical and cell profiles of a microcosm containing water and sediment show that cells of strain LO- 1 are confined to the oxic–anoxic interface and the upper regions of the anaerobic zone which in this case, occurred in the sediment. This microorganism is relatively large, ovoid in morphology and usually biomineralizes three braid-like bundles of multiple chains of bullet-shaped magnetosomes that appeared to be enclosed in a magnetosome membrane. Cells of LO- 1 had an unusual <b>three-layered</b> <b>unit</b> membrane <b>cell</b> wall and contained several types of inclusions, some of which are sulfur-rich. Strain LO- 1 is motile by means of a single bundle of sheathed flagella and exhibits the typical ‘wobbling’ motility and helical swimming (‘flight’) path of the magnetotactic cocci. This study and reports from others suggest that LO- 1 -like organisms are widespread in sediments of freshwater to brackish natural aquatic environments...|$|R

40|$|The {{studies of}} the designs on true-time-delay lines (TTDLs), n-bit digital phase {{shifters}} and wideband switched-line phase shifters using composite right/left-handed transmission-line (CRLH TL) <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> are presented in this thesis. To simplify these designs, a symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> having equal input and output impedance is proposed. In the design of TDDLs, the symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> with higher time-delay efficiency helps achieve a size reduction of 67. 9 %, compared with the TTDL designed using right-handed transmission line (RH TL). The symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> is further modified to a compact CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> to further reduce the size by 58 %. For performances comparison, the TTDLs using the compact CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells,</b> symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> and RH TL are studied using computer simulation and measurement. Results show that the TTDLs using the compact CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> can achieve much longer time delays. The TTDLs designed using CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> have narrow bandwidths because CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> have narrow bandwidths. In this thesis, a wideband <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> obtained by rotating the CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> by 900 is proposed {{in the design of}} TTDLs. Simulation and measurement show that the TTDL using wideband <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> can achieve a time delay about 3 times and 6 times longer than that of the periodic microstrip line (PML) and RH TL, respectively. A 2 -bit, 3 -bit and 6 -bit phase shifters using symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> are designed using computer simulation. In these designs, positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes mounted on the fingers of the CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> are used as switches to control the phase response at the output. Different phase shifts are achieved using different switching states determined by controlling bits. The phase shifters are fabricated and measured. Simulated and measured results agree very well. Power-handling capability is also analyzed using surface-current density on the CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells.</b> Results show that the phase shifters have much higher power-handling capabilities than that of the PIN diodes. A wideband 1800 -switched-line phase shifter using symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> is proposed. The switched-line phase shifter employs a symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> as the reference arm and a RH TL as the delay arm to produce a constant phase shift across a wide frequency band. For comparison, a traditional 1800 -switched-line phase shifter using RH TLs for both reference and delay arms is also designed. To reduce the size, the CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> is realized using lump elements (LEs). Wideband 900 -and 1800 -switched-line phase shifters using LE-CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> are studied and compared with the traditional 900 -and 1800 -switched-line phase shifters. Simulated and measured results show that the proposed designs using symmetrical CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> and LE-CRLH TL <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> have very constant phase shifts with smaller variations compared with the traditional designs. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|In GIS-based {{data-driven}} {{modeling of}} mineral prospectivity, a suitably fine <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> size {{is used for}} spatial representation of known occurrences of mineral deposits of the type sought (D) in a study area (T). However, until now, the <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> size is chosen subjectively. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for objective selection of the most suitable <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> size for data-driven modeling of mineral prospectivity using a raster-based GIS. A set of choices of suitable <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> sizes is first derived via point pattern analysis {{of a set of}} known occurrences of mineral deposits of the type sought. Then, (a) the lower limit of a set of choices of suitable <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> sizes is considered and defined according to the map scales from which spatial data for mineral prospectivity mapping were derived, and (b) the upper limit of the same set of choices of suitable <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> sizes is considered (and revised as necessary) based on knowledge of spatial extents of mineral deposits of the type sought or via analysis of reflexive nearest neighbour points. Finally, it is shown that fractal analysis of spatial contrast between <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> containing D and <b>unit</b> <b>cells</b> not containing D in T provides for objective selection of the most suitable <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> size. In a case study application of the weight-of-evidence method to mineral prospectivity mapping, using the most suitable <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> size, found via the proposed methodology, results in spatial evidence weights and weight uncertainties that are nearly identical to those derived by using the finest (i. e., lower limit) <b>unit</b> <b>cell</b> size.
