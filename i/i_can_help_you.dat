500|$|Elliott {{was known}} as [...] "a coach's AD." [...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty. [...] If not, then that person could leave any time." ...|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> in any way, call me." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there was}} to be a good outcome: soon {{afterwards}} Peter Abeles, head of (then Australian) transport giant TNT, telephoned him and said, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> with a commercial solution to your problem." [...] After that, Wild said, [...] "Bit by bit, with his support, I got a joint venture together. And that's when we did {{the main part of the}} work." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E
