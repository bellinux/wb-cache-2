40|$|Quantification of bed-load {{transport}} in high-gradient mountain streams is important, but {{the field}} data needed to test transport models are scarce {{and difficult to}} obtain. In the present study, we describe the experimental station for monitoring water and sediment fluxes built in 1985 on the Rio Cordon, a small step-pool channel in the eastern Italian Alps. The measuring station consists of an <b>inclined</b> <b>frame</b> that separates fine from coarse sediments (D> 20 mm), which are continuously measured {{by a series of}} ultrasonic sensors fitted above a storage area. The acquired 25 -year dataset, which comprises a high-magnitude/ low-recurrence flood event, has allowed a magnitude-frequency analysis of bed-load volumes to be performed. Results from a combined frequency analysis of peak water discharge and total bed-load volumes are presented. In addition, the integration between the sediment transport dataset and the repeated surveys of sediment sources and of channel changes allowed us to assess the geomorphological effectiveness of different flood events. Despite the importance of the experimental station for making these bed-load observations possible, its maintenance costs are not low and these may have an impact on its future existence. At the same time, improving current instrumentation and future installations with novel technology would make the station an ideal location for calibrating surrogate techniques for sediment transport monitoring...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{study is}} made {{of the effect of}} random wave forces on {{self-supporting}} steel and concrete oil drilling platforms. Various methods of estimating the forces on the structure, and various ways of idealising both the forces and the structure itself, are compared, the- objective being a realistic and safe design. The sea is here represented by a wave amplitude spectrum,from which spectra for the forces on the structure are derived using a linear wave theory, in two ways. Firstly, using the well-known Morison equation, which requires experimental drag and inertia coefficients; and secondly by considering wave diffraction from the structural members. A quantitative comparison {{is made of}} the two methods. Using the diffraction theory, it is possible to guage the effect of sheltering - i. e. the effect on the forces on one member due to the presence of another. The principal structures considered here are idealised as plane framed structures (though the theory is applicable for structures with, say, plate elements also), and in this connection wave forces on <b>inclined</b> <b>frame</b> members are considered. This is particularly useful for steel structures. A comparison is made between the results obtained by evaluating the forces 'consistently' and by 'lumping' them at element nodal points. In addition, a comparison is made of solution methods which ignore certain cross-correlation terms in the equations of motion for the response with one that includes such terms, in an attempt to show that a fuller analysis is no more difficult, and is likely to be safer, than the more approximate methods...|$|E
40|$|Quantification of bedload {{transport}} in high-gradient mountain streams is important, but field data necessary to test transport models are scarce. In the present work, {{we describe the}} experimental station for monitoring water and sediment fluxes built in 1985 on the Rio Cordon (Eastern Italian Alps), a small step-pool channel. The measuring station consists of an <b>inclined</b> <b>frame</b> that separates (at 20 mm truncation) fine and coarse sediments, which are continuously measured for accumulations by two turbidimeters. The 25 -year dataset acquired, which comprises high-magnitude/low-recurrence flood events, has allowed a magnitude-frequency analysis of bedload volumes. Results from a combined frequency analysis of peak water discharge and total bedload volumes based on the 25 events are presented, focusing on discrepancies between recurrence intervals of peak discharge and bedload volume for each event. In addition, the integration between the sediment transport dataset and the repeated surveys of sediment sources and of channel changes has permitted to assess the geomorphic effectiveness of different flood events. The Rio Cordon measuring facilities have provided excellent data and valuable insights into the bedload dynamics of steep streams throughout its 25 years of operation, thanks to the close collaboration between the ARPAV-Veneto Region and the Department Land and Agro-forest Environments (University of Padova). However, the maintenance costs of the station are not trivial and may impact its future "vitality". At the same time, improvement of the present instrumentation and installation of novel technology would make the station an ideal location for calibrating surrogate techniques for sediment transport monitoring...|$|E

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of high gradient mountain streams an important aspect {{is represented by the}} quantification of the bedload transport. Field data necessary to test transport models and better understand sediment transport phenomena result scarce and difficult to obtain. In the present study, we focus the attention on the results obtained by multiple field surveys carried out after the November 2012 event when bedload transport along the Rio Cordon, a small step-pool channel in the eastern Italian Alps, was generated. The stream is characterized by the presence of a station, managed by the Regional Land Safety Department of ARPAV (Regional Agency for Environmental Protection and Prevention of Veneto), for monitoring water and sediment fluxes since 1986. The measuring station consists of an <b>inclined</b> <b>frame</b> that separates fine from coarse sediments (D> 20 mm), which are continuously assessed by a series of ultrasonic sensors fitted above a storage area. After the November 2012 event, a series of field surveys were carried out to identify the source area of the mobilized sediment. The quantification of bedload and fine loads using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner device was then performed, allowing the definition of the volume and grain-size characteristics of the transported sediment. The results have shown that the main source area was represented by lateral small debris flow located just upstream the measuring station. Thanks to the grain-size characterization and the field recognition it was possible to confirm that no morphological changes of the main channel have occurred upstream the sediment sources immission. Therefore, the input of sediment for the stream derives only from lateral debris flow process located near to the catchment output...|$|E

40|$|An <b>inclined</b> point <b>frame</b> {{was used}} to measure leaf area indicies in an alpine tundra Kobresia stand and Deschampsia meadow on Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Measurements were made {{throughout}} the summer of 1971 at vi various heights in the canopy and for each species in the two communities. Maximum leaf area indices of 2. 2 and 2. 0 occurred in the Kobresia and Deschampsia sites, respectively. The Kobresia site was characterized by a single dominant species, Kobresia myosuroides, and a predominance of vegetation within 2. 5 cm of mean ground level. The Deschampsia site had no single dominant species. The region of maximum foliage shifted from the 2. 5 to 5 cm height zone in June to the 5 to 10 cm zone in early August. Phenological observations revealed a greater number of vegetative contacts in the Deschampsia site on all sampling dates. Certain shared species varied in their phenological patterns. It is suggested that differences in the duration of snow cover and surface melt-water {{may be related to the}} variation in phenological patterns in the two sites. In both communities, maximum LAI occurred when flower and fruit production overlapped. Arctic tundra LAI values, measured using similar methods, were less than half the maximum LAI values reached in the alpine communities examined here...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the British Journal of Social Psychology [Wiley Â© The British Psychological Society] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] 10. 1348 / 014466608 X 349496 Theory and research deriving from social identity or self-categorization perspectives often starts out with the presumption that social actors necessarily view societal objects such as nations or states as human categories. However, recent work suggests that this may be only {{one of a number of}} forms that societal representation may take. For example, nations may be understood variously as peoples, places, or institutions. This paper presents findings from a qualitative interview study conducted in England, in which soldiers and civilians talked about nationhood in relation to military service. Analysis indicated that, in this context, speakers were often inclined to use the terms 'Britain', 'nation', and 'country' as references to a political institution as opposed to a category of people. In addition, there were systematic differences between the ways in which the two samples construed their nation in institutional terms. The civilians were inclined to treat military service as a matter of obedience to the dictates of the Government of the day. In contrast, the soldiers were more <b>inclined</b> to <b>frame</b> military service as a matter of loyalty to state as symbolically instantiated in the body of the sovereign. Implications for work adopting a social identity perspective are discussed. Â© 2009 The British Psychological Society...|$|R
30|$|The first {{additional}} block process aims at correcting globally for {{the large}} spatial scale error of reduction, be it of internal or external origin. The internal and external Gauss coefficients are estimated to SH degree 8 in the <b>inclined</b> dipole reference <b>frame</b> {{with a one year}} knot-spacing over the full simulated mission duration. We also scale the measurements by the F 10.7 solar radio flux values in order to account for the dependence of the ionospheric field on the solar activity. The improvement brought by this scaling is rather marginal but reduces the offsets between close satellite encounters. Note that the internal and external Gauss coefficients estimated by the dedicated corrections have little scientific value as they contain numerous sources of magnetic fields. They are not intended to be interpreted but they remain useful for better understanding the origin of the large scale field residuals. There is no major technical limit for this processing block to accept more sophisticated parameterization or improved time resolution. For instance, it could be fine-tuned to absorb most of the remaining large scale magnetic fields in case we lack the explicit models for the main and the magnetospheric fields described above.|$|R
40|$|Improved ranging {{accuracy}} is {{obtained by the}} development of a novel ultrasonic sensor ranging algorithm, unlike the conventional ranging algorithm, which considers the divergence angle and the incidence angle of the ultrasonic sensor synchronously. An ultrasonic sensor scanning method is developed based on this algorithm for the recognition of an inclined plate and to obtain the localization of the ultrasonic sensor relative to the <b>inclined</b> plate reference <b>frame.</b> The ultrasonic sensor scanning method is then leveraged for the omni-directional localization of a mobile robot, where the ultrasonic sensors are installed on a mobile robot and follow the spin of the robot, the inclined plate is recognized and the position and posture of the robot are acquired with respect to the coordinate system of the inclined plate, realizing the localization of the robot. Finally, the localization method is implemented into an omni-directional scanning localization experiment with the independently researched and developed mobile robot. Localization accuracies of up to Â± 3. 33 mm for the front, up to Â± 6. 21 for the lateral and up to Â± 0. 20 Â° for the posture are obtained, verifying the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed localization method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is an {{important}} aspect {{in the design of}} spread footings to understand the behaviour of surrounding soil when footing are subjected to inclined and eccentric loads. The conventional method of footing design require that footing must possess sufficient safety against failure and settlement must be kept within the allowable value. To have a safe design, the bearing pressure on the underlying ground has to be kept within the allowable bearing values and eccentricity must satisfy the criterion of less than 1 / 6 of the footing width (e < B/ 6) so as to avoid tension between the foundation and the soil (Coduto, 2001). Similar condition applies also in case of load having certain inclination with the vertical axis of a footing, conventionally inclination angle, Î± <. This is the reason why footings subjected to large overturning or rotation also require large footing dimensions which sometimes become uneconomical. This paper presents the results of laboratory model tests on behavior of a model footing resting on Ganga sand under eccentric â€“ <b>inclined</b> load(through load <b>frame</b> for application of inclined-eccentric load at a time, developed by Roy and Chattopadhyay, 2011).

40|$|This study {{adopted a}} {{qualitative}} approach to address a range of questions intended to clarify and explain {{the ways in which}} performance management and measurement (PMM) has been used as part of the Kingdom of Thailand's public service reform. The study examines the origins of Thailand's public sector development within the context of wider debates about New Public Management, bureaucracy and post-bureaucracy, and the emergence of HRM. By adopting {{a qualitative approach}}, based on interviews with over 60 managers and employees, it provides a rare insight into the ways in which PMM is experienced by those who are required to implement it and who are subject to it. These insights are especially interesting as they also provide one of the few qualitative studies into Thai organisational practices. In order to evaluate how far the responses to PMM are specific to the public sector, a comparison is made with a private bank in order to control for some of the influence of national culture. The findings suggest that, despite a rhetoric of 'performance', the public sector organisations are finding it difficult to make PMM operate effectively. In particular, it is shown that there is a persistent bureaucratic culture that <b>inclines</b> employees to <b>frame</b> PMM in terms of compliance to hierarchical authority rather than identify with it as a means of improving real performance. This is seen to be associated with challenges to psychological contracts and the established patterns of trust, discretion and power. In contrast, the private sector organisation had managed to establish 'performance' as a substantive feature of its management processes, especially HRM, and had adopted forms of management that appeared closer, in some respects, to ideas of post-bureaucracy...|$|R
