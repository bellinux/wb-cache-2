Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an <b>engine</b> <b>bleed</b> valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
2500|$|Bleed air {{produced}} by gas turbine engines is compressed air that {{is taken from}} the compressor stage of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. In modern airliner engines, two regulator valves (high stage and low stage) turn on and off automatically and are controlled by at least [...] "...two air supply and cabin pressure controllers (ASCPCs) which open and close appropriate valves. <b>Engine</b> <b>bleed</b> air comes from the high stage or low stage engine compressor section. Low stage air is used during high power setting operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low power setting operations." [...] Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, pneumatic actuators, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as [...] "customer bleed air". Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high temperature and high pressure (typical values are 200–250°C and 275 kPa (40 PSI), for regulated bleed air exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).|$|E

The bulletproof front windscreen was 57 mm thick, while 8 mm of armor protected the pilot from behind. The ejection seat was an improvement over the Yak-19, with a longer stroke gun, and leg restraints. Armament was also improved, with three NR-23 cannon, each with 75 rounds.|$|E

Deliveries of production Cheyenne IIIs began on June 30, 1980.

50|$|The air is {{then sent}} through a water separator, {{where the air}} is forced to spiral along its length and {{centrifugal}} forces cause the moisture to be flung through a sieve and toward the outer walls where it is channeled toward a drain and sent overboard. Then, the air usually will pass through a water separator coalescer or the sock. The sock retains the dirt and oil from the <b>engine</b> <b>bleed</b> air to keep the cabin air cleaner. This water removal process prevents ice from forming and clogging the system, and keeps the cockpit and cabin from fogging on ground operation and low altitudes.|$|E

50|$|To provide {{third stage}} restart {{capability}} for the Saturn V, the J-2 gaseous hydrogen start tank was refilled in 60 seconds {{during the previous}} firing after the engine had reached steady-state operation (refill of the gaseous helium tank was not required because the original ground-fill supply was sufficient for three starts). Prior to engine restart, the stage ullage rockets were fired to settle the propellants in the stage propellant tanks, ensuring a liquid head to the turbopump inlets. In addition, the engine propellant bleed valves were opened, the stage recirculation valve was opened, the stage prevalve was closed, and a LOX and LH2 circulation was effected through the <b>engine</b> <b>bleed</b> system for five minutes to condition the engine to the proper temperature to ensure proper engine operation. Engine restart was initiated after the “engine ready” signal was received from the stage. This {{was similar to the}} initial “engine ready”.

40|$|Environmental Control System (ECS) or Air Management System is {{a generic}} term used in {{aircraft}} industry for system and equipment associated with cooling, heating, ventilation, humidity/contaminant control and pressurization within aircraft occupied compartments, cargo compartments and electronic equipment bays.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was unconventional, {{and consisted of}} a long, thin, area ruled fuselage with a large fin and all-moving stabilators in the tail. The single seat cockpit was in the extreme nose and the small-span wing was mounted high on the fuselage. At the ends of each wing were pods that contained two turbojets each. These pods were designed to swivel through an arc of 100° (horizontal to 10° past vertical) to allow for both horizontal and vertical flight. To take off vertically, the pods were rotated to direct the engine's thrust downward, while for horizontal flight the pods were rotated back to the horizontal. The pods were capable of directing thrust slightly forward as well for enhanced landing maneuvers. In addition to the four wing engines, four engines were also mounted in the fuselage - two in the rear directed out of two separate tail ducts, and two directly aft of the cockpit and positioned vertically to aid in VTOL operation, exhausting out of two ventral ducts.
