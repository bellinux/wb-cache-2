5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy <b>gain</b> <b>factor,</b> labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E

Using proportional control alone will always result in an error between the setpoint and the actual process value, because it requires an error to generate the proportional response. If there is no error, there is no corrective response.|$|E
30|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} {{model has been}} used to investigate the modulation properties of InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot laser. The numerical model takes into account <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor.</b> Variation of <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor,</b> does not affect ground state threshold current of the laser but it degrades the photon number and consequently, reduction of output power in the InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot laser is demonstrated. It is shown that increase of the <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor,</b> decrease resonance frequency, relaxation oscillation frequency and modulation bandwidth. Despite <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor</b> limits small-signal response of the quantum dot lasers, the eye diagram of the large-signal modulation of the laser is improved for large values of <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor.</b> As we increase <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor,</b> we realize clear eye opening with small jitter. QD lasers with a high nonlinear <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor</b> have narrow small signal bandwidth, but are capable of large-signal modulation at very high rates.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} design and {{evaluation}} of pressure-based interactive control of 3 D navigation precision. Specifically, we examine the control of <b>gain</b> <b>factors</b> in tangible 3 D interactions using locally-coupled mobile devices. By focusing on pressure as a separate input channel we can adjust <b>gain</b> <b>factors</b> independently from other input modalities used in 3 D navigation, in particular for the exploration of 3 D visualizations. We present two experiments. First, we determined that people strongly preferred higher pressures to be mapped to higher <b>gain</b> <b>factors.</b> Using this mapping, we compared pressure with rate control, velocity control, and slider-based control in a second study. Our results show that pressure-based gain control allows people {{to be more precise}} in {{the same amount of time}} compared to established input modalities. Pressure-based control was also clearly preferred by our participants. In summary, we demonstrate that pressure facilitates effective and efficient precision control for mobile 3 D navigation...|$|R

30|$|Note {{that the}} relays in these {{networks}} {{are usually not}} able to decode all data streams due to {{the large amount of}} inter-user interference. Instead, they assist the communication by simply forwarding scaled and rotated versions of their received signals, which corresponds to the multiplication with complex-valued <b>gain</b> <b>factors.</b> We refer to this type of forwarding protocol as multiuser AF relaying (e.g., [6]). The relay gains are chosen such that all signals add up coherently at the destination antennas. Global channel knowledge, that is, knowledge of all first-hop and second-hop channel coefficients, is usually required to calculate the <b>gain</b> <b>factors</b> accordingly. It is important to stress that information about the equivalent two-hop (source-relay-destination) channels (treated e.g., in [10 – 12]) is generally not enough to explicitly compute the relay gains. A gradient-based iterative scheme is required to find the <b>gain</b> <b>factors</b> in this case (e.g., [13]). Examples of papers discussing coherent cooperative gain allocation schemes, where the relay gains are computed from instantaneous, global CSI are [14 – 18].|$|R
30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor</b> on the modulation response of InGaAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dot laser based on rate equations. For different <b>gain</b> compression <b>factors</b> the output power-current characteristics, light emissions of quantum dot laser have been simulated and effect of <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor</b> changes on quantum dot laser is illustrated. Also, small and large-signal response of quantum dot lasers is studied {{and the impact of}} the <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor</b> is presented. It explains that increase of <b>gain</b> compression <b>factor,</b> decreases small-signal modulation characteristics, nevertheless, improves large-signal response of quantum dot lasers. It helps to generate better laser signal quality, higher eye and smaller jitter. The large-signal behavior of a laser diode determines its capability for digital data transfer. The modulation speed of quantum dot lasers is of specific importance if such lasers are considered for optical communication systems.|$|R
