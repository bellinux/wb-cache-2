500|$|After {{defeating}} the Continental Army at the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, British Admiral Richard Howe mistakenly assumed a strategic advantage {{to be at}} hand, and requested the Second Continental Congress send representatives {{in an attempt to}} negotiate peace. A delegation, including Adams and Benjamin Franklin, met with Howe at the Staten Island Peace Conference on September 11. Howe's authority was premised on the Colonists' submission, so no common ground was to be found. When Lord Howe unhappily stated he could view the American delegates only as British subjects, Adams replied, [...] "Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, ...except that of a British subject." [...] Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority. Being quite unimpressed with General Howe, and also after payments to colonial volunteers were increased, Adams in September 1776 said about the war, [...] "We shall do well enough." [...] Indeed, <b>if</b> <b>Washington</b> got his men, the British would be [...] "ruined".|$|E
500|$|The next day, July 13, Howe {{attempted}} to open {{negotiations with the}} Americans.

[...] Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who had hurried to the waterfront on Washington's orders, accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no. Reed told Brown that {{there was no one in}} the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address [...] "George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.", but it was again declined. The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask <b>if</b> <b>Washington</b> would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20. Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons, but Washington said, [...] "Those who have committed no fault want no pardon." [...] Patterson departed soon after. Washington's performance during the meeting was praised in parts of the colonies.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (a {{think tank}} founded by [...] "a {{small group of}} visionary Americans {{committed}} to advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East") argued that the U.S.-Israel relationship is [...] "A Strategic Asset for the United States." [...] In discussing their report, Walter B. Slocombe said that while in the popular imagination, the U.S.-Israel relationship is only good for Israel, Israel provides enormous assistance to the United States, including military expertise which has saved American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Robert D. Blackwill countered {{the claim that the}} U.S.-Israel relationship significantly damages the relationship between the United States and the Arab world. [...] He asked rhetorically: [...] "Would Saudi Arabia's policies toward the United States be markedly different in practice <b>if</b> <b>Washington</b> entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue during which the bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel went into steep, systemic decline? In that instance, would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce Iran into freezing its nuclear weapons program? Would it regard U.S. policy toward Afghanistan any less critically? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it be more inclined to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? Walt [...] and I judge the answer to all these questions [...] 'No.'" [...] When asked how this report could so flatly contradict the Walt and Mearsheimer thesis, Slocombe responded, [...] "There is so much error in the world," [...] and added, [...] "I think {{it would be interesting to}} ask them whether they make the same contrary argument about the other countries to whom we also provide something like this kind of support.

[...] "From all {{accounts}} I can collect," [...] says he, [...] "it appears very clear that this was a very ill-concerted, or a very ill-executed plan, perhaps both; but it seems to be generally acknowledged that Major Grant exceeded his orders, and that no disposition was made for engaging." ...|$|E

The State House, however, appealed to his imagination very strongly as he walked up its unfinished lawn, amid the heaps of huge limestone blocks, his eyes upon the looming façade of the west front. He walked the echoing rotunda with a timid air; and the beautiful soaring vault was so majestic in his eyes, he wondered <b>if</b> <b>Washington</b> could be finer.

The people, he thought, were with him, <b>if</b> <b>Washington</b> was not, and he believed the latter would not dare to risk his popularity in thwarting their enthusiasm.

60|$|Hamilton {{was equally}} strenuous with Jefferson in urging upon Washington {{the policy of}} a re-election, as it {{regarded}} the public good, and wrote to him fully on the subject. It was the opinion of every one, he alleged, {{with whom he had}} conversed, that the affairs of the national government were not yet firmly established; that its enemies, generally speaking, were as inveterate as ever; that their enmity had been sharpened by its success and all the resentments which flow from disappointed predictions and mortified vanity; that a general and strenuous effort was making in every State to place the administration of it in the hands of its enemies, as if they were its safest guardians; that the period of the next House of Representatives was likely to prove the crisis of its national character; that <b>if</b> <b>Washington</b> continued in office, nothing materially mischievous was to be apprehended; but, if he should quit, much was to be dreaded.|$|E
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>Washington</b> was chagrined by {{the signal}} failure of this expedition, he was cheered by the better fortune of one set on foot {{about the same}} time, under his own eye, by his young friend, Major Henry Lee of the Virginia dragoons.

The coup de main at Stony Point had piqued his emulation. In the course of his reconnoitring, and by means of spies, he had discovered that the British post at Paulus Hook, immediately opposite to New York, was very negligently guarded. Paulus Hook is a long low point of the Jersey shore, stretching into the Hudson, and connected to the main land by a sandy isthmus. A fort had been erected on it, and garrisoned with four or five hundred men, under the command of Major Sutherland. It was a strong position. A creek, fordable only in two places, rendered the hook difficult of access. Within this, a deep trench had been cut across the isthmus, traversed by a drawbridge with a barred gate; and still within this was a double row of abatis, extending into the water. Confident in the strength of his position, and its distance from any American force, Major Sutherland had become remiss in his military precautions. All this had been ascertained by Major Lee; and he now proposed the daring project of surprising the fort at night, and thus striking an insulting blow [...] "within cannon shot of New York." [...] Washington was disposed to favor the adventurous schemes of this young officer.|$|E
