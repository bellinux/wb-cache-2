40|$|Binary {{cohesive}} interparticle {{forces are}} often {{used to describe the}} aggregative behaviour of particles in gas fluidization applications of fine powders and, sometime, to explain other phenomena in fluidization such as the delayed bubbling in aeratable powders.

Rumpf and Molerus suggest some approaches to relate interparticle cohesive forces with bulk properties.

Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this study come from a large-scale field survey conducted in six Chinese provinces. Based on the collected survey data, econometric model on the determinants <b>of</b> domestic <b>solid</b> waste <b>discharge</b> was constructed and used for analysis. Findings - Results from the study show that the per capita daily <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> rural domestic <b>solid</b> waste was close to 1 kg in 2010, slightly less than the urban level of 1. 2 kg. Results from descriptive statistical analysis and econometric estimation indicate that by implementing selected policy measures, the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> waste can be significantly reduced. In addition, the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>solid</b> waste is also closely related with local socio-economic development.

40|$|The {{steady-state}} analysis {{presented in this}} report provides a basis for assessment of dissolved oxygen in the New York Bight, particularly in the apex area. The analysis indicates that the discharge of carbonaceous and nitrogenous wastes does not materially affect the dissolved oxygen levels through bacterial oxidation. Furthermore, the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>solids</b> (sludge disposal, dredge spoils and construction debrisj do not influence these concentrations on a bight-wide scale. The localized sludge disposal area is evidently affected in this regard, but this area is restricted to a relatively limited extent. On the other hand, the depression of dissolved oxygen, particularly in the hypolimetic waters, is affected by phytoplankton respiration and decay and the vertical transport structure. It is probable that the discharge of wastewater from the treatment plants and urban runoff has some effect on the growth of phytoplankton and the subsequent decay tbrough the inorganic nutrient route. The degree to which water quality conditions are affected by these inputs may be quantified by the development and validation of a model defining these kinetic interactions. The analysis, developed in this second phase, will be extended to incorporate the kinetic routes, relating the growth and decay of the phytoplankton to the nutrient concentrations resulting from these wastewater inputs. Thus, the effect; of the discharges will be defined, providing a basis for areawide water quality planning, {{particularly with respect to}} the relative influence of the point sources from treatment plants and the distributed sources from urban runoff by contrast to the effects of other inputs such as the disposal practices and atmospheric inputs. The present analysis is directed to the definition of a transport structure in accordance with the original contract to provide the Brookhaven investigators with a reasonable transport field for summer conditions. The transport equations included advective and dispersive terms in a multi [...] segmented horizontal system with two vertical layers. The advective terms were developed by a minimum energy principle, which yield the general observed flow pattern in the Bight. The overall transport field also included consistent values of the various disperation coefficinents. It is recognized that advective-dispersive models of this nature do not necessarily result in a unique solution for the transport. However, its validity to represent average summer conditions is demonstrated by its ability to reproduce the salinity distribution for the two years. The analysis further indicates that the dissolved oxygen concentration in the hypolimnetic waters is particularly sensitive to the respiration and decay rates of the phytoplankton and the vertical dispersion coefficients. Relatively small changes of these paremeters, within the range of measured values, cases significant changes in the dissolved oxygen levels. Thus, from both a transport and kinetic viewpoint, the present analysis reasonably reproduces observed water quality conditions and permits assussment of the effect of wastewater inputs. In view of the potential significance of these aischarges on dissolved oxygen and other water quality parameters this analysis had indicated the analytic direction on which to proceed and provide a valid basis for the more definitive time variable analysis...|$|E

This is in part due to inadequate municipal waste infrastructure and services which has caused those living along the river to rely upon it for waste disposal. However, there has been little research to understand the prevalence of household waste along the river. Our aim is to develop a methodology that deploys a low cost sensor to identify point source <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> waste using image classification methods.

To this end, this thesis presents a programme of theoretical and computational analyses which investigate the effects of a very wide range <b>of</b> different <b>discharge</b> flow patterns from silos, including both concentric and eccentric flows. The critical effects of changes of flow channel geometry, silo aspect ratio, changes of plate thickness and geometric and material nonlinearity are explored in detail. The codified procedures and pressure distributions for concentric and eccentric <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the EN 1991 - 4 (2007) European Standard are analysed first on a number of example silos custom-designed according to EN 1993 - 1 - 6 (2007) and EN 1993 - 4 - 1 (2007), followed by the development and investigation of a more complete mixed flow pressure theory. The computational analyses presented in this thesis are thought to be the first of their kind...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} modern technological processing lines MSW incinerators. Describe individual objects and their links with the principle of thermal combustion. Processes described in the process line will be: waste reception, storage and waste materials, waste pretreatment, loading of waste into the process, thermal treatment of waste, energy utilization and conversion, gas cleaning, disposal of residues from flue gas cleaning, gas discharge, monitoring and control emissions, cleaning and inspection of wastewater treatment and disposal of ash (kiln ash), <b>discharge</b> (disposal) <b>of</b> <b>solid</b> residues. In {{the second part of}} this database will be set up incinerators occurring in Europe with basic information (address, website, kiln type, number of lines, the amount of waste incinerated, etc.). The developed database will be created graphs for better clarity and comparison. The database will be accompanied by the emission requirements of individual countries according to the applicable domestic and European legislation...|$|R
50|$|Because raceway {{aquaculture}} operations <b>discharge</b> {{large volumes}} <b>of</b> water, the concentration <b>of</b> <b>discharged</b> <b>solids</b> is low. This means {{it is not}} easy to treat and implement practical, cost effective treatments. Technologies for the removal <b>of</b> <b>solids</b> include microscreens, dual-drain tanks, swirl separators, plate separators, baffles, media filters, air flotation, foam fractionation, chemical flocculation, and constructed wetlands. But because of the impracticality and / or high costs of these methods, most of them are not applicable for commercial aquaculture. As a consequence, sedimentation (settling) is still the most widely applied and cost effective technology. Since 1999, regulations in South Korea require that all raceway farms provide waste water treatment facilities covering at least 20% of the farmed area to prevent pollution of the freshwater environment. Open race way ponds were used for removal of heavy metal ions like lead using live Spirulina (Arthospira) sp.|$|R
