5|$|Adonis {{originally}} was a Phoenician god of fertility representing {{the spirit of}} vegetation. It is further speculated {{that he was an}} avatar of the version of Ba'al, worshipped in Ugarit. It is likely that lack of clarity concerning whether Myrrha was called Smyrna, and who her father was, originated in Cyprus before the Greeks <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> the myth. However, {{it is clear that the}} Greeks added much to the Adonis-Myrrha story, before it was first recorded by classical scholars.|$|E
5|$|Faramir <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and {{recognized}} {{them to be}} the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions including Boromir, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir, since he knew, although Frodo at that point did not, that Boromir was already dead. One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Anduin river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead body of his brother, {{who had been killed}} by Orcs after Frodo left the group.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{decided that}} he needed to have his own {{strategic}} reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed the Alamo Scouts as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding. An Alamo Scout Training Center for volunteers was established on Fergusson Island, not far from Alamo Force's headquarters on Goodenough Island, under the command of Colonel Frederick W. Bradshaw, whom Krueger had <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units where they could be used for similar work. By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.|$|E

5|$|Osmium was {{discovered}} in 1803 by Smithson Tennant and William Hyde Wollaston in London, England. The discovery of osmium is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Platinum reached Europe as platina ("small silver"), <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> in the late 17th century in silver mines around the Chocó Department, in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy, but a distinct new element, was published in 1748.|$|E

She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger: The power plant was damaged by the dropship crash and will soon explode {{with the force of}} a 40-megaton thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulacos remaining dropship to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Scott's army moved farther inland from Puebla unopposed and {{attacked}} Mexico City from the south. During that campaign in 1847, Hancock <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> battle at Contreras and Churubusco. He was appointed a brevet first lieutenant for gallant and meritorious service in those actions. Hancock {{was wounded in}} the knee at Churubusco and developed a fever. Although he was well enough to join his regiment at Molino del Rey, fever kept Hancock from participating in the final breakthrough to Mexico City, something he would regret {{for the rest of his}} life. After the final victory, Hancock remained in Mexico with the 6th Infantry until the treaty of peace was signed in 1848.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana narrates: Rama, his consort Sita and {{his brother}} Lakshmana were exiled to the forest for a 14-year period. While in the forest, Sita was kidnapped by the demon-king Ravana.

Searching for Sita, Rama and Lakshmana reached the Krauncha forest, where Kabandha dwelt. The brothers <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> a demoness, who tempted Lakshmana.

5|$|The {{schooner}} Pilot's Pride <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> this hurricane {{northeast of}} the Bahamas on October7. The system moved just west of due north and intensified into a Category2 hurricane on the following day. Based on ship reports, the hurricane is estimated to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of 105mph (165km/h). The bark Marie was damaged by the storm on October8 and returned to port for repairs. Early on October9, the cyclone curved northeastward and weakened to a Category1 hurricane. The storm was last noted to the southeast of Sable Island late on October10.|$|E
5|$|A lucky break allowed 3rd Battalion to ambush {{the staff}} car {{carrying}} Generalmajor Friedrich Kussin, the German commandant of Arnhem, {{and kill him}} and his driver. Nevertheless, most of the battalion had been stopped by the Germans in Oosterbeek while 'C' Company had entered Arnhem but were halted on the road leading to the bridge. At 15:30 the 1st Parachute Battalion were released from the reserve and directed along the Ede-Arnhem road. Here they <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> German armoured vehicles and a column of five tanks and fifteen half-tracks, which were engaged by the battalion. They continued fighting their way forward, and by morning had reached the outskirts of Arnhem. By this time around {{a quarter of the}} battalion had been killed, wounded or were missing. Before this, at nightfall, Brigadier Lathbury had contacted Lieutenant-Colonel Frost in command at the bridge and informed him the brigade would stay put during the night and attempt to reach him in the morning.|$|E

5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind {{to a halt and}} the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E
5|$|Irataba (Mohave: eecheeyara tav , {{also known}} as Yara tav, Yarate:va, Arateve; – 1874) was {{a leader of the}} Mohave Nation, known for his role as a {{mediator}} between his people and the United States. He was born near the Colorado River in present-day Arizona. Irataba was a renowned orator {{and one of the first}} Mohave to speak English, a skill he used to develop relations with the United States. Early records mention his large physical size and gentle demeanor. Irataba <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> European Americans in 1851, when he assisted the Sitgreaves Expedition. In 1854, he met Amiel Whipple, then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado. Several Mohave aided the group, and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail, which would take them to southern California. He later helped and protected other expeditions, earning him a reputation among whites as the most important native leader in the region.|$|E
5|$|Little Bee is {{detained}} {{and quickly}} deported back to Nigeria, where she believes {{she will be}} killed.

During a trip to the same beach where they <b>first</b> <b>encountered</b> one another, soldiers arrive to take Little Bee away. Despite being captured, Little Bee is not dispirited, and instead is ultimately hopeful at the sight of Charlie playing happily with a group of Nigerian children.|$|E
