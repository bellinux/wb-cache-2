5|$|The {{implementation}} of SBS on the Woodhaven/Cross Bay corridor {{has been supported}} by transit advocates and bus riders, particularly those in the Rockaways. However, many residents of the communities north of the Rockaways, particularly car users and business owners, have opposed the Select Bus Service project. Much of the opposition has been due to the {{implementation of}} bus lanes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boulevard, which could cause increased traffic congestion. The plan in April 2015 would have prohibited left-turns at twelve intersections.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{entering}} Cayuga County, NY31 crosses {{and begins to}} parallel the New York State Thruway (I-90), which NY31 does {{for most of its}} routing west of the outer Syracuse suburbs. In Port Byron, NY31 intersects NY38 {{in the center of the}} village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY31 continues alone to Weedsport, where the route meets NY34 and County Route31B (CR31B, formerly NY31B) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY31 to the south.|$|E
5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to {{the underside of the}} tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua {{to the floor of the}} mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E

25|$|A superficially similar honeyeater is {{the black}} honeyeater, (Sugomel nigrum). It has a {{different}} call, is smaller, with a finer bill, shorter tail and lacks the bare eye patch. Males of this species also have a distinctive stripe <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest and abdomen, while females have plainer wings and less streaking on the breast (eds Higgins et al. 2001).|$|E
25|$|On calm summer afternoons {{with little}} {{prevailing}} wind, sea breezes from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast {{depending on the}} relative strengths of the sea breezes, and sometimes survive to move {{out over the water}} at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. Due to its large size Lake Okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own lake breeze which collides with the east and west coast sea breezes.|$|E
25|$|The {{top deck}} {{on the new}} bridge was {{originally}} just a flat space. Traversing the bridge in the harshness of winter was very uncomfortable, so an enclosure running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedestrian area was added by the 1970s. Originally {{meant to be a}} heated indoor pedestrian area, due to energy cost concerns, the walkway is mostly unheated. There are some heaters inside that keep the area slightly warmer than outside, and some heat loss from the steam mains, but it can still dip below the freezing point. The structure also adds a windbreak for the top level, improving conditions for people who choose to walk outside. In the summer, large overhangs also provide some shade.|$|E

25|$|On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Flight 292, an Airbus A320 {{discovered}} {{a problem with}} its landing gear as it took off from Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California. It flew in circles for three hours to burn off fuel, then landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport on runway 25L, balancing on its back wheels as it rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> runway. Passengers were able to watch their own coverage live from the satellite broadcast on JetBlue in-flight TV seat displays of their plane as it made an emergency landing with the front landing gear visibly becoming damaged. Because JetBlue did not serve LAX at the time, the aircraft was evaluated and repaired at a Continental Airlines hangar.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Lower Peninsula {{was home}} to many {{different}} railroads during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century. One of these lines was the Detroit, Bay City & Alpena Railroad, later known as the Detroit and Mackinac Railway. The railroad had a main line along the Lake Huron shore and branch lines connecting to logging camps and gravel quarries. The railroad was a part owner of the SS Chief Wawatam a rail car ferry that crossed the Straits of Mackinac. Running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Lower Peninsula was the Michigan Central Railroad, which connected Mackinaw City with Bay City, Detroit, Lansing, and beyond. This line later became the New York Central and was sold to the Detroit and Mackinac Railway in 1976. Several other railroads have existed in Alpena's history.|$|E
25|$|The Fahd 240 {{is based}} upon the latest Mercedes Benz LAP 1424/32 chassis. This variant {{includes}} a far more powerful engine and a slight increase in armor. It has the same engine as the Fahd. All original Fahds have been updated to this standard, and it is the main variant in service with the Egyptian Army. It weighs 11.6 tons. The seating arrangement and design characteristics are similar to the original Fahd APC. It has a crew of two and can carry ten soldiers. On top of the passenger compartment are two large roof hatches, hinged {{at the center of the}} vehicle. They sit facing outward <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. Each passenger has a firing port, giving four ports on either side of the vehicle. The armament is similar to the original Fahd.|$|E
50|$|Euclid Avenue {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The 3-mile Bridle Path runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Euclid Avenue from Foothill Boulevard to 24th Street. The Bridle Path is also used for walking and jogging.|$|R
50|$|The mansion {{originally}} had many unusual {{features such as}} a fire pole <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> a spiral staircase leading to the master bedroom, elephant sculptures, and a pink piano. In 2012, the mansion received a major remodel to modernize the decor.|$|R

25|$|The playfield is a {{planar surface}} {{inclined}} upward {{from three to}} seven degrees (current convention is {{six and a half}} degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playfield glass. If it clearly rolls off to one side, a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg levelers that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and nudging becomes harder.|$|E
25|$|Haussmann and Belgrand built new sewer tunnels {{under each}} {{sidewalk}} {{of the new}} boulevards. The sewers were designed to {{be large enough to}} evacuate rain water immediately; the large amount of water used to wash the city streets; waste water from both industries and individual households; and water that collected in basements when the level of the Seine was high. Before Haussmann, the sewer tunnels (featured in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables) were cramped and narrow, just 1.8 meters high and 75 to 80 centimeters wide. The new tunnels were 2.3 meters high and 1.3 meters wide, large enough for men to work standing up. These flowed into larger tunnels that carried the waste water to even larger collector tunnels, which were 4.4 meters high and 5.6 meters wide. A channel <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel carried away the waste water, with sidewalks on either side for the égoutiers, or sewer workers. Specially designed wagons and boats moved on rails up and down the channels, cleaning them. Belgrand proudly invited tourists to visit his sewers and ride in the boats under the streets of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Fahd is of {{all-welded}} steel armor construction giving complete {{protection against}} attack by 7.62 mm caliber AP rounds and shell splinters. The vehicle is equipped with air conditioning. The driver sits {{at the front of}} the vehicle on the left side with the commander to the right. Both have forward observation via large bulletproof windows, which can be rapidly covered by an armored shutter hinged at the top, and a side door that opens to the front, featuring a window in its upper part that can also be covered by a shutter as well. Above the commander's position is a single-piece, rear-opening hatch cover. The driver has a forward-facing, roof-mounted day periscope, which can be replaced by a passive periscope for night driving. The troop compartment is at the rear of the hull with the infantry entering via a door in the rear, the upper part of which folds upwards and the lower part downwards to form a step. Over the top of the troop compartment are two rectangular roof hatches hinged in the center that can be locked vertically. The infantry sits on individual bucket seats <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle facing outwards. In either side of the troop compartment are four firing ports with a vision block above so that the troops can fire their weapons from within the vehicle. Either side of the rear door has a firing port with a vision block above. Optional equipment may be fitted on the vehicle, such as an NBC protection system and passive IR among others.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as a Rifleman with Company M, Third Battalion, Ninth Marines, Third Marine Division in action against hostile forces in the Republic of Vietnam. On March 3, 1969, while returning from a reconnaissance in force mission in the vicinity of Fire Support Base Cunningham in Quang Tri Province, the First Platoon of Company M came under intense automatic weapons fire and a grenade attack from a well-concealed North Vietnamese Army force pinning <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> column. Rapidly assessing the situation, Private First Class Wilson, acting as Squad Leader, skillfully maneuvered his squad to form a base of fire and act as a blocking force while the point squad moved to outflank the enemy. During the ensuing fire fight, both his machine gunner and assistant machine gunner were seriously wounded and unable to operate their weapon. Realizing the importance of recovering the M-60 machine gun and maintaining a heavy volume of fire against the hostile force, Private First Class Wilson, with complete disregard for his own safety, followed by another Marine, fearlessly dashed across the fire-swept terrain to recover the weapon. As they reached the machine gun, a North Vietnamese soldier threw a grenade at the Marine. Reacting instantly, Private First Class Wilson fired a burst from his M-16 rifle killing the enemy soldier. Observing the grenade fall between himself and the other Marine, Private First Class Wilson, fully realizing the inevitable result of his actions, shouted to his companion and unhesitatingly threw himself on the grenade, absorbing the full force of the explosion with his own body. His heroic actions inspired his platoon members to maximum effort as they aggressively attacked and defeated the enemy. Private First Class Wilson's indomitable courage, inspiring valor and selfless devotion to duty upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E
500|$|The {{canyon is}} one of the last {{remaining}} wild areas in Orange County in a strip of preserves along the San Joaquin Hills about [...] long and [...] wide. Recently, State Route 133 between the 405 and 73 freeways has been expanded to four lanes from the original two lanes, and much of the original road <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canyon has been demolished and re-vegetated. The new road was constructed further from the creek bed to lessen environmental impacts. The northernmost extreme of the canyon is being developed into a residential area consisting of 590 homes, called Laguna Crossing, the first phase of which was opened in 2013.|$|E
500|$|One {{vision of}} Islandia, {{supported}} by land owners, would have connected the northern Florida Keys– from Key Biscayne to Key Largo– with bridges and created new islands using the fill from the SeaDade channel. Although Ludwig's SeaDade plans were {{not supported by}} Miami-area politicians or the state of Florida, Islandia's supporters continued to lobby for development support. In 1968, when it appeared the area {{was about to become}} a national monument, Islandia supporters bulldozed a highway six lanes wide right <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, destroying the forest for [...] Islandia landowners called it Elliott Key Boulevard, but called it [...] "Spite Highway" [...] privately. It was hoped that since there was so much environmental damage, no one would want it for a national monument.

500|$|Two large {{cofferdams}} {{were constructed}} for the dam, {{but they were}} parallel to the river rather than straddling its width, so drilling into the canyon walls was not required. By the end of 1935 about 1,200 workers completed the west and east cofferdams. The west cofferdam was [...] long, [...] thick and was constructed [...] above the bedrock. The cofferdams allowed workers to dry portions of the riverbed and begin constructing the dam, while water continued to flow <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> riverbed. In , once the west foundation was complete, portions of the west cofferdam were dismantled, allowing water to flow through part of the dam's new foundation. In , MWAK had begun constructing cofferdams {{above and below the}} channel between the east and west cofferdams. By December, the entire Columbia River was diverted over the foundations constructed within the east and west cofferdams. On , 1936, the Wenatchee Daily World announced that the river was diverted and by early the next year, people were arriving in large numbers to see the riverbed.|$|E
