40|$|N. Grandin. A fier the Mahdi: Colonial Policy among Pastoral Arabs in the Sudan. The British colonial {{practice}} in the Northern Sudan was <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of a resurgence of Mahdism. This resulted in frequent contradictions between a theory of Native Administration, based upon the assumption of a tribal model, and empirical direct manipulations which ran contrary {{to the principle of}} Indirect Rule, even as proclaimed in local officiai instructions. A comparison between two 'tribes' having similar ways of life but a different history {{at the time of the}} Mahdiya shows a political development with thoroughly divergent trends. Amongst the Humr—-who had supported the Mahdi—the officiai policy was to limit <b>the</b> Nazir's authority <b>by</b> developing <b>the</b> 'omodiya System based upon lineage divisions. Amongst the Kababish, conversely, and because they had opposed the Mahdi, the colonial government encouraged the consolidation of a tribal autocracy centered on the Nazir and his lineage. This was a stringent departure from traditional practice, where the very nature of the economy precluded the formation of any permanent System of centralized government. Grandin Nicole.

40|$|The {{description}} here proposed of {{the main}} aspects of Peter Sloterdijk’s trilogy, Spheres, leads to consider {{the elements of the}} very core of his complex, wide-opened, and even sometimes risky proposal, as a metaphorical redescription of the most philosophical of geometrical forms. And taking in account that his is precisely a fruitful change of point of view, this paper is dedicated to point out the moments in which this story of redescription in three stages, or metaphors, proposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German Philosopher so as to show that this poetical reconstruction of the space, provides the elements to understand our historical moment as a period of abundance preceded and <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ancient <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> losing of the center...|$|R
40|$|Both of {{the major}} ethnic groups in Guyana—Africans and East Indians— show a normal concern for the {{well-being}} of their ethnic group. They both also <b>fear</b> being <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> other—a <b>fear</b> that is due to the human instinct of self-preservation. But for East Indians in Guyana, fear is moti-vated and justified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> belief that “Black ” people are evil by nature. This belief is legitimized in the Hindu scriptures in the caste system that is based on the dualism of good and evil. This article looks at the caste system, its reconstitution in Guyana, and the violent consequences due to East Indian need to justify their perception of themselves as the morally superior “good ” group who are therefore entitled to rule...|$|R
50|$|Manly-Warringah made an {{unexpected}} bright {{start to the}} 2005 season, at one stage leading the competition outright after round seven. However their season was marred early <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dismissal of John Hopoate who was given a 17-match ban for striking Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks forward Keith Galloway in the round two match. Steve Matai made his first grade debut in that match, a late replacement after John Hopoate was suspended, then sacked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> club. Furthermore, the season overall was <b>dominated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> team's <b>fear</b> of playing matches at night, with most of their defeats occurring under lights. This was pointed out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Channel Nine commentators prior to its round eight, Friday night match against the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium (which was in fact Manly's first Friday night match in six years) which the Sea Eagles indeed lost by a scoreline of 38-12.|$|R

You cannot make that sort of thing to order in a crisis. Scientific education--and more particularly the scientific education of our owning and responsible classes--has been crippled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bitter jealousy of the classical teachers who <b>dominate</b> our universities, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> and hatred of the Established Church, which still so largely controls our upper-class schools, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> entire lack of understanding and support on the part of those able barristers and financiers who rule our political life. Science has been left more and more to men of modest origin and narrow outlook, and now we are beginning to pay in internal dissensions, and presently we may have to pay in national humiliation for this almost organised rejection of stimulus and power.|$|R
