40|$|The family {{histories}} {{relating to}} asthma and wheezy bronchitis {{were examined in}} 77 asthmatic, 78 wheezy bronchitic, and 87 control children, aged between 1 and 12 years.

However these differences did not reach significance. The strong similarities between asthmatic and wheezy bronchitic children in their family histories of asthma and wheezy bronchitis suggest that these two forms of wheezy illness share a common genetic defect...|$|R

5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E

40|$|In fasting nondiabetic subjects, insulin is {{secreted}} {{in regular}} pulses every 12 to 15 minutes, but patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes lack regular oscillatory insulin secretion. To investigate whether abnormal insulin oscillations are an early feature of diabetes, we studied 10 minimally glucose-intolerant first-degree relatives {{of patients with}} non-insulin-dependent diabetes and 10 controls matched for age and obesity. We performed a time-series analysis of fasting plasma insulin levels in blood samples obtained at 1 -minute intervals for 150 minutes. Fasting plasma glucose levels were higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> controls (mean +/- SD, 5. 4 +/- 0. 7 vs. 4. 4 +/- 0. 3 mmol per liter). Autocorrelation of pooled data showed no regular oscillatory activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> but a 13 -minute cycle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> controls (r = 0. 23, P less than 0. 001). Similarly, Fourier transform analysis showed no significant peak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> but <b>the</b> expected significant peak at 13 to 14 minutes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> controls (P less than 0. 05).

5|$|Following the California {{gold rush}} {{that began in}} 1849 and the Australian gold rush that began in 1851, a larger amount of gold was put into {{commerce}} than could be easily absorbed by the normal channels. This resulted in {{a decrease in the}} value of gold and an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> value of silver. As a result, silver coins rapidly disappeared from circulation due either to hoarding or melting. In response, Congress authorized the Mint to reduce the quantity of silver in all denominations except the three-cent piece and silver dollar. Beginning in the 1860s, silver production rose and the price decreased. During this time, silver coins largely disappeared from circulation and were replaced by copper and paper currency.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E

40|$|Background: High {{rates of}} {{co-morbidity}} between Generalized Social Phobia (GSP) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) have been documented. The {{reason for this}} is unclear. Family studies are one means of clarifying the nature of co-morbidity between two disorders. Methods: Six models of co-morbidity between GSP and GAD were investigated in a family aggregation study of 403 first-degree relatives of non-clinical probands: 37 with GSP, 22 with GAD, 15 with co-morbid GSP/GAD, and 41 controls with no history of GSP or GAD. Psychiatric data were collected for probands and relatives. Mixed methods (direct and family history interviews) were utilised. Results: Primary contrasts (against controls) found an increased rate of pure GSP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of both GSP probands and co-morbid GSP/GAD probands, and found relatives of co-morbid GSP/GAD probands to have an increased rate of both pure GAD and comorbid GSP/GAD. Secondary contrasts found (i) increased GSP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of GSP only probands compared to <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of GAD only probands; and (ii) increased GAD <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of co-morbid GSP/GAD probands compared to <b>the</b> <b>relatives</b> of GSP only probands. Limitations: The study did not directly interview all <b>relatives,</b> although <b>the</b> reliability of family history data was assessed. The study was based on an all-female proband sample. The implications of both these limitations are discussed. Conclusions: The results were most consistent with a co-morbidity model indicating independent familial transmission of GSP and GAD. This has clinical implications for the treatment of patients with both disorders. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All fights reserved...|$|R

5|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence of global disruption of plant communities at the K–Pg boundary. Extinctions are seen both {{in studies of}} fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K–Pg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>relative</b> abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the Paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a fern spike in the geologic record; this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption.|$|E
