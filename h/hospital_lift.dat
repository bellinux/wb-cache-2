50|$|As the war moved east, Victoria {{reverted to}} work as a {{personnel}} carrier. She became something of an emergency <b>hospital</b> ship, <b>lifting</b> sick and injured troops and ferrying them mainly to shore based hospitals around Dieppe. When not engaged in this line of work, the ship was used to return troops to England for leave.|$|R

5000|$|Radio Chelsea and Westminster is the {{hospital}}'s own hospital radio station, available for; patients, {{staff and}} the local community. It was launched in 1977 to provide music and escapism for patients. Patients are able {{to listen to the}} hospital radio on Channel 6 on their hospedia beside unit, or online at www.radiocw.org. The radio station has featured in a number of locations around the hospital it is currently {{on the second floor of}} the <b>hospital</b> between <b>lift</b> banks C and D The charity is entirely self-funded and relies on subscriptions, personal donations and fundraising events to continue its work.|$|R
50|$|Acadia, with a {{capacity}} for 788 patients and three surgical teams had no water ambulances was the larger of two hospital ships evacuating U.S. wounded from North Africa, but was too large to dock at Bizerte. On the first evacuation in June 1943 the <b>hospital</b> ship <b>lifted</b> 788 patients from Oran to the United States. The general shortage of ships meant that only three Army hospital ships, USAHS Seminole and USAHS Shamrock along with Acadia, were available in theater {{by the end of}} 1943 so that only 3,593 patients were evacuated to the United States by hospital ship as opposed to 16,284 by troop ship.|$|R
5000|$|A {{passenger}} train travelling from Oran {{to the capital}} Algiers and consisting of a locomotive and eight carriages stalled on a steep gradient leading to a mountain pass a few kilometres beyond the town of Bouhalouane in the Chlef Province of Algeria. The locomotive was uncoupled leaving the carriages unsecured; the brakes failed on the carriages and they rolled back down the slope to Bouhalouane where they collided with a freight train in the station. The noise woke many of the residents who rushed to the station where they witnessed an 'apocalyptic scene'. The passenger carriages were split open and stacked upon each other; screams of the wounded could be heard. Motorists passing the station were stopped and their cars became makeshift ambulances taking the injured to nearby <b>hospitals.</b> Heavy <b>lifting</b> equipment and cutting torches were used as police and army worked to rescue the injured, illuminated by spotlights. By dawn 100 bodies had been recovered. The final death toll was 131 people, with 200 injured.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 March, {{an article}} in the Serbian {{newspaper}} [...] "Politika Express" [...] was called “Albanians got poisoned for dollars". On 6 April, the same newspaper praised the role of the Serbian Police because according to them, the police did the right thing by avoiding the appearance of a [...] "comedy". Serbian officials called it [...] "mass hysteria" [...] and propaganda perpetrated by Albanian separatists. The Serbian police obstructed medical assistance, stopping patients in front of health institutions and preventing them from entering hospitals, or even taking away driving licences from ambulance drivers. In <b>hospitals,</b> the police <b>lifted</b> the medical records of patients (Dobreci, 1994). Some patients and physicians were interrogated and mistreated at the police station. Albanian medical doctors appealed to the authorities to establish an independent and impartial international investigation of these events. This demand was rejected.|$|R
5000|$|Polonska {{had been}} an artist {{before the onset of}} schizophrenia, but when Adamson first met her, she was mopping the {{hospital}} floors. For Polonska to practise her sculpture, Adamson had to persuade the <b>hospital</b> authorities to <b>lift</b> the restrictions on 'potential offensive weapons in the hands of mental patients' so she could have a hammer and chisel. In 1971 the Arts Council of Great Britain released a short film, [...] "Rolanda Polonsky, Sculptor". Polonska is filmed at Netherne, where she had already been living for 24 years, 'talking about her work, and the meanings that it has for her. Her art is deeply religious and personal, and she uses Christian themes in a refreshing and idiosyncratic way'. The film features, among other works, her masterpiece Stations of the Cross, which are in the Collection (along with several other sculptures and about 2000 sketches and drawings) but are still the original plaster casts, funding never found to cast them in bronze.|$|R
40|$|Consolidated the Order of San Juan of God in Spain, their {{religious}} soon {{were required to}} pass to American lands. With the purpose of <b>lifting</b> <b>hospitals</b> they arrived to beginnings of the XVII century and they were organized in three counties: one that would embrace the viceroyalty of New Spain and of overseas, the other one the viceroyalty of the Peru and a third, the denominated Mainland. To four years of having installed in Mexico, they were requested in the populous and rich mining city call Our Mrs. of the Zacatecas. Consolidada la Orden de San Juan de Dios en España, sus religiosos pronto fueron requeridos para pasar a tierras americanas. Con el fin de levantar hospitales llegaron a inicios del siglo XVII y se organizaron en tres provincias: una que abarcaría el virreinato de Nueva España y de ultramar, la otra el virreinato del Perú y una tercera, la denominada Tierra Firme. A cuatro años de instalados en México, fueron solicitados en la populosa y rica ciudad minera llamada Nuestra Señora de los Zacatecas...|$|R
50|$|In Saint Vincent, the {{hurricane}} destroyed 584 of the 600 houses in Kingstown. At Grenada, 19 Dutch ships were wrecked. On Saint Lucia, rough waves {{and a strong}} storm tide struck the fleet of British Admiral Rodney at Port Castries, with one ship destroying the citys <b>hospital</b> by being <b>lifted</b> on top of it. The hurricane destroyed all but two houses at Port Castries, and throughout the island about 6,000 perished. Among the ships lost from Rodneys fleet were the frigates HMS Phoenix wrecked on the Cuban coast, and HMS Blanche which disappeared without a trace, the sixth rate frigates HMS Andromeda and HMS Laurel which were wrecked on Martinique with heavy loss of life and five other smaller vessels either wrecked or foundered. By far the worst losses in the British fleet however were among the squadron of Rear-Admiral Joshua Rowley, which was caught at sea by {{the hurricane}} off the San Domingo coast. Ships of the line HMS Thunderer which foundered with all hands, and HMS Stirling Castle which was smashed on the coast with fewer than 50 survivors, were lost and the remaining six ships were all severely damaged.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hospitals</b> often {{experience}} <b>lift</b> congestion as {{a result}} of their heavy traffic, complex user types, and relatively slow-moving lifts (due to concerns over safety). Given the increasing number of current and new hospital building blocks that consist of many storeys, a visual simulation-based decision support system (DSS) is recommended. We present the modelling approach and development of a tool capable of being used for lift performance evaluation/prediction of existing/new hospital designs. These are also applicable to other general-purpose lift systems. A new data modelling approach, based on collected empirical traffic data, was developed to estimate the inter-floor passenger traffic. The DSS is flexible enough to allow the input of any zoning policy. The integrated zoning analysis offered here has not been found in existing lift simulators. This paper is the first to model a special feature designed to disable certain lift buttons in order to ensure fair use of the lift service. We carried out field studies of two existing hospitals, and we projected lift demand for a new hospital under construction. Performances at all three hospitals with different design structures under different operational control policies and lift features are given. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and security of lift and squeeze technique in phacoemulsification of hypermature cataract. METHODS: From June 2010 to June 2013, totally 156 eyes with hypermature cataract, which received phacoemulsification in our <b>hospital,</b> were enrolled. <b>Lift</b> and squeeze technique was used to chop the nucleus, and 1 g/L Trypan blue was used for capsulorhexis. Average time of phaco complication, corneal edema and visual outcome were recorded. RESULTS: The best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA) was 0. 1 - 0. 4 in 15 eyes(9. 6 %), 0. 5 - 0. 7 in 82 (52. 6 %) eyes, and 0. 8 - 1. 0 in 59 (37. 8 %) eyes at 3 mo after surgery. The phaco time was 25 - 56 s(average 42 ± 10 s), the maximum phaco power was 30 %. Posterior capsular rupture and vitreous loss happened in 2 eyes(1. 3 %), and the IOLs were implanted in the sulcus. Corneal edema classified at grade Ⅰ were seen in 12 eyes(7. 7 %), and 5 eyes(3. 2 %) at gradeⅡ, no eye at grade Ⅲ and grade Ⅳ. The mean endothelial cell loss was 8. 7 % at 3 mo. CONCLUSION: Crystalline lens capsule staining with Trypan blue increase the success rate of intact continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis(CCC). The lift and squeeze technique reduces the stress on the zonules and capsule, and decreases the phaco time and phaco power...|$|R
50|$|When Aidan {{witnesses}} Chris defending Andrew {{and standing}} up to his father, he realises {{that he wants to}} get back together with him. Aidan goes to find Chris at the university dance and asks him if he can change his mind about trying again.
