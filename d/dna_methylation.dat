5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer cells harbor a {{large number}} of {{molecular}} alterations such as mutations, amplifications and deletions on DNA sequences and epigenetic changes on <b>DNA</b> <b>methylations.</b> These aberrations may dysregulate gene expressions, which in turn drive the malignancy of tumors. Deciphering the causal and statistical relations of molecular aberrations and gene expressions is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms of clinical phenotypes. Results In this work, we proposed a computational method to reconstruct association modules containing driver aberrations, passenger mRNA or microRNA expressions, and putative regulators that mediate the effects from drivers to passengers. By applying the module-finding algorithm to the integrated datasets of NCI- 60 cancer cell lines, we found that gene expressions were driven by diverse molecular aberrations including chromosomal segments' copy number variations, gene mutations and <b>DNA</b> <b>methylations,</b> microRNA expressions, and the expressions of transcription factors. In-silico validation indicated that passenger genes were enriched with the regulator binding motifs, functional categories or pathways where the drivers were involved, and co-citations with the driver/regulator genes. Moreover, 6 of 11 predicted MYB targets were down-regulated in an MYB-siRNA treated leukemia cell line. In addition, microRNA expressions were driven by distinct mechanisms from mRNA expressions. Conclusions The results provide rich mechanistic information regarding molecular aberrations and gene expressions in cancer genomes. This kind of integrative analysis will become an important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the era of personalized medicine. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{huntingtin}} protein interacts with over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have multiple biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function. <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> also appears to be changed in HD.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} poly(A) site can be {{influenced}} by extracellular stimuli and depends on {{the expression of the}} proteins that take part in polyadenylation. For example, the expression of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results in the selection of weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins. RNA-binding proteins other than those in the polyadenylation machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> near the polyadenylation signal.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems. <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E

The methylation pattern of specific sequences such as the origin of replication and rRNA genes has been studied in wild type E. coli and a methylation deficient (dam- dcm-) mutant. These sequences were found to be methylated in wild type cells and unmethylated in the mutant indicating that there is no effect of the state of methylation of these sequences on their expression. Analysis of the state of methylation of GATC sites in newly replicating DNA using the restriction enzyme Dpn I (cleaves only when both strands are methylated) revealed no detectable hemimethylated <b>DNA</b> suggesting that <b>methylation</b> occurs at the replication fork.

25|$|Whereas <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> is not {{necessary}} per se for transcriptional silencing, it is thought nonetheless to represent a “locked” state that definitely inactivates transcription. In particular, <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> appears critical {{for the maintenance of}} mono-allelic silencing in the context of genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. In these cases, expressed and silent alleles differ by their methylation status, and loss of <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> results in loss of imprinting and re-expression of Xist in somatic cells. During embryonic development, few genes change their methylation status, at the important exception of many genes specifically expressed in the germline. <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> appears absolutely required in differentiated cells, as knockout of any of the three competent DNA methyltransferase results in embryonic or post-partum lethality. By contrast, <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> is dispensable in undifferentiated cell types, such as the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, primordial germ cells or embryonic stem cells. Since <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> appears to directly regulate {{only a limited number of}} genes, how precisely <b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> absence causes the death of differentiated cells remain an open question.|$|E
25|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>methylation</b> is a {{powerful}} transcriptional repressor, at least in CpG dense contexts. Transcriptional repression of protein-coding genes appears essentially limited to very specific classes of genes {{that need to be}} silent permanently and in almost all tissues.

40|$|BackgroundMultiple {{endocrine}} neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is a familial syndrome {{characterized by}} the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary tumors. Parathyroid tumors {{are the most common}} clinical manifestations, occurring in more than 90 % of MEN 1 patients. Heterozygous germline mutations of the MENIN gene underlie the tumorigenesis in MEN 1 and epigenetic alterations along with germline mutations may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the associations between genotype and phenotype in Korean MEN 1 patients. MethodsWe analyzed medical records from 14 unrelated MEN 1 patients who had newly confirmed MENIN germline mutations, together with 14 previous reports in Korea. Aberrant <b>DNA</b> <b>methylations</b> were also examined in MEN 1 -related parathyroid tumors using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. ResultsTotal 28 germline mutations of MENIN were relatively highly concentrated in exons 7 and 8 compared to previous reports from Western countries. Six mutations (c. 111 dupT/p.

We also found three distinct sites in exon 2 of MENIN were significantly hypomethylated in the MEN 1 parathyroid tumors, comparing correspondent blood samples. ConclusionWe also have found a lack of genotype/phenotype correlation in Korean MEN 1 patients. There were not a few unusual initial manifestations in MEN 1 patients, thus, genetic testing for the MENIN germline mutations can provide important information for the better prognosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer is {{a complex}} disease where various types of {{molecular}} aberrations drive the development and progression of malignancies. Large-scale screenings of multiple types of molecular aberrations (e. g., mutations, copy number variations, <b>DNA</b> <b>methylations,</b> gene expressions) become increasingly important in the prognosis and study of cancer. Consequently, a computational model integrating multiple types of information {{is essential for the}} analysis of the comprehensive data. Results We propose an integrated modeling framework to identify the statistical and putative causal relations of various molecular aberrations and gene expressions in cancer. To reduce spurious associations among the massive number of probed features, we sequentially applied three layers of logistic regression models with increasing complexity and uncertainty regarding the possible mechanisms connecting molecular aberrations and gene expressions. Layer 1 models associate gene expressions with the molecular aberrations on the same loci. Layer 2 models associate expressions with the aberrations on different loci but have known mechanistic links. Layer 3 models associate expressions with nonlocal aberrations which have unknown mechanistic links. We applied the layered models to the integrated datasets of NCI- 60 cancer cell lines and validated the results with large-scale statistical analysis. Furthermore, we discovered/reaffirmed the following prominent links: (1) Protein expressions are generally consistent with mRNA expressions. (2) Several gene expressions are modulated by composite local aberrations. For instance, CDKN 2 A expressions are repressed by either frame-shift mutations or <b>DNA</b> <b>methylations.</b> (3) Amplification of chromosome 6 q in leukemia elevates the expression of MYB, and the downstream targets of MYB on other chromosomes are up-regulated accordingly. (4) Amplification of chromosome 3 p and hypo-methylation of PAX 3 together elevate MITF expression in melanoma, which up-regulates the downstream targets of MITF. (5) Mutations of TP 53 are negatively associated with its direct target genes. Conclusions The analysis results on NCI- 60 data justify the utility of the layered models for the incoming flow of cancer genomic data. Experimental validations on selected prominent links and application of the layered modeling framework to other integrated datasets will be carried out subsequently. </p...|$|R
40|$|Smoking is a {{major risk}} factor of {{morbidity}} and mortality. It is well established that monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity is decreased in smokers. Serotonin (5 -HT), a major substrate for MAO that circulates as a reserve pool stored in platelets, is a marker of platelet activation. We recently reported that smoking durably modifies the platelet 5 -HT/MAO system by inducing a demethylation of the MAO gene promoter resulting in high MAO protein concentration persisting {{more than ten years}} after quitting smoking. The present data enlarges the results to another MAO substrate, norepinephrine (NE), further confirming the central role of MAO in tobacco use-induced diseases. Thus, MAO could be a readily accessible and helpful marker in the risk evaluation of smoking-related diseases, from cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases to depression, anxiety and cancer. The present review implements the new finding of epigenetic regulation of MAO and suggests that smoking-induced MAO demethylation can be considered as a hallmark of smoking-related cancers similarly to other aberrant <b>DNA</b> <b>methylations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Biologically active {{derivatives}} of adenine substituted in {{the position}} 9 with hydroxylated aliphatic chain {{were found to be}} inhibitors of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAH-hydrolase).

This new approach for purification of SAH-hydrolases permits their simple isolation from crude tissue homogenates. Antimetabolic efficiency of the investigated aliphatic adenosine analogs is due to the cellular SAH-hydrolase inhibition which results in intracellular SAH accumulation and subsequent inhibition of cellular methylases.

The N 6 -methy-ladenosine (m 6 A) demethylase FTO plays a pivotal regulatory role for postnatal growth and energy expenditure. The purpose of this review is to provide translational evidence that links milk signaling with FTO-activated transcription of the milk recipient. FTO-dependent demethylation of m 6 A regulates mRNA splicing required for adipogenesis, increases the stability of mRNAs, and affects microRNA (miRNA) expression and miRNA biosynthesis.

40|$|Abstract. Alzheimer disease (AD) {{is among}} the few {{diseases}} that may display high homocysteine (HCY) and low B 12 and folate in blood. This observation has raised the suspect that amyloid-β overproduction and accumulation, {{which may be the}} cause of the disease, could be due to the loss of epigenetic control in the expression of the genes involved in AβPP (amyloid-β protein precursor) processing. We have shown, in cell culture, that two of the genes responsible for amyloid-β production are controlled by the methylation of their promoters. The process is strictly related to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism. SAM is a natural compound, mainly produced by the liver, which has been found at very low concentrations in AD brains. A further support to this thesis came from the observation that in elderly <b>DNA</b> <b>methylations</b> are consistently lower than in young and mid aged people.
