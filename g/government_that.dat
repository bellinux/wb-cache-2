40|$|Over the years, {{several studies}} have {{examined}} government responsiveness and congruence in Western democracies by examining {{the relationship between the}} ideological positions of voters and governments. Although these studies generally find high levels of responsiveness and congruence, this research is limited {{by the fact that it}} has focused exclusively on <b>governments</b> <b>that</b> formed immediately after an election, thus implicitly ignoring <b>governments</b> <b>that</b> form between elections. This is an important omission, we argue, due to both the number of <b>governments</b> <b>that</b> form between elections (nearly half in our sample of Western democracies) and theoretical expectations which suggest that responsiveness and congruence may look quite different in the absence of an election. In this paper, we reassess levels of democratic performance across 22 Western democracies utilizing data for all <b>governments</b> <b>that</b> have formed during the postwar period. For governments which form immediately after an election, we confirm the results of past studies which find high levels of congruence and responsiveness. However, after extending the analysis to <b>governments</b> <b>that</b> form between elections, the level of government responsiveness appears to diminish over time with each new government. Our findings concerning levels of voter-government congruence are mixed, yet we do find som...|$|R

De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E
