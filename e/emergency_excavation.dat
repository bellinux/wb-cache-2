40|$|The Roman site of Manta Rota, {{located in}} Algarve region, Portugal, is {{known from the}} XIXth century when Estacio da Veiga {{recovered}} a few pottery fragments and identified the foundations of Roman structures. References in early XXth century refer to a pottery kiln and to the remains of both amphorae and lamps. In 1992, <b>emergency</b> <b>excavations</b> directed by Cristina Garcia excavated a structure identified as a kiln and recovered abundant amphorae fragments of a locally produced Dressel 14 type. There is evidence of production of tiles, common ware and amphora. The study of the remains collected (terra sigillata and amphorae) in the excavations shows that Roman occupation of the site covers a period {{from the middle of}} the 1 st century until the 5 th century AD. The major production of the kiln area was the Dressel 14 fish sauce amphora centered in the middle/second half of the 1 st century but the production of Almagro 51 c is also attested. A preliminary macroscopic analysis of both the amphorae and the common ware show identical features. The aim of this paper is to present chemical characterization of the production of Manta Rota and to compare the results with different workshops in the Algarve region as Quinta do Lago, near Faro or S. Bartolomeu de Castro Marim, in the proximity of the studied area, in order to establish geochemical fingerprints of Manta Rota ceramic production center. Preliminary results point to a fine geochemical differentiation of the Manta Rota ceramics in comparison with the other two roman production centers of Algarve region...|$|R

In the area to the north of the Schlossberg hill, the {{gradient}} of this road was reduced in 1974 and the small hill completely dug up. During an <b>emergency</b> <b>excavation</b> carried out at the time the size of the inner ward from the 13th century was confirmed as 19.3 by 21.6 m and the outer walls were 1.25 m thick. It was partitioned by two dividing walls into three longitudinal areas. In the centre of the site was a small courtyard, 7 by 5 m. The entranceway lay on the southern side and was protected by a moat, over which the Schloßpruggen drove in 1549. At its corners there were pentagonal oriels for defensive fire. The main building was surrounded by a medieval Zwinger with walls 1.2 to 3.6 m thick, the southwest corner of which was fortified with a roundel (Rondell).

On 22 April Hinds, together with Anna Booth (Finds Liaison Officer for Somerset) and Alan Graham—an independent archaeologist contracted by Somerset County Council—visited the site to carry out an <b>emergency</b> <b>excavation.</b> The excavation, led by Graham and assisted by Hinds, Booth, Crisp and members of the landowner's family, was performed over three days, from 23 to 25 April.Graham initially excavated a 1.5 m trench around the small hole that Crisp had dug, and identified the pit in which the pot had been deposited. A small black-burnished ware bowl had been inverted over the mouth of the larger pot, to form a lid. First he excavated the pit fill around the exterior of the pot, identifying organic matter which might represent packing material to protect it, and determined that the pot had been broken in situ long before its discovery in 2010. He then excavated the pot itself. Due to the weight of the contents, the need for speedy excavation due to security concerns and the difficulty in lifting the broken pot with the contents still inside—which would be the preferred archaeological method, so that the contents could be excavated in controlled, laboratory conditions—the decision was taken to excavate the coins in the field. The coins were removed in layers, by which method it was hoped to determine if there was any chronological pattern in the deposition of the coins; that is, whether the earliest coins were at the bottom and latest coins at the top. The coins were collected in 66 labelled bags, and in total weighed approximately 160 kg. Graham excavated and recorded the finds, and the others bagged the coins as Graham lifted them out.|$|E

40|$|Augustus' {{propaganda}} {{founded the}} ruler's power {{on a series}} of references to the sky: Caesar's comet, which helped to establish the divine nature of kingship, the completion of the calendar's reform celebrated in the Campus Martius' meridian, and Augustus' association with Capricorn, the zodiacal sign of the winter solstice. Various forms of proof derived from texts, works of art and numismatics show the key role of such a ‘power from the stars’.

Ten of them show traces of wood work, five have traces of butchering activities, three present traces of meat processing and two present undetermined traces. The site is located at an atypically high elevation for an open air site and there is evidence of a high rate of woodworking activity, rare in the Middle Palaeolithic occupations. The woodworking activities are possibly linked to the exploitation of woody local resources (maybe for the construction of hunting blinds) and not only with to the manufacture and maintenance of spears and shafts.

40|$|In a geopolitical {{very complex}} context as the Gaza Strip {{it has to}} be dealt with an {{enhancement}} of an archaeological site. This site is the monastery of St. Hilarion. To enable a cultural appropriation of a place with several identified phases of occupation must undertake extensive archaeological excavation. Excavate in this geographical area is to implement <b>emergency</b> <b>excavations,</b> so the aim of such a project can be questioned for each mission. Real estate pressure is also a motivating setting the documentation because the large population density does not allow systematic studies of underground before construction projects. This is also during the construction of a road that the site was discovered. Site dimensions are 150 m by 80 m. It is located on a sand dune, 300 m from the sea. To implement the survey, four different levels of detail have been defined for terrestrial photogrammetry. The first level elements are similar to objects, capitals, fragment of columns, tiles for example. Modeling of small objects requires the acquisition of very dense point clouds (density: 1 point / 1 mm on average). The object must then be a maximum area of the sensor of the camera, while retaining in the field of view a reference pattern for the scaling of the point cloud generated. The pictures are taken at a short distance from the object, using the images at full resolution. The main obstacle to the modeling of objects is the presence of noise partly due to the studied materials (sand, smooth rock), which do not favor the detection of points of interest quality. Pretreatments of the cloud will be achieved meticulously since the ouster of points on a surface of a small object results in the formation of a hole with a lack of information, useful to resulting mesh. Level 2 focuses on the stratigraphic units such as mosaics. The monastery of St. Hilarion identifies thirteen floors of which has been documented years ago by silver photographs, scanned later. Modeling of pavements is to obtain a three-dimensional model of the mosaic in particular to analyze the subsidence, which it may be subjected. The dense point cloud can go beyond by including the geometric shapes of the pavement. The calculation mesh using high-density point cloud colorization allows cloud sufficient to final rendering. Levels 3 and 4 will allow the survey and representation of loci and sectors. Their modeling can be done by colored mesh or textured by a generic pattern but also by geometric primitives. This method requires the segmentation simple geometrical elements and creates a surface geometry by analysis of the sample points. Statistical tools allow the extraction plans meet the requirements of the operator can monitor quantitatively the quality of the final rendering. Each level has constraints on the accuracy of survey and types of representation especially from the point clouds, which are detailed in the complete article...|$|R
40|$|An <b>emergency</b> <b>excavation</b> {{carried out}} in the Saint- Jean {{district}} of Roujan (Hérault) uncovered a set of three Greco-roman temples built on a podium, incorporated within a peribolos, itself opening onto a 33 meter wide square to be uncovered. This lst century AD monumental quarter, which must be associated with another ancient town (Medilianum ?) in the Béziers area, goes through some important alterations as from the 5 th century AD. The large central temple is pulled down; the northern sanctuary is transformed into a funeral building which is soon equipped with an apse, whilst a baptismal building is built {{on the site of the}} southern sanctuary. Up until the beginning of the llth century, many graves are dug near both buildings. Throughout this century, settlements are henceforth reorganised around a new castle whilst a canonical priory is founded in its vicinity. Around this time, a heated debate émerges about the processions of the relies of Saint Majan relies which are fought over by several local monasteries (Villemagne, Saint-Thibéry, Aniane) at the expense of the Roujan inhabitants. This topic allows us to grasp through an anthropological angle the complexity of religious displays which are here indissociable from the médiéval constitution of a memory of origins in local Christianity. It also brings forward questions about the récognition of the status of the ancient locality, as well as the part played by this locality in the organisation of the suburbs of Béziers between the Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The Christianisation process is associated with the development of a funeral function inside the ancient peribolos as well as the building of a baptistery. Such an equipment unmistakeably evokes the part played by Episcopal action faced with an organised decentralization which favoured the city's communities. The other way round, this theme also questions the vigour of a civic and religious centre which may have developed during the Early Roman Empire around a hypothetical forum.

40|$|Findings of an {{excavation}} {{are often}} incomprehensible, some sparse evidence of different contexts that follow {{each other in}} a very long period of time. The simple storage of these fragments in 'archaeological fences' is often an useless operation, because these findings require a previous decoding to restore their meaning and their documentary and figurative evidence. The fragmentary nature of an ancient architecture, requires a particular historiographical approach, a further assessment about the cultural function of the unearthed relics, {{especially in the case of}} an urban excavation. City is the place and the result of several diachronies that the archaeological 'emptiness' may irreparably distrupts it, without being able to reveal the meaning of this apparent chaos that suddenly revealed from the underground. Central point of this reflection is the necessity to define, in a shared way, an idea of space that is generated by the relationship between the excavation and the urban structure which participates in that imagine, changing the identity both in its internal spatial relations and in the surrounding context. Today, the relationship with the latter, is absolutely central to his interpretation and enhancement. This theme provides more points for reflection and undermines many choices in sites. Sometimes, the necessity for the protection, if detached by careful reflection on the meaning of <b>emergency</b> <b>excavation,</b> contributes to a real 'alienation' of the same. The ‘archaeological fences’, with their various heights, contribute to make obscure and marginal a heritage that should be shared, jeopardizing the conservation of the same places. The excessive ‘monumentalization’ of ruins has often led to a clear separation between ancient and modern city, denying any different relationship from the 'veneration'. Urban archeology is once again the critical point, the most sensitive area of confrontation between contemporary and archaeological ruins. However, it does not need a project that rests respectfully beyond the edge of the archaeological remains to solve the problem of 'staying in touch' with history. Breaking the splendid isolation of the ruins and restoring their identity, is the purpose that a correct evaluation should be aimed to; the key role in this research is carried out by the so-called 'border areas', the edge created between the excavation and the urban environment. Physical boundary of the investigation area, metaphorical filter between a past, which is sometimes crystallized and often incomprehensible, and a present that pushes with its many needs, a line of demarcation among the different spatio-temporal diachronies of the same place, and the limit of an excavation engraved into the fabric of living city will always involve a relationship with the surrounding reality, deeply pondered or completely disregarded. Through the analysis of some examples, in Rome and elsewhere, now and in the course of time, this paper aims to highlight the importance and the role of this boundary, so full of meaning, both in cases in which it was designed, or ignored, or reduced to a simple wire fenc...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} decade of {{settlement}} in Barbados, slaves were not the dominant labor force; rather, indentured servitude was the most common source of labor. After the failure of tobacco and cotton crops, however, the successful implementation of sugar crops necessitated more and cheaper labor, and Barbados plantation owners turned to the Atlantic slave trade. Slaves imported to Barbados from Africa belonged to as many as nineteen tribes, originating from all across Africa, but concentrated in the West African coast. The overall objective of this thesis was to use molecular archaeology techniques to determine the origin of the remains discovered during an <b>emergency</b> <b>excavation</b> in Fontabelle, St. Michael, Barbados. To discover the origin of the unidentified remains, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was extracted in a separate facility {{to reduce the risk of}} contamination by modern DNA sources. Because of its maternal inheritance, mtDNA is used to establish lineages across generations. The mitochondrial genome is separated into a coding region and non-coding region; the non-coding region which has a mutation rate higher than nuclear DNA, particularly in two regions, hypervariable regions I and II (HV I and HV II). Certain mutations in these hypervariable regions are more likely to be found in certain ethnic groups, to the extent that ethnic groups can be identified by their specific set of mtDNA mutations, or haplogroups. Haplogroups have been compiled into a comprehensive phylogenetic tree representing human migration patterns and tracing back to the first maternal ancestor. After extraction, HV I of each bone sample was amplified. However, due to post-mortem damage sustained by the DNA, sequences were obtained from only 3 of the 5 bones analyzed, only one of which was reproducible. MtDNA from the cheek cells of laboratory personnel interacting with the bones was sequenced as a positive contamination control. All sample sequences were compared to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS), the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence, to determine their haplogroup. Laboratory personnel were haplotyped as belonging to haplogroups T 2 b, H and J 1 b 1, all haplogroups of European origin. The ancient sample with reproducible sequencing results was haplotyped as haplogroup C 1, a Native American haplogroup of North and South America, which suggests this sample belongs to the descendant of one of forty Amerindians from South America enslaved by the settlers of Barbados. Establishing the origin of the other two samples was less conclusive as there was no additional sequence for determining which mutations were true and which were the result of sequencing errors. The majority of the mutations from both samples, however, when compared with worldwide frequencies of mtDNA mutations, showed the highest match probabilities with Kenyan and African populations, suggesting the samples belong to the remains of African slaves. Ideally, at least three separate extractions, each producing amplified mtDNA and mtDNA sequences, is obtained from each ancient sample in order to identify and authenticate haplogroup results. Despite attempts at optimizing the extraction protocol—by reducing then increasing the mass of each sample, by increasing incubation time for bone dissolution and cell lysis, by performing repeat extractions to remove PCR inhibitors, and by utilizing mtDNA amplification kits—most extractions did not yield DNA suitable for extraction. This suggests DNA in the bone samples either exists in such low concentrations or has sustained so much damage that it cannot act as the DNA template in PCR reactions. It is unlikely further attempts at extraction with these remains will produce positive results...|$|E

Although it is {{still too early to}} offer a clear interpretation, ancient river beds can be shown to have once existed far closer to the village than is presently the case. The excavations in zone 2 (i. e. the plateau with the Middle Kingdom nomarchal tombs) concentrated around the monumental tomb of Djehutihotep (17 L 20 / 1) and the one to its east, which belonged to Amenemhat (17 L 22 / 1). The discovery that the burial corridor of the former tomb was dug through an older burial shaft 17 L 20 / 1 B, proves that Djehutihotep was not the first to build in the area. The general form of shaft 17 L 20 / 1 B as well as a small amount of late Old Kingdom pottery provide the first unmistakable evidence that this part of the cemetery was already used long before the Middle Kingdom. There are also two other, unfinished shafts in the immediate neighbourhood which are of the same type as 17 L 20 / 1 B. Excavations in 17 L 20 / 1 A-B yielded only few finds of intrinsic interest, apart from large amounts of decorated wall surface fragments of Djehutihotep’s tomb chapel. The most surprising find was some parts of a limestone obelisk, which may have {{stood in front of the}} tomb and which is one of the very few known private obelisks of the entire Middle Kingdom. The burial corridor 17 L 20 / 1 A was built in two phases, and was never entirely finished. Comparative study of the measurements of the entrance shaft and the burial chamber suggests the outer coffin must have been over 3 m long and about 1. 50 m. wide, a size closely similar to that of other nomarch coffins from the site. Two niches in the rear part of the burial chamber may have been part of a pulley system enabling the workers involved in the burial to haul the coffin into the tomb from the outside. Work in tomb 17 L 22 / 1 now permits for the first time to envisage the architectural form of this building, and how it relates to the Djehutihotep tomb. Zone 4, on the north flank of the Wādī Nakhla below zone 2, is usually referred to in the literature as an Old Kingdom/First Intermediate Period cemetery, although thus far this rested on impressions rather than evidence. Our research showed that some very large Old Kingdom elite tombs do in fact exist here. Tomb 16 L 34 / 1 contains an Ernennungsurkunde dated to the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferefre and tomb 15 N 56 / 1, belonging to Nyankhnemty and Nyankhhathor must be of a roughly similar date. Far more unexpected is the discovery that zone 4 contained some large Middle Kingdom burials with sloping passages, which once contained rich elite burials not much inferior to those in zone 2. Equally unexpected is the presence, throughout zone 4, of large amounts of Second Intermediate Period and early New Kingdom burials, including some with evidence for the presence of the Pan-Grave culture. After this, Dayr al-Barshā lost its appeal as a burial site, until the Ptolemaic Period, which has left a few traces. The small selection of tombs that has so far been investigated in Zone 7, points towards a date of their original use in the Sixth Dynasty. The reuse in this area seems to have been far less intense than in Zone 4 for funerary purposes, while Coptic habitation of the tombs occurred regularly. However, the original architecture of the tombs was left relatively unmodified by the Copts in comparison to the tombs of Zone 4. The restoration inscriptions of Djehutinakht, son of Teti, occur only in decorated Old Kingdom tombs, but so far no trace of any actual restoration activity has turned up. After four seasons of excavations on the western island the layout and composition of the cemetery in the desert plain (zone 9) are gradually becoming clear. The tombs range from large, well-built, vaulted mud brick tombs to shallow pit tombs with a poor funerary equipment. These varied tomb types are arranged in walled complexes. Work during the 2004 season was concentrated in four places. Three were tomb complexes already discovered and partially investigated in 2003 (10 O 13, 10 O 22 and 10 O 15). The fourth was tomb complex 10 N 55 situated near the Middle Kingdom cemetery road, just across tomb 10 N 15 / 1 which was excavated in 2002. The main aim of the 2005 season was to complete the documentation of complexes 10 O 13 and 10 O 15, and to excavate the triple shaft tomb 10 N 55 / 1. In 2005 we also carried out an <b>emergency</b> <b>excavation</b> of a tomb which had collapsed under the modern road which borders the zone 9 on the west. Analysis of the human remains focussed on finds material unearthed from 2002 - 2005 in zones 4, 7, and 9, with a minimum number of individuals of 40 from zone 4, 10 from zone 7, and 29 from zone 9. Some interesting patterns can be noted. The demographic breakdown for zone 4 shows that adult males are the most numerous, although this sexual bias may be due partly to poor preservation. The poor representation of juveniles, and particularly infants and fetuses, is however likely significant. A similar, but even more striking example of the missing juvenile cohort is evident in zone 9, dating prediominantly to the early Middle Kingdom. Pathological data shows a myriad of disease and traumatic injuries that these individuals suffered from. Pathologies of the spine indicate that many of the deceased had been involved in some sort of heavy labour. Dental pathologies are also very prevalent, due to grit and sand in the food and air. This condition leads the dentition to be exposed to pathogens which create caries and dental abscesses The ceramic analysis is beginning to produce coherent patterns. The report offers a first overview of the most frequently attested pottery types dating between the late Old Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period. The report is concluded by brief accounts on quarry research and the study of the early Christian remains at Dayr Abū Hinnis. status: publishe...|$|E
