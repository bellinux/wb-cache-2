40|$|We {{investigated}} ram-pressure effects by an intracluster wind on {{an inner}} disk of spiral galaxies by a hydrodynamical simulation. Even {{if the wind}} is mild and {{not strong enough to}} strip the gas disk, the ram pressure <b>disturbs</b> <b>orbits</b> of the inter-arm gas significantly. This results in asymmetric dense molecular arms in the inner few kpc region of a galaxy. This mechanism would explain the asymmetric CO gas distributions in the central regions often observed in Virgo spirals. Comment: To appear in PASJ. 7 pages, 3 gif figure...|$|R

[...] The boost in star formation in NGC 5713 may be linked to the gravitational interactions with NGC 5719. The interactions are expected to <b>disturb</b> the <b>orbits</b> of gas clouds in NGC 5713, thus causing the clouds to collide with each other. The collisions cause the clouds to collapse and form new stars, hence leading to the increased star formation seen in NGC 5713.|$|R

50|$|An {{unexpected}} major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast {{volumes of}} dense materials {{beneath the surface}} of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations ("mascons") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly <b>disturb</b> the <b>orbits</b> of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we derive the {{analytical}} solution of a satellite <b>orbit</b> <b>disturbed</b> by atmospheric drag. The disturbance force vector is first transformed and rotated to the orbital frame {{so that it}} can be used in the simplified Gaussian equations of satellite motion. Then, the force vector is expanded to triangular functions of the Keplerian angular elements and the disturbances are separated into three parts: short-periodic terms with triangular functions of M, long-periodic terms with triangular functions of (ω, i) and secular terms [non-periodic functions of (a, e) ] with a program using mathematical symbolic operation software. The integrations are then carried out with respect to M, (ω, i) and t, respectively, to obtain {{the analytical}} solutions of satellite <b>orbits</b> <b>disturbed</b> by atmospheric drag. Some interesting conclusions are obtained theoretically. The atmospheric disturbance force is not a function of Ω. The semimajor axis a of the orbital ellipse is reduced in a constant and strong manner by the air disturbance; the shape of the ellipse (eccentricity e) changes towards a more circular orbit in a linear and weak manner. The right ascension of the ascending node Ω and the mean anomaly M are influenced by the disturbance only short periodically. Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{possibility}} that minor mergers resolve the loss cone depletion problem, which is the difficulty occured in the coalescence process of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, by performing numerical simulations with a highly accurate $N$-body code. We show that the minor merger of a dwarf galaxy <b>disturbs</b> stellar <b>orbits</b> in the galactic central region of the host galaxy where the loss cone depletion is already caused by the SMBH binary. The disturbed stars are supplied into the loss cone. Stars of the dwarf galaxy are also supplied into the loss cone. The gravitational interactions between the SMBH binary and these stars become very effective. The gravitational interaction decreases the binding energy of the SMBH binary effectively. As a result, the shrink {{of the separation of}} the SMBH binary is accelerated. Our numerical results strongly suggest that the minor mergers are one of the important processes to reduce the coalescence time of the SMBH binary much less than the Hubble time.

40|$|The {{problem of}} charged {{particle}} motions in magnetotaillike model current sheets is revisited with {{the inclusion of}} a nonzero dawn-dusk magnetic field component. Three cases are examined considering both trapped and escaped orbits. The results show that a nonzero B(y) component <b>disturbs</b> the particle <b>orbits</b> by destroying orbit symmetry in the phase space about the z = 0 plane. It also changes the bounce frequency of particle orbits. The presence of B(y) thus modifies the Speiser orbits, particularly near the ejection phase.

It is noted that many {{particles in}} the solar system have a radiation pressure/gravitational attraction ratio of 0. 5, a condition that holds true for {{particles in the}} asteroid belt. Collisionally <b>disturbed</b> into eccentric <b>orbits,</b> the particles could collect frosty grains in the outermost solar system. IRAS revealed the presence of many of these grains in the asteroid belt. It is numerically shown that the agglomeration of many subkilometer radius asteroids deflected into the outer solar system by orbital perturbations induced by Jupiter could provide a nucleating location for the outwardly-migrated grains. Techniques which could be employed to test the hypothesis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} the motion and {{deposition}} of oblate and prolate spheroids in the nano- and microscale was developed. The aim was to mimic {{the environment of the}} human lung, but the model is general and can be applied for different flows and geometries for small nonspherical particle Stokes and Reynolds numbers. A study of the motion and orientation of a single oblate and prolate particle has been done yielding that Brownian motion <b>disturbs</b> the Jeffery <b>orbits</b> for small particles. Prolate microparticles still display distinguishable orbits while oblate particles of the same size do not. A statistical study was done comparing the deposition efficiencies of oblate and prolate spheroids of different size and aspect ratio observing that smaller particles have higher deposition rate for lower aspect ratio while larger particles have higher deposition rates for large aspect ratio.

50|$|The migrations of {{the giant}} planets and {{encounters}} between them have many impacts throughout the Solar System. The gravitational encounters between the giant planets excite their eccentricities and inclinations. The planetesimals scattered inward by Neptune enter planet-crossing orbits, initiating the Late Heavy Bombardment. Impacts of these planetesimals leave craters and impact basins on the moons of the outer planets, and may result in the disruption of their inner moons. Some of those planetesimals with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are jump-captured as Jupiter trojans when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during encounters with the ejected ice giant. One group of Jupiter trojans can be depleted relative to the other if the ice giant passes through it following the ice giant's last encounter with Jupiter. Later, when Jupiter and Saturn are near mean-motion resonances, other Jupiter trojans can be captured via the mechanism described in the original Nice model.Other planetesimals are captured as irregular satellites {{of the giant}} planets via three-body interactions during encounters between the ejected ice giant and the other planets. The irregular satellites begin with wide range of inclinations including prograde, retrograde, and perpendicular orbits. The population is later reduced as those in perpendicular orbits are lost due to the Kozai mechanism, and others are broken up by collisions among them. The encounters between planets can also <b>disturb</b> the <b>orbits</b> of the regular satellites and {{may be responsible for}} the inclination of Iapetus's orbit. Saturn's rotational axis may have been tilted when it slowly crosses a spin-orbit resonance with Neptune.|$|R
40|$|In transiting {{planetary}} systems, {{the angle}} between the {{orbital angular momentum}} and the stellar spin is usually constrained through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect observed in radial velocity and can be subject to large uncertainties, especially for hot stars (T_eff > 6250 K). It is thus interesting to have an alternative method to constrain {{the value of the}} obliquity and to detect companions that might have <b>disturbed</b> the <b>orbit</b> of the planet. We show how the long-term variations in the transit duration (TDV) can be used to constrain the obliquity of the stellar rotation axis. We introduce a simple theory to express the secular variations in the orbital elements and their effects on the TDVs with a general formulation valid for both oblique and eccentric systems. Parameters or orbital elements that cannot be directly measured, such as the longitude of the ascending node of the orbit, are avoided thus allowing us a straightforward application. We compute the expected TDVs for the presently known transiting systems, adopting their parameters found in the literature. Considering the capabilities of the present or next generation space-borne telescopes, we point out the systems that could be readily observed and discuss the constraints derivable on their fundamental parameters. TDVs can be used to constrain the obliquity of the stars (and possibly of the planets in systems younger than 10 [...] 100 Myr), giving information about the formation scenarios, the strength of the tidal coupling, and the internal structure of both the stars and the planets. Moreover, they can provide an indirect indication of the presence of other bodies, even with a mass comparable with that of the Earth, because they give rise to additional contributions to the nodal precession.

Barely a month after its discovery was announced, on 14 April 1930, {{in an article in}} the New York Times, Armin O.

50|$|Believers in Planet X/Nibiru {{have often}} {{confused}} it with Nemesis, a hypothetical star first proposed by physicist Richard A. Muller. In 1984, Muller postulated that mass extinctions were not random, but appeared {{to occur in}} the fossil record with a loose periodicity that ranged from 26 to 34 million years. He attributed this supposed pattern to a heretofore undetected companion to the Sun, either a dim red dwarf or a brown dwarf, lying in an elliptical, 26-million-year orbit. This object, which he named Nemesis, would, once every 26 million years, pass through the Oort cloud, the shell of over a trillion icy objects believed to be the source of long-period comets that orbit at thousands of times Pluto's distance from the Sun. Nemesis's gravity would then <b>disturb</b> the comets' <b>orbits</b> and send them into the inner Solar System, causing the Earth to be bombarded. However, to date no direct evidence of Nemesis has been found. Though the idea of Nemesis appears similar to the Nibiru cataclysm, they are, in fact, very different, as Nemesis, if it existed, would have an orbital period thousands of times longer, and would never come near Earth itself.|$|R
50|$|Haret’s major {{scientific}} {{contribution was}} made in 1878, in his Ph.D. thesis Sur l’invariabilité des grandes axes des orbites planétaires. At {{the time it was}} known that planets <b>disturb</b> each other’s <b>orbits,</b> thus deviating from the elliptic motion described by Johannes Kepler’s First Law. Pierre Laplace (in 1773) and Joseph Louis Lagrange (in 1776) had already studied the problem, both of them showing that the major axes of the orbits are stable, by using a first degree approximation of the perturbing forces. In 1808 Siméon Denis Poisson had proved that the stability also holds when using second degree approximations. In his thesis, Haret proved by using third degree approximations that the axes are not stable as previously believed, but instead feature a time variability, which he called secular perturbations. This result implies that planetary motion is not absolutely stable. Henri Poincaré considered this result a great surprise and continued Haret’s research, which eventually led him to the creation of chaos theory. Félix Tisserand recommended the extension of Haret's method to other astronomic problems and, much later, in 1955, Jean Meffroy restarted Haret’s research using new techniques.|$|R

5000|$|The phrase {{refers to}} an {{orbiting}} body (a planet or protoplanet) [...] "sweeping out" [...] its orbital region over time, by gravitationally interacting with smaller bodies nearby. Over many orbital cycles, a large body will tend to cause small bodies either to accrete with it, or to be <b>disturbed</b> to another <b>orbit,</b> or to be captured either as a satellite or into a resonant orbit. As a consequence it does not then share its orbital region with other bodies of significant size, except for its own satellites, or other bodies governed by its own gravitational influence. This latter restriction excludes objects whose orbits may cross but that will never collide with each other due to orbital resonance, such as Jupiter and its trojans, Earth and 3753 Cruithne, or Neptune and the plutinos. As {{to the extent of}} orbit clearing required, Jean-Luc Margot emphasises [...] "a planet can never completely clear its orbital zone, because gravitational and radiative forces continually perturb the orbits of asteroids and comets into planet-crossing orbits" [...] and states that the IAU did not intend the impossible standard of impeccable orbit clearing.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we derive to {{the second}} order (5 × 10 - 6) the {{analytical}} solution of a satellite <b>orbit</b> <b>disturbed</b> by the lunar gravitational force. The force vector is first expanded to omit terms smaller than the third order (10 - 9). Then, four terms of potential functions are derived from the expanded force vector and set into the Lagrangian equations of satellite motion to obtain the theoretical solutions. For the first term of the potential functions, the solutions are derived directly. For the second term, mathematical expansions and transformations are used to separate disturbances into three parts: short-periodic terms with triangular functions of M, long-periodic terms with triangular functions of (ω, i, ω) and secular terms with non-periodic functions of (a, e). The integrations are then carried out with respect to M, (ω, i, ω) and t, to obtain the analytical solutions of satellite orbits with a program using mathematical symbolic operation software. The third potential function differs from the second by a factor and the fourth is simpler than the second. Therefore, the solutions are derived similarly using slightly modified programs, respectively. The results show that only two Keplerian elements (ω, M) are linearly perturbed by lunar gravitation; that is, the lunar attracting force will cause a linear regression (delay) of the perigee (orientation of the ellipse) and a linear delay of the position (mean anomaly) on an Earth satellite. The Keplerian element a (semimajor axis of the ellipse) is not perturbed long periodically as the others. The derived solutions are also valid for solar and planetary gravitational disturbances. Because of the distance differences between the Moon, the Sun and the planets to the Earth or an Earth satellite, the solutions are of third and fourth orders for solar and planetary gravitational disturbances on an Earth satellite, respectively.
