5|$|Bound for <b>Glory</b> is {{considered}} by TNA to be their equivalent to the National Football League's Super Bowl or rival World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania event. As such, TNA used an extensive marketing campaign that involved several wrestlers dressing up as gangsters from the 1920s and 1930s era of Chicago to promote the show {{since it is the}} biggest event the company holds annually. Samoa Joe and The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) participated in some of these promotional video shoots. This was the first Bound for <b>Glory</b> event to use roman numerals in the title. TNA created a section on their company website to promote Bound for <b>Glory</b> IV. TNA released a poster to promote the show featuring Karen Angle, Joe, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, and Gail Kim. The official theme for the show was Tarantula by The Smashing Pumpkins. A contest was held to win upgraded ringside seats, free merchandise, and meet several TNA performers at Bound for <b>Glory</b> IV by wearing a Halloween costume to the event, with a drawing being held {{prior to the start of}} the telecast.|$|E
