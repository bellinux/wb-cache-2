The Standing Committee, of which the chairman is a member, is a permanent body which controls {{the activities of the}} National Assembly when it is not in session. The chairman and {{the other members of the}} Standing Committee have to resign from their posts when the National Assembly dissolves itself, which it normally <b>does</b> <b>every</b> fifth year. The chairman presides over the sessions of the National Assembly and authenticates laws and resolutions passed by the National Assembly by signing them. The chairman leads the activities of the Standing Committee and organises its external relations with other state bodies and is responsible for maintaining cordial relations between the members of the Standing Committee. The deputies of the National Assembly have the right to question the chairman.|$|E

While comics were expected to tell jokes about the administration, the 2006 dinner was held at a time when the relationship between the administration and the media was under great strain, and the administration was sensitive to criticism. Attorney and columnist Julie Hilden concluded that Colbert's [...] "vituperative parody" [...] might have been unfair under different circumstances, but noted that Bush's record of controlling bad press created a heightened justification for people to criticize him when they got the chance. Media Matters [...] and Editor & Publisher came to Colbert's defense, calling his detractors hypocrites.

500|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday {{used the term}} [...] "galactic alignment" [...] to {{describe}} a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in mass extinctions supposedly observed in the fossil record. According to the Shiva Hypothesis, mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, {{it was suggested that}} vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its 250-million-year orbit of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it <b>does</b> <b>every</b> 20–25million years—it comes {{under the influence of the}} far stronger [...] "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact. However, this [...] "alignment" [...] takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date. Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.|$|E
500|$|In {{an honest}} {{description}} of the disadvantages of Florida, Stowe attempts to disabuse readers {{of the notion that}} the region is perfect. She writes, [...] "In New England Nature is an up-and-down smart, decisive, housemother that has her times and seasons and brings up her ends of life with a positive jerk" [...] and contrasts that characterization with Nature in Florida, an [...] "indulgent old grandmother, who has no particular time for any thing and <b>does</b> <b>every</b> thing when she happens to feel like it". Those who wish to live in Florida, Stowe warns, must also get to know its deficiencies: occasional freezing weather in winter, unsculptable lawns, insects and snakes, and people who disagree as they do everywhere else. Were Florida a woman, Stowe writes, she would be a dark brunette, full of jolly untidiness. Malaria is a fact of life, and Stowe cautions Northerners who may be lured to the region by tales of the mild climate to understand that temperature extremes are common, taking particular effort to address consumptives, or those afflicted with tuberculosis. Those who consider moving to the region should weigh all these issues before making their decisions. In The Journal of Southern History, Susan Eacker attests that Stowe's assignment of female characteristics to Florida coincided with her own gradual admission that she may be turning into a [...] "woman's rights woman".|$|E

Hyphen wrote that Whitlock [...] "reinforced the insipid and insidious 'small Asian penis' stereotype". The Asian American Journalists Association demanded an apology.

On February 17, ESPN used a racial slur on its mobile website in the headline [...] "Chink in the Armor" [...] after Lin had nine turnovers in New York's loss to the Hornets. It was removed 35minutes later, and ESPN apologized. The network fired the employee who posted the headline, and suspended ESPNews anchor Max Bretos for using the same reference earlier in the week. Bretos also apologized. Knicks radio announcer Spero Dedes also used the phrase on 1050 ESPN New York, but he was an employee of Madison Square Garden (MSG) and not ESPN.

2500|$|Hay {{published}} a magazine piece entitled Philosophy of laughter {{in which he}} discussed the psychology of comedy. In the essay, he stated [...] "Why <b>does</b> <b>every</b> one of us laugh at seeing somebody else slapped {{in the face with}} a large piece of cold custard pie? Is it because we're all naturally cruel? Or is it because there's something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No. No. and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be - in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall - we tend to identify with the actors we are watching. So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear for a moment that it as been thrown at us. And then, immediately we realise that it hasn't hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh".|$|E

Even with her robotic voice, it's clear that 'You look great by the way, very healthy' is no compliment." [...] GamePros Chris Holt discussed GLaDOS as an icon of feminism, and wrote that as opposed to being an [...] "archetypal villain", she is a [...] "prototypical bound woman". He added that [...] "A female protagonist murdering a female villainess (or vice versa) is not what is interesting to us as critics, but it's the idea that despite her seemingly robotic, unemotional and unstoppable nature, GLaDOS appears vulnerable, sympathetic, and even a victim herself". He wrote [...] "GLaDOS has been augmented because of the danger she presents to a presumably misogynistic society" [...] and that [...] "by destroying these cores, Chell is stripping her of the layers that society has deemed necessary for her to wear" [...] and making her [...] "far more dangerous". He added that Chell and GLaDOS serve as opposing sides of femininity; where Chell is [...] "dutiful and <b>does</b> <b>every</b> task assigned of her", GLaDOS is [...] "aggressive and seemingly dangerous to the order of a male-dominated society". He also described Chell as a [...] "domestic icon" [...] while he described GLaDOS as a [...] "progressive, intelligent working woman" [...] and that by killing her, [...] "Chell {{can be seen as the}} dutiful 'safe' woman conquering the 'dangerous' feminist". He also cited the use of poems by Emily Dickinson, whom he compares to GLaDOS in how both were reclusive and were essentially disembodied voices.|$|E

2500|$|So in {{love with}} praise, both popular and in the highest circles, is Wilberforce, observes Hazlitt, that he was even half {{inclined}} {{to give up his}} favorite cause, abolition of the slave trade, when William Pitt, the Prime Minister, was set to abandon it, and he sided with Pitt in approval of the repressive measures then imposed by the government in Britain and the government's later severe measures during the period of the Napoleonic Wars and afterward. [...] "He has no mercy on those who claim a property in negro-slaves as so much live-stock on their estates ... but not a word has he to say, not a whisper does he breathe against the claim set up by the Despots of the Earth over their Continental subjects, but <b>does</b> <b>every</b> thing in his power to confirm and sanction it! He must give no offence. ... He preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages; and tolerates its worst abuses in civilized states." [...] To [...] "render signal services to mankind" [...] requires greater moral strength than Wilberforce possesses: what is needed is [...] "a severity, a sternness, a self-denial, and a painful sense of duty" [...] that in Wilberforce's case vanish in exchange for a nod of approval from the king or the Prime Minister. Even in Wilberforce's acts of independence from his party's political standpoint, Hazlitt notes a subtle balancing of motives. In the words of Wilberforce biographer William Hague, who quotes Hazlitt's Spirit of the Age criticism, [...] "Hazlitt considered that Wilberforce meant well, but would never risk becoming unpopular with the ruling establishment: 'He ... reaps the credit of independence without the obloquy ... He has all the air of the most perfect independence, and gains a character for impartiality and candour, when he is only striking a balance between the éclat of differing from a Minister on some vantage ground, and the risk or odium that may attend it.|$|E
