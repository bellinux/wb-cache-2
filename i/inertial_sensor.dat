25|$|An air bag is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one {{on the passenger side}} as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard on the passenger side, the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor</b> for crash detection.

40|$|The {{usage of}} <b>inertial</b> <b>sensors</b> has {{traditionally}} been confined primarily to the aviation and marine industry due to their associated cost and bulkiness. During the last decade, however, <b>inertial</b> <b>sensors</b> have undergone a rather dramatic reduction in both size and cost {{with the introduction of}} micro-machined electromechanical system (mems) technology. As a result of this trend, <b>inertial</b> <b>sensors</b> have become commonplace for many applications and can even be found in many consumer products, for instance smart phones, cameras and game consoles. Due to the drift inherent in <b>inertial</b> technology, <b>inertial</b> <b>sensors</b> are typically used in combination with aiding sensors to stabilize and improve the estimates.

Methods: This was a laboratory-based, repeated-measures design with ten healthy participants. Concurrent validity was tested between an <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor,</b> forceplate, and rigid-body kinematics across three commonly used balance tests. Further, the <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor</b> measures were compared across eight commonly used tests of balance. Variables manipulated include stance position, surface condition, and eyes-open versus eyes-closed. Results: The <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor</b> was correlated to both the forceplate-derived measures (r= 0. 793) and rigid-body kinematics (r= 0. 887). Significant differences between the balance tests were observed when tested with the <b>inertial</b> <b>sensor.</b> In general, there was a three-way interactions between the three balance factors (surface, stance, and vision) leading to pairwise comparisons between each balance test. The root-mean-square showed an increase across tasks of greater difficulty ranging from an average of 0. 0368 with two legs, eyes-open to 0. 911 when tested during tandem stance, eyes-closed tested on a foam pad.
