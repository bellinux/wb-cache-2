50|$|During {{the first}} months of the war the Australian defence forces were without anyone {{specially}} trained in the tactical operation of radar and in March 1940 each service selected an officer to be sent to Britain for this purpose. The RAAF candidate was Pilot Officer Albert Pither who had previously completed an RAF signals course in England. In September 1940 he was posted to Britain for a two-month course in the tactical uses of radar including inspection of equipment in each of the British services. Pither was in Britain when the technology was put to use during the Battle of Britain. He returned to Australia by way of radar centres in Canada and the United States of America. In May 1941 Pither was promoted to Wing Commander in charge of the Radar Section of the RAAF Directorate of Signals. He began developing a plan to surround Australia with a chain of radar stations based on his experience with the British Chain Home system which relied on <b>fixed</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receiver towers. He also established a Radio (radar) School at the Richmond RAAF Station near Sydney. In early November 1941, one month before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the RAAF was given full responsibility for Australia's early warning radar operations and adopted Pither's radar defence strategy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—During the {{experimental}} data processing, {{we find that}} corner reflectors cannot be focused properly using 3 -D SAR with a moving transmitter due to the phase reversal phenomenon based on the phase history analysis, i. e., the phases at different observation angles might shift rad, and the echoes cancel, rather than accumulate, to each other. To overcome this defect, 3 -D SAR with <b>fixed</b> <b>transmitter</b> is designed. Since the geometry of the transmitter and targets remains unchanged during the observation session, the coherence of echoes is well preserved. The mechanism of 3 -D SAR with <b>fixed</b> <b>transmitter</b> can accurately be explained using the Stratton-Chu equation. For perfect conductor, the 3 -D image {{is related to the}} electric current density. For general dielectric medium, the 3 -D image is related to the electric current density, magnetic current density and directional vector of scatterer. Experimental results show that one can focus corner reflectors and cavity-shaped objects by fixing the transmitter, which might fail for the traditional 3 -D SAR because of the phase reversal phenomenon. 1...|$|E

The zone consists of a 13000 sq mi piece of land where <b>fixed</b> <b>transmitters</b> must coordinate their emissions before a license is granted.

With the advent of wireless technology and microprocessors in everything from cameras to cars, it is difficult to keep the sites free of radio interference. To aid in limiting outside interference, the area surrounding the Green Bank observatory was at one time planted with pines characterized by needles of a certain length to block electromagnetic interference at the wavelengths used by the observatory. At one point, the observatory faced the problem of North American flying squirrels tagged with US Fish & Wildlife Service telemetry transmitters. Electric fences, electric blankets, faulty automobile electronics, and other radio wave emitters have caused great trouble for the astronomers in Green Bank.

Exposure from <b>fixed</b> site <b>transmitters</b> at home and school was calculated by using a geospatial propagation model.

All analyses were adjusted for relevant confounders.; Mean exposure (median; 75 (th)) for broadcast transmitters, downlink and total exposure at baseline were 1. 9  μW/m(2) (1. 0  μW/m(2); 2. 8  μW/m(2)), 14. 4  μW/m(2) (3. 8  μW/m(2); 11. 0  μW/m(2)) and 16. 3  μW/m(2) (5. 8  μW/m(2); 13. 4  μW/m(2)), respectively.

Recently, the hypercube has been proposed as a virtual topology for TWDM multihop lightwave networks based on optical passive star couplers.
