[...] The Times also gave it all five stars, saying that [...] "the really ingenious element is the Drivatar AI, {{in which the}} computer learns your driving technique." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Car handling is demanding, but beginners can instantly have fun, thanks to helpful driving assists and generous early prizes." [...] However, Jim Schaefer of Detroit Free Press gave it three stars out of four, saying, [...] "man, is this game difficult, even on the easy setting. I prefer games with unreal speed, power boosts and shortcuts.

2500|$|Sound the Alarm is {{the first}} album in a trilogy with the theme of self-discovery. It was {{followed}} by Under the Boards (2007) and Daybreak (2011). Conley said that Sound the Alarm was [...] "an expression of discontent. Under the Boards is reflection and remorse. Daybreak is acceptance." [...] He {{also said that the}} three-album concept was: [...] "just a bit of a therapeutic experiment". I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldn’t really deal with the world or myself. So I was just like this has got to end, I have to at least try and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the world and on myself. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought out what I was finding, so the first album was filled with all the anger, the surface pain, and all the paranoid delusional thoughts that were there.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Takei {{starred in}} the musical Allegiance, which Takei {{described}} as his legacy project. The show is based on Takei's own experiences and research into the Japanese American internment of World War II and premiered at the Old Globe Theatre in Balboa Park in San Diego, California. Allegiance debuted on Broadway on November 8, 2015, to mixed reviews. The Guardian said it was [...] "unexceptional though often affecting"; Deadline called it [...] "a triumph of a rare sort, shedding light in a dark corner of our history with uncommon generosity of spirit." [...] The New York Times praised the [...] "well-intentioned and polished" [...] play for tackling a difficult subject while trying {{at the same time}} to entertain its audience, but said Allegiance [...] "struggles to balance both ambitions, and doesn't always find an equilibrium." [...] The Associated Press said Allegiance tries to tackle internment camps, discrimination and war, [...] "but does so unsuccessfully in a bombastic and generic Broadway musical." [...] Variety wrote, [...] "In their sincere efforts to 'humanize' their complex historical material, the creatives have oversimplified and reduced it to generic themes." [...] The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "the powerful sentiments involved are too often flattened by the pedestrian lyrics and unmemorable melodies of Jay Kuo's score". USA Today called Allegiance [...] "as corny as Kansas in August and as obvious as Lady Gaga on a red carpet. But darned if it won't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> your heartstrings." ...|$|E

60|$|The Government {{wanted to}} save the Blacks from {{ultimate}} extermination, if possible. One of its schemes was to capture them and coop them up, on a neighboring island, under guard. Bodies of Whites volunteered for the hunt, for the pay was good--L5 for each Black captured and delivered, but the success achieved was not very satisfactory. The Black was naked, and his body was greased. It was hard to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> him that would hold. The Whites moved about in armed bodies, and surprised little families of natives, and did make captures; but it was suspected that in these surprises half a dozen natives were killed to one caught--and {{that was not what}} the Government desired.|$|E
6000|$|With a quick {{intake of}} breath he tried to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> himself. He thought of the battles he had fought with bullies older and bigger than himself, and had won because he had kept {{his head in the}} heat of contest and had coolly taken {{advantage}} of every opening. But that was different. Then he was in action and it was easier to keep cool. Then, too, if he missed one blow there was a chance for another. It was this sitting still with the knowledge that there would be but one chance, and that this must be taken at just the right moment or be lost forever that upset him so. Then curiously enough the motto of the Boy Scouts flashed into his head--"Be prepared." [...] It was like a tonic to his shaking nerves.

Then he turned swiftly and flung himself upon the farmer, crushing his soft felt hat down to his chin. Grant could see nothing, and while he strove to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> his antagonist he was thrown violently backward off the driving seat. The wagon was of the usual high pattern, and he came down on the ground with a crash that nearly knocked him unconscious. Before he got up, he was seized firmly and held with his shoulders pressed against the soil. He struggled, however, until somebody grasped his legs and his arms were drawn forcibly apart. It was impossible to see, because the thick hat was still over his face and somebody held it fast, but he had an idea that three or four men had fallen upon him. They had, no doubt, been hidden among the brush; the affair had been carefully arranged with his treacherous companion.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the more}} celebrated {{technologies}} of the era, {{such as the}} telephone, the telegraph, and the light bulb, the corset {{was the product of}} many inventors, making and patenting improvements, and fighting about their rights in court. As American women donned their corsets, they were enacting a daily intimate relationship with a heavily patent-protected technology. The corset during these decades was deeply embedded both within the social construction of gender and sexuality, as a marker of femininity and respectability, and within the United States patent system, as a commercial good in which many claimed intellectual property rights. <b>Getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> <b>on</b> the corset, then, offers a way to simultaneously consider gender, sexuality, and patent law.|$|R

Moreover, analyses of the grasping kinematics revealed <b>an</b> enlarged maximum <b>grip</b> aperture {{in the presence of}} large numbers. RT effects remained present when controlling for the number of fingers used while grasping but disappeared when participants pointed to the object.
