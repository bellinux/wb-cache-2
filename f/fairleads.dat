25|$|With few exceptions, the hull, ramp, {{and power}} plant of the LCA {{remained}} the same throughout the war. Early on the coxswain's position was moved from aft to forward on the starboard side. Other particulars could vary greatly; some LCAs having Direction finding antenna loops, others Danforth anchors on vertical racks forward. The hatch layout on the stern deck varied, as did the placement and type of mooring bits, chocks, cleats, <b>fairleads,</b> and fuel caps. Photographic evidence shows all these variations and also differences in {{the placement of the}} lifelines that were looped along either hullside for men in the water.|$|E
25|$|The bell is {{deployed}} {{over the}} side of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame or through a moon pool. Deployment usually starts by lowering the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, through a set of sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. The bell hangs from a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the <b>fairleads</b> guide it down the clump weight cables to the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Sydney {{paid off}} at Sydney on 8 May 1928 {{and arrived at}} Cockatoo Island in 1929, where she was broken up. The ship's {{foremast}} was retained, and in 1934, it was erected at Bradleys Head by the floating crane Titan. This initially served as {{a monument to the}} engagement against Emden, but was rededicated in 1964 as a monument for all Australian ships lost and all sailors killed in the line of duty. Part of the bow, including the stem head, jackstaff, and <b>fairleads,</b> was set into the seawall at Milsons Point, under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. One of the cruiser's derricks is on display in the Victory Memorial Gardens in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, and a compass stand is located at Port Macquarie, New South Wales. The main top-mast was erected at Environa, New South Wales, but rotted at the base and collapsed. It was later moved to Jervis Bay.|$|E
50|$|If {{the line}} {{is meant to be}} moved while in the <b>fairlead,</b> the angle in the line created by the <b>fairlead</b> must be shallow to {{minimize}} friction. For larger angles a block or pulley is used as a <b>fairlead</b> to reduce friction. Where {{the line is}} removed from a hook <b>fairlead</b> before using, the angle is not an issue.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fairlead</b> is {{a device}} to guide a line, rope or cable around an object, {{out of the way}} or to stop it from moving laterally. Typically a <b>fairlead</b> will be a ring or hook. The <b>fairlead</b> may be a {{separate}} piece of hardware, or it could be a hole in the structure.|$|R

Wind deflectors were fitted on {{the leading edge of the}} bridge area and a canvas-covered shelter was installed on the quarterdeck to provide better weather protection for depth charge crews. Oiling <b>fairleads</b> were fitted to the edge of the hull by the anchor winch. The bilge keels were lengthened and made deeper (a process that took a minimum of three weeks).|$|E

50|$|Fairlead-A U-shape or {{circular}} fitting often positioned {{near the}} bow that leads an anchor warp or a sheet to a cleat or winch. The anchor <b>fairlead</b> is usually bronze or stainless steel {{as it must}} take the regular abrasion of the warp and chain. The anchor <b>fairlead</b> is usually set on the change of angle between the deck and the topside to prevent wear and tear.|$|R
40|$|Mooring {{line is a}} {{major source}} of {{stability}} and {{plays a key role in}} the global response of offshore floating wind turbine. In the current state of the research, a formulation based on the analytical catenary equation is most commonly used for the analysis of mooring lines. However, due to the inability of catenary equations to consider the ocean current drag forces on mooring lines, the effect of drag forces on <b>fairlead</b> restoring forces has not been investigated yet. In this study, we have investigated the influence of drag forces on <b>fairlead</b> forces using discrete catenary formulation for modeling mooring line. The discrete catenary formulation has the ability to incorporate ocean current drag forces. Three types of elements; fully suspended, touchdown and seabed element are formulated to model the suspended, touchdown and seabed portion of a slack mooring line, respectively. The influence of viscous drag on the <b>fairlead</b> restoring forces is demonstrated through the analysis of OC 3 -Hywind mooring system subjected to ocean currents. It was found that the viscous drag significantly influences the <b>fairlead</b> forces...|$|R

5000|$|To make it work, the {{backstay}} is led {{through a}} block or <b>fairlead</b> along the deck to a two-legged, second order lever mounted with its fulcrum above deck level. The end of the runner {{is attached to a}} cross-member between the two legs and part way along the lever. When the lever is moved away from the <b>fairlead,</b> tension is placed on the runner on a line below the fulcrum so that the lever is pulled down onto the deck. When the tension is to be released, the lever is thrown towards the <b>fairlead.</b> When released, the amount of slack in the runner is therefore twice the distance of the attachment point from the fulcrum. It is not necessary to have great leverage as the adjustment is made at a point in the manoeuvring of the boat when the rigging is slack. The significant point is that the lever should be designed to take up the required amount of slack.|$|R

50|$|Finally, the {{fittings}} such as swivels or crutch plate, painter ring, stretchers, keel {{and stem}} band are fitted and fixed with screws. In a sailing dinghy, {{there would be}} more fittings such as <b>fairleads,</b> horse, shroud plates, mast step, toe straps and so on.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>fairleads</b> {{are most}} {{frequently}} found in nautical applications, they can be found anywhere [...] is used. In off-roading, a fairlead is used to guide the winch cable and remove lateral strain from the winch. A roller fairlead is used with steel cable and a hawse fairlead is used with synthetic cable.|$|E
5000|$|Among other features, the Ibex {{can be built}} or {{delivered}} with Foer's patented Vector winching system. A winch is mounted centrally in the vehicle, and the cable runs to <b>fairleads</b> front and rear. This allows the vehicle to pull in either direction, or pull out the cable and secure it both ways, so that the vehicle can pull along the cable like a cable car. http://www.4wdonline.com/Foers/Winch.html ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Fairleads</b> {{are used}} {{on almost every}} {{sailboat}}. Even as simple a sailboat as a Sunfish has a fairlead for each of its two lines. A ring fairlead holds the halyard parallel to the mast so its cleat can be located near to the cockpit. On models without a deck block for the sheet, a hook fairlead in the forward edge of the cockpit gives the sailor options when handling the sheet.|$|E
50|$|An {{aluminium}} mast and boom {{are used}} to set a bermuda rig of mainsail and jib. To keep things simple, the jib sheets lead to fixed <b>fairleads</b> and cam-cleats, the mainsail is loose-footed, and the mainsheet leads to a rope horse across the transom. ClamCleats may be present to allow this mainsheet traveller to be adjusted. The standard mainsail has three fibreglass battens, and can be shaped using a kicking strap and Cunningham.|$|E
50|$|Various {{hardware}} {{is found}} {{attached to the}} boom. The hardware could include <b>fairleads,</b> blocks, block tracks, and cleats. For attachment, screws are used on wooden booms and screws or rivets on aluminium booms. If {{the foot of the}} sail is attached to the boom, there may be hoops from the foot of the sail, around the boom, or there may be a track {{on the top of the}} boom into which fittings on the foot of the sail are slid.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fairlead</b> {{can also}} be used to stop a {{straight}} run of line from vibrating or rubbing on another surface. An additional use on boats is to keep a loose end of line from sliding around the deck (e.g. the windward (inactive) jib sheet).|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} hook <b>fairlead</b> {{can be seen}} on {{buildings}} with an angled flagstaff mounted over a door. At the base of the flagstaff is usually a hook so the flag halyard can be held parallel to the pole, and still tied off to a cleat beside the door, rather than above.|$|R
25|$|A Laser's {{date and}} place of {{manufacture}} can be determined {{by looking at the}} serial number stamped into the transom or under the <b>fairlead</b> on the bow on older hulls.

50|$|The skidders use {{the same}} 6V53 Detroit Diesel engine and {{steering}} gearbox as the M113, but utilized a more heavily built undercarriage and a 4-speed Clark powershift transmission. The skidder either came as a cable arch model, with a tilting tray to set the logs on (A hydraulic grapple attachment was later offered to fit over the cable <b>fairleads).</b> Or as a Clam-Bunk forwarder, with a Prentice grapple mounted {{on the roof of}} the cab. Dealers also modified the base tractor to handle various forestry and utility jobs.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, clewlines are {{attached}} to the outer corners or clews of the sail. They lift more weight than the buntlines, and also have to pull against the sheets - although these will have been released there is still a certain amount of friction produced by the blocks and <b>fairleads</b> that they run through. For this reason the clewlines are usually fitted with blocks to increase the mechanical advantage. The clewlines are coloured green in the diagram, and run along the underside of the yard from the outboard ends to the mast, and then down to the deck.|$|E

40|$|The oil {{production}} in deepwater demands a previous {{knowledge of the}} floating units behavior when anchored under a specific environmental conditions and, thus, the programs of numerical simulations are fundamental tools. In this paper is shown a validated model to calculate the catenary static configuration, non-rigid to flexion and submitted to current profile in line plane direction and its own weight. There is also a consideration of soil bathymetry and horizontal or slanting plane, where line can lay down (conventional configuration) or be just suspended (taut-leg configuration). All the developed procedures are implemented in a program called CATENA and the results obtained, {{as well as the}} comparison to different programs that use other methods to calculate catenary configuration, are presented in the end. The main utility of CATENA is the possibility to determine the line configuration by many parameters, as geometrical or mechanical. In CATENA, is possible to give one of these referred parameters to determinate lines configuration, that can be horizontal, vertical or strain forces on <b>fairlead</b> or on anchor, mooring radius (the horizontal distance between anchor and <b>fairlead),</b> the angle between horizontal and strain force on <b>fairlead</b> and on anchor or the length of backed or suspended cable. The output data are these entire characteristics and line configuration. This program is a worthwhile tool for naval engineering due to its particular features that will be presented and the good results obtained in comparison to other methods.
