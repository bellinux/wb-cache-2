40|$|High-pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> is an {{important}} component of the fuel injection system of diesel engine, it suffer complex loading from engine. The fatigue life of <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> has great impact on reliability of engine. In this study, the fluid-solid coupling model which considers the action of fuel is established. Analysis on the effect of fuel’s pressure oscillation on the mode is carried out. Through the simulation comparisons, the mode frequency and mode shape of each model are all analysed. Base on the fluid-solid coupling model, frequency response analysis is done to study the reliability of high-pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe.</b> The results show that the pressure oscillation of fuel has important influence on the mode frequency. The maximum Stress Tensor and Vibration Velocity appeared at the position of first order mode frequency.

40|$|The inner {{diameter}} of high pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> {{has a significant}} effect on the fuel injection process and the performance of a diesel engine. The spray impact force of each nozzle hole of a conventional injection system of pump-line-nozzle for diesel engine (based on the spray momentum flux) and the injection pressure (on a fuel injection pump test rig) were measured. With varying fuel injection quantities and pump speed, the effects of the {{inner diameter}} of the high pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> on <b>fuel</b> injection process and the fuel injection characteristics of each nozzle hole were analyzed. It was noted from experimental results that the fuel injection pressure changes with variations in the inner diameter of the high pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> and also the injection duration gradually increases with increase in the inner diameter. At low injection pump speed, even with the same geometric fuel deliver rate, the injection duration also increases gradually. Due to throttling effect and reduction in injection pressure, the fuel injection quantities of the injection nozzle were relatively minimal when the inner diameters of the high pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> were respectively small and large. The optimum injection pipe inner diameter for the right quantity for fuel injection falls between the two cases (between small and large). In addition, the injection rate of each nozzle hole increases with the decrease in angle between the needle axis and each of the nozzle hole axis. The fuel injection quantity of each nozzle hole increases while their relative difference decreases with increasing pump speed...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{effort is}} in progress to further validate the National Combustion Code (NCC) that has been developed at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) for comprehensive modeling and simulation of aerospace combustion systems. The validation efforts include numerical simulation of the gas-phase combustor experiments conducted at the Center for Turbulence Research (CTR), Stanford University, followed by comparison and evaluation of the computed results with the experimental data. Presently, at GRC, a numerical model of the experimental gaseous combustor is built to simulate the experimental model. The constructed numerical geometry includes the flow development sections for air annulus and <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe,</b> 24 channel air and fuel swirlers, hub, combustor, and tail pipe. Furthermore, a three-dimensional multi-block, multi-grid grid (1. 6 million grid points, 3 -levels of multi-grid) is generated. Computational simulation of the gaseous combustor flow field operating on methane fuel has started. The computational domain includes the whole flow regime starting from the <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> and the air annulus, through the 12 air and 12 fuel channels, in the combustion region and through the tail pipe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Computer {{software}} {{has been}} developed and {{described in the present}} study of thorough parametric analysis and design of a mechanical diesel fuel injection system. The method is based on the numerical solution of one dimensional, unsteady, incompressible flow equations through the <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe</b> along with appropriate initial condition, pump end boundary condition and nozzle end boundary condition. Method of characteristics was used to solve the mathematical model by using a finite difference technique. The computer program has been written in Visual Fortran, which is capable of calculating pressure, velocity and other related parameters at different cam angles at any location of the <b>fuel</b> <b>pipe,</b> including pump and nozzle ends. First of all the numerical scheme was optimized and then its authenticity was verified by comparing its results with calculated and measured results available in the literature. The calculations of the present software were found to have improved agreement and acceptability. It was then used to make a thorough parametric analysis of a typical fuel injection system. The results have been presented in the form of graphs...|$|R
50|$|In general, pogo {{oscillation}} {{occurs when}} a surge in engine pressure increases back pressure against the fuel coming into the engine, reducing engine pressure, causing more fuel {{to come in and}} increasing engine pressure again. Flexing of <b>fuel</b> <b>pipes</b> can also induce fluctuations in fuel pressure. If the cycle happens to match a resonance frequency of the rocket then dangerous oscillations can occur through positive feedback, which can, in extreme cases, tear the vehicle apart.|$|R
