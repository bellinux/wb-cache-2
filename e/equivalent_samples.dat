40|$|The {{comparison}} of means derived from samples of noisy data {{is a standard}} part of climatology. When the data are not serially correlated the appropriate statistical tool for this task is usually the conventional Student's t-test. However, data frequently are serially correlated in climatological applications {{with the result that}} the t-tests in its standard form is not applicable. The usual solution to this problem is to scale the t-statistic by a factor which depends upon the <b>equivalent</b> <b>sample</b> size n_e. We show, by means of simulations, that the revised t-test is often conservative (the actual significance level is smaller than the specified significance level) when the <b>equivalent</b> <b>sample</b> size is known. However, in most practical cases the <b>equivalent</b> <b>sample</b> size is not known. Then the test becomes liberal (the actual significance level is greater than the specified significance level). This systematic error becomes small when the true <b>equivalent</b> <b>sample</b> size is large (greater than approximately 30). We re-examine the difficulties inherent in difference of means tests when there is serial dependence. We provide guidelines for the application of the 'usual' t-test and propose two alternative tests which substantially improve upon the 'usual' t-test when samples are small. (orig.)

40|$|This study {{describes}} an algorithm {{for determining the}} fine phase response of <b>equivalent</b> <b>sampling</b> oscilloscopes of a linear time-invariant response function from its magnitude. The Nose-to-Nose (NTN) calibration method can give the phase response of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>sampling</b> oscilloscopes, but the phase resolution can only achieve 250 MHz because the limit of the technology. In this study the fine phase response has been reconstructed. Although the truncation of the Kramers-Kronig transform using three basic functions may approximate gives rise to large errors in estimated phase, these errors may {{be approximated by using}} three basic functions. This result rests on data obtained by an NTN technique in combination with a swept-sine calibration procedure. The NTN technique yields magnitude and phase information over a broad bandwidth, yet has low frequency resolution. The swept-sine procedure returns only the magnitude of the oscilloscope response function, yet can be made at any frequency at which fundamental microwave power standards are available. As an example, we get the fine phase response of <b>equivalent</b> <b>sampling</b> oscilloscopes Agilent 86100 C from dc to 40 GHz; its frequency resolution achieves 1 MHz. In the process of this analysis, we observe that the true oscilloscope response function as measured by the NTN calibration is indistinguishable from the reconstructed phase response over a very large bandwidth. At last we analyze the phase uncertainty of the phase response, and the uncertainty analysis process is provided. The results show that the algorithm can be used to get the fine phase response of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>sampling</b> oscilloscopes...|$|R
