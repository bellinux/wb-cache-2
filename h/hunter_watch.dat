6000|$|... 'Grandfather!' {{he thought}} without sequence, {{and took out}} his watch. He {{could not see the}} hands, but he set the {{repeater}} going. 'Five o'clock!' His grandfather's first gold <b>hunter</b> <b>watch,</b> butter-smooth with age--all the milling worn from it, and dented with the mark of many a fall. The chime was like a little voice from out of that golden age, when they first came from St. John's Wood, London, to this house--came driving with grandfather in his carriage, and almost instantly took to the trees. Trees to climb, and grandfather watering the geranium-beds below! What was to be done? Tell Dad he must come home? Confide in June?--only she was so--so sudden! Do nothing and trust to luck? After all, the Vac. would soon be over. Go up and see Val and warn him off? But how get his address? Holly wouldn't give it him! A maze of paths, a cloud of possibilities! He lit a cigarette. When he had smoked it halfway through his brow relaxed, almost as if some thin old hand had been passed gently over it; and in his ear something seemed to whisper: 'Do nothing; be nice to Holly, be nice to her, my dear!' And Jolly heaved a sigh of contentment, blowing smoke through his nostrils....|$|E
60|$|The cavalcade {{passed out}} by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and {{proceeded}} past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on {{his way through the}} metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold <b>hunter</b> <b>watch</b> not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.|$|E

He was employed at this time as an engineman. He left and started at Cadeby Colliery, near Rotherham, as a winding engineman, and remained there for 24 years. On leaving he was presented with a Gold <b>Hunter</b> <b>Watch</b> by workmen and officials. He was elected as the General Secretary of the National Winding and General Engineers' Society serving for 25 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{whole area}} of the Bratislava Forest Park is an official, active hunting ground. There are seven crops fields for wild animals, three Red deer feeders, 25 Roe deer feeders and 16 <b>hunter's</b> <b>watch</b> towers. There is no hunter's lodge in the park.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Media {{has been}} {{documented}} to significantly impact children and adolescents’ behavior, attitudes, cultural norms, identity development, and normative behaviors. We conducted a content analysis of three waterfowl hunting videos to determine what images and words were being conveyed to hunters, and a mail survey of Illinois waterfowl hunters to test how age may influence viewing of waterfowl hunting media. In particular, we hypothesized that: 1) age will influence whether <b>hunters</b> have <b>watched</b> waterfowl hunting media, and 2) age will influence how often <b>hunters</b> <b>watch</b> them. Overall, 82 % of waterfowl <b>hunters</b> had <b>watched</b> waterfowl hunting media. Age influenced whether hunters, and how often <b>hunters,</b> had <b>watched</b> them; younger <b>hunters</b> {{were more likely to}} have watched the media and watched them significantly more often. Media watching also influenced hunters’ expectations, their identity as a waterfowl hunter, and their perception of the number of birds they harvest when compared to others. Results suggest that media influences waterfowl hunters’ expectations, identity, and behavior, all of which play an important role in how we will manage for waterfowl hunters in the future...|$|R
60|$|The old hermit {{remained}} {{with the boys}} two hours, and then embarked in his canoe and was soon out of sight down the stream leading to Firefly Lake. The young <b>hunters</b> <b>watched</b> him out of sight with some regret. He had told them {{he did not think}} anybody was now on the lake but themselves.|$|R
60|$|The young <b>hunters</b> <b>watched</b> {{out for the}} reappearance of Jed Sanborn, Snap and Shep {{going to}} Firefly Lake for that purpose. Two days later they saw the old hunter coming to the shore with a big {{flat-bottomed}} boat, containing four men. The men were from the circus and said they had come for the captured lion.|$|R
60|$|All of {{the young}} <b>hunters</b> <b>watched</b> the {{approach}} of the old man with interest. He was a very tall individual, with snow-white hair and a flowing beard. He was dressed in a suit of rusty black, and on his head he wore a wide-brimmed straw hat, with a big hole in the top. His canoe was of birch bark, light and strong, and he propelled it with a short, broad paddle.|$|R
60|$|Behind {{one of the}} old oaks {{which we}} have {{described}} in the preceding chapter, shrouding himself from observation like a <b>hunter</b> <b>watching</b> for his game, or an Indian for his enemy, but with different, very different purpose, Tyrrel lay on his breast near the Buck-stane, his eye on the horse-road which winded down the valley, and his ear alertly awake to every sound which mingled with the passing breeze, or with the ripple of the brook.|$|R

60|$|There {{was no need}} to look farther for a good fox track. Soon {{the music}} of the hounds went ringing over the hill and down the hollow; but though the dogs ran true, and the <b>hunter</b> <b>watched</b> the runways all day with {{something}} more than his usual interest, he got no glimpse of the wily old fox. Late at night the dogs came limping home, weary and footsore, but with never a long yellow hair clinging to their chops to tell a story.|$|R

60|$|Usually {{there was}} great rejoicing among the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows when the hunting season ended and they knew that Lightfoot would be in no more danger until the next hunting season. But this year there was no rejoicing. You see, no one could find Lightfoot. The last seen of him {{was when he was}} running for his life with two hounds baying on his trail and the Green Forest filled with <b>hunters</b> <b>watching</b> for a chance to shoot him.|$|R
2500|$|During the British Raj, the {{officials}} of the colonial government ridiculed the temple traditions, while Christian missionaries launched a sustained attack on the moral outrage of sensuousness of Odissi and other Hindu temple dance arts. In 1872, a British civil servant named William <b>Hunter</b> <b>watched</b> a performance at the Jagannath temple in Puri, then wrote, [...] "Indecent ceremonies disgraced the ritual, and dancing girls with rolling eyes put the modest worshipper to the blush...", and then attacked them as idol-worshipping prostitutes who expressed their devotion with [...] "airy gyrations".|$|R

60|$|So {{the hunter}} found an old log behind some small trees and there sat down. He {{could see all}} around Paddy's pond. He sat {{perfectly}} still. He was a clever hunter {{and he knew that}} so long as he did not move he was not likely to be noticed by any sharp eyes that might come that way. What he didn't know was that Lightfoot had been watching him all the time and was even then standing where he could see him. And another thing he didn't know was that Paddy the Beaver had come out of his house and, swimming under water, had reached a hiding-place on the opposite shore from which he too had seen the hunter sit down on the log. So the <b>hunter</b> <b>watched</b> for Lightfoot, and Lightfoot and Paddy <b>watched</b> the <b>hunter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Using bait is also {{a common}} {{practice}} in leopard hunting on a safari. A dead, smaller sized antelope is usually placed high in the tree to lure the otherwise overcautious leopard. The <b>hunter</b> either <b>watches</b> the bait from a shootable distance or stalks the animal if it came for the bait during the night.|$|R
5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of time.

60|$|Then Achilles rose again, and cried: 'What coward has smitten me with {{a secret}} arrow from afar? Let him stand forth and meet me with sword and spear!' So {{speaking}} he seized the shaft with his strong hands and tore {{it out of the}} wound, and much blood gushed, and darkness came over his eyes. Yet he staggered forward, striking blindly, and smote Orythaon, a dear friend of Hector, through the helmet, and others he smote, but now his force failed him, and he leaned on his spear, and cried his warcry, and said, 'Cowards of Troy, ye shall not all escape my spear, dying as I am.' But as he spoke he fell, and all his armour rang around him, yet the Trojans stood apart and watched; and as <b>hunters</b> <b>watch</b> a dying lion not daring to go nigh him, so the Trojans stood in fear till Achilles drew his latest breath. Then from the wall the Trojan women raised a great cry of joy over him who had slain the noble Hector: and thus was fulfilled the prophecy of Hector, that Achilles should fall in the Scaean gateway, by the hand of Paris.|$|R

50|$|Often, bears will be {{attracted}} {{through the use}} of baits such as a rotting carcass, bakery by-products, sweets, or even jellies.

60|$|But, as {{the student}} {{advanced}} along the path, his air was not that of one whose deep inward thoughts withdrew his attention from all outward objects.

In spring, he sang as a bluebird, in summer as a blackbird and in autumn as a hawk, who then tried to take Gendenwitha with him to the sky. Dawn tied him to her doorpost.
