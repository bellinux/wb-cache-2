40|$|The Plutonium Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory is {{constantly}} undergoing <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> processing <b>equipment</b> {{to keep up}} with new technology and improving process equipment to accommodate customer needs. The old process equipment that is decommissioned has been exposed to radioactive materials and has to be disposed of a s TRU-waste. The bag-out process that was used for removing contaminated equipment pieces was very time consuming and exposed glovebox workers to hazardous radiation. This was due to a small size of the bag-out port, which limited the size of the pieces to fit through the port, and consequently increased the number of pieces and bag-outs that had to be performed...|$|R

40|$|Maintenance {{management}} {{is a tool}} that supports Biomedical Engineering staff in the development, control and direction of maintenance programs for medical equipment. Objective: to characterize the maintenance management <b>of</b> biomedical <b>equipment</b> in emergency areas of medical institutions {{in the metropolitan area}} of Medellin during 2008 - 2009. Materials and methods: a survey was conducted with chiefs and maintenance technicians of eleven institutions classified at level 3, belonging to the health network of the municipality of Medellin. Results: among the medical institutions included in the present study, it was found that 80 % <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> failure was related with mishandling of the devices, and 70 % of maintenance work developed during the period of study was carried out by qualified Biomedical Technicians/ Technologist. On the other hand, a weakness was observed in programs for medical <b>equipment</b> maintenance <b>of</b> the surveyed institutions, as it was found that most of them had only working PM schedules, and outdated record information <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> regarding, maintenance, acquisition or <b>decommissioning</b> plans <b>of</b> <b>equipment.</b> Conclusion: the study shows the existence of weaknesses in certain areas of the maintenance, such also poor organization and management, and poor availability of original spare parts...|$|R
40|$|Dust {{removal from}} a gas stream {{is a common}} problem in many {{industrial}} processes (e. g. power, cement, steel plants, etc.). In the last decades, plant managers {{more and more often}} have had to face the necessity of improving de-dusting systems in order to meet more stringent law requirements, inspired by the principle of the “maximum safety technologically feasible”, but also pushed by the increased penetration of environmental issues into public opinion, and its meaning in terms of company image. Budgets for these improvements play a role in a general asset management strategy: de-dusting, being often an operation having low influence on production performances, is seen more as a “necessary cost ” than a profit generator. The trend for companies, especially in the actual economical scenario, is to reuse existing de-dusting plants, enhancing their efficiencies rather than install new plants that would involve costs for the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> obsolete <b>equipment.</b> The obvious economic benefits of retrofits are counterbalanced by technical disadvantages. In particular, a systematic assessment of safety issues is required, not limited to the safety-oriented design of new machines, but extended in the evaluation of the impact that changes in process conditions (induced by the new equipment) can have on the existing ones. In this work, explosion problems in the de-dusting section of a cement plant have been considered. Particularly, using fault tree analysis, it has been evaluate...|$|R
40|$|Liquid mixed, {{high-level}} {{radioactive waste}} has been stored in underground single-shell tanks at the US Department of Energy`s (DOE`s) Hanford Site. After retrieval of the waste from the single-shell tanks, the DOE will proceed with closure of the tank farm. The 241 -AX Tank Farm includes four one-million gallon single-shell tanks in addition to sluice lines, transfer lines, ventilation headers, risers, pits, cribs, catch tanks, buildings, well and associated buried piping. This equipment is classified as ancillary equipment. This document addresses the requirements for regulatory close <b>of</b> the ancillary <b>equipment</b> in the Hanford Site 241 -AX Tank Farm.

40|$|The primary {{research}} {{objective of this}} effort {{is to develop a}} portable, capillary electrophoresis (CE) microchip capable of sensitively and rapidly monitoring hazardous waste metal ions critical to the successful deactivation and <b>decommissioning</b> (D&D) <b>of</b> contaminated <b>equipment</b> and structures at various DOE sites. Hazardous waste metal ions to be adapted for sensing on the microchip include UO 2 2 +, Be 2 +, Cr 6 +, Hg 2 +, Pb 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, Cs+, and Sr 2 +. Particular emphasis will be placed on developing viable, new extraction methods for metal ion sampling from both the air via a microimpinger which is integrated onto the microchip itself, and from contaminated surfaces, both techniques being amenable to on-line introduction onto the microchip. Two different detection methods for monitoring the electrophoretic separations taking place down the microchannel will be exploited in this research, indirect and direct detection. Special emphasis will be placed on maintaining the ultimate portability of the final microchip device through the careful selection of metallochromic dyes and fluorophores which are amenable to use of small, inexpensive light sources (e. g., LED's) and photodetectors...|$|R

40|$|Belgium {{started its}} nuclear program quite early. The first {{installations}} were constructed in the fifties, and presently, more than 55 % of the Belgian electricity production is provided by nuclear power plants. After 30 years of nuclear experience, Belgium started <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> nuclear facilities in the eighties with two main projects: the BR 3 -PWR plant and the Eurochemic reprocessing plant. The BR 3 -decommissioning project is carried out at the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, while the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> the former Eurochemic reprocessing plant is managed and operated by Belgoprocess n. v., which is also operating the centralized waste treatment facilities and the interim storage for Belgian radioactive waste. Some fundamental principles {{have to be considered}} for the management of materials resulting from the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> nuclear installations, <b>equipment</b> and/or components, mainly based on the guidelines of the ''IAEA-Safety Fundamentals. The Principles of Radioactive Waste Management. Safety Series No. 111 -F, IAEA, Vienna, 1995 '' with respect to radioactive waste management. Two of the fundamental principles indicated in this document are specifically dealing with the strategy for the management <b>of</b> materials from <b>decommissioning,</b> ''Generation <b>of</b> radioactive waste shall be kept to the minimum practicable'' (seventh principle), and ''Radioactive waste shall be managed {{in such a way that}} it will not impose undue burdens on future generations'' (fifth principle). Based on these fundamental principles, Belgoprocess has made a straightforward choice for a strategy with minimization of the amount of materials to be managed as radioactive waste. This objective is obtained through the use of advanced decontamination techniques and the unconditional release of decontaminated materials. Unconditionally released materials are recycled, such as i. e., metal materials that are removed to conventional melting facilities, or are removed to conventional industrial disposal sites if they have no remaining value. In order to achieve these objectives, Belgoprocess uses techniques and equipment that enable the high degrees of decontamination to be obtained, while based on commercially available technology. As an example, for concrete surfaces, where the contamination has not penetrated deeply, significant improvement in operation efficiency was achieved when developing dry hand held and automated floor and wall shaving systems as an alternative for scabbling. As it was also shown that it is economically interesting to decontaminate metal components to unconditional release levels using dry abrasive blasting techniques, an industrial automated dry abrasive blasting unit was installed in the Belgoprocess central decontamination infrastructure. Moreover, a specific facility was developed and operations started for taking representative samples and monitoring concrete material in view of the final demolition and unconditional release of remaining structures of buildings after completing all dismantling and decontamination work...|$|R
