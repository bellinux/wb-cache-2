It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie's recording studio. Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Scorsese {{made his}} first feature-length film, {{the black and white}} I Call First, which was later retitled Who's That <b>Knocking</b> <b>at</b> My Door with his fellow {{students}} actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semiautobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which also would have included a later film, Mean Streets.|$|E
25|$|Victor Fontan (born Pau, France, 18 June 1892, died Saint-Vincent 2 January 1982) was a French cyclist {{who led the}} 1929 Tour de France but {{dropped out}} after <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> doors at night to ask for another bicycle. His plight led to a change of rules to prevent its {{happening}} again.

25|$|More recently, {{his films}} have {{featured}} corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in The Departed and politicians in Gangs of New York and The Aviator. Guilt is a prominent theme {{in many of}} his films, as {{is the role of}} Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Bringing Out the Dead, Mean Streets, Who's That <b>Knocking</b> <b>at</b> My Door, The Departed, Shutter Island). He has been noted for his liberal usage of profanity and violence.|$|E
25|$|She {{signed up}} for a brief six-week course in filmmaking at New York University (NYU), where she came into contact with budding young filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who was {{struggling}} to complete his film What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This? A negative cutter had butchered his film, not leaving enough negative frames to allow for hot splicing. One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That <b>Knocking</b> <b>at</b> My Door (1967).|$|E

Also, often {{contributes}} {{his voice to}} a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in The Aviator and The Wolf of Wall Street). He provides the opening voice-over narration in Mean Streets and The Color of Money; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of Raging Bull; provides {{the voice of the}} unseen ambulance dispatcher in Bringing Out the Dead.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{with the}} economy in serious {{recession}} and interest rates touching seventeen per cent, Richmond's creditors came <b>knocking.</b> <b>At</b> one point, {{an attempt was made}} to seize the club's 1973 and 1974 premiership trophies as securities for unpaid debts, an embarrassing situation. For a number of years, the exact amount that the club owed was not publicly known. After Bartlett came Allan Jeans, who then passed the job to ex-Richmond premiership player John Northey for 1993. Northey returned the team to the simple long-kicking style of the halcyon days under the legendary Tom Hafey. Along with some draft concessions granted by the AFL, Northey's efforts gradually improved Richmond. The team fumbled an opportunity to make the 1994 finals, then opened 1995 with its best start to a season in 75 years and eventually made it to the preliminary final. With a talented playing list and a strong administration led by Leon Daphne (Richmond's first president from the corporate world, the Alan Bond farce aside), Richmond looked set to become regular finalists again.|$|E
25|$|Callum, who was {{battling for}} custody over Max, {{attacked}} David and the Platt family for months {{until one day}} when, after the Platt's return from a week-long holiday, Sarah Platt was babysitting Max. Whilst they were watching a scary movie, Gemma Winter, Callum's friend, came <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> the door of Callum's flat. She had been beaten up by a thug. When Max was playing in his room, he found Callum's gun. Callum threatened Sarah that if she told anyone about the gun then he would release a video of Bethany dealing and taking drugs to the police. Sarah flees with Max, refused to speak to anyone about it and told Bethany {{to stay away from}} him. However, he continued threatening the Platts. Sarah confided in Jason Grimshaw to finish him off. He attacked Callum in the Rovers and told him to stay away. He was then arrested for possession of the gun but was released without charge due to lack of evidence. When Callum arrived at the Platts' house to collect Max, David and Jason prevented him. Furious, Callum and two of his thugs lead Jason into the ginnel and beat him up. Sarah found Jason and called an ambulance. Jason's parents Eileen and Tony were told that he might not walk or talk again. Max, who had witnessed the attack on Jason, told David and Kylie what he saw after he appeared terrified when Callum came to collect him. Max gave a statement to the police. Before Callum was arrested, he spiked Sarah's drink and knocked her unconscious. He threatened Bethany that he would kill Sarah if she did not lie for him. The day after, on Lily Platt's 2nd birthday, Bethany revealed to the Platts that she made a statement against Max. The family was disgusted as they knew she was lying. Sarah informed Tony about Callum and the following day, he took matters into his own hands by beating up Callum in the ginnel, only to be stopped by Liz. Callum continued to attack the Platts because he needed money to pay off a dangerous drug dealer. Sarah lures him to the house and records what he is saying. Callum finds her 'phone and starts attacking Sarah, and Kylie comes in and beats him over the head with a wrench, killing him. They bury his body in a manhole in the garage and Sarah is traumatized.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Buddha a [...] "promising debut," [...] {{considering}} it [...] "a solid skatepunk record that illustrates the group's flair for speedy, catchy hooks and irreverent humor." [...] Rolling Stone viewed it, alongside proper debut album Cheshire Cat (1995) as [...] "slapped together lilting melodies and racing beats {{in an attempt}} to connect emo and skate punk, a sort of pop hardcore." [...] "This fast and furious beauty may have been recorded in two days, but it soon had the labels <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> DeLonge and co’s door," [...] said Total Guitar in 2012.|$|E

500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." [...] during the chorus section, and then goes on to [...] "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" [...] and [...] "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" [...] referencing her first singles [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998) and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums In the Zone (2003) and Circus (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's Ray of Light (1998) and Music (2000). The [...] "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" [...] was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{a special}} case {{established}} under the State Management Scheme where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973, most notably in Carlisle. During the 20th century elsewhere, both the licensing laws and enforcement were progressively relaxed, and there were differences between parishes; in the 1960s, at closing time in Kensington at 10:30pm, drinkers would rush over the parish boundary {{to be in good}} time for [...] "Last Orders" [...] in Knightsbridge before 11pm, a practice observed in many pubs adjoining licensing area boundaries. Some Scottish and Welsh parishes remained officially [...] "dry" [...] on Sundays (although often this merely required <b>knocking</b> <b>at</b> {{the back door of the}} pub).

So much so, that when the selectors announced the Indian team for the 1996 World Cup sans Dravid, an Indian daily newspaper carried a headline – [...] "Rahul Dravid gets a raw deal". However, they could not ignore him any longer after the World Cup. Dravid made his international debut on 3 April 1996 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in the Singer Cup held in Singapore immediately after the 1996 World Cup replacing Vinod Kambli. He wasn't particularly impressive with the bat scoring just three runs before being dismissed by Muttiah Muralitharan but took two catches in the match. He followed it up with another failure in the next game scoring just four runs before getting run out against Pakistan.|$|E

[...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect.
