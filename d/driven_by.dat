5|$|Submarine {{volcanism}} is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> various processes. Volcanoes near plate {{boundaries and}} mid-ocean ridges are {{built by the}} decompression melting of mantle rock that rises on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to the crustal surface. Eruptions associated with subducting zones, meanwhile, are <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> subducting plates that add volatiles to the rising plate, lowering its melting point. Each process generates different rock; mid-ocean ridge volcanics are primarily basaltic, whereas subduction flows are mostly calc-alkaline, and more explosive and viscous.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-2 {{series is}} the {{original}} variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it {{is known as the}} F108; specifically in the KC-135, the E-6 Mercury and some E-3 Sentry aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a single-stage fan with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP compressor <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> a four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP compressor <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> a single-stage HP turbine. The combustor is annular.|$|E

5|$|Archaea, a {{group of}} prokaryotes {{separate}} from bacteria, also feature flagella <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella. Whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial Type III secretion system, archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from Type IV pili.|$|E

5|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{insignificant}} {{during the first half}} of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America.

5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above, in this early reference, no mention is made of live animals as co-inhabitants within the sack, nor is the mention of any initial {{whipping}} contained, nor that Malleolus, contained within the sack, was transported to the river in a cart <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> black oxen.|$|E

5|$|Flagella are rigid protein structures, about 20nanometres in {{diameter}} and up to 20micrometres in length, that are used for motility. Flagella are <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the energy released by the transfer of ions down an electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> the tool holder.|$|E
