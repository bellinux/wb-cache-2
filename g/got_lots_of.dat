500|$|Morison {{has always}} had an {{interest}} in greyhound racing, ever since he attended Walthamstow Stadium as a boy. In January 2013, Morison set up a greyhound racing syndicate alongside his former strike partner at Norwich City, Grant Holt, and the two launched the SMGH Racing Club. Talking of the racing club, Morison stated – [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> kennels myself, lots of animals, lots of dogs. So me and Grant got together bought a couple of dogs and it's spiralled out of control a little bit, because we've bought seven now in the space of about three months. But it's been brilliant". When he finishes playing football, he says it would be [...] "a dream" [...] to be a greyhound trainer.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} {{her approach}} to Ingrid, Lawless {{said that she}} was inspired by stories of witches throughout history, and explained: [...] "hether they were rumor or not, we've <b>got</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> great information about how they've lived and what made them so terrifying". She clarified that she did not base her performance on other characters from horror stories. Surprised by the amount of history incorporated into Salem, she commented that show creators Adam Simon and Brannon Braga relied on [...] "anecdotal evidence of people at the time" [...] when writing storylines for her character {{and the rest of the}} cast. Lawless characterized Ingrid as a [...] "serious piece of work" [...] and the [...] "soul of violence" [...] even though she also possesses [...] "her charms and her wits and her elegance and her generosity".|$|E
500|$|Loretta {{has stated}} {{on-screen}} {{that she does}} not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries. Speaking of the character Walton stated, [...] "I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl—there’s a lot more depth to her. She’s actually quite shy and reserved. She’s <b>got</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history! Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper. It’s like two different lives, and I think many real-life pole-dancers are like that. They’re really nice, normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses." [...] Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where Hollyoaks films scenes.|$|E

500|$|In August 2016, Kerry King {{was asked}} if Slayer will release a {{follow-up}} to Repentless. He replied, [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are {{way ahead of the}} ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." [...] King also stated that Slayer is not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he is [...] "completely open" [...] to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, [...] "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} {{period of the}} {{response}} to the tsunami, concerns were voiced in various quarters that the international relief effort might falter if nations did not honour their initial pledges.

Now, people always say, 'You're being too modest, you're being too modest', and I say, 'What?' They just have to ask me the right question. I know it's not good artwork and I don't know if it's well-drawn, but I know it's entertaining." [...] – Don Rosa, Torino Comics Festival, April 2011 ...|$|E

2500|$|Pattinson began {{modelling}} {{at the age}} of 12, but his workload {{began to}} decrease four years later. In December 2008, he blamed the lack of modelling work on his masculine appearance: [...] "When I first started I was quite tall and looked like a girl, so I <b>got</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> jobs, because it was during that period where the androgynous look was cool. Then, I guess, I became too much of a guy, so I never got any more jobs. I had the most unsuccessful modelling career."
