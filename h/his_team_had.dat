5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1998–99 season, Kartik took 23 wickets for Vijay Cricket Club in the Chennai League. He played more {{regularly}} in the 1998–99 Ranji Trophy, taking 29 wickets in seven matches at 19.3 to be the 13th highest wicket-taker. This included a 3/8 and 4/62 in an innings win over Rajasthan, and 5/84 and 5/55 in the last two matches of the campaign against Tamil Nadu and Delhi. He also added 29 and 53 with the bat against Tamil Nadu to help stave off a defeat after <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> trailed by over 200 on the first innings.|$|E
5|$|Barney Burman {{supervised}} the makeup {{for the other}} aliens: <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> to rush the creation {{of many of the}} aliens, because originally the majority of them were to feature in one scene towards the end of filming.

5|$|Beattie and <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> {{noticed that}} someone else had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a pickaxe had damaged the wooden lid of his coffin, and the coffin plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed the coffin plaque.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} with the {{discovery}} of the first transuranic elements, which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule. In 1945, when American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, he realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium filling a fourth d-block row.|$|E

5|$|There was one {{change of}} driver before the race. Jon Wood, the {{grandson}} of retired driver Glen Wood, was originally scheduled to replace 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing car, but withdrew {{because of a lack}} of experience with the Car of Tomorrow, and former Haas CNC Racing driver Johnny Sauter took over his seat. Wood said he felt Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive. Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event, and <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> Nationwide Series driver Jason Keller ready to replace him if he could not compete.|$|E
5|$|Vincenzo Nibali {{was also}} {{cited as a}} {{potential}} winner of the race, following a difficult season. He had struggled during the Tour de France and was subsequently {{thrown out of the}} Vuelta for holding on to a team car. He had therefore made Il Lombardia a significant target. Nibali had performed strongly in the other late-season Italian classics, while <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano–Torino. Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: he was riding the Tour of Almaty instead.|$|E
5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , the engine was adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Alonso moved back into the lead of the Drivers' Championship on 231 points. Webber's failure to score meant he fell to second, eleven points behind Alonso. Hamilton's second-place finish resulted in him moving ahead of Vettel, with Button remaining in fifth. Red Bull still led the Constructors' Championship despite not getting both cars to the finish. McLaren remained in second with 399 points; Ferrari had caught up to McLaren, the gap between the two teams reduced to 25 points with two races of the season remaining. Given Alonso's new lead, Vettel acknowledged <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> the fastest car in the season's two remaining races and remained confident of winning the Drivers' Championship. After the conclusion of the championship in Vettel's favour by four points, Webber's manager Flavio Briatore highlighted the Korean Grand Prix as one of Webber's most obvious lost opportunities in his bid to win the title.|$|E
5|$|Coming in at 7/173, Meckiff top-scored with 55—his only {{first-class}} 50—as Victoria batted {{first and}} made a late recovery to end with 244. Meckiff took 3/65, including the wickets of Test players Bill Watson and Richie Benaud as New South Wales responded with 281. In the Victorian second innings Meckiff managed only 8 as Victoria left their opponents a target of 161 runs for victory. The paceman took 4/56 and claimed the final wicket, removing Test opener Jim Burke caught for 8 as New South Wales mustered 160, causing the match to end in the first tie in Shield history. Burke had returned to bat after being injured earlier in the innings, while New South Wales captain Ian Craig, who had been ill, hauled himself {{out of bed in}} an attempt to salvage the match after <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> fallen to 7/70. Meckiff's other victims in the final innings included Test players Alan Davidson and Johnny Martin.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran was {{confident}} {{that he could be}} competitive and achieve a good result without having to worry about the championship. Da Matta felt <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E

5|$|Despite taking {{victory in}} the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was facing {{pressure}} heading into {{the second half of}} the season; he was forty-seven points behind Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after scoring four points in the last two races. Alonso had been largely affected by safety car periods in Valencia and Silverstone despite his team having narrowed the performance gap on their championship rivals. However, Alonso remained upbeat about his title chances and said <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> more motivation to succeed despite his recent results. Hamilton, the defending race winner at the Hockenheimring, felt the race would give an indication on form for {{the second half of the}} year and believed McLaren should have a successful balance of their car in order to be competitive at the track.|$|E
5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the {{stewards}} as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said that <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi. Kobayashi admitted {{that he was at}} fault for his retirement and Senna believed the marshals were late reacting to Kobayashi's accident and felt his own accident was unavoidable.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} an {{intermediary}} title was developed after director Tetsuya Nomura and <b>his</b> <b>team</b> <b>had</b> {{already begun to}} develop ideas for the second Kingdom Hearts game, which he had intended to be set {{a year after the}} original. Originally titled Kingdom Hearts: Lost Memories, Nomura changed the name to match the overall outline of the story, while still reflecting the theme of memories. Chain of Memories was developed {{to bridge the gap between}} Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II. Like most sequels, Kingdom Hearts II was planned to have the character start from the beginning, ability-wise. To explain the loss of abilities gained in the previous game, Nomura had the story revolve around Sora's memories getting corrupted and implemented the card battle system to symbolize Sora's various memories.|$|E
