50|$|Typically cryostats are {{manufactured}} with two vessels, one inside the other. The outer vessel is evacuated with the vacuum {{acting as a}} thermal insulator. The inner vessel contains the cryogen and is supported within the outer vessel by structures made from low-conductivity materials. An intermediate shield between the outer and inner vessels intercepts the heat radiated from the outer vessel. This heat is removed by a cryocooler. Older <b>helium</b> <b>cryostats</b> used a liquid nitrogen vessel as this radiation shield and had the liquid helium in an inner, third, vessel. Nowadays few units using multiple cryogens are made with the trend being towards 'cryogen-free' cryostats in which all heat loads are removed by cryocoolers.|$|R
40|$|During the three-month period (Dec. 1, 1948 - Mar. 1, 1949) {{both of the}} Collins <b>Helium</b> <b>Cryostats</b> have {{fulfilled}} all {{requirements of}} the low-tempera-ture research program. The cryostat engines and valve mechanism have been completely trouble-free during this period. It has been learned that if a minute leak should develop at low tempera-tures in the stainless-steel Dewar vessel (vacuum jacket) of the liquefier, {{there is a possibility}} of maintaining adequate vacuum by increasing the pumping speed of the diffusion pump. This is accomplished by increasing the voltage on the heater element which in turn gives a higher operating tempera-ture of the diffusion-pump oil. This expedient can be used when time is an object in meeting deadlines.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effective application of porous heat exchangers of cylindrical shape through which fluid pa~es axially. On {{the basis of a}} theoretical analysis the conclusion derived was that the best thermal efficiency can be reached by the use of porous material with a large heat-exchanger surface, a high radial and low axial thermal conductivity (ie with a marked anisotropy of thermal conductivity), and a small radius of the heat exchanger operating at lower flows of cooling agent. The results of experiments carried out at helium and nitrogen temperatures are presented. These results have confirmed the high effectiveness of porous heat exchangers, even in comparison with chamber-type heat exchangers. For the temperature range from 1. 5 to 300 K the heat exchangers composed of highly conductive metal nets (mesh gauge of the order of magni-tude of 10 - 1 mm) stacked perpendicularly to the direction of flow of the cooling fluid, appear to be the most promising ones.
