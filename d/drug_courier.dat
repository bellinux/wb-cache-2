She is house-sitting for a flat owned by a Joanna Rupelford, when a {{handsome}} stranger, Sam Berryman, arrives and eventually tells her she {{is the most beautiful}} woman he has ever met and asks her out on a date, even though he appears to have mistaken her for the flat's owner.

The date is going extraordinarily well until Sam is suddenly called away, only for a couple of heavies to return with Sam later. It turns out that Sam, the heavies and the flat are all part of an elaborate drugs sting due to take place that evening. With Rosie having shown herself to the <b>drug</b> <b>courier</b> they intend to entrap, Rosie is talked into doing the sting herself.|$|E
25|$|Corby's lawyers {{argued that}} she had no {{knowledge}} of the cannabis until customs officials at the airport found it. Her defence centred on the theory {{that she had}} become an unwitting <b>drug</b> <b>courier</b> for what {{was supposed to have been}} an interstate shipment of drugs between Brisbane and Sydney in Australia. Her legal defence suggested that airport baggage handlers had put the drugs in Corby's bag, but they could not provide substantive probative evidence of this. According to her lawyers, the cannabis was meant to have been removed in Sydney. These claims were later supported when the former head of operations for the Australian Federal Police's internal investigation unit, Ray Cooper, claimed that it was well known within the AFP that some passengers were unwittingly being used to transfer drugs between domestic airports in Australia. In a June 2008 documentary, , Corby's former lawyer, Robin Tampoe, said that he fabricated the defence theory that Australian baggage handlers could have planted the drugs in Corby's luggage and apologised to them, and said that former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer told him he suspected Corby's brothers were behind the convicted drug smuggler's crime. Tampoe was subsequently struck off for misconduct.|$|E
