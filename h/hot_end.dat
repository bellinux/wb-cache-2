5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E
25|$|The reduced {{pressure}} now arrests the outward {{motion of the}} piston and it begins to accelerate towards the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> again and by its own inertia, compresses the now cold gas, which is mainly in the cold space.|$|E
25|$|The {{gas volume}} {{in the engine}} {{increases}} and therefore the pressure reduces, which causes a pressure difference across the displacer rod to force the displacer towards the <b>hot</b> <b>end.</b> When the displacer moves, the piston is almost stationary and therefore the gas volume is almost constant. This step results in the constant volume cooling process, which reduces {{the pressure of the}} gas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Based on a {{detection}} {{method of freezing}} point, the paper proposed a simple, reliable, portable, and low-cost refrigeration and heat-removal system. Semiconductor refrigeration was chosen through comparing operating principles and features of three refrigeration solutions. Forced air cooling was then selected through comparing three heat dissipating methods for <b>hot</b> <b>ends</b> of semiconductor chilling. After determining the refrigeration and heat-removal solution, semiconductor refrigeration and heat dissipating by air cooling for the <b>hot</b> <b>ends</b> were selected as erection schemes, with stirring apparatus and condensate water processing unit. Mechanical compression was chosen for fixation through comparing features of three installation methods. It {{is safe to say}} that this refrigeration and heat-removal system can be used to rapidly detect the categories and quantities of adulterated milk with accuracy.

25|$|The beta {{configuration}} has {{a single}} cylinder with a <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> and a cold end, containing a power piston and a 'displacer' that drives the gas between the hot and cold ends. It is typically used with a rhombic drive to achieve the phase difference between the displacer and power pistons, {{but they can be}} joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|To summarize, the Stirling engine {{uses the}} {{temperature}} difference between its <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> and cold end {{to establish a}} cycle of a fixed mass of gas, heated and expanded, and cooled and compressed, thus converting thermal energy into mechanical energy. The greater the temperature difference between the hot and cold sources, the greater the thermal efficiency. The maximum theoretical efficiency is equivalent {{to that of the}} Carnot cycle, but the efficiency of real engines is less than this value because of friction and other losses.|$|E
25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the cold end of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E

500|$|Next, {{the glass}}–cutter cut the cylinder, {{and the glass}} was flattened. It was {{necessary}} to gradually cool the glass, {{a process known as}} annealing, to prevent it from breaking. [...] A lehr or annealing oven was used to anneal the product. A typical 20th-century lehr was a large conveyor inside a long oven. The newly made glass gradually moved from the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> of the lehr to its opposite end, which was at room temperature. The glass would then be cut into the desired window glass size, placed in a box, and moved to inventory. [...] It is not known if (or when) the lehrs at the Hartford City plant had conveyors.|$|E
500|$|Estimated to be 590 to 650 {{million years}} old, {{the stars were}} {{probably}} at the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> of spectral class A during their main sequence lifetime, similar to Vega. They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling. Despite the giant luminosity class, the secondary component is very clearly within the Hertzsprung gap on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, still expanding and cooling towards the red giant branch, making it a subgiant in evolutionary terms. [...] The more massive primary has already passed through this stage, when it reached a maximum radius of 36 to 38 {{times that of the}} Sun. It is now a red clump star which is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core, a process that has not yet begun for the less massive star. Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage and starting to expand again which will lead it to the asymptotic giant branch. Isotope abundances/C13 ratio and C/N ratio have all declined in Capella Aa but not in Capella Ab. and spin rates confirm this evolutionary difference between the two stars. Heavy element abundances are broadly comparable to those of the Sun and the overall metallicity is slightly less than the Sun's.|$|E

50|$|Hydrothermal {{synthesis}} can {{be defined}} as a method of synthesis of single crystals that depends on the solubility of minerals in hot water under high pressure. The crystal growth is performed in an apparatus consisting of a steel pressure vessel called an autoclave, in which a nutrient is supplied along with water. A temperature gradient is maintained between the opposite ends of the growth chamber. At the <b>hotter</b> <b>end</b> the nutrient solute dissolves, while at the cooler end it is deposited on a seed crystal, growing the desired crystal.|$|R
2500|$|Broadly, modern glass {{container}} factories are three-part operations: the batch house, the <b>hot</b> <b>end,</b> {{and the cold}} end. The batch house handles the raw materials; the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> handles the manufacture proper — the forehearth, annealing ovens, and forming machines; and the cold end handles the product-inspection and [...] -packaging equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Glass {{containers}} typically receive two surface coatings, {{one at the}} <b>hot</b> <b>end,</b> {{just before}} annealing and one at the cold end just after annealing. At the <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> a very thin layer [...] of tin(IV) oxide is applied either using a safe organic compound or inorganic stannic chloride. Tin based systems {{are not the only}} ones used, although the most popular. Titanium tetrachloride or organo titanates can also be used. In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the cold end coating. At the cold end a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from sticking together when they are moved on a conveyor. The resultant invisible combined coating gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service surface damage, the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|E

The furnaces are natural gas- or fuel oil-fired, and operate at temperatures up to [...] The temperature is limited only {{by the quality of}} the furnace’s superstructure material and by the glass composition. [...] Types of furnaces used in container glass making include 'end-port' (end-fired), 'side-port', and 'oxy-fuel'.

50|$|The uniflow type {{of steam}} engine uses steam that flows in one {{direction}} only in each half of the cylinder. Thermal efficiency is increased in the compound and multiple expansion types of steam engine by separating expansion into steps in separate cylinders; in the uniflow design, thermal efficiency is achieved by having a temperature gradient along the cylinder. Steam always enters at the <b>hot</b> <b>ends</b> of the cylinder and exhausts through ports at the cooler centre. By this means, the relative heating and cooling of the cylinder walls is reduced.|$|R

2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are 100% inspected; automatic machines, {{or sometimes}} persons, inspect every container {{for a variety}} of faults. Typical faults include small cracks in the glass called checks and foreign inclusions called stones which are pieces of the refractory brick lining of the melting furnace that break off and fall into the pool of molten glass, or more commonly oversized silica granules (sand) that have failed to melt and which subsequently are included in the final product. [...] These are especially important to select out {{due to the fact that}} they can impart a destructive element to the final glass product. [...] For example, since these materials can withstand large amounts of thermal energy, they can cause the glass product to sustain thermal shock resulting in explosive destruction when heated. Other defects include bubbles in the glass called blisters and excessively thin walls. Another defect common in glass manufacturing is referred to as a tear. [...] In the press and blow forming, if a plunger and mould are out of alignment, or heated to an incorrect temperature, the glass will stick to either item and become torn. [...] In addition to rejecting faulty containers, inspection equipment gathers statistical information and relays it to the forming machine operators in the <b>hot</b> <b>end.</b> Computer systems collect fault information and trace it to the mould that produced the container. This is done by reading the mould number on the container, which is encoded (as a numeral, or a binary code of dots) on the container by the mould that made it. Operators carry out a range of checks manually on samples of containers, usually visual and dimensional checks.|$|E

40|$|Thermoeconomics {{is defined}} as the {{integration}} of thermodynamics with economics of thermal systems. In this paper, we discuss the thermoeconomics of heat exchanger units in a power plant for cost based optimal design conditions. In this regard, unit cost parameters of <b>hot</b> and cold <b>end</b> heat exchangers in distributing the heat transfer surface area of the power plant are considered for minimum total cost of the heat exchangers. A closed form expression is given in terms of unit costs of the conductances of both heat exchangers, and the results are presented in terms of a unit cost ratio, G, and the <b>hot</b> and cold <b>end</b> heat exchangers costs. The results demonstrate a strong dependence of the total cost function on the absolute temperature ratios as well as the <b>hot</b> to cold <b>end</b> conductance cost ratio. It is also shown that for the case of equal unit costs of the <b>hot</b> and cold <b>end</b> heat exchangers, the total conductance is equally divided between the two heat exchangers.
