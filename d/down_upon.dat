One day, seven years after arriving in Borneo, Oerip returned from patrol to find his home had been burned <b>down.</b> <b>Upon</b> the recommendation of a passing doctor, Oerip went back to Java, via Tarakan and Surabaya, to Cimahi, where he spent several months in recovery from fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Since {{before the}} start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have shared an intense rivalry as cities. For more than a century after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and {{economic}} power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> as the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey {{was certainly not}} a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E
5|$|The temperance movement, {{which had}} been absorbed into the moralistic system of the Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid- to late-19th- and early-20th century Rhondda. Alcohol was looked <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> and so were the {{increasingly}} violent sports such as rugby, so young men looked for different and more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society, and brass bands would eventually gain acceptance by the movement.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society.|$|E

5|$|Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was {{accepted}} by the Senate for two reasons: {{for the removal of}} Caracalla, and for having received the loyalty of the army. The senators were less concerned by Macrinus' Mauretanian ancestry than by his equestrian social background and scrutinized his actions as emperor. Their opinion of him was reduced by his decisions to appoint men to high offices who were of similarly undistinguished background. Only the Senate had the constitutional power to choose the emperor from among the senators and Macrinus, not being a senator and having become emperor through force rather than through traditional means, was looked <b>down</b> <b>upon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience. He {{was disappointed that}} {{the popularity of the}} characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including Big Bird and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should be able to be appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a program that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E
5|$|Several unique {{chemicals}} {{are produced by}} Mycena haematopus. The primary pigment is haematopodinB, which is so chemically sensitive (breaking <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> exposure to air and light) that its more stable breakdown product, haematopodin, was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008. A chemical synthesis for haematopodin was reported in 1996. Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline alkaloids discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of pyrrole and quinoline, both heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds. Compounds of this type also occur in marine sponges and are attracting research interest due to various biological properties, such as cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, and both antifungal and antimicrobial activities. Additional alkaloid compounds in M.haematopus include the red pigments mycenarubins D, E and F. Prior {{to the discovery of}} these compounds, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were considered to be rare in terrestrial sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{unexpected}} {{success of}} her first book, No Logo (1999), extended author and journalist Naomi Klein's book tour beyond its original two-week schedule. She spent the next 30 months traveling the world promoting the book as well as writing newspaper articles covering the anti-globalization movement. Most of her articles were originally published in the Canadian national newspaper The Globe and Mail, while some were published by The Nation, The New York Times, and The Guardian. During this time she resisted her publisher's urgings to write a new book, and the pressure to match No Logos success was bearing <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> her. She relented to the pressure for another publication by collecting {{the best of the}} articles and speeches she had written since No Logo. She did not intend this new book to be a sequel or follow-up, but rather a stand alone collection of writing.|$|E
5|$|Villa Real was now {{surrounded}} by hostile territory, and any Spanish help {{was too far}} away to be of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians in search of food and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish as a result of rocks being cast <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> them from the mountaintop. The battle lasted various days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, {{but the rest of the}} province of Chiapa remained rebellious.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible {{as long as they were}} afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E

5|$|Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) that a {{group of}} Trill {{scientists}} will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a species formed of both a humanoid host and a symbiont, which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it <b>down.</b> <b>Upon</b> Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.|$|E
5|$|First, Frederick {{had assumed}} {{he could use}} his trade-mark oblique order attack, but his {{reconnaissance}} had been incomplete. The Russians {{had been there for}} two weeks, had dug in to prepare for Frederick's arrival, and their fortifications bristled with abatis and guns. When he did arrive, Frederick had made limited efforts to assess the terrain and there was no operational reason for him not to have sent some of his cavalry to scout the area, except, perhaps, that his hussars, previously often used in reconnaissance, were being converted by Seydlitz into heavy cavalry. In the two weeks they had to prepare for the battle, the Russians and the Austrians had discovered, and reinforced, a causeway between the lakes and the marshland that allowed them to present Frederick with a united southeastern front. This effectively cancelled any advantage of the oblique battle order employed so successfully at Rossbach and Leuthen. Furthermore, the Russians utilized several natural defensive positions. The chain of hillocks could be enhanced by the construction of redans; the Russians were able to shape abutments from which to fire <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> the Prussians; they also constructed bastions, especially on the Spitzberge. Despite the murderous fire, Frederick's troops eventually turned the Russian left, but to little benefit. The terrain allowed the Russians and Austrians to form a compact front up to 100 men deep, shielded by the hills and marshes.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Microsoft Studios {{launched}} Halo Wars, a real-time strategy spin-off to {{the first-person}} shooter video game series Halo. The game {{was developed by}} Microsoft subsidiary Ensemble Studios. While Halo Wars was a commercial success, Ensemble Studios was shut <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> completion of its development. Prior to its closure, Ensemble had started writing a script and laying the narrative groundwork for a sequel. According to Halo Wars lead writer Graeme Devine, this original script explored {{the history of the}} Forerunners and involved the Spirit of Fire arriving at a Forerunner station that Anders had tracked. In 2007, Microsoft formed an internal division named 343 Industries to oversee and develop products in the Halo franchise. While the division had intentions of creating a follow-up to Halo Wars, they refrained from doing so until they found the right developer to partner with on the project. They viewed working with other developers and using external experience as a significant part of maintaining quality across their numerous projects.|$|E

5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} who needed additional funds for education or vied for political office found farming as a decent profession which, although humble, was not looked <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> by fellow gentrymen. Wealthy nobles, officials, and merchants could own land, {{but they often}} did not cultivate it themselves and merely acted as absentee landlords while living in the city. They mostly relied on poor tenant farmers (diannong 佃農) who paid rent {{in the form of}} roughly fifty percent of their produce in exchange for land, tools, draft animals, and a small house. Wage laborers (gunong 雇農) and slaves were also employed on the estates of the wealthy, although they were not as numerous as tenants. During Western Han, the small independent owner-cultivator represented the majority of farming peasants, yet their economic struggle to remain independent during times of war, natural disaster and crisis drove many into debt, banditry, slavery, and dramatically increased the number of landless tenants by late Eastern Han. The social status of poor independent owner-cultivators was above tenants and wage laborers, yet below that of wealthy landowners. While wealthy landowners employed tenants and wage laborers, landowners who managed small to medium-sized estates often acted as managers over their sons who tilled the fields and daughters who weaved clothes and engaged in sericulture to produce silk for the home or sale at market.|$|E
5|$|The action {{continued}} {{across the}} Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk, Nieuwpoort, Gravelines and Sluis. The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon {{cut off the}} Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship Mackerel (Makreel), came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe, pouring in a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the galley found herself close to Vice-Admiral Cant's Half Moon (Halve Maene). The galley tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results. The Halve Maene bore straight <b>down</b> <b>upon</b> the galley and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop. Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire straight into the waist. Another State's galliot bore down to complete the work; San Felipe sunk quickly carrying with her all the galley slaves, sailors, and soldiers.|$|E
