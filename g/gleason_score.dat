25|$|After a {{prostate}} biopsy, a pathologist {{looks at}} the samples under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the grade of the tumor. The grade tells how much the tumor tissue differs from normal prostate tissue and suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The Gleason system is used to grade prostate tumors from 2 to 10, where a <b>Gleason</b> <b>score</b> of 10 indicates the most abnormalities. The pathologist assigns a number from 1 to 5 for the most common pattern observed under the microscope, then does {{the same for the}} second-most-common pattern. The sum of these two numbers is the <b>Gleason</b> <b>score.</b> The Whitmore-Jewett stage is another method sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|The D'Amico {{classification}} stratifies men by low, intermediate, or {{high risk}} based on stage, grade, and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings.

50|$|Tumors with <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> 8-10 {{tend to be}} {{advanced}} neoplasms {{that are}} unlikely to be cured. Although some evidence suggests that prostate cancers will become more aggressive over time, <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> usually remain stable for a few years.|$|R
40|$|Histologic grading is an {{important}} predictor of prostatic disease stage and prognosis. We aimed to assess the degree of concordance between pathologic characteristics of the specimens obtained from biopsy and radical prostatectomy materials. <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> and modified <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> calculated for 25 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma from both needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens were analyzed. Mean <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> for biopsy and radical specimens were 6. 4 (SD:± 0. 7) and 6. 64 (SD:± 1. 3); and corresponding modified <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> were 7. 32 (SD:± 1. 43) and 7. 32 (SD:± 0. 98), respectively. The <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> of biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens were identical in 48 % (12 / 25) of the cases, while 32 % (8 / 25) of the biopsy specimens were over-and 20 % (5 / 25) of them were undergraded. While assessing modified <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores,</b> the exact degree of concordance of biopsy specimens with radical prostatectomy materials was 56 % (14 / 25) and of the 11 (44 %) cases not correlated exactly, 6 (24 %) were over- and 5 (20 %) were undergraded. When the exact, over- and underestimated <b>scores</b> of <b>Gleason</b> and modified Gleason grading systems were compared statistically, no difference between two groups was seen (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Prostate tissue {{characteristics}} play {{an important}} role in predicting the recurrence of prostate cancer. Currently, experienced pathologists manually grade these prostate tissues using the <b>Gleason</b> <b>scoring</b> system, a subjective approach which summarizes the overall progression and aggressiveness of the cancer. Using advanced image processing techniques, Aureon Biosciences Corporation has developed a proprietary image analysis system (MAGIC TM), which here is specifically applied to prostate tissue analysis and designed to be capable of processing a single prostate tissue Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) stained image and automatically extracting a variety of raw measurements (spectral, shape, etc.) of histopathological objects along with spatial relationships amongst them. In the context of predicting prostate cancer recurrence, the performance of the image features is comparable to that achieved using the <b>Gleason</b> <b>scoring</b> system. Moreover, an improved prediction rate is observed by combining the <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> with the image features obtained using MAGIC^TM, suggesting that the image data itself may possess information complementary to that of <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores...</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{patients}} who undergo treatment, {{the most important}} clinical prognostic indicators of disease outcome are the stage, pretherapy PSA level, and <b>Gleason</b> <b>score.</b> In general, the higher the grade and the stage, the poorer the prognosis.

The predictions are based on the experience of large groups of patients suffering from cancers at various stages.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{expression}} of QSER1 {{is seen in}} multiple cancer conditions. Over{{expression of}} QSER1 was noted in Burkitt’s Lymphoma. QSER1 expression also increases with increasing <b>Gleason</b> <b>score</b> (more advanced stages) of prostate cancer. In a study on breast cancer response to paclitaxel and fluorouracil‐doxorubicin‐cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, {{it was noted that}} breast cancer lines with higher levels of QSER1 were more likely to respond to treatment than those with underexpression of QSER1.|$|E
25|$|Which {{option is}} best {{depends on the}} stage of the disease, the <b>Gleason</b> <b>score,</b> and the PSA level.

A combination of the treatment options is often recommended for managing prostate cancer.|$|E
40|$|The {{changes in}} serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {{concentrations}} {{can be used}} as a prognostic factor in patients undergoing maximum androgen blockage for metastatic prostate cancer. A total of 149 patients followed in our department were classified into 4 groups on the basis of PSA changes: group 1, those with normalisation of PSA levels within the first 3 months; group 2, those with normalisation of PSA between months 3 and 6; group 3, those with a decrease in PSA, but not reaching normal range; group 4, those with no decrease. The <b>gleason</b> <b>scores</b> and the number of bone metastases were also compared between the groups. Again time to progression in patients with <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> 5 - 7 (grade 2) and over 7 (grade 3) whose PSA levels decreased between first and 3 rd months (mean 21. 2 months) were significantly longer than the patients with same <b>gleason</b> <b>scores</b> whose PSA levels decreased between 3 rd and 6 th months (mean 13. 4 months) (p < 0. 001).

40|$|The recent Prostate Chemoprevention Trial (PCPT), which {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} finasteride in reducing prostate cancer incidence, showed promising results.

25|$|Active {{surveillance}} is {{observation and}} regular monitoring without invasive treatment. In {{the context of}} prostate disease this usually comprises regular PSA blood tests and prostate biopsies. Active surveillance is often used when an early stage, slow-growing prostate cancer is suspected. However, watchful waiting may also be suggested when the risks of surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy outweigh the possible benefits. Other treatments can be started if symptoms develop, or if {{there are signs that}} the cancer growth is accelerating (e.g., rapidly rising PSA, increase in <b>Gleason</b> <b>score</b> on repeat biopsy, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{prostate}} cancer may involve active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy) and external beam radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or some combination. Which option is best depends {{on the stage of}} the disease, the <b>Gleason</b> <b>score,</b> and the PSA level. Other important factors are the man's age, his general health, and his feelings about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because all treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{widespread}} use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the US has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years. Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered curative treatment options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting. This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical co-morbidity and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, <b>Gleason</b> <b>score</b> and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in the treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic diseases, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Gleason</b> {{pathological}} <b>score</b> in {{prostate cancer}} is an importantprognostic indicator.

500|$|At {{the level}} of EFS mRNA expression, the local and {{systemic}} recurrence of prostate cancer is associated with CpG site hypermethylation of number of genes, including FLNC and EFS (p ≤ [...]03), both genes involved in cell attachment, and is predicted to result in reduction of gene expression. EFS expression was strongly downregulated in hormonal therapy resistant PC346DCC, PC346Flu1 and PC346Flu2 prostate cancer cells compared to therapy responsive PC346C cells.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&# 946; 1) expression and prognosis in prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TGF-&# 946; 1 expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to amplify RNA that had been isolated from fresh-frozen malignant and benign tissue specimens collected from 89 patients who had clinically localized prostate cancer and had been treated with radical prostatectomy. The control group consisted of li patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. The expression levels of TGF-&# 946; 1 were compared between the groups in terms of <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores,</b> pathological staging, and prostate-specific antigen serum levels. RESULTS: In {{the majority of the}} tumor samples, TGF-&# 946; 1 was underexpressed 67. 0 % of PCa patients. The same expression pattern was identified in benign tissues of patients with prostate cancer. Although most cases exhibited underexpression of TGF-&# 946; 1, a higher expression level was found in patients with <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> > 7 when compared to patients with <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> < 7 (p = 0. 002). Among the 26 cases of TGF-&# 946; 1 overexpression, 92. 3 % had poor prognostic features. CONCLUSIONS: TGF-&# 946; 1 was underexpressed in prostate cancers; however, higher expression was observed in tumors with higher <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores,</b> which suggests that TGF-&# 946; 1 expression may be a useful prognostic marker for prostate cancer.

40|$|Background/Aims: The {{combined}} role of whole-body {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (WB-MRI), bone scintigraphy and prostate specific antigen (PSA) were considered in predicting metastases and prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: Totally 38 PCa patients underwent WB-MRI, bone scintigraphy and PSA detections, and 34 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients were checked with PSA. Pearson correlations were performed to determine associations among PSA, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and <b>Gleason</b> <b>scoring.</b> Specificity and sensitivity were for comparison of diagnostic accuracies. Patients' baseline PSA, PSA nadir and time to the prostate-specific antigen nadir (TTPN) were analyzed, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were also established. Results: ADC values were negatively correlated with PSA levels (rs = - 0. 389, P = 0. 016) and <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> (rs = - 0. 432, P = 0. 006), while PSA levels were positively correlated with <b>Gleason</b> <b>scoring</b> (rs = 0. 493, P = 0. 002). Diagnostic efficacy of whole body-diffusion weighted imaging (WB-DWI) combined with PSA seemed the most favorable, and bone scintigraphy was advantageous in identifying bone metastasis. PSA levels (> 61. 60 µg/L), <b>Gleason</b> <b>scores</b> (> 6) and ADC (- 3 mm 2 /s) could all predict pessimistic prognosis (HR = 7. 65; HR = 6. 09; HR = 7. 28).

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} intra and inter-observer concordance rates in the <b>Gleason</b> <b>scoring</b> of prostatic adenocarcinoma, before and after a web-based educational course.
