5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd Georgeâ€™s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> the {{two great}} players were jealous of one another. There were times in the series when I felt {{it was not so}} much a battle between England and Australia as a battle between Bradman and Hammond.|$|E

30|$|In the {{expressions}} like <b>IN</b> <b>MY</b> HUMBLE <b>OPINION,</b> the modal {{value of the}} main clause would be downgraded. However, what the usage really reflects is the social distance between the speaker and the addressee. We can hardly picture two intimate friends uttering out the expression <b>in</b> <b>my</b> humble <b>opinion.</b> On the contrary, expressions like <b>IN</b> <b>MY</b> PROFESSIONAL <b>OPINION</b> tones up the modal value of the main clause by the positive item PROFESSIONAL. Hence the meaning potential of modality could be multiply expanded with the manifestation going from implicit to explicit.|$|R
5000|$|Autonomy: High scores {{indicate}} that the respondent is independent and regulates his or her behavior independent of social pressures. An example statement for this criterion is [...] "I have confidence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinions,</b> {{even if they are}} contrary to the general consensus".|$|R
25|$|Fear <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> is a {{state of}} drunkenness. And when men are in that state when the fear impulse takes a hold...he loses all reason, sense of values, and is not liable, or at least should not be held {{accountable}} for acts perpetrated when thus possessed.|$|E
25|$|For {{political}} reasons, Pakistan claims {{victory in}} the 1965 war. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> the war ended {{in a kind of}} stalemate. We were in a position of strength. Had the war continued for a few more days, we would have gained a decisive victory. I advised then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri not to agree for ceasefire. But I think he was under pressure from the United Nations and some countries.|$|E

25|$|Here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> is {{the only}} imaginative prose-writer of the {{slightest}} value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, {{it will probably be}} admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses.|$|E
25|$|You have {{misunderstood}} {{the whole}} article, because you {{jumped to the}} conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter.

25|$|Now {{and then}} I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{are the most}} respectable critics of my {{position}} on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn {{is by far the}} first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E

25|$|On December 6, 2006, Deming {{testified before}} the US Senate {{committee}} on the Environmental and Public Works, concluding that The amount of climatic warming {{that has taken place}} in the past 150 years is poorly constrained, and its cause--human or natural--is unknown. There is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, {{it is likely to be}} beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> it would be foolish to establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, I cannot {{find in the}} Canadian Bill of Rights {{anything}} clearly {{showing that}} Parliament intended to establish concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms some overriding general principles to be enforced by the courts against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in statutes existing at the time. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> Parliament did nothing more than instruct the courts to construe and apply those laws {{in accordance with the}} principles enunciated in the Bill on the basis that the recognized rights and freedoms did exist, not that they were to be brought into existence by the courts.|$|E
25|$|I {{understand}} {{the reorganization of}} the Lake Shore has been affected upon favorable terms, but have never {{had an opportunity to}} see the plan. I would every strongly recommend the purchase or least of the western divisions of the system, if favorable terms may be obtained. I would also advise the purchase of the Spokane Branch, if the property could be acquired upon satisfactory terms, which <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> would be based upon the value of that portion of the line within the city limits over which the Great Northern now gains access, including any liens the bonds may constitute upon the depot property, and the salvage value of the rails upon the remaining portion of the branch.|$|E

25|$|The {{thickness}} of the wall should, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> be such that armed men meeting {{on top of it}} may pass one another without interference. In the thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made of charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like pins, to give it lasting endurance. For that is a material which neither decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not only city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require a thickness like that of a city wall, will be long in falling to decay if tied in this manner.|$|E
25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think {{it is unfortunate that}} anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As a member of the House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|His fielding {{was almost}} a minus quality. Hassett would be saddled with the {{difficult}} task of hiding him away from busy corners all day long. But the fielding of the team as a whole was thought to be brittle. Moroney...would never be accused of being a mobile unit of the out-cricket, and Ian Johnson was, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> anyhow, a very doubtful quantity especially as a slip-fieldsman, where he seemed likely to do duty...I sympathized with Hassett over the big job he faced in getting good fielding done with the quality of the manpower as his disposal. There were only five good fieldsmen in the group of twelve chosen. These were Harvey, Miller, Morris, Loxton and Archer, and Archer was the supernumerary.|$|E

25|$|At 7 in {{the evening}} of November 28 {{occurred}} a new paroxysm, during which the volcano vomited forth such masses of fire and ejecta that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> all the material ejected during so many months, if taken together, would not equal the quantity which issued at the time. The columns of fire and smoke ascended higher than ever before, increasing every moment in volume, and setting fire to the whole island, there being not the smallest portion of the latter which was {{not covered by the}} smoke and the glowing rocks and ashes. All this was accompanied by terrific lightning and thunder above, and violent shocks of earthquakes underneath. The cloud of ejecta, carried on by the wind, extended itself toward west and south with the result that we saw already some stones fall close to our shore. I, therefore, shouted to all those who were still in the town to take to flight and we all ran off in a hurry; otherwise we would have been engulfed on the spot; as the waves of the angry lake began already to flood the houses nearest to the beach.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} available thus {{seems to}} indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and Cape Fears. It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant. Although there is some reason to think that the Keyauwee tribe actually contributed more blood to the Robeson County Indians than any other, the name is not widely known, whereas that of the Cheraw has been familiar to historians, geographers and ethnologists {{in one form or another}} since the time of De Soto and has a firm position in the cartography of the region. The Cheraws, too, seem to have taken a leading part in opposing the colonists during and immediately after the Yamasee uprising. Therefore, if the name of any tribe is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, that of the Cheraw would, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> be most appropriate.|$|E
