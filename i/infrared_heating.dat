25|$|Very low {{voltages}} are inefficient {{since the}} lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts. Some <b>infrared</b> <b>heating</b> elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.|$|E
25|$|In polar {{regions that}} are {{expected}} to experience among the most rapid impact from climate warming, springtails have shown contrasting responses to warming in experimental warming studies. There are negative, positive and neutral responses reported. Neutral responses to experimental warming have also been reported in studies of non-polar regions. The importance of soil moisture has been demonstrated in experiments using <b>infrared</b> <b>heating</b> in an alpine meadow, which had a negative effect on mesofauna biomass and diversity in drier parts and a positive effect in moist sub-areas. Furthermore, a study with 20 years of experimental warming in three contrasting plant communities found that small scale heterogeneity may buffer springtails to potential climate warming.|$|E
25|$|Incandescent bulbs {{are much}} less {{efficient}} than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb (such as heat lamps) deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, <b>infrared</b> <b>heating</b> for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared {{with other types of}} lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.|$|E

50|$|The modern {{commercial}} fryer boasts improved {{energy efficiency}} which {{is due in}} part to better heat transfer systems. Commercial fryers with <b>infrared</b> <b>heating</b> or convection heating are efficient, but often expensive. The most common fryer models are electric and gas.|$|E
40|$|Short {{exposures}} to <b>infrared</b> <b>heat</b> are generally used to facilitate tail-vein bleeding of experimental mice {{as an alternative}} to retro-orbital bleeding for the purpose of obtaining serum samples. Altered temperatures have been shown to influence immune responses in a variable manner. This study evaluates the effects of <b>infrared</b> <b>heat</b> on the immune response. After confirming the efficacy of heat exposure as measured by alterations in body temperatures, the exposed mice were evaluated for antigen-specific antibody responses and allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocytic (CTL) responses as readouts for humoral and cellular immune responses respectively. Antigen-specific serum antibody titers to lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, diphtheria toxin and rabbit IgG antigens were analyzed in <b>infrared</b> <b>heat</b> exposed and unexposed control C 57 BL/ 6 mice that were immunized with the corresponding antigen. Significant decreases in antigen-specific antibody titers were observed only when heat exposed C 57 BL/ 6 mice were immunized with lysozyme or BSA but not with other antigens tested. These alterations were not seen in heat exposed BALB/c mice. Dialyzed serum prepared from such heat exposed C 57 BL/ 6 was also found to inhibit CTL generation in vitro and inhibited IL- 2 stimulated proliferation of CTLL- 2 cells. These studies suggest that the procedure of <b>infrared</b> <b>heat</b> exposure prior to tail vein bleeding may influence some immune parameters although this may not be true for all strains of mice and all antigens...|$|R

50|$|German-British {{astronomer}} Sir William Herschel {{is credited}} {{with the discovery of}} infrared in 1800. He made an instrument called a spectrometer to measure the magnitude of radiant power at different wavelengths. This instrument was made from three pieces. The first was a prism to catch the sunlight and direct and disperse the colors down onto a table, the second was a small panel of cardboard with a slit wide enough for only a single color to pass through it and finally, three mercury-in-glass thermometers. Through his experiment Herschel found that red light had the highest degree of temperature change in the light spectrum, however, <b>infrared</b> <b>heating</b> was not commonly used until World War II. During World War II <b>infrared</b> <b>heating</b> became more widely used and recognized. The main applications were in the metal finishing fields, particularly in the curing and drying of paints and lacquers on military equipment. Banks of lamp bulbs were used very successfully but by today's standards, the power intensities were very low. The technique offered much faster drying times than the fuel convection ovens of the time. Production bottlenecks were mitigated and military supplies to the armed forces were maintained. After World War II the adoption of <b>infrared</b> <b>heating</b> techniques continued but on a much slower basis. In the mid 1950s the motor vehicle industry began to show interest in the capabilities of infrared for paint curing and a number of production line infrared tunnels came into use.|$|E

50|$|The {{very low}} thermal {{conductivity}} of cubic phase of zirconia also {{has led to}} its use as a thermal barrier coating, or TBC, in jet and diesel engines to allow operation at higher temperatures.

5000|$|In {{the case}} of heating outdoor areas, the {{surrounding}} air is constantly moving. Relying on convection heating is in most cases impractical, the reason being that, once you heat the outside air, it will blow away with air movement. Even in a no-wind condition, the buoyancy effects will carry away the hot air. Outdoor radiant heaters allow specific spaces within an outdoor area to be targeted, warming only the people and objects in their path.
