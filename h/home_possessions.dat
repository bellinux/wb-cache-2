That is, <b>home</b> <b>possessions</b> surveyed in PIRLS do not discriminate well between higher and lower SES families in high income countries. When coupled with reports of relatively high education levels by parents, SES distributions tend to be negatively skewed, showing little variation at lower SES levels {{due to lack of}} valid SES items (e.g., Finland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates). Lack of variability in SES items affects the validity of our SES measure and its cross-country comparability.|$|E

The data are from an exploratory study investigating how and why people displayed objects in their homes. Although mantelpiece displays were the principal focus, other display areas were considered, and interview respon-dents were invited to tell stories about the provenance and meaning of objects. Analysing such narratives as social performances demonstrates {{the extent to which the}} apparently ‘private ’ experiences of the self are manifested by means of display objects and domestic artefacts. Narratives and objects inhabit the inter-section of the personal and the social. An analysis of four narratives that two women related during interviews in their homes shows how people account for themselves in recounting stories of their <b>home</b> <b>possessions.</b> In conclusion, a research strategy combining narrative accounts with an interpretation of photo-graphic data is suggested...|$|E
30|$|Indeed, the {{robustness}} {{of the results}} from our scaling approach that used the common part of the context questionnaires indicates that—for the purpose of obtaining plausible values—the questions in those questionnaires could {{be reduced to a}} core set, such as gender, parental education and occupation, migration, home language, and <b>home</b> <b>possessions.</b> However, in PISA, the contextual variables are not included in the scaling as a means of improving the reliability of the plausible values. Rather, they are included so that the contextual factors possibly associated with performance can be subsequently analyzed. Importantly, what we are showing here is the potential that a rotated design has to broaden the range of contextual variables included, and therefore increase the relevance of the assessment for policymakers, educators, and researchers, while simultaneously allowing the respondent time to be kept to approximately 30  minutes a length consistent with most current large-scale assessments.|$|E

30|$|In PISA 2012, student-level SES was {{measured}} by the Index of economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS), a composite index of highest parental occupational status (HISEI), highest parental educational attainment (HISED), and <b>home</b> <b>possessions</b> which referred to the number of books at homes, home educational, and cultural possession (HOMEPOS). This index was derived from the students’ responses to the items related to their parents’ current jobs and educational status as well as the available number of the learning materials at home. As ESCS represented the student SES in PISA 2012; therefore, we averaged the ESCS scores of every student from a given school in calculating aggregated school-level ESCS in this study. The ESCS index was standardised in all OECD countries to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Greater values represented more advantaged family backgrounds. A negative value implies that the ESCS was below the OECD average and a positive value means that was above the OECD average.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{large scale}} {{international}} assessment studies, questionnaires are typical used to query students’ <b>home</b> <b>possessions.</b> Composite scores are computed from {{responses to the}} home resource questionnaires and are used {{as a measure of}} family socioeconomic background in achievement comparison or for statistical control. This paper deals with profiling the socio-economic status (SES) of Ghanaian students’ {{in the context of the}} TIMSS 2011 study. Latent class analysis was used to profile students into respective SES classes based on the students’ responses to 11 questions concerning their home resources. The results showed three clearly distinct socio-economic profiles: high-, middle- and low-SES. Moreover, a discriminate analysis was conducted to explore the degree to which the groups are accurately classified. The discriminant analysis was able to correctly classify 92. 20 % of the individual students into their appropriate SES group. A gender comparison of these classes suggested stable measurement invariance for the latent class indicators. This article contributes to addressing the composition of SES by providing statistical criteria to evaluate SES using empirical data...|$|E
40|$|An ‘object in purgatory’ {{is a gift}} {{you have}} {{received}} and don't want, but nonetheless feel compelled to keep. My Objects in Purgatory exhibition (2011) invited visitors to contribute their uncherished gifts, and relate the stories associated with them. Their contributions were exhibited, and in return they received a handmade brooch featuring an image of another visitor’s uncherished gift. This paper describes how public display gave the gifts material agency—opening up a new shared space for reflection on the usually taboo subject of unwanted gifts. The use of display in the exhibition and in the brooches provided rich layers of performance, provocation and interpretation. The paper also establishes the Objects in Purgatory exhibition as a method that combines a form of artistic production—the participatory exhibition—with a form of exchange. The method engages the audience in active reflection on their practices of keeping <b>home</b> <b>possessions,</b> and develops an existing form of contemporary jewellery practice (the making of wearable memories) by employing brooches to reallocate the memories, obligations and feelings associated with unwanted gifts—thereby developing the relational potential of jewellery...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This study {{examined}} the effects of school, family, peer and student individual characteristics on scientific literacy scores. The study analyzed data from the Program of International Student Assessment (PISA) 2006 data collected from 171 schools and 5, 184 students in Azerbaijan. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was utilized to analyze the effects of school, family, peer and student individual characteristics on scientific literacy scores. The study found that student-level factors explain a slightly higher proportion of variance than school-level predictors. Several student-level effects (gender, parental education and occupation, ability, self-efficacy) and school-level factor (peer academic effects in mathematics) were found to be significantly associated with scientific literacy scores. Other school-level factors (peer socio-economic effects and school inputs) and student-level characteristics (index of <b>home</b> <b>possessions)</b> were not significantly related to scientific literacy scores. The analysis concluded with policy recommendations and offered suggestions for future research...|$|E
30|$|Parental education, parental {{occupational}} status, and <b>home</b> <b>possessions</b> {{are combined}} into a single family SES scale using a principal component analysis. Parental education and parental occupational status are measured with the maximum level of education and maximum score in occupational status for either parent. Mother’s and father’s levels of education are self-reported according to the following categories: 1 = some primary, lower secondary or no schooling, 2 = lower secondary, 3 = upper education, 4 = post-secondary but not university, 5 = university or higher. Mother’s and father’s self-reported occupations were converted into occupational status scores following Caro and Cortés (2012). Parental occupation questions followed a categorical approach including following options along with descriptors: (a) has never worked for pay; (b) small business owner; (c) clerk; (d) service or sales worker; (e) skilled agricultural or fishery worker; (f) craft or trade worker; (g) plant or machine operator; (h) general laborers; (i) corporate manager or senior official; (j) professional; and (k) technician or associate professional. Job categories and descriptors were mapped into the International Socioeconomic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI) scores using the scoring scheme proposed by Ganzeboom et al. (1992).|$|E

It has been also defined as one’s access to collectively desired resources, like, (1) material capital (income, wealth, trust funds, etc.), (2) human capital (skills, abilities, credentials, etc.) and (3) social capital (instrumental relationships such as being friends with lawyers and doctors) [2]. Duncan socio-economic [...].Index has been used in US as a measure, which is a subjective assessment of occupational prestige based on educational attainment and income. In 1974 Peter Rossi et al. also developed a household prestige score as a measure. Currently in UK a National Statistics Socio-economic classification (NS-SEC) is used to calculate a measure for socio-economic status based on one’s job and employment relations.|$|E
