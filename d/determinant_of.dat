5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any row to another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another column, {{does not change the}} determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the <b>determinant</b> <b>of</b> any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the <b>determinant</b> <b>of</b> a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the <b>determinant</b> <b>of</b> a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E

The empirical evidence obtained shows the existence of significant differences between these two types of firms for the <b>determinants</b> <b>of</b> survival. In the context of family-owned SMEs, the empirical evidence obtained allows us to conclude that: size, age and R&D expenditure are neither positive nor restrictive <b>determinants</b> <b>of</b> survival; cash flow and labour productivity are positive <b>determinants</b> <b>of</b> survival; and, debt, interest paid and risk are restrictive <b>determinants</b> <b>of</b> survival.

5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important <b>determinant</b> <b>of</b> success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E

5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The <b>determinant</b> <b>of</b> the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a ring R. Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M(n, R) of all square n-by-n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R-module R'n. If the ring R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The <b>determinant</b> <b>of</b> square matrices over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a field F, where every nonzero element is invertible. Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E
