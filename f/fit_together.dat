5|$|The color {{matching}} required in a tiling by Wang dominoes {{can easily be}} achieved by modifying {{the edges of the}} tiles like jigsaw puzzle pieces so that they can <b>fit</b> <b>together</b> only as prescribed by the edge colorings. Raphael Robinson, in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have <b>fit</b> <b>together</b> to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|The Xerxes.20 which {{superseded}} the Xerxes.X in 2005 incorporated new {{main bearing}} {{ball and the}} new Rmat-5 sub-plinth. The bearing, attached to the inner platter, has an unusually small-diameter hardened-steel spindle, which sits {{on top of a}} tungsten ball that measures 2mm and is machined to a tolerance in the order of micrometres. The corresponding housing is made of bronze. The two-piece platter, when <b>fit</b> <b>together,</b> are snug and will not resonate.|$|E

5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges <b>fit</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not <b>fit</b> <b>together</b> exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E
5|$|None of the carpals (wrist bones) <b>fit</b> <b>together</b> precisely, {{suggesting}} {{the presence of}} a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backwards) until they nearly touched the wrist. When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.|$|E

The ascending smoke gets to the upper tube, cools down and produces the desired sublimate.|$|R

5|$|Tolkien {{argues that}} the {{original}} poem has almost been lost {{under the weight of}} the scholarship on it; that Beowulf must be seen as a poem, not just as a historical document; and that the quality of its verse and its structure give it a powerful effect. He rebuts suggestions that the poem is an epic or exciting narrative, likening it instead to a strong masonry structure built of blocks that <b>fit</b> <b>together.</b> He points out that the poem's theme is a serious one, mortality, and that the poem is in two parts: the first on Beowulf as a young man, defeating Grendel and his mother; the second on Beowulf in old age, going to his death fighting the dragon.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states <b>fit</b> <b>together.</b> Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} the neck), {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not <b>fit</b> <b>together</b> in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
