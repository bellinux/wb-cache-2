In this investigation synthetic peptides were utilized to examine the effect on transport of amino acid substitutions within the T-antigen <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> signal. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> was evaluated by immunofluorescence after microinjection of protein-peptide conjugates into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Substitution of other basic amino acids at position 128 revealed a hierarchy for <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport.</b> The rate of <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> was most rapid when a lysine was at position 128 followed in descending order by arginine, D-lysine, ornithine, and p-aminophenylalanine. Peptide-induced <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> was dependent upon a positively charged amino acid at positions 128 and 129, since substitutions of neutral asparagines at these positions abolished transport.

40|$|Abstract Transport of macromolecules {{between the}} nucleus and the {{cytoplasm}} {{is an essential}} necessity in eukaryotic cells, since the nuclear envelope separates transcription from translation. In the past few years, {{an increasing number of}} components of the plant <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> machinery have been characterised. This progress, although far from being completed, confirmed that the general characteristics of <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> are conserved between plants and other organisms. However, plant-specific components were also identified. Interestingly, several mutants in genes encoding components of the plant <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> machinery were investigated, revealing differential sensitivity of plant-specific pathways to impaired <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport.</b> These findings attracted attention towards plant-specific cargoes that are <b>transported</b> over the <b>nuclear</b> envelope, unravelling connections between <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> and components of signalling and developmental pathways.

40|$|The {{transport}} of proteins into the nucleus requires {{not only the}} presence of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> signal on the targeted protein but also the signal recognition proteins and the nuclear pore translocation apparatus. Complicating the search for the signal recognition proteins {{is the fact that the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> signals identified share little obvious homology. In this study, synthetic peptides homologous to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> signals from the simian virus 40 large T antigen, Xenopus oocyte nucleoplasmin, adenovirus E 1 A, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAT alpha 2 proteins were coupled to a UV-photoactivable cross-linker and iodinated for use in an in vitro cross-linking reaction with cellular lysates. Four proteins, p 140, p 100, p 70, and p 55, which specifically interacted with the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> signal peptides were identified. Unique patterns of reactivity were observed with closely related pairs of <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> signal peptides. Competition experiments with labeled and unlabeled peptides demonstrated that heterologous signals were able to bind the same protein and suggested that diverse signals use a common transport pathway.

40|$|The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is {{the sole}} gateway between the nucleus and the {{cytoplasm}} of interphase eukaryotic cells, and it mediates all trafficking between these 2 cellular compartments.

40|$|The {{glucocorticoid}} receptor (GR) {{belongs to}} the superfamily of steroid receptors and is an important regulator of physiological and metabolic processes. In its inactive state, GR is unbound by ligand and resides in the cytoplasm in a chaperone complex. When it binds glucocorticoids, it is activated and translocates to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription factor. However, the subcellular localization of GR {{is determined by the}} balance between its rates of nuclear import and export. The mechanism of GR <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> has been extensively studied. Originally, it was believed that nuclear import of GR is initiated by dissociation of the chaperone complex in the cytoplasm. However, several studies show that the chaperone machinery is required for <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> of GR. In this review, we summarize the contribution of various chaperone components involved in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> of GR and propose an updated model of its nuclear import and export.

40|$|Steroid receptors {{exist as}} large {{oligomeric}} complexes in hypotonic cell extracts. In the present work, we studied the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> of the 2 major {{components of the}} oligomeric complex, the receptor itself and the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90), by using different in vitro transport systems: digitonin permeabilized cells and purified nuclei.

When nonstabilized PR oligomer was introduced into the <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> system, the complex dissociated and the PR but not the Hsp 90 was transported into the nucleus.

40|$|SummaryDuring {{antiviral}} defense, interferon (IFN) signaling triggers <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT 1 (PY-STAT 1), {{which occurs}} via {{a subset of}} karyopherin alpha (KPNA) nuclear transporters. Many viruses, including Ebola virus, actively antagonize STAT 1 signaling to counteract the antiviral effects of IFN. Ebola virus VP 24 protein (eVP 24) binds KPNA to inhibit PY-STAT 1 <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> and render cells refractory to IFNs. We describe the structure of human KPNA 5 C terminus in complex with eVP 24. In the complex, eVP 24 recognizes a unique nonclassical nuclear localization signal (NLS) binding site on KPNA 5 that is necessary for efficient PY-STAT 1 <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport.</b> eVP 24 binds KPNA 5 with very high affinity to effectively compete with and inhibit PY-STAT 1 <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport.</b> In contrast, eVP 24 binding {{does not affect the}} transport of classical NLS cargo. Thus, eVP 24 counters cell-intrinsic innate immunity by selectively targeting PY-STAT 1 nuclear import while leaving the transport of other cargo that may be required for viral replication unaffected...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSegregation Distorter (SD) is a meiotic {{drive system}} in Drosophila that causes {{preferential}} {{transmission of the}} SD chromosome from SD/SD+ males owing to dysfunction of SD+ spermatids.

Overexpression of Ran or RanGEF (Ran GTPase exchange factor) in the male germline fully suppresses distortion. We conclude that mislocalization of Sd-RanGAP causes distortion by reducing nuclear RanGTP, thereby disrupting the Ran signaling pathway. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> of a GFP reporter in salivary glands is impaired by SD, suggesting that a defect in <b>nuclear</b> <b>transport</b> may underlie sperm dysfunction...|$|R

We find that most nucleoporins and karyopherins preferentially associate with a subset of highly transcribed genes and with genes that possess Rap 1 binding sites whereas the RanGEF preferentially associates with transcriptionally inactive genes. Consistent with coupling of transcription to the nuclear pore, we show that transcriptional activation of the GAL genes results in their association with nuclear pore proteins, relocation to the nuclear periphery, and loss of RanGEF association.
