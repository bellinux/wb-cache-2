Using data collected over a two year period for the semi-arid Badia region of Jordan, a geometric optical/empirically based model was used to detect changes in vegetation cover.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} severe weather and organized lines of cumulus towers, called feeder clouds, which form in the inflow region of supercell and multicell thunderstorms. Using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) <b>imagery,</b> <b>correlations</b> between the occurrence of feeder clouds and severe weather reports are explored. Output from theWeather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) mesocyclone detection algorithm (MDA) is also assessed for {{a subset of the}} satellite case days. Statistics from the satellite and radar datasets are assembled to estimate not only the effectiveness of feeder cloud signatures as sole predictors of severe weather, but also the potential utility of combining feeder cloud analysis with the radar’s MDA output. Results from this study suggest that the formation of feeder clouds as seen in visible satellite imagery is often followed by the occurrence of severe weather in a storm. The study finds that feeder cloud signatures by themselves have low skill in predicting severe weather. However, if feeder clouds are observed in a storm, there is a 77 % chance that severe weather will occur within 30 min of the observation. For the cases considered, the MDA {{turns out to be the}} more effective predictor of severe weather. However, results show that combined predictions (feeder clouds plus mesocyclones) outperform both feeder cloud signatures and the MDA as separate predictors by; 10 %– 20 %. Thus, the presence of feeder clouds as observed in visible imagery is a useful adjunct to the MDA in diagnosing a storm’s potential for producing severe weather. 1...|$|R

30|$|The dNBR and RdNBR {{values were}} most {{strongly}} correlated to the organic-uncharred and inorganic-charred categories of ground cover, with few significant correlations to the organic-charred and inorganic-uncharred categories (Table 2). These {{results indicate that}} the dNBR and RdNBR are good at identifying areas that were relatively unchanged (low burn severity) and significantly changed (high burn severity) after a fire. These areas are often relatively homogenous, with extensive green tree canopies or conversely, a “moonscape” with widespread charred soil, ash, and black charred vegetation. It is the moderately burned areas with mixed characteristics {{in the middle of the}} burn severity spectrum that are more difficult to identify using remote sensing. Moderately burned areas are often a mix of burn severity conditions and characteristics. The effects of the fire on the ground do not always match the effects in the above-ground vegetation, which is most often reflected in satellite <b>imagery.</b> The <b>correlations</b> between the hyperspectral SMA results and all four organic and inorganic ground cover categories were statistically significant (Table 2), indicating a better ability to discern moderate burn severity effects when compared to the dNBR or RdNBR. It is important to be able to map moderate fire effects such as uncharred inorganics and charred organics because exposed mineral soil is prone to erosion, even if it is unburned, and organic cover on the soil surface, even if it has been burned, provides soil protection from wind and water. An additional benefit to using airborne hyperspectral imagery over satellite imagery is the scale at which post-fire maps can be produced. The hyperspectral imagery used in this study had 4.2 -m pixels on the ground compared to 30 -m pixels in the satellite imagery. The ability to detect earth-surface components at a finer scale improves the accuracy at which post-fire components and conditions can be mapped.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comparative analysis of Hartmann von Aue’s Gregorius, Kafka’s DieVerwandlung and Thomas Mann’s DerErwählte, focusing on their uses of biblical motifs. Connected by pervasive themes {{of guilt and}} atonement, each text also relies similarly in its expression of these ideas {{on the use of}} images which are familiar from the biblical context, and thus suggest archetypal instances of sin and redemption as points of comparison for the protagonist’s fate. In this way all three texts create a manifest sense of helpless affliction by guilt by implementing echoes of the fate of Adam, both in the relationships of their characters, and in structures of recurring loss, decline and expulsion. Each narrative, moreover, also suggests allusions to the opposing figure of Christ through concurrent echoes of the Passion in its imagery of degradation and exile, and, to varying degrees, through the introduction of complementary images of restoration and rehabilitation drawing on patterns of resurrection. The texts diverge, however, {{in the way in which}} they relate these fields of <b>imagery,</b> as the <b>correlation</b> of Fall and redemption which is symbolically affirmed in Hartmann’s narrative, and echoed in Mann’s, is disrupted by Kafka’s introduction of a tragic conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring the {{dynamics}} in wheat crops requires near-term observations with high spatial resolution {{due to the}} complex factors influencing wheat growth variability. We studied the prospects for monitoring the biophysical parameters and nitrogen status in wheat crops with low-cost imagery acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) over an 11 ha field. Flight missions were conducted at approximately 50 m in altitude with a commercial copter and camera system—three missions were performed between booting and maturing of the wheat plants and one mission after tillage. Ultra-high resolution orthoimages of 1. 2 cm·px− 1 and surface models were generated for each mission from the standard red, green and blue (RGB) aerial images. The image variables were extracted from image tone and surface models, e. g., RGB ratios, crop coverage and plant height. During each mission, 20 plots within the wheat canopy with 1 × 1 m 2 sample support were selected in the field, and the leaf area index, plant height, fresh and dry biomass and nitrogen concentrations were measured. From the generated UAV imagery, {{we were able to}} follow the changes in early senescence at the individual plant level in the wheat crops. Changes in the pattern of the wheat canopy varied drastically from one mission to the next, which supported the need for instantaneous observations, as delivered by UAV <b>imagery.</b> The <b>correlations</b> between the biophysical parameters and image variables were highly significant during each mission, and the regression models calculated with the principal components of the image variables yielded R 2 values between 0. 70 and 0. 97. In contrast, the models of the nitrogen concentrations yielded low R 2 values with the best model obtained at flowering (R 2 = 0. 65). The nitrogen nutrition index was calculated with an accuracy of 0. 10 to 0. 11 NNI for each mission. For all models, information about the surface models and image tone was important. We conclude that low-cost RGB UAV imagery will strongly aid farmers in observing biophysical characteristics, but it is limited for observing the nitrogen status within wheat crops...|$|R

BAER teams desire maps indicative of soil burn severity, but photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation also influences the spectral properties of post-fire imagery. Our objective was to assess burn severity both remotely {{and on the ground}} at six 2003 wildfires. We analyzed fire effects data from 34 field sites located across the full range of burn severities observed at the Black Mountain Two, Cooney Ridge, Robert, and Wedge Canyon wildfires in western Montana and the Old and Simi wildfires in southern California. We generated Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) indices from Landsat 5, SPOT 4, ASTER, MASTER and MODIS <b>imagery.</b> Pearson <b>correlations</b> between the 44 image and 79 field variables having an absolute value greater than 0. 5 were judged meaningful and tabulated in overstory, understory, surface cover, and soil infiltration categories. Vegetation variables produced a higher proportion of meaningful correlations than did surface cover variables, and soil infiltration variables the lowest proportion of meaningful correlations. Soil properties had little measurable influence on NBR, dNBR or NDVI, particularly in low and moderate severity burn areas where unconsumed vegetation occludes background reflectance. BAER teams should consider BARC products much more indicative of post-fire vegetation condition than soil condition. Image acquisition date, in relation to time of field data collection and time since fire, appears to be more important than type of imagery or index used. We recommend preserving the raw NBR or dNBR values in an archived map product to enable remote monitoring of post-fire vegetation recovery. We further recommend that BAER teams rely on the continuous BARC-Adjustable (BARC-A) product (and assign their own severity thresholds as needed) more than the classified BARC product, which oversimplifies highly heterogeneous burn severity characteristics on the ground...|$|R

40|$|Fields of {{sand dunes}} are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the north}} polar region of Mars and provide a record of sand transport processes influenced by Mars? polar climate. Spatial and temporal variations in dunes, ripples, coarse-grained ripples, and exposed dune cross-strata were analyzed in two areas of the Olympia Undae Dune Field {{in order to assess}} the influence of the Martian polar boundary conditions on ripple and dune activity and on pattern development. Two- and three-dimensional parameters, including dune crest length, spacing, width, slope, and height, were statistically assessed using regression analysis and descriptive statistics. Sediment fluxes were calculated using Co-registration of Optically Sensed <b>Imagery</b> and <b>Correlation</b> (COSICorr), a program that precisely co-registers and correlates imagery, and by measuring dune displacement. Two-dimensional pattern analysis indicates the co-existence of two populations of dunes that can be interpreted as two generations or as forming simultaneously under sediment availability limited conditions. Three-dimensional pattern analysis shows an asymmetry in slope profiles of the primary dunes and is consistent with primary dunes forming transversely to constructional winds. Four different types of ripple crestline patterns are identified and likely arise due to differences in grain size and dune-modified wind speeds and secondary flow directions. Maximum measured ripple displacement in the center of Olympia Undae study area is ~ 1. 4 m yr^- 1 ? 0. 13 m. Assuming a mean ripple height of 0. 11 m and a 4 : 1 saltation to reptation ratio, the sediment flux is ~ 0. 42 m? m^- 1 yr^- 1. Adjacent to the polar ice cap, barchan dune crest displacements range between 0. 25 m yr- 1 and 2. 80 m yr- 1 and dune heights between 11 m and 31 m. Mean sediment flux is 3. 5 m? m- 1 yr- 1. Results indicate that there is a spatial decay in sediment transport across the field and that fluxes near the cap are comparable to those found in Nili Patera, Mars and Victoria Valley, Antarctica. Overall the polar boundary conditions seasonally limit sand availability by seasonal frost cover and subsurface ice. The polar boundary conditions are most influential at the dune pattern scale, but appear to have little influence on the ripple pattern or ripple mobility...|$|R

40|$|While the use {{of motor}} imagery (the mental {{representation}} of an action without overt execution) during actual training sessions is usually recommended, experimental studies examining the effect of physical fatigue on subsequent motor imagery performance are sparse and yielded divergent findings. Here, we investigated whether physical fatigue occurring during an intense sport training session affected motor imagery ability. Twelve swimmers (nine males, mean age 15. 5 years) conducted a 45 min physically-fatiguing protocol where they swam from 70 % to 100 % of their maximal aerobic speed. We tested motor imagery ability immediately before and after fatigue state. Participants randomly imagined performing a swim turn using internal and external visual imagery. Self-reports ratings, imagery times and electrodermal responses, an index of alertness from the autonomic nervous system, were the dependent variables. Self-reports ratings indicated that participants did not encounter difficulty when performing motor imagery after fatigue. However, motor imagery times were significantly shortened during posttest compared to both pretest and actual turn times, thus indicating reduced timing accuracy. Looking at the selective effect of physical fatigue on external visual imagery did not reveal any difference before and after fatigue, whereas significantly shorter imagined times and electrodermal responses (respectively 15 % and 48 % decrease, p, 0. 001) were observed during the posttest for internal visual <b>imagery.</b> A significant <b>correlation</b> (r = 0. 64; p, 0. 05) was observed between motor imagery vividness (estimated through imagery questionnaire) and autonomic responses durin...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{microstructural}} variability {{has long been}} recognized as a major contributing factor in the scatter of published fatigue data. It is also acknowledged that these effects are generally more prevalent for short cracks and in the threshold region. A number of models exist to explain individual microstructural effects such as grain boundary influence, grain cluster, average grain size, porosity etc. It is {{the aim of the}} Aeronautics and Astronautics Fatigue Lab to develop an encompassing model that accurately predicts these effects. In order to develop this model a range of material data will be required to inform and validate the model simulation. It is the aim of this thesis to develop the methods required to generate suitable fatigue crack data and also image the crack propagation and strain fields. The methodology from ASTM E 647 was used for the determination of crack growth data with the notable exception of the use of compression pre-cracking and relevant crack growth models for the ESE(T) specimen. Compression pre-cracking methods have been utilised as data have shown that standard pre-cracking methods may affect crack growth rate data and the determination of threshold values. High and low load ratio tests were conducted with closure accounted for, allowing for accurate determination of the fatigue crack growth threshold. High resolution DIC imagery was captured for a range of loads over a range of crack lengths and enabled the visualization of material strain fields.

40|$|Optical 2 D {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} such as aerial photographing and satellite imaging {{have been used in}} forest inventory for a long time. During the last 15 years, airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been adopted in many countries for the estimation of forest attributes at stand and sub-stand levels. Compared to optical remote sensing data sources, ALS data are particularly well-suited for the estimation of forest attributes related to the physical dimensions of trees due to its 3 D information. Similar to ALS, it is possible to derive a 3 D forest canopy model based on aerial imagery using digital aerial photogrammetry. In this study, we compared the accuracy and spatial characteristics of 2 D satellite and aerial imagery as well as 3 D ALS and photogrammetric remote sensing data in the estimation of forest inventory variables using k-NN imputation and 2469 National Forest Inventory (NFI) sample plots in a study area covering approximately 5800 km 2. Both 2 D data were very close to each other in terms of accuracy, as were both the 3 D materials. On the other hand, the difference between the 2 D and 3 D materials was very clear.

This region is characterized by shallow continental shelf subjected to semi-diurnal tides. Industrial activities in this area since the early 1970 s {{may have contributed to the}} degradation of the biodiversity of the ecosystem with eutrophication problems and disappearance of benthic and planktonic species. To assess the long-term effect of anthropogenic and natural discharges on the Gulf of Gabes, the optical environment of the coastal waters is assessed from in situ measurements of total suspended matter concentration (TSM), Secchi depth and turbidity (TU). This monitoring requires regular seaborne measurements (monthly), which is very expensive and difficult to obtain. The objective of the present study is the evaluation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) AQUA data compared with two sampling campaigns realized at the study area. To map turbidity data from MODIS images, a semi-empirical algorithm was applied at band 667  nm. This bio-optical algorithm has already been calibrated and validated on the Belgian coast. The validation of this algorithm on the Gulf of Gabes using in situ measurements of turbidity and remotely sensed turbidity obtained from MODIS <b>imagery</b> shows a <b>correlation</b> coefficient of 68. 9 %.

40|$|Accurately {{measuring}} soil {{organic matter}} content (SOM) in paddy fields is important because SOM {{is one of the}} key soil properties controlling nutrient budgets in agricultural production systems. Estimation of this soil property at an acceptable level of accuracy is important; especially in the case when SOM exhibits strong spatial dependence and its measurement is a time- and labor-consuming procedure. This study was conducted to evaluate and compare spatial estimation by kriging and cokriging with remotely sensed data to predict SOM using limited available data for a 367 -km(2) study area in Haining City, Zhejiang Province, China. Measured SOM ranged from 5. 7 to 40. 4 g kg(- 1), with a mean of 19. 5 g kg(- 1). Correlation analysis between the SOM content of 131 soil samples and the corresponding digital number (DN) of six bands (Band 1 - 5 and Band 7) of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) <b>imagery</b> showed that <b>correlation</b> between SOM and DN of Band 1 was the highest (r= - 0. 587). We used the DN of Band I as auxiliary data for the SOM prediction, and used descriptive statistics and the kriging standard deviation (STD) to compare the reliabilities of the predictions. We also used cross-validation to validate the SOM prediction. Results indicate that cokriging with remotely sensed data was superior to kriging in the case of limited available data and the moderately strong linear relationship between remotely sensed data and SOM content.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of two parts. In the first part we developed a new method for lidar DTM generation. In the second part we used vertical lidar profiles for model-based prediction of the percentages of individual tree species in the forest and to predict different light properties of the forest In steep forested relief, the existing algorithms for computing DTM from the lidar data have problems {{to distinguish between the}} ground returns and the vegetation returns, because on the steep slopes the local cloud neighborhood has properties similar to the vegetation. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we introduced a new method of DTM computation from the lidar data, called REIN, which is especially adapted to the steep forested topography. The method makes use of the lidar point redundancy to mitigate errors. It does not belong into any of the known algorithm groups, because it randomly samples the point cloud. REIN has a greater ability to adapt to variations in the terrain and forest cover. Because of ensuring that each part of the area of interest gets equal probability of being sampled, REIN results in a homogeneous DTM even under non-homogeneous data input conditions. REIN also takes care of the problem of negative outliers due to multi-path reflections. In the second part of the thesis we used vertical vegetation profiles, computed from the small-footprint discrete lidar data, to predict the percentages of individual tree species in the forest and to predict different light properties of the forest. The ensemble methods of machine learning were used together with different combinations of the explanatory variables, derived both from the discrete lidar data and from the aerial infra-red <b>imagery.</b> The <b>correlations</b> for the eight best modeled target variables are between 0, 76 and 0, 83. Relatively modest correlations are attributed to the heterogeneity of forests in the test area, to the errors in the training set, and to the imprecise positioning of the field plots (due to GPS errors under the forest canopy), resulting in a possible spatial shift between the field data and lidar data. Infrared explanatory variables contribute the most to the predictions of target variables referring to the tree composition. Lidar data are better suited to explain the forest light properties, which in turn are linked to the spatial distribution of the above-ground forest biomass. The machine-learned ensemble models are more accurate and more robust than the linear regression models. The multi-target models are more suitable than the single-target ensemble models, because the total time to set up a multi-target model is shorter than the time needed to set up multiple single-target models. The multi-target models are also easier to implement. The forest has been delimited into the forest stands by image segmentation based on the model-based raster maps...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{benefit from}} mental {{practice}} training after stroke, {{one must be}} able to engage in motor imagery, and thus reliable motor imagery assessment tools tailored to persons with sensorimotor impairments are needed. The aims of this study were to (1) examine the test-retest reliability of the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ- 20) and its short version (the KVIQ- 10) in healthy subjects and subjects with stroke, (2) investigate the internal consistency of both KVIQ versions, and (3) explore the factorial structure of the two KVIQ versions. Methods: The KVIQ assesses on a five-point ordinal scale the clarity of the image (visual: V subscale) and the intensity of the sensations (kinesthetic: K subscale) that the subjects are able to imagine from the first-person perspective. Nineteen persons who had sustained a stroke (CVA group) and 46 healthy persons (CTL group) including an age-matched (aCTL: n = 19) control group were assessed twice by the same examiner 10 to 14 days apart. The test-retest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coef- ficients (ICCs). The internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) and the factorial structure of both KVIQ versions were studied in a sample of 131 subjects. Results: In the CVA group, the ICCs ranged from 0. 81 to 0. 90, from 0. 73 to 0. 86 in the aCTL group, and from 0. 72 to 0. 81 in the CTL group. When imagining movements of the affected and unaffected limbs (upper and lower limbs combined) ICCs in the CVA group ranged, respectively, from 0. 71 to. 87 and from 0. 86 to 0. 94. Likewise, when imagining movement of the dominant and nondominant limbs, ICCs in the aCTL group ranged, respectively, from 0. 75 to 0. 89 and from 0. 81 to. 92. Cronbach a values were, respectively, 0. 94 (V) and 0. 92 (K) for the KVIQ- 20 and 0. 89 (V) and 0. 87 (K) for the KVIQ- 10. The factorial analyses indicated that two factors explained 63. 4 % and 67. 7 % of total variance, respectively. Conclusion: Both versions of the KVIQ present similar psychometric properties that support their use in healthy individuals and in persons post-stroke.

Analysis of the observations and simulations focused on the 24 h period of most rapid intensification for each case as determined from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 12 h mean sea level pressure analyses. ^ Comparisons between the two sets of data highlight inadequacies in model moisture physics and suggest possibilities for improvement. Multiple tests of a single cyclone showed that the final forecast cyclone intensity and position was highly sensitive to the chosen convective parameterization scheme, which determines sub-grid scale warming and drying processes and their effects on storm evolution. ^ SSM/I observations of area-averaged precipitation and an index that responds to cold-cloud (convective) precipitation to the northeast of surface cyclone centers correlated well (∼ 0. 80) with the latitude-normalized deepening rate (NDR) of the study sample. This large correlation was replicated by the numerical model, although the area-averaged precipitation region yielding the maximum coefficient differed significantly from that determined using microwave <b>imagery.</b> A similar <b>correlation</b> emerged between model-derived area- and vertically-averaged vertical motion fields and NDR. The similarity of these correlations for nearly coincident averaging regions relative to the storm center implicates unrealistic patterns in vertical motion fields as the reason for the failure of the model to accurately capture the observed optimal area-averaging region. This region was located near the storm triple point and occluded (bent-back) front, both potentially strongly convective environments. ^ The contribution to cyclone evolution by vorticity and thermal forcing mechanisms was examined by applying a derived Pettersen-Sutcliffe diagnostic equation to dynamic and thermodynamic model output fields. Comparisons of time-averaged instantaneous filtered and unfiltered surface pressure tendency fields indicated storms having strong intensification rates had significant contributions from small-scale features. All storms experienced greatest development during the middle period of the most rapidly deepening phase (from 33 - 39 h). Examination of unfiltered and filtered contributions to surface pressure deepening by vorticity and thermal forcing mechanisms yielded no useful information due to the existence of 2 ̆ 2 spikes 2 ̆ 2 in the unfiltered fields at isolated grid points (pseudo-singularities). ^ Finally, composites were produced for three classes of observed and simulated cyclone deepening rate showing horizontal and vertical distributions of moist, dynamic and thermodynamic processes. Composites of conditional symmetric instability (CSI) using a parameterization scheme external to the model indicated the presence of CSI, which was unaccounted for by the model, primarily in the proximity of the warm front for all types of cyclone intensification rates. Accounting for CSI in such a location relative to the storm center could potentially provide additional intensification through diabatic heating resulting from latent heat release, which would act to amplify the upper-level ridge. Comparisons of composites located at the 850, 500, and 300 hPa levels indicated greater low-level baroclinicity during the antecedent deepening phase (from 12 - 24 h) and deeper upper-level geopotential troughs during the most rapidly deepening phase (from 24 - 48 h) for storms exhibiting strong intensification rates. ...|$|R
