5|$|The company {{still made}} some acquisitions, such as buying the <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> {{specialist}} Odigo for $20 million in 2002, after having previously purchased a 12percent stake in it in 2001.|$|E
5|$|October 10, 2008: Twitter's status blog {{announced}} that <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> (IM) service {{was no longer}} a temporary outage and needed to be revamped. It was {{announced that}} Twitter aims to return its IM service pending necessary major work.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1980s, Telemap Group Ltd {{launched}} a fee-based service allowing users to connect their ZX Spectrums via a Prism Micro Products VTX5000 modem to a viewdata service known as Micronet 800, hosted by Prestel, which provided {{news and information}} about microcomputers. The service allowed a form of <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> and online shopping.|$|E

50|$|Free Skype-to-Skype {{calls and}} <b>instant</b> <b>messages</b> were only {{available}} {{in the country where}} the phone was purchased, or while roaming on 3’s sister networks. Skype-to-Skype calls and <b>instant</b> <b>messages</b> were subject to a fair use policy of 4,000 minutes of outgoing calls and 10,000 <b>instant</b> <b>messages</b> per month (depending on country).|$|R
50|$|The Silent Circle <b>Instant</b> <b>Message</b> Protocol (SCIMP) was an {{encryption}} {{scheme that}} was developed by Silent Circle. It enabled private conversation over <b>instant</b> <b>message</b> transports such as XMPP (Jabber).|$|R
5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential. Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (<b>instant</b> <b>messaging).</b>|$|E
5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|Jonze {{conceived}} {{the idea in}} the early 2000s after reading an article about a website that allowed for <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> with an artificial intelligence program. After making I'm Here (2010), a short film sharing similar themes, Jonze returned to the idea. He wrote {{the first draft of}} the script in five months. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles and Shanghai in mid-2012. The role of Samantha was recast in post-production, with Samantha Morton being replaced with Johansson. Additional scenes were filmed in August 2013 following the casting change.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to receiving the <b>instant</b> <b>message</b> from Cho, Andy Koch, Cho's roommate, notified the resident advisor and phoned his father. Koch {{and his father}} alerted Virginia Tech campus police that Cho had sent Koch a suicidal <b>instant</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
50|$|Google Talk was {{integrated}} into Gmail where users could send <b>instant</b> <b>messages</b> to other Gmail users. As it worked within a browser, the Google Talk client {{did not need}} to be downloaded to send <b>instant</b> <b>messages</b> to Gmail users.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} {{also features}} on-screen text transcripts of the spoken phrases {{in their original}} language along with the translation. In addition, Skype Translator supports Skype <b>Instant</b> <b>Message,</b> which can translate users’ <b>instant</b> <b>messages</b> into 51 languages supported by Microsoft Translator.|$|R
5|$|Candidates {{may use the}} Internet {{to publish}} {{election}} advertising, including posting content on electronic media applications (such as digital banners, <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> software, mobile applications, RSS feed readers and widgets), social networking services and other websites, and sending e-mails. SMS and MMS messages can also be sent. Candidates must notify the returning officer of each platform on the Internet {{that is used to}} publish election advertising within 12 hours after the start of the campaign period (that is, the time when the place of nomination closes on nomination day) and thereafter each time before a platform is used for such publication. Candidate and their election agents must use their best efforts to ensure that all Internet election advertising is published in accordance with the law; in other words, the returning officer must be satisfied that all reasonable steps in the circumstances were taken. Contravening any regulations relating to election advertising on the Internet is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, jail of up to 12 months, or both.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{development}} staff had {{an equal number}} of writers as illustrators, it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members' individual preferences. The staff also commented that {{the development}} team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and <b>instant</b> <b>messaging.</b> Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated, Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem.|$|E
5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar across the top of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E

25|$|<b>Instant</b> <b>messaging</b> spam {{makes use}} of <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> systems. Although less {{ubiquitous}} than its e-mail counterpart, {{according to a report}} from Ferris Research, 500 million spam IMs were sent in 2003, twice the level of 2002. As <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> tends to not be blocked by firewalls, it is an especially useful channel for spammers. This is very common on many <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> systems such as Skype.|$|E

25|$|On 29 October 2015, the Tor Project {{released}} Tor Messenger Beta, an <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> program {{based on}} Instantbird with Tor and OTR built in {{and used by}} default. Like Pidgin and Adium, Tor Messenger supports multiple different <b>instant</b> <b>messaging</b> protocols; however, it accomplishes this without relying on libpurple, implementing all chat protocols in the memory-safe language JavaScript instead.|$|E
