25|$|In Roman times, {{there was}} a demand for common {{ostriches}} to use in venatio games or cooking. They have been hunted and <b>farmed</b> for their <b>feathers,</b> which at various times have been popular for ornamentation in fashionable clothing (such as hats during the 19th century). Their skins are valued for their leather. In the 18th century they were almost hunted to extinction; <b>farming</b> for <b>feathers</b> began in the 19th century. At {{the start of the}} 20th century there were over 700,000 birds in captivity. The market for feathers collapsed after World War I, but commercial <b>farming</b> for <b>feathers</b> and later for skins and meat became widespread during the 1970s.

Moreover, the men took an easy, perhaps unscientific, method of {{classifying}} <b>feathered</b> <b>game.</b> Nearly everything with wings that dwelt chiefly on lake, river, or sea they called ducks, and all the feathered creatures of the forest they styled partridges. From this simple classification, however, were excepted swans, geese, eagles, and hawks.|$|R

50|$|Most {{religious}} observances {{are held}} with the balian presiding.

The religious ceremonies attending the celebration of the great buklog festival, held to propitiate the diwata or to celebrate an event of communal significance, are exclusively performed by the balian. In general, the functions of a balian are those of a medium who directs the living person’s communication with the spirits, of a priest who conducts sacrifices and rituals, and of a healer of the sick.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} caponisation on live weight, weight gain, carcass {{characteristics}} and blood plasma values of pheasants were examined. Eighty pheasants reared in <b>feathered</b> <b>game</b> nurserie {{were included in}} experiment. The birds were castrated at 8 or 12 weeks of age. The age of castration up to 12 weeks showed complete testicular regeneration while when castration was performed at 8 weeks of age testicular regeneration reached 25 %. Pheasant capons, that were fed higher protein diet, showed lower live weights but higher dressing percentages than game pheasants. Weight and weight gain of pheasant capons were increased till December. Blood plasma values showed significantly higher levels (P< 0. 01) of Ca, total protein and albumin for pheasant capons but these differences were related to composition of feed mixtures. We concluded that pheasant capons fed higher protein diet represents better commercial product than pheasant reared as game animals but that more studies under different feeding conditions and alternative breeding systems are necessary to clarify the effects of caponisation of pheasants and to justify production.

50|$|The Cretan Hound uses both {{sight and}} scent {{on the hunt}} {{and they have a}} {{particular}} tendency to taste the aerial or ground scent, {{even to the point of}} sucking it from pebbles and stones. When the prey is sensed, the tail moves in circular fashion and the hound becomes rigid, moments before the chase begins. Meek, affectionate, aristocratic, yet deadly on the chase, it’s a polite hound that comes alive in the presence of prey; clean, gentle, elegant in form and movement, it’s never vulgar or overwhelming in gestures. Slightly reserved with strangers, it’s naturally inquisitive and tolerant. The Cretan Hound lives happily together with other domestic animals but will ruthlessly chase the neighbor’s cat! Excellent, gentle and very affectionate with children. It rarely barks but will give notice of strangers approaching its home; at the farm it will kill mice and rats and it’s not indifferent to <b>feathered</b> <b>game,</b> but the latter use will make the breed lazy and untidy in the hunt; its constitution needs the challenge of the true chase.|$|R
30|$|Microorganisms {{isolated}} from keratin-rich environments such as poultry feather wastes, slaughterhouse wastes, and leather wastes, have high keratinolytic activity (Brandelli et al. 2010; Fakhfakh-Zouari et al. 2010; Khardenavis et al. 2009). Most of the keratinases from these strains are extracellular enzymes, {{with only a}} minute fraction being intracellular or associated with the cell wall.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of hanging {{position}} of hunted pheasant carcasses (secured by the head as compared to hanging position secured by the legs) on the biogenic amine concentration in the thigh and breast muscles. The carcasses of <b>feathered</b> <b>game</b> (Phasianus colchicus), left entirely untreated after hunting and placed in a storage space at a pre-set temperature of 7 °C for 21 days were used in the study. Samples of breast and thigh muscles were taken at regular weekly intervals. Measurement of biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine, tryptamine, histamine, phenylethylamine) was based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Higher biogenic amine concentrations were detected in the muscles (both breast and thigh) of pheasants hanging by their legs compared to pheasants hanging by their heads (no statistically significant difference in biogenic amine concentration between monitored groups was, however, established). Higher concentrations of biogenic amines were found in the thigh muscles compared to breast muscles in both monitored groups. The obtained results show, that hanging the carcasses of pheasants during storage by the head is more suitable method in term of biogenic amine concentration than storing carcasses hanging by the legs...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine and compare the levels of amino acids (AAs) in breast and thigh muscles of six species of <b>feathered</b> <b>game</b> of the same age. The experiment involved the following species: wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), chukar partridge (Alectoris chucar), Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and grey partridge (Perdix perdix). The highest content of AAs was found in the chukar partridge (breast: 815. 7 ± 47. 71 g/kg; thigh: 771. 4 ± 107. 0 g/kg, on a dry matter basis), the lowest levels of AAs were found in Japanese quail (breast: 734. 2 ± 45. 07 g/kg) and grey partridge (thigh: 614. 9 ± 49. 66 g/kg). In all examined species, the level of histidine in breast muscles differed (P ≤ 0. 01) from that in thigh muscles. In all investigated species, the levels of essential AAs in breast muscles were higher (P ≤ 0. 01) than those in thigh muscles, whereas the levels of non-essential AAs in breast muscles were lower (P ≤ 0. 01) than those in thigh muscles. Breast muscles are therefore more valuable than thigh muscles because of the content of essential AAs...|$|R
50|$|The vine ripens {{relatively}} quite late, producing good yields {{with high}} resistance to fungal disease and rot. The grape crossed with another Veneto wine grape, Marzemina bianca, to produce Raboso Veronese. It produces quite a large, tight, cylindrical bunch {{with one or}} two wings and a sturdy bunchstem. Its spheroid grape has a blue-black, very tough skin with good bloom. The flesh has a varietal, neutral flavour which is slightly meaty and sweet-acidulous-astringent.Each grape has two or three average-sized, pear-shaped seeds. This vigorous vine can produce an abundant yield. Optimal vinification requires appropriate maceration of juice and skins: this results in a full-bodied wine, acidic and tannic when young, ideal for laying down.Left to age in wooden barrels, it will gradually acquire a deep ruby colour with garnet tinges, a broad and full bouquet of wild violets with a concentrated note of morello cherry; the palate is dry, attractively astringent, and full-flavoured.At full maturity, Raboso Piave {{is one of the great}} Venetian reds, probably the best among the traditional wine of Eastern of Veneto.
