Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax.

The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E
