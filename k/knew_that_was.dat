25|$|While a cyclone {{had been}} {{predicted}} for the later days in May, many disregarded the warning or felt that St. Louis city {{would not be}} affected. The day started quietly, with people going about their daily business. The weather in the morning did not indicate any severe threat of a tornado. The local weather bureau predicted thunderstorms, but nothing more serious. Around noon, the clouds began to appear more ominous and the barometric pressure dropped, alarming those who <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> an indication of a tornado.|$|E

25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which was the story of the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E

500|$|For the exteriors of {{the capital}} city of King's Landing, that had been doubled for Malta for the entire season 1, now the {{production}} flew to the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Known as The Pearl of the Adriatic, the city proved to be a good representation of King's Landing since it shared many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, [...] "The minute we started walking around the city walls we <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> it. You read the descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that's what the actual city is. It has the sparkling sea, sun and beautiful architecture." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] was {{the first}} episode that did not feature regular {{character}} Kramer (Michael Richards), Jerry's neighbor. David explained {{that the reason for}} Kramer's absence was because—during Seinfelds early seasons—the character never left his apartment and did not go out with the other three. Richards was still displeased with the absence of his character, as he felt the episode was a breakthrough and—as such—essential for the series' development. In an interview for the Seinfeld first and second season DVD box set, he commented, [...] "The Chinese restaurant episode was so unique, and I just {{wanted to be a part}} of that because it was cutting edge.

500|$|From the outset, Euston {{intended}} to create {{two versions of}} the story; a four-part serial for broadcast on UK television and a 100-minute film, The Quatermass Conclusion, for distribution abroad. While writing the scripts, Kneale was [...] "careful not to pad, because I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the obvious thing, but to write in material which can be removed". There is one major deviation between the two versions; in the film version, the scene where Quatermass, separated from Annie Morgan while transporting Isabel to London, encounters a band of elderly people living in a scrapyard is completely absent; this meant that {{two versions of the}} hospital scene where Isabel dies were shot—one with Quatermass present (the film version) and one without (the television version). There was little interest among film distributors in The Quatermass Conclusion, and it received only a limited theatrical release.|$|E

While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized.

The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward.

500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E
