5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E
5|$|In Malagasy culture lemurs, {{and animals}} in general, have souls (ambiroa) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if {{killed in a}} cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other {{elements}} of daily life, have {{been a source of}} taboos, known locally as fady, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad,</b> onto human babies. In general, fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.|$|E
5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad,</b> seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E

25|$|Some {{argue that}} it is {{impossible}} to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable.

Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.|$|E
40|$|When {{utilities}} are additive, we uncovered {{in our previous}} paper (Bogomolnaia et al. "Dividing <b>Goods</b> <b>or</b> <b>Bads</b> under Additive Utilities") many similarities but also surprising differences {{in the behavior of}} the familiar Competitive rule (with equal incomes), when we divide (private) <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> <b>bads.</b> The rule picks in both cases the critical points of the product of utilities (or disutilities) on the efficiency frontier, but there is only one such point if we share goods, while there can be exponentially many in the case of bads. We extend this analysis to the fair division of mixed items: each item can be viewed by some participants as a good and by others as a bad, with corresponding positive or negative marginal utilities. We find that the division of mixed items boils down, normatively as well as computationally, to a variant of an all <b>goods</b> problem, <b>or</b> of an all bads problem: in particular the task of dividing the non disposable items must be either good news for everyone, <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> news for everyone. If at least one feasible utility profile is positive, the Competitive rule picks the unique maximum of the product of (positive) utilities. If no feasible utility profile is positive, this rule picks all critical points of the product of disutilities on the efficient frontier. Comment: 14 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
