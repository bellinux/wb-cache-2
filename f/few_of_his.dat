5|$|Wood's {{recordings}} did {{not remain}} in the catalogues long after his death. The Record Guide, 1956, lists none of his records. A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> recordings have subsequently been reissued on compact disc, including the Decca and Columbia Vaughan Williams recordings from 1936 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Magheru, {{upon the}} advice of Colquhoun, ordered the demobilization of his troops (October 10), and, {{accompanied}} by a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officers, passed the Southern Carpathians into Hermannstadt—at the time, the Transylvanian city was nominally in the Austrian Empire, but gripped by the Hungarian Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Many of Riley's {{poems are}} filled with musical references. Riley had no musical education, and could not read sheet music, but learned from his father how to play guitar, and from a friend how to play violin. He {{performed}} in two different local bands, and became so proficient on the violin {{he was invited to}} play with a group of adult Freemasons at several events. A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being A Short'nin' Bread Song—Pieced Out.|$|E
50|$|The first Period of Lu You's {{works is}} from his teenage years to age 46. This period, {{although}} the longest, contains the <b>fewest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works, {{about two hundred}} poems, because he himself destroyed his early works in his later years.|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Staunton's often-criticized {{description}} of Anderssen as Germany's second best player, after Anderssen {{had won the}} 1851 London International tournament, may have been reasonable {{on the basis of}} what is now known about von der Lasa's skill. Staunton was sometimes an objective chess commentator: a large percentage of his 1860 book Chess Praxis was devoted to Morphy's games, which he praised highly; and in The Chess-Player's Companion (1849) Staunton sometimes criticised his own play, and presented a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> losses.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{scarcity}} of artefacts and inscriptions relating to Menkauhor's reign, <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> activities are known. Menkauhor sent an expedition to Sinai to exploit the mines of turquoise and copper in the Wadi Maghareh. The expedition is evidenced by a damaged rock inscription showing Menkauhor's titulary {{which is one of}} the few attestations dating to his lifetime. The mines of Sinai had been exploited since the Third Dynasty (2686 BC–2613 BC), and both Menkauhor's predecessor Nyuserre Ini and successor Djedkare Isesi sent expeditions to the Wadi Maghareh.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{more scientific}} items during his decade in the United States than during all {{his years in}} England: some 45 papers, not counting reprintings, and four pamphlets, not counting subsequent editions, but in general his science was now anticlimactic. <b>Few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> papers contributed anything significantly new {{to the field of}} chemistry; most were committed to combatting the new chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Season 5, set 18 months after, {{begins at}} 7:00a.m. Jack is {{believed}} to be dead by everyone except a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed by terrorists with connections to the American government. The acquisition of nerve gas by the terrorists poses a new threat, and Jack discovers an insidious conspiracy while trying to stop those responsible.|$|E
5|$|The 1st-centuryAD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas {{second only}} to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' {{influence}} has been found or suspected {{in a wide range}} of ancient writing; Longus' 2nd centuryAD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him. Almost all that he wrote seems to have disappeared within two centuries, though, so it is unlikely that any writer later than the 2nd centuryBC read any but a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lines.|$|E
5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} {{teaching}} in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his message on the significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E

50|$|Running back O.J. Simpson {{would have}} a stellar year, despite the Bills poor team record. Simpson would rush for 742 yards on 183 attempts. However, Simpson would only score 5 touchdowns, the <b>fewest</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career in one season. The Bills would only score 21 touchdowns as a team during the 1971 season, the fewest in {{franchise}} history.|$|R
5|$|A Republican in a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to {{his handling of the}} Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 1990s, after the {{completion}} of his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions, as well as writing lyrics for musicians Yellow Magic Orchestra and Debbie Harry. He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of the dead) in 1992 before co-authoring The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|By his own reckoning, Offenbach {{composed}} {{more than}} 100 operas. Both {{the number and}} the noun are open to question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to all but a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stage works as operettas, rather than operas. Offenbach reserved the term opérette (English: operetta) or opérette bouffe for some of his one-act works, more often using the term opéra bouffe for his full-length ones (though {{there are a number}} of one- and two-act examples of this type). It was only with the further development of the Operette genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term opérette began to be used for works longer than one act. Offenbach also used the term opéra-comique for at least 24 of his works in either one, two or three acts.|$|E

5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E
5|$|Efe's obverse dies {{show the}} king's name and title, usually spelt {{with a mixture}} of runes and Latin script, with some aspects of the coins {{occasionally}} ill-drawn or omitted altogether. The king's name is generally arranged around the central motif of a pellet (or a cross) within a circle of pellets: this layout probably derived from Northumbrian coins. The reverse dies consisted of a cross and the letters E F E, placed in four sectors that were divided off by lines. It can be shown that Efe did not use his dies in any particular or consistent order. Calculations have been made that suggest that <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dies remain undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He felt {{he had become a}} journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E

500|$|Although Davenport {{continued}} at the Evening Mail after Roosevelt was elected, the quality <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work declined; <b>fewer</b> and <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> images {{were selected for}} inclusion in Albert Shaw's Review of Reviews. He also began to devote large periods to other activities; in 1905, he spent months in <b>his</b> home state <b>of</b> Oregon, first visiting Silverton and then showing, at Portland's Lewis and Clark Exposition, the animals he bred.|$|R
5|$|In {{a report}} to the Holy Synod that year, Bishop Tikhon {{proposed}} dramatic changes in the operation of the diocese. Recognizing the needs of the growing multi-ethnic Orthodox community, he recommended reforming the missionary diocese into a self-supporting American diocese, composed of numerous ethnic auxiliary dioceses. His plan called for Russian (New York), Arab (Brooklyn), Serbian (Chicago), and Greek dioceses. Additionally, he called for the formation of a governing council, composed of clergy and laity, which would meet to discuss administrative and canonical issues. On March 5, 1907, the first All-American Sobor convened in Mayfield, Pennsylvania. Following Archbishop Tikhon's reassignment to Russia that year, however, <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reforms were implemented.|$|E
5|$|Maclean {{raised a}} force of about 180 Emigrants, {{and a number of}} militia. By the time he reached Sorel on October 14, he had raised, in {{addition}} to the Emigrants, about 400 militia men, sometimes using threatening tactics to gain recruits. His and Carleton's hopes were dashed on October 30, when Carleton's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 (mostly militia, with some Emigrants and Indian support) was repulsed by the Americans. A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boats were landed, but most were driven off by Seth Warner's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
