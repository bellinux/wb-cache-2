500|$|To {{what extent}} Mint Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) George T. Morgan should be {{credited}} {{for work on}} the half dollar and quarter eagle is uncertain; Mint officials and employees were not consistent on this point. [...] Assistant Director Mary M. O'Reilly said in 1936 that the bureau's records indicated that Barber was the designer. [...] Later the same year, she forwarded a statement by an unnamed Philadelphia Mint employee stating that by {{the very nature of}} Barber's and Morgan's long association (Morgan was Barber's assistant for 37 years), the two engravers would have conferred frequently, and that Morgan's technique is [...] "very obvious on both sides of both coins". The employee concluded that [...] "no mistake could be made, in my opinion, in crediting both men with the execution of these two coins. [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> this is correct." [...] Q. David Bowers, in his book on commemoratives, mentions the dispute, credits Barber on the obverses of both coins, and gives both men credit on the reverse of the half dollar. He asserts Morgan created the reverse of the quarter eagle.|$|E

Mussolini wrote to Bergonzoli: [...] "I have given you a difficult task but one suited to your courage and experience as an old and intrepid soldier—the task of defending the fortress of Bardia to the last. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> 'Electric Beard' and his brave soldiers will stand at whatever cost, faithful to the last." [...] Bergonzoli replied: [...] "I am aware of the honour and I have today repeated to my troops your message — simple and unequivocal. In Bardia we are and here we stay." [...] Bergonzoli had approximately 45,000 defenders under his command. The Italian divisions defending the perimeter of Bardia included remnants of four divisions.

[...] Bergonzoli also had the remnants of the disbanded 64th [...] "Catanzaro" [...] Infantry Division, some 6,000 Frontier Guard (GaF) troops, three companies of Bersaglieri, part of the dismounted Vittorio Emanuele cavalry regiment, and a machine gun company of the 60th [...] "Sabratha" [...] Infantry Division.|$|E
500|$|The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought {{critical}} praise: [...] "Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical {{beauty and}} sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open." [...] When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after {{a long period of}} theatrical neglect, Tempos critic Robert Stein responded to ENO's 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that [...] "Adams's triumph... consists really in taking a plot chock-full of talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation... making a satisfying and engaging piece." [...] Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of The Guardian wrote that [...] "from its early visual coup {{with the arrival of the}} plane, Sellars' production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form". In Jeal's view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that [...] "Nixon in China is a great American Opera. I suspected that it was a significant work when I saw it in 1987; I was ever more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive." ...|$|E

[...] Since the late 1940s, the government had been dismissing about five homosexuals a month from civilian posts; by 1954, the number had grown twelve-fold. [...] "Mixed in with the hysterics were some logic, though: homosexuals faced condemnation and discrimination, and most of them—wishing to conceal their orientation—were vulnerable to blackmail." [...] DCI Roscoe Hillenkoetter was called to Congress to testify on homosexuals being employed at the CIA. He said, [...] "The use of homosexuals as a control mechanism over individuals recruited for espionage is a generally accepted technique which has been used at least on a limited basis for many years." [...] As soon as the DCI said these words, his aide signaled to take {{the remainder of the}} DCI's testimony off the record. Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter's notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: [...] "While this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> if Josef Stalin or a member of the Politburo or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business." [...] The Senators reluctantly agreed the CIA had to be flexible.|$|E

On February 20, 2010 Parliament Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn stated he would announce {{the dissolution of the}} coalition the next plenary week if its activity by then was not confirmed in documents. On February 17 Lytvyn had asked the coalition to provide within ten days documents that confirmed its existence, in particular, a list of at least 226 Members of Parliament who are members. Lytvyn stated {{that it was possible to}} ensure [...] "the effectiveness of the current coalition" [...] or create a new coalition in parliament. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko stated on February 22 she was holding negotiation [...] "to unite in the Verkhovna Rada the democratic and pro-Ukrainian forces, all rational deputies of Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, the Lytvyn Bloc and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc". If the current Cabinet could not be preserved Tymoshenko has stated she would go into Parliamentary opposition. During a Cabinet of Ministers meeting on February 24, 2010 Tymoshenko stated “I am certain that Our Ukraine group leaders … will stand firmly in the defense of Ukraine and everything Ukrainian. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> these leaders will not change their ideology or beliefs and join a majority coalition led by Party of Regions” (the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc or Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc faction where needed to form a new coalition). On February 24 Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine’s parliament) Volodymyr Lytvyn received a document that had been drafted by the Party of Regions faction that had been submitted for examination by all factions, except the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, according to the Party of Regions the document was not the draft of a new coalition agreement but [...] "a document submitted to the head of the Lytvyn Bloc faction in the process of talks so that he can consider this draft and we proposed that our colleagues consider this coalition agreement and make their amendments and remarks, if they deem it necessary".|$|E

2500|$|This has led {{a number}} of {{forensic}} pathologists to support Dr. Siebert's diagnosis. Mr. Steve Meadows, the State Attorney who succeeded Mr. Ober, concluded that the criticism of Dr. Siebert was politically motivated. When the Medical Examiner Commission voted not to retain Dr. Siebert following the expiration of his contract, Mr. Meadows appointed Dr. Siebert back into the position as temporary Medical Examiner. Mr. Meadows stated: [...] "I will not sacrifice Charles Siebert {{on the altar of}} political expediency or correctness. Despite what amounts to a reckless character assassination by some media outlets and, regrettably, even some members of our government, I believe Dr. Siebert to be a competent and thorough medical examiner–not beholden to anyone or any cause. Quite simply, Dr. Siebert is a well-qualified doctor doing his best to serve the people of this district. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Dr. Siebert looks forward to a hearing before an administrative judge and his first opportunity to respond to the allegations upon which the vote for his removal was based." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a visit made {{sometime}} before the attack, Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional {{head of the}} British Army, had told Lieutenant General Sir Evelyn Barker, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, to emphasise to the British servicemen that they were [...] "facing a cruel, fanatical and cunning enemy, {{and there was no}} way of knowing who was friend and who foe." [...] Since there were female terrorists as well, according to Montgomery, all fraternising with the local population would have to cease. Within a few minutes of the bombing, Barker translated this instruction into an order that [...] "all Jewish places of entertainment, cafes, restaurants, shops and private dwellings" [...] be out of bounds to all ranks. He concluded, [...] "I appreciate that these measures will inflict some hardship on the troops, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> if my reasons are fully explained to them, they will understand their propriety and they will be punishing the Jews in a way the race dislikes as much as any, by striking at their pockets and showing our contempt of them."

[...] In his autobiography Carson describes what followed: [...] "I was in advance, starting for their camp, calling for the men to follow. [...] The [...] officer called a halt, none of them would follow me. [...] I was informed that Leroux, the principle guide, told the officer in command, to halt, that the Indians wanted to have a parley. The Jicarillas started packing their goods for flight and a shot was fired that struck Captain Grier, causing no serious injury. (Due to the fact that Grier had a pair of heavy gauntlets tucked in his jacket) The captain ordered a charge, but the delay allowed all but one of the Indians to escape.

60|$|I have {{received}} a serious, and to me, at any rate, an impressive remonstrance from the Scottish Patriotic Association. It appears that I recently referred to Edward VII. of Great Britain and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, under the horrible description of the King of England. The Scottish Patriotic Association draws my {{attention to the fact}} that by the provisions of the Act of Union, and the tradition of nationality, the monarch should be referred to as the King of Britain. The blow thus struck at me is particularly wounding because it <b>is</b> particularly unjust. <b>I</b> believe in the reality of the independent nationalities under the British Crown much more passionately and positively than any other educated Englishman of my acquaintance believes in it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Scotland <b>is</b> a nation; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> nationality <b>is</b> the key of Scotland; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> all our success with Scotland has been due to the fact that we have in spirit treated it as a nation. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> Ireland <b>is</b> a nation; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> nationality <b>is</b> the key to Ireland; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> all our failure in Ireland arose from the fact that we would not in spirit treat it as a nation. It would be difficult to find, even among the innumerable examples that exist, a stronger example of the immensely superior importance of sentiment to what is called practicality than this case of the two sister nations. It is not that we have encouraged a Scotchman to be rich; it is not that we have encouraged a Scotchman to be active; it is not that we have encouraged a Scotchman to be free. It is that we have quite definitely encouraged a Scotchman to be Scotch.|$|R
