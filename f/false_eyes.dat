5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and <b>false</b> <b>eyes.</b> This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E

Did not the Versailles National Guard do duty at the Chateau? Had they not Swiss; Hundred Swiss; Gardes-du-Corps, Bodyguards so-called? Nay, it would seem, the number of Bodyguards on duty has, by a manoeuvre, been doubled: the new relieving Battalion of them arrived at its time; but the old relieved one does not depart! ...|$|E

When Volkoff destroys the copy hidden in Yuri's <b>false</b> <b>eye</b> and downloads it to another location, Mary retrieves a piece of the micro chip.|$|R
5000|$|This pattern {{may result}} in a {{predator}} confusing the back end of the fish for the front end. The foureye butterflyfish's first instinct when threatened is to flee, putting the <b>false</b> <b>eye</b> spot closer to the predator than the head. Most predators aim for the <b>eyes,</b> and this <b>false</b> <b>eye</b> spot may trick the predator into believing that the fish will flee tail first. Other potential functions of the eye spot exist. The eye spots are larger and more variable than the real eye and eye spot shape varies from vertically oval in young to more circular in adults. These features suggest other possible functions of the eye spot including: intimidating prey, altering predation reaction distances, disorientating predators, serving as a general warning, or for social communication. When escape is not possible, a foureye butterflyfish will sometimes turn to face its aggressor, head lowered and spines fully erect, like a bull about to charge. This may serve to intimidate the other animal or may remind the predator that the butterflyfish is much too spiny to make a comfortable meal.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Chiococca and Erythroxylum species, and Hamelia patens and Morinda royoc. There {{are three}} colour morphs, green, brown, and purplish-brown. The <b>false</b> <b>eyes</b> are {{conspicuous}} {{in the last}} form. The larvae start feeding {{at the beginning of}} dusk and keep feeding throughout the night. During the day they hide at the base of their host plant or in nearby vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Male {{birds of}} some species, {{such as the}} peacock, have {{conspicuous}} eyespots in their plumage, used to signal their quality to sexually selecting females. The number of eyespots in a peacock's train predicts his mating success; when a peacock's train is experimentally pruned, females lose interest. Several species of pygmy owl bear <b>false</b> <b>eyes</b> {{on the back of}} the head, misleading predators into reacting as though they were the subject of an aggressive stare.|$|E

50|$|Fulgora laternaria {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 85 - 90 mm, with a {{wingspan}} up to 100 - 150 mm. This insect has a protuberance at its head as long as 10 - 15 mm, looking like a peanut and showing <b>false</b> <b>eyes</b> to resemble that of a lizard or a serpent. The insect was originally - and mistakenly - believed to be luminescent. When attacked, it protects itself by displaying large, yellow, fake eyes on its hind wings to frighten the aggressor, and releases a foul-smelling substance. Adults can be found from June to December. They feed on the sap of plants, mainly from some trees as Hymenaea courbaril, Simarouba amara and Zanthoxylum species.|$|E

50|$|Titanium {{was first}} {{introduced}} into surgeries in the 1950s after having been used in dentistry for a decade prior. It is now the metal of choice for prosthetics, internal fixation, inner body devices and instrumentation. Titanium is used {{from head to toe}} in biomedical implants. One can find titanium in neurosurgery, bone conduction hearing aids, <b>false</b> <b>eye</b> implants, spinal fusion cages, pacemakers, toe implants, and shoulder/elbow/hip/knee replacements along with many more. The main reason why titanium is often used in the body is due to titanium's biocompatibility and, with surface modifications, bioactive surface. The surface characteristics that affect biocompatibility are surface texture, steric hindrance, binding sites, and hydrophobicity (wetting). These characteristics are optimized to create an ideal cellular response. Some medical implants, as well as parts of surgical instruments are coated with titanium nitride (TiN).|$|R

5000|$|The {{biology of}} Sematurinae {{is so far}} poorly known. The larva of Homidiana was {{illustrated}} by Westwood (1879) who incorrectly placed it among Coronidia, and was described by Fassl (1910). In 1995-1998, caterpillars were found in Costa Rica. Sematurine eggs have been described by Minet and Scoble (1999:302), and are upright, high, with vertical and finer transverse ribs. The caterpillars of Homidiana subpicta have rows of black spines {{either side of the}} dorsal midline and five pairs of prolegs. The larva of Coronidia orithea lacks such spines, and is well camouflaged like a lichen-covered twig and has realistic-looking <b>false</b> <b>eyes</b> making it resemble a predatory spider. The larvae of Mania were reared in Costa Rica in 2001 and are a bit similar to those of Coronidia being well camouflaged but bearing small projections rather than long spines one the dorsal surface. Like some Uraniidae, pupation occurs on the ground among debris. The pupa of Homidiana has a long projecting proboscis [...] "sheath" [...] with eight hooklets at the cremaster tip (Minet and Scoble, 1999).|$|E
5000|$|Males seek females by patrolling near forest {{edges and}} forest openings. In courtship, {{the male and}} female will fly about a foot apart, slowly flying {{together}} in unison. The male will then fly above and behind the female to disperse his pheromones and he will continue to do this until the female decides to mate with him. [...] Females lay their pale greenish-yellow eggs singly on host plant leaves. [...] The larva is green with two false eyespots on the thorax. It has a few blue spots on the first abdominal segment to the eighth segment. It also lives in a leaf shelter. [...] The larva is almost identical to the caterpillar of the spicebush swallowtail (Papilio troilus, except the spicebush swallowtail larva has larger <b>false</b> <b>eyes,</b> larger blue spots, and different host plant preferences.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper proposes a hybrid method for eyes {{localization}} in facial images. The novelty is in combining techniques that utilise colour, edge and illumination cues to improve accuracy. The method {{is based on}} the observation that eye regions have dark colour, high density of edges and low illumination as compared to other parts of face. The first step in the method is to extract connected regions from facial images using colour, edge density and illumination cues separately. Some of the regions are then removed by applying rules that are based on the general geometry and shape of eyes. The remaining connected regions obtained through these three cues are then combined in a systematic way to enhance the identification of the candidate regions for the eyes. The geometry and shape based rules are then applied again to further remove the <b>false</b> <b>eye</b> regions. The proposed method was tested using images from the PICS facial images database.
