5000|$|Biamplification {{enables a}} bassist {{to use a}} {{crossover}} circuit to split their bass signal into two: a low frequency signal and a high frequency signal, and then route the low and high frequencies into two power amplifiers, each of which send their powered signal to different speaker enclosures. One power amp (usually of higher power) handles the low frequencies, which are sent the larger drivers (at lower frequencies), and a less powerful amp amplifies the high frequencies, which are sent to the horn. For bass players seeking a pure, transparent sound, biamplification may produce a [...] "cleaner" [...] sound. For bass players in hard rock or heavy metal who are using an overdriven sound, biamplification may be safer for the horn or tweeter; while a clipped, distorted signal can be handled by a heavy-duty woofer, the same clipped signal will come much closer to damaging a <b>horn</b> <b>driver</b> or a tweeter. Biamping allows a bassist to have the [...] "dirty" [...] overdriven sound through their woofer(s) while keeping the signal sent to the horn clean, thus protecting the horn.

[...] Klipsch subsequently introduced horns of braced fiberglass which were said to alleviate resonances that colored the earlier, metal designs.

In 1989 Klipsch introduced a midrange horn with a tractrix flare which was said to reduce [...] "honkiness" [...] and create a more open sound quality, compared to earlier designs. Klipsch also moved away from silk diaphragms to different driver-diaphragm materials like phenolic, aluminum and titanium, to inject a purer sound into the horn in the first place.Midrange horns made entirely of formed wood were used into the 1950s.|$|E

The database includes speech sounds as well as volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, but the speech sounds were recorded separately from the acquisition MRI data; therefore, their speech spectra are not appropriate for use as the reference for the transfer functions of the vocal tract. A time-stretched pulse signal generated from a <b>horn</b> <b>driver</b> unit was introduced into the physical model at the lips, and the response signals of the models were recorded at the model’s glottis. In the measurements, the glottis of the models was sealed with a plastic plate, and the response signals were measured from a small hole in the plate using a probe microphone. This method permits accurate measurement of the transfer functions of the vocal tract under a closed-glottis condition.

Cone mid-range drivers typically resemble small woofers.

Other mid-range cone materials include plastics such as polypropylene, Cobex, Bextrene, woven Kevlar, fiberglass, carbon fiber, or light metal alloys based on aluminium, magnesium, titanium, or other alloys.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} methods for the {{professional}} development of horn loudspeakers. The basic idea is to separately describe the acoustic source (<b>horn</b> <b>driver)</b> and the device to guide the wave (horn or wave guide). The separate description of both systems allows one to freely combine the data of any driver and horn which yields an enormous flexibility when developing new driver/horn combinations. At first, it is investigated by measurements which properties of the sound wave {{can be found at}} the common interface between driver and horn. Different driver/horn combinations are analysed by decomposing the pressure and velocity profiles into orthogonal eigenfunctions. Based on the practical measurement results, several modal models for the interface are derived. On the one hand, the models must be capable to describe the three-dimensional properties of the sound wave at the interface. On the other hand, it must be possible to measure or calculate the model's parameters in practice. Then, it is described how the modal horn parameters are calculated using numerical methods (Boundary Element Method) combined with modal excitation and decomposition. The driver's parameters are acquired using a particular measurement technique. Additionally to the linear modal modelling, a method to calculate harmonic distortion in horn loudspeaker is developed and verified. Finally, it is demonstrated how to use the methods in practice. A complete development process of a horn loudspeaker is described and the results are verified by measurements. The practical relevance of the methods results not only from the high accuracy, but also from the effective application when developing horn loudspeakers...|$|E

First, only half of the participants were provided with {{a brief description of the}} FCW system. Second, four different auditory warning conditions were compared: no-auditory warning (baseline), average-urgency warning, highest-urgency warning, and an auditory icon car <b>horn.</b> <b>Drivers</b> who received FCW system training had faster reaction times and 68 % fewer collisions than drivers who did not receive training. While the highest-urgency warning produced the fastest initial glance to the forward scene, it was the car horn warning that produced robust reaction time, glance behavior, and collision benefits. Unexpectedly, 34. 7 % of distracted drivers glanced back to the center console display, following their initial forward glance, prior to braking. This unanticipated behavior resulted in longer reaction times, shorter minimum time-to-collision, and a 63. 7 % increase in collisions as compared with drivers who did not glance back to the console display. Results suggest that even brief system training can aid interaction with an FCW system and glance behavior, reaction times can improve with an auditory icon car horn as the auditory warning, and that uninterrupted forward attention upon detection of a collision threat is imperative for an effective collision avoidance response...|$|R
40|$|The outdoor {{propagation}} of spherically spreading sound waves of finite amplitude was investigated. The {{main purpose of}} the experiments {{was to determine the}} extent to which the outdoor environment, mainly random inhomogeneity of the medium, affects finite amplitude propagation. Periodic sources with fundamental frequencies in the range 6 to 8 kHz and source levels SPLlm from 140 to 149 dB were used. The sources were an array of 7 to 10 <b>horn</b> <b>drivers</b> and a siren. The propagation path was vertical and parallel to an 85 m tower, whose elevator carried the traveling microphone. The general conclusions drawn from the experimental results were as follows. The inhomogeneities caused significant fluctuations in the instantaneous acoustic signal, but with sufficient time averaging of the measured harmonic levels, the results were comparable to results expected for propagation in a quiet medium. Propagation data for the fundamental of the siren approached within 1 dB of the weak shock saturation levels. Extra attenuation on the order of 8 dB was observed. The measurements generally confirmed the predictions of several theoretical models. The maximum propagation distance was 36 m. The narrowbeam arrays were much weaker sources. Nonlinear propagation distortion was produced, but the maximum value of extra attenuation measured was 1. 5 dB. The maximum propagation distance was 76 m. The behavior of the asymetric waveforms received in one experiment qualitatively suggested that beam type diffraction effects were present. The role of diffraction of high intensity sound waves in radiation from a single horn was briefly investigated...|$|R
