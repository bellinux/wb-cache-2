25|$|The countess {{entered the}} room again to find Elisabeth distraught and weeping uncontrollably. At this point, the Emperor {{appeared}} outside her apartments, {{and was forced to}} wait there with Nopcsa, who was controlling himself only with great effort. The Empress broke the news to her husband in private; <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> a broken man.|$|E
500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith says that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so how could he know that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} Tsawa Kachu of the Ganden Palace {{showed me}} statues and rosaries (that {{belonged to the}} Fourth Dalai Lama and other lamas), but I was unable to distinguish between them! When <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> I heard him tell the people outside that I had successfully passed the tests. Later, when he became my tutor, he would often admonish me and say: [...] "You must work hard, since you were unable to recognize the objects!" ...|$|E
60|$|From {{that time}} until <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> one member or other {{was staring at}} his neck. Andrew looked anxiously in the glass over the mantelpiece but could see nothing wrong.|$|R
60|$|And {{without giving}} {{her time to}} reply, <b>he</b> hastily <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{without giving}} the boy time to utter thanks {{that might be}} unwilling, <b>he</b> quickly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
2500|$|M.B. {{said that}} during the September 19 visit he noticed a webcam pointed at Clementi's bed and thought the {{position}} [...] "was kind of strange", {{although he did not}} think that anyone was actually watching. In cross-examination, he noted he remembered this only when it later became relevant. M.B. also said that when he lay in Clementi's bed, he heard people joking and laughing in the courtyard, and it [...] "seemed like the jokes were at somebody else's expense". When <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> there were about five students who [...] "seemed to be looking at me and it seemed kind of unsettling".|$|E
60|$|The moment <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> Philip {{turned to}} Mildred angrily.|$|E
60|$|With that <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> closing but not barring the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick, gentlemen, to your horses; {{there comes}} Dunwoodie," [...] and, {{followed}} by his officers, <b>he</b> precipitately <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{with these}} words <b>he</b> hastily <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and Elizabeth heard him the next moment {{open the front door}} and quit the house.|$|R
5000|$|When Jason was fired, {{he pushed}} his chair over and swore as <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> board <b>room,</b> having argued with Bouris about his {{decision}} ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{for a few}} minutes, and {{returned}} shaking his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{and about}} two minutes {{afterwards}} the music suddenly ceased.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{and soon}} {{returned}} with Lady de Burg and Guy.|$|E
60|$|When <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> she {{expected}} an effusion of tears from her stepdaughter; but Pansy in fact treated her to something very different.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do my best," [...] {{answered}} Songbird, and then, as Tom moved restlessly, <b>he</b> hastily <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as quietly}} as he had entered it.|$|R
6000|$|Softly as {{the door}} closed Sir Eustace heard it; and then <b>he</b> too <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> murmuring, [...] "I shall soon come for my answer, Madeline." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{accompanied}} by his sons, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and I remained alone.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{with a bow}} to the courtiers <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{followed}} by Kennedy.|$|E
60|$|So speaking, Varney arose, {{and taking}} the flask from the table, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> sitting <b>room,</b> {{and after}} being gone fully ten minutes {{returned}} with a flat tin box, in which he kept some papers of value.|$|R
6000|$|... "Far be {{it from me}} to {{disagree}} with the opinion of a lady--especially when it concerns another lady," [...] he said, as <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> blue <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|His {{progress}} was stayed by a solid, forbidding slab of oak. Somehow or other, since <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> door {{had managed to}} get itself shut.|$|R
60|$|Saying this <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> hastily, {{shutting}} {{the door behind him}} with a bang.|$|E
60|$|A sudden {{flush of}} colour came over his face, and <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in haste.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Macheson {{drew up a}} {{chair for}} Letty, but she refused it, trembling.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You will excuse Thomas Pinch's want of polish, Martin,' said Mr Pecksniff, with a {{smile of}} {{patronage}} and pity, as soon as <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> 'He means well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go if you like," [...] he said shortly, [...] "but if {{you take}} Effie, mind she is {{properly}} looked after, that is all," [...] and <b>he</b> abruptly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|The man {{bowed and}} silently withdrew. Not until <b>he</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> did Feurg√©res move from his place. Then he arose {{to his feet}} and held out his hands to Isobel.|$|R
60|$|The Bishop's eyes twinkled as <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{with his}} hand on his godson's arm.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Effingham kissed Grace again affectionately, and, {{although}} she strenuously endeavoured to detain him, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and, {{passing through}} the hall, saw that the letter had been taken away.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> then <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> leaving Bathurst to {{read the}} letters which he still held in his hand, feeling that they were too {{precious}} {{to be looked at}} until he was alone.|$|R
60|$|She {{understood}} him. Her bosom heaved painfully; {{her eyes}} {{fell to the}} ground--she made no reply. The tears rose in Julian's eyes {{as he looked at}} her. <b>He</b> hurriedly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|Bruno began {{feeling in}} his pockets, {{looking more and more}} melancholy as he did so: then he put his thumb in his mouth, and {{considered}} for a minute: then <b>he</b> quietly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
