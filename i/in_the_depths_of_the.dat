5|$|The expedition, {{named after}} its supply ship, {{was a private}} venture, financed by public {{contributions}} augmented by a government grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. The expedition's team of scientists carried out a comprehensive scientific programme, while other parties explored Victoria Land and the Western Mountains. An attempted landing and exploration of King EdwardVII Land was unsuccessful. A journey to Cape Crozier in June and July 1911 was the first extended sledging journey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic winter.|$|E
5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala {{to see if they}} could succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left Cobán in August 1693 to seek out the hostile Lakandon Ch'ols <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action.|$|E
5|$|With no {{prospect}} of Tony's money, Beaver loses interest in Brenda, who is left adrift and in poverty. Meanwhile, Tony has met an explorer, Dr. Messinger, and joins him on an expedition {{in search of}} a supposed lost city in the Amazon rainforest. On the outward journey, Tony engages in a shipboard romance with Thérèse de Vitré, a young girl whose Roman Catholicism causes her to shun him when he tells her he has a wife. In Brazil, Messinger proves an incompetent organiser; he cannot control the native guides, who abandon him and Tony <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jungle. Tony falls ill, and Messinger leaves in their only canoe to find help, but is swept over a waterfall and killed.|$|E

5|$|The {{funds for}} her {{continuing}} care {{were provided by}} Charles Widmore. As a result of Theresa's fate, Oxford fired Daniel and quietly removed all references to him ever having been at the university. At some point, Daniel also performed an experiment upon himself, resulting in long-term memory damage. While in Essex, Massachusetts, Daniel saw a news report covering {{the discovery of the}} apparent wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sunda Trench. Widmore approached Daniel and after informing him that the Sunda Trench wreckage was a hoax, urged him to go to the island, which he said would heal him of his plight. At first, Daniel was reluctant, but Eloise convinced him to go. Daniel is then recruited into a covert team alongside Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader), Miles Straume (Ken Leung) and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), which is organized by Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) and led by Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason). Their mission was to travel to the island, find Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), the then current leader of the Others, and disable the Dharma Initiative station called the Tempest, which contained poisonous gases.|$|E
5|$|The play is {{sometimes}} given a historical setting, enabling audiences {{to reflect on}} the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set {{in the midst of the}} Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E

25|$|Everything {{that has}} {{happened}} since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: it was only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without them we could never come to know God.|$|E
25|$|But on August 8, {{the state}} of Virginia {{abandoned}} its plans and agreed to begin work on the northern route for Lee Boulevard. For nearly a year, state and county officials had disagreed whether the northern route rights-of-way were adequate to begin construction. The state disagreed, but Arlington County officials {{did not wish to}} spend more money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression to acquire more rights-of-way. By actively reconsidering the southern route, however, {{the state of}} Virginia put pressure on Arlington County to fix the rights-of-way problems with the northern route. Agreement to begin construction on the northern route finally was reached on August 8. The state of Virginia agreed to provide $83,450 to purchase the remaining required rights-of-way. Arlington County provided another $21,122.|$|E

25|$|As the {{half-size}} {{models were}} nearing completion in 1933, the CFA suspended the project. By now, the United States was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression. The bridge was finished and slightly over budget, and Congress was increasingly unwilling {{to appropriate money}} for any further construction except the most critical remaining construction items (such as roadways). Obtaining funds for the costly granite and expensive carving was politically impossible. Furthermore, what funds were available were impounded under the Economy Act of 1933. Nevertheless, the CFA wanted very much {{to proceed with the}} statues. With the full-size models already paid for, it asked the sculptors to finish their work. The Commission of Fine Arts visited Friedlander's White Plains, New York, studio on October 14, 1933, and approved his models.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} {{started in}} 1936 was {{planned to be}} finished sometime in 1944. The NKVD oversaw the project, drafting hundreds of military, civilian and prison workers to work on it. The underdeveloped technology of the time required special makeshift caissons (vertical mines for ventilation and soil extraction) {{to be built in}} the middle of the river. Due to technical failures and the start of the war, the construction was never finished or even disclosed to the public. The builders were able only to connect the Right Bank with the close Zhukiv Island (where the present-day southern port is situated). The flooded entrance to the tunnel and abandoned caissons can now be seen in the forests and bays of Holosiivskyi Raion. Contemporary amateur researchers believe that a large secret base component of the project, including a train station, barracks and mass graves of workers, are also located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnels.|$|E
25|$|The {{legend of}} St. James gained support {{during the reign}} of Alfonso II. The period was marked by Alfonso II's {{reaching}} out to Charlemagne for military assistance and importation of similar royal ceremonies and governmental structures. Galician hermit Pelayo claimed to observe a mysterious brightness during several nights over the wood of Libredón, in Iria Flavia diocese. Angelic songs accompanied the lights. Impressed by this phenomenon, Pelayo appeared before the bishop of Iria Flavia, Teodomirus, who – after having heard the hermit – visited the location with his retinue. Legend has it that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest was found a stone sepulchre with three corpses, which were identified as those of St. James, son of Zebedee, and his two disciples, Theodorus and Atanasius. According to the legend, king Alfonso was the first pilgrim who had come to see the Apostle: During the travel he was guided at night by the Milky Way, which from then on acquired in Spanish the name Camino de Santiago.|$|E

25|$|Rieve was {{committed}} to organizing new members in the hosiery industry. In November 1930, Rieve authorized a strike among hosiery workers in the mills around Reading, Pennsylvania. The strike collapsed after heavy employer opposition. Rieve then tried a new tactic: The union agreed to a 30 percent wage cut in the expectation that non-union mills would lower their wages below the new union level. This would trigger a massive strike, enabling the AFHW to move in and organize the workers. Roughly 3,000 workers, or {{about a third of}} the total number in the industry, struck. Rieve purposefully withheld strike aid to the workers in an attempt to increase the radicalism of the workers and raise the demand for a union. But employers were content to idle plants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression, and the strike lingered for nearly a year. Admitting defeat, Rieve signed a new contract in September 1932.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{spending}} {{increased significantly}} from $3.0 trillion in FY2008 to $3.5 trillion in FY 2009. Spending then roughly stabilized at that dollar {{level for the}} remainder of his two terms. For instance, 2014 spending of $3,506B was slightly below the 2009 level of $3,517B. Throughout 2015, the U.S. federal government spent $3.7 trillion, around the historical average relative {{to the size of the}} economy at 20.7% GDP. Projecting 2008 spending forward at the historical 5% rate, by 2015 Federal spending was $500 billion below trend. The budget deficit reached 9.8% GDP in 2009 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recession, before steadily recovering to 2.5% GDP by 2015, below the historical average (1970–2015) of 2.8% GDP. Federal spending per person rose approximately from $9,800 in 2008 to $11,400 in 2009 mainly due to the Great Recession, then declined somewhat (the first reduction since 1960) and remained relatively flat thereafter, finishing at $11,500 in 2015.|$|E
