500|$|Renault {{driver and}} two-time Championship winner Fernando Alonso created {{controversy}} {{when he said}} [...] "if I can help, I will help Massa." [...] Alonso's departure from McLaren after driving for the British team in 2007 had been acrimonious, and Alonso's dislike for the rookie Hamilton was well documented. Talking about Hamilton's penalty in Japan, Alonso said [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> but it's good he's punished anyway." [...] Hamilton refused {{to be drawn into}} the controversy: [...] "I don't particularly have an opinion on it," [...] he said, adding that he was interested only in his own race.|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{split up}} {{into two groups}} {{to head to the}} Others' camp. Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) walk on land to the camp, bringing guns and ammunition with them. Meanwhile, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) plan to use Desmond's sailboat to go by sea. Sayid plans to use black smoke as a signal, saying that [...] "this time, they will know that we are coming", a reference to the attacks in the first-season finale. When the boat reaches the Others' camp, Sayid finds it to be deserted. Meanwhile, Michael, Jack, Sawyer, Hurley and Kate engage in a gun battle with some Others that were following them, and Sawyer kills one. Jack confronts Michael about leading the group into a trap, and Michael confesses to the murders of Ana Lucia and Libby. They realize that Michael has led them to a location other than the beach, ruining their former plan to meet up with Sayid. There, they see a large pile of pneumatic tubes, suggesting that the reports sent out from the [...] discovered in the episode [...] "?" [...] had never been read. Shortly after the discovery of the tube pile, they hear whispers, and suddenly Sawyer, Kate, and Jack are incapacitated by electric darts. The hostages, bound and gagged, are brought to a dock, where it appears that the Others are led by Henry Gale (Michael Emerson). Gale keeps his bargain with Michael, returning his son, Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), to him and giving them an old fishing boat with instructions to sail on a heading of 325 degrees until they are rescued. Michael threatens Henry that he could tell the outside world of the island's location. Henry responds by telling him that it wouldn't matter as they {{would not be able to}} find the island, should they return. He also gives Michael a counter-threat: if he did tell people of the island's location, people would <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to get his son back. Michael reluctantly accepts but asks who Henry and his people are, to which Henry responds [...] "We're the good guys, Michael". Michael uses the boat to get him and Walt off the island. Hurley is then released and sent back to the other survivors with a message that they are to stay away from the Others' part of the island. As Hurley is let go, the other three captives are taken away.|$|E

Anderson {{to get the}} nomination of the Liberal Party of New York, {{a move that would}} help split the opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and, as instructed by Cohn, dropped it off at the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46 percent of the vote. Speaking after the statute of limitations for bribery had expired, Stone said, [...] "I paid his law firm. Legal fees.
