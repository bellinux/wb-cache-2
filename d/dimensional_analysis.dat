5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms of length, mass, and time using <b>dimensional</b> <b>analysis</b> was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E
5|$|To numerically add {{physical}} quantities with units, {{they must}} be expressed with common units. For example, adding 50milliliters to 150milliliters gives 200milliliters. However, if a measure of 5feet is extended by 2inches, the sum is 62inches, since 60inches is synonymous with 5feet. On the other hand, it is usually meaningless to try to add 3meters and 4square meters, since those units are incomparable; this sort of consideration is fundamental in <b>dimensional</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as <b>dimensional</b> <b>analysis.</b> Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.|$|E

40|$|A {{traditional}} two <b>dimensional</b> (planar) statistical <b>analysis</b> {{was used}} to identify the clustering types of North Central Texas traffic fatalities occurring in 2001 - 2006. Over 3, 700 crash locations clustered {{in ways that were}} unlike other researched regions. A two dimensional (x and y coordinates) space was manipulated to mimic a one dimensional network to identify the tightest clustering of fatalities in the nearly 400, 000 crashes reported from state agencies from 2003 - 2006. The roadway design was found to significantly affect crash location. A one <b>dimensional</b> (linear) network <b>analysis</b> was then used to measure the statistically significant clustering of flow variables of after dark crashes and daylight crashes. Flow variables were determined to significantly affect crash location after dark. The linear and planar results were compared and the one <b>dimensional,</b> linear <b>analysis</b> was found to be more accurate because it did not over detect the clustering of events on a network...|$|R

25|$|Unit {{conversion}} for temperature {{differences is}} {{simply a matter of}} multiplying by, e.g., 1°F / 1 K (although the ratio is not a constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one temperature scale to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple <b>dimensional</b> <b>analysis</b> can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the absolute temperature equal to −273.15°C, or the temperature difference equal to 1°C.|$|E
25|$|In physics or {{engineering}} education, a Fermi problem, Fermi quiz, Fermi question, Fermi estimate, {{or order}} estimation is an estimation problem {{designed to teach}} <b>dimensional</b> <b>analysis,</b> approximation, and such a problem is usually a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The estimation technique is named after physicist Enrico Fermi as he {{was known for his}} ability to make good approximate calculations with little or no actual data. Fermi problems typically involve making justified guesses about quantities and their variance or lower and upper bounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason is}} that there is a cutoff used to define H, and the cutoff defines the {{shortest}} wavelength. Fluctuations of H at wavelengths near the cutoff can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with the cutoff, the parameters will scale by <b>dimensional</b> <b>analysis,</b> but then comparing parameters doesn't compare behavior because the rescaled system has more modes. If the system is rescaled in such a way that the short wavelength cutoff remains fixed, the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.|$|E
