50|$|The first full-duration {{firing of}} the S-II <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> {{occurred}} 20 May 1966 when S-II-T test-fired on the A-2 test stand for 354.5 seconds.

50|$|The missile {{used by the}} Bastion-P is the P-800 Oniks, a {{supersonic}} {{anti-ship missile}} with a 200-250 kg warhead. They are fired vertically from the launchers using a solid-fuel rocket booster for initial acceleration, then use a liquid-fuel ramjet for sustained cruising at Mach 2.5. The Oniks/Yakhont's maximum range varies at 120-300 km utilizing a low-low or hi-low flight trajectory respectively. Using satellite guidance at the initial <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> and active radar guidance when approaching a target, the missile can fly to an altitude of 14000 m before descending to sea-skimming altitude of 5 m at the final stage, useful up to sea state 7.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{selection}} by the RLM of the Bf 109 as its next single-seat fighter over the He 112, Ernst Heinkel {{became interested in}} a new fighter that would leap beyond {{the performance of the}} Bf 109 as much as the Bf 109 had over the biplanes it replaced. Other German designers had similar ambitions, including Kurt Tank at Focke-Wulf. There was never an official project {{on the part of the}} RLM, but Rudolf Lucht felt that new designs were important enough to fund the projects from both companies to provide [...] "super-pursuit" [...] designs for evaluation. This would result in the single-engined He 100 fighter, and the promising twin-engine Fw 187 Falke Zerstörer-style heavy fighter, both reaching the <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> of development.|$|E

40|$|The refuge, {{located in}} Scotts Bluff County, played host {{during the summer}} of 1993 to one of only two bald-eagle nests in Nebraska, and three eaglets were reared to <b>flight</b> <b>stage.</b> A {{successful}} nest on the Middle Loup River in 1992 was the first bald-eagle nest to fledge in Nebraska in over 100 years. [See NBR 60 (2) : 59. June 1992. ] The nest was discovered on April 2 while I was inspecting an abandoned heron/cormorant rookery. A startled adult bald eagle leaped {{out of one of the}} larger nests and began making several treetop-level passes and snapping its beak over the intruder. Staff members Felix and Lucy Koenig began to make casual observations of the area during routine, biweekly wildlife surveys. Lucy relocated the nest from afar, using a spotting scope, and witnessed the first hatchling on May 5. A vantage point was selected 1 / 4 mile from the nest, and an observation blind was erected. During subsequent visits to the blind, a second and then a third (May 13) eaglet were confirmed by Mrs. Koenig. We knew that there would be anxious days ahead prior to any young leaving the nest; usually only one eaglet is produced from a successful nest. The biggest risks facing the three eaglets until <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> would be sibling rivalry and high winds. It seemed unreasonably optimistic to expect all three eaglets to fledge...|$|E

The tests revealed that the young adults from the flight 32 -h stage had a significantly decreased positive geotaxis and increased negative phototaxis when compared with ground controls. These findings suggested a greater sensitization of the least-developed <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> to post-hatching environmental influences.

30|$|The payload assumed {{for each}} flight could be {{calculated}} based on the aircraft’s maximum payload multiplied by a flight’s weight load factor. While flight schedules contain information on payload capacity available on each flight, actual passenger numbers and the (total) payload transported had to be estimated.

The sources used to determine both seat load factors and overall weight load factors include the ICAO Traffic by <b>Flight</b> <b>Stage</b> databank and ICAO’s Air Carrier statistics [19]. By combining such data with the available seats and payload capacities from the schedules, an estimation of the relevant transport performance for the years 2004 – 2008 could be provided.|$|E

The F- 1 thrust decay was normal and not appreciably different from previous (AS- 505 through 509) flights.. Analysis indicates that with an S-IC stage having only four retro motors, failure of one retro motor to ignite would result in marginal separation distances and, in the 3 -sigma case, re-contact of the two stages..

40|$|To {{resolve the}} problem of future {{airspace}} management under great traffic flow and high density condition, 4 D trajectory estimation {{has become one of}} the core technologies of the next new generation air traffic control automation system. According to the flight profile and the dynamics models of different aircraft types under different flight conditions, a hybrid system model that switches the aircraft from one <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> to another with aircraft state changing continuously in one state is constructed. Additionally, air temperature and wind speed are used to modify aircraft true airspeed as well as ground speed, and the hybrid system evolution simulation is used to estimate aircraft 4 D trajectory.

40|$|Birds on {{migration}} normally {{switch between}} flight stages and periods of stopover where fuel stores are replenished. How migratory birds divide their time between flight and stopover {{is still not}} well known. Short-term recoveries of passerine birds ringed in Sweden were analysed to investigate how far long-distance migrating passerines fly during a <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> and whether they migrate one or more flight stages in a row. Included {{in the study were}} birds recovered at least 50 km from the ringing site and within seven days from ringing. The median distance covered by the recovered birds was 245 km. About 40 % of the recoveries within 24 hours from ringing were found at least 200 km from the ringing site. The distances covered varied and many birds moved only short distances, perhaps as a result of searching for good stopover sites, while others moved much further away. Two recoveries of Sedge Warblers three days after ringing indicated that these birds had flown three nights in a row before being controlled. The results suggest that long-distance passerine migrants regularly perform several flight stages in a row, with short rests in between, before refuelling, even if there are no major barriers ahead...|$|E
