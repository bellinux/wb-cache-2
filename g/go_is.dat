5|$|Lara Croft <b>Go</b> <b>is</b> a 2015 turn-based puzzle {{video game}} in the Tomb Raider series. The player moves Lara Croft as a puzzle piece through a board game while {{avoiding}} obstacles and manipulating the environment. The developers distilled major series motifs, such as boulder chases and reaction-based gameplay, to suit Lara Croft Go time-independent gameplay.

5|$|Let <b>Go</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, {{released}} on 4 June 2002. For {{a year after}} signing a record deal with Arista, Lavigne struggled due to conflicts in musical direction. She relocated to Los Angeles, California, and recorded there, her earlier materials for the album; the kind of sound to which the label was not amenable. She was paired to the production team The Matrix, who understood her vision for the album.|$|E
5|$|Neither of Go Man Go's parents raced. His sire (father), the Thoroughbred {{stallion}} Top Deck, was bred by the King Ranch. His dam (mother) {{hailed from}} Louisiana; Go Man <b>Go</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to have}} gained his swiftness on the track from her. For {{the first years of}} Go Man Go's racing career, his owner faced difficulty in registering him with the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), a matter that remained unresolved until 1958.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex <b>Go</b> <b>is</b> limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

50|$|Carl Janfalk (a.k.a. Calle) {{showed up}} and during the very first {{rehearsal}} {{it was obvious that}} he was the right guy. No bullshit, no stress, no worries! Carl was in. Blood Tsunami entered Midrange Studios in January 2012 and together with engineer Anders Henningsen they recorded a new 6 track demo. The new demo displayed a band that had gotten harder, dirtier and meaner during their hiatus. The songs was shorter, more in your face and stripped to the bone. Long <b>gone</b> <b>was</b> the NWOBHM influences, long <b>gone</b> <b>was</b> the Swedish sounding riffs, long <b>gone</b> <b>was</b> the screaming vocals and the growling backing vocals. Long <b>gone</b> <b>was</b> the ten billion kick drums and long song structures. Blood Tsunami was reborn and appeared to be more pissed off, ferocious and vicious that ever before.|$|R
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to <b>go</b> <b>is</b> in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|Charizard {{appeared}} {{as the main}} Pokémon in the short novel, Charizard Go! Adapted by Tracey West, the novelisation retells Ash's journey with his Charmander, and it reaches its climax as Ash and Charizard battle in the Pokémon League at the Indigo Plateau against his good friend Ritchie. The story covers Ash and his companions finding the abandoned Charmander, the battles in which Charmeleon did not listen to Ash, and Charizard's battle against Blaine's Magmar. Charizard <b>Go!</b> <b>is</b> the sixth novel in the Pokémon Chapter Books series. Another chapter novel, All Fired Up: Pokémon the Johto Journeys, adapted by Jennifer Johnson, covers the portion of Ash's journey near Violet City and the Characific Valley.

He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them <b>go</b> <b>is</b> only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her too dangerous to be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him {{into the heart of the}} Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Go</b> <b>was</b> {{very much}} the brain child of Bob Ayling and when he left British Airways, <b>Go's</b> future <b>was</b> {{rendered}} shaky. In November 2000, BA announced it planned to sell Go, as part of efforts to improve profit levels, coupled with concerns that <b>Go</b> <b>was</b> attracting customers from BA's own services. Estimated gains from the sale fluctuated, and in January 2001 British Airways admitted that its initial estimates may have been incorrect and that they now estimated <b>Go</b> to <b>be</b> worth only £200m. With the revised forecasts, {{there seemed to be}} an increase in pressure to sell Go as soon as possible, possibly within two months. <b>Go</b> <b>was</b> sold in June 2001 in a management buyout led by Cassani with the cooperation of private equity firm 3i for £100 million.
