25|$|Aldehyde substituents suffer {{nucleophilic}} addition in {{the presence}} of organolithium compounds; however, adducts of aldehydes with lithium diamines can serve as effective directing groups for lateral lithiation. Subsequent treatment with an electrophilic primary alkyl halide and elimination of the diamine provides <b>functionalized</b> aryl aldehydes.|$|E
25|$|Alkenyl- and alkynylaluminates {{are most}} {{commonly}} generated through {{the addition of}} n-butyllithium to the alkenylalane. The alkenyl and alkynyl groups, which {{are better able to}} stabilize negative charge, are transferred in preference to the alkyl group. When these intermediates react with alkyl halides, <b>functionalized</b> olefins are produced.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonic acids, {{which are}} organic oxyacids, are {{a class of}} strong acids. A common example is p-toluene{{sulfonic}} acid (tosylic acid).

40|$|Various {{embodiments}} of {{the present}} disclosure pertain to methods of making magnetic carbon nanoribbons. Such methods generally include: (1) forming carbon nanoribbons by splitting carbon nanomaterials; and (2) associating graphene nanoribbons with magnetic materials, precursors of magnetic materials, or combinations thereof. Further embodiments {{of the present}} disclosure also include a step of reducing the precursors of magnetic materials to magnetic materials. In various embodiments, the associating occurs before, during or after the splitting of the carbon nanomaterials. In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure further comprise a step of (3) <b>functionalizing</b> the carbon nanoribbons with <b>functionalizing</b> agents. In more specific embodiments, the <b>functionalizing</b> occurs in situ during the splitting of carbon nanomaterials. In further embodiments, the carbon nanoribbons are edge-functionalized.

25|$|The most-general {{method of}} {{asymmetric}} pyridine hydrogenation {{is actually a}} heterogeneous method, where asymmetry is generated from a chiral oxazolidinone bound to the C2 position of the pyridine. Hydrogenating such <b>functionalized</b> pyridines {{over a number of}} different heterogeneous metal catalysts gave the corresponding piperidine with the substituents at C3, C4, and C5 positions in an all-cis geometry, in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity. The oxazolidinone auxiliary is also conveniently cleaved under the hydrogenation conditions.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} can be <b>functionalized</b> {{to attain}} desired properties {{that can be}} used in a wide variety of applications. The two main methods of carbon nanotube functionalization are covalent and non-covalent modifications. Because of their hydrophobic nature, carbon nanotubes tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts. The resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite. The surface of the carbon nanotubes can be modified to reduce the hydrophobicity and improve interfacial adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment.|$|E
25|$|Transition metal catalyzed hydrovinylation {{is another}} {{important}} alkene synthesis process starting from alkene itself. In general, it involves {{the addition of a}} hydrogen and a vinyl group (or an alkenyl group) across a double bond. The hydrovinylation reaction was first reported by Alderson, Jenner, and Lindsey by using rhodium and ruthenium salts, other metal catalysts commonly employed nowadays included iron, cobalt, nickel, and palladium. The addition can be done highly regio- and stereoselectively, the choices of metal centers, ligands, substrates and counterions often play very important role. Recent studies showed that the use of N-heterocyclic carbene with Ni can be useful for the selective preparations of <b>functionalized</b> geminal olefins or 1,1-disubstituted alkenes.|$|E

Nonlinear absorption and refraction of the hybrid films are measured, which are strongly enhanced and tunable by different AuNP concentrations compared to both GO and AuNP-only samples. The enhanced nonlinearity {{is due to}} the effective functionalization of the hybrid films, which is verified by the ultraviolet-visible and Fourier-transform infrared spectra. Our low-loss hybrid GO-AuNP films provide a solid-state material platform for diverse nonlinear applications. The <b>functionalizing</b> method can serve as a universal strategy to manipulate the physical properties of hybrid GO...|$|R

25|$|Antimicrobial {{activity}} can be imparted onto a surface through the grafting of <b>functionalized</b> polymers, for example those terminated with quaternary amine functional groups, {{through one of}} two principle methods. With these methods—“grafting to” and “grafting from”—polymers can be chemically bound to a solid surface and thus {{the properties of the}} surface (i.e. antimicrobial activity) can be controlled. Quaternary ammonium ion-containing polymers (PQA) have been proven to effectively kill cells and spores through their interactions will cell membranes. A wealth of nitrogenous monomers can be quaternized to be biologically active. These monomers, for example 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) or 4-vinyl pyridine (4-VP) can be subsequently polymerized with ATRP. Thus antimicrobial surfaces can be prepared via “grafting to” or “grafting from” mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} of suitable matrix compounds {{is determined to}} some extent by trial and error, but {{they are based on}} some specific molecular design considerations. They are of a fairly low molecular weight (to allow easy vaporization), but are large enough (with a low enough vapor pressure) not to evaporate during sample preparation or while standing in the mass spectrometer. They are often acidic, therefore act as a proton source to encourage ionization of the analyte. Basic matrices have also been reported. They have a strong optical absorption in either the UV or IR range, so that they rapidly and efficiently absorb the laser irradiation. This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several conjugated double bonds, as seen in the structure of cinnamic acid. They are <b>functionalized</b> with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.|$|E
25|$|Scaffolds {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials, such as collagen or fibrin, and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), {{is one of the}} possible choices as scaffold material. <b>Functionalized</b> groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E
40|$|New {{methods to}} {{synthesize}} and <b>functionalize</b> polymers are of constant {{interest to the}} polymer scientist. The 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition between an azide and terminal alkyne has received much attention since the reports that copper(i) provides high yields and regioselective synthesis of 1, 4 -substituted 1, 2, 3 -triazoles. This coupling chemistry has been rapidly adopted by polymer scientists in the synthesis and post-polymerization modification of polymers. This Review will provide the historical context of the recent development of the copper-mediated azide?alkyne cycloaddition and its use in polymer science, particularly in dendrimer synthesis/functionalization, surface immobilization/modification, orthogonally <b>functionalizing</b> polymers, and its integration with ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization) ...|$|R
40|$|Control over {{chemical}} functionalization is {{a crucial}} point {{in the field of}} nanotechnology. Herein, we present the covalent functionalization of several carbon nanoforms (single-walled carbon nanotubes, double-walled carbon nanotubes, multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanohorns) by means of diphenyl dichalcogenides. These ones show different reactivity to the nanomaterials and are able to modify their electronic properties depending on the electronegativity of the <b>functionalizing</b> heteroatom. Theoretical calculations were also performed to support the experimental results. All the modified structured nanocarbons were thoroughly characterized by TGA Raman, XPS, UV/Vis/nIR, IR and TEM techniques. Our findings propose a simple approach to <b>functionalize</b> carbon nanomaterials and, in the meantime, to tune their electronic properties...|$|R
50|$|Innate {{selectivity}} {{is observed}} for reactions that <b>functionalize</b> C-H bonds that lack an influence of directing forces, thus only {{relying on the}} natural reactivity of the molecule. Inductive (through-bond) effects can explain the innate selectivity of a C-H bond in a molecule through {{the examination of the}} electronic nature of the bonds. The presence and proximity of electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) or electron-donating groups (EDGs) can heavily influence the electron density of a C-H bond. The reactivity trend for nonmetal insertion is tertiary>secondary>primary. Steric effects can also influence the selectivity of C-H bond activation: bulky groups can decrease the rate of <b>functionalizing</b> an adjacent C-H bond.|$|R
