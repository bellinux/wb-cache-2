5|$|Passive constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction {{in such a}} way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with <b>get.</b> <b>For</b> example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E

25|$|Because the {{delegation}} {{did not bring}} the expected number of captives, the members {{were taken to the}} local jail. The talks were held at the Council House, a one-story stone building adjoining the jail on the corner of Main Plaza and Calabosa (Market) Street. During the council, the Comanche warriors sat on the floor, as was their custom, while the Texians sat on chairs on a platform facing them. Lockhart had informed the Texians that she had seen 15 other prisoners at the Comanches' principal camp several days before. She maintained that the Indians had wanted to see how high a price they could <b>get</b> <b>for</b> her, and that they then planned to bring in the remaining captives one at a time.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{director}} John Fenty {{became the}} controlling shareholder {{in the club}} after a search for outside investors failed, and a sale of shares to the local public was poorly received. He owned a 51% majority stake in the club and has made significant loans to the club to ensure its continued operation. Former Leicester City chairman John Elsom also joined {{the board of directors}} along with racehorse stable trainer and owner Michael Chapman in December 2002. However, with cash flow problems, corners had to be cut and the squad was paper thin, numbers were mainly made up by inexperienced youth team players, and loan signings of questionable purpose. Like many other teams who suffer a relegation in the previous season, Grimsby got off to a mediocre start and a lower mid-table finish was as good as it would <b>get</b> <b>for</b> Slade's men.|$|E

25|$|San Francisco had {{a chance}} to score early when {{defensive}} back Rashad Holman intercepted a pass from Johnson on the opening drive and returned it 13 yards to the Buccaneers 40-yard line. But on third down, Bucs defenders Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks shared a sack on Garcia that pushed the 49ers out of field goal range. Tampa Bay then drove 74 yards in 13 plays with a drive that included 17-yard receptions by Alstott and receiver Keyshawn Johnson, along with four third down conversions. Alstott finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. San Francisco responded as Garcia's 30-yard completion to Tai Streets set up a 24-yard field goal by Jeff Chandler, but the 7-3 score ended up being as close as the 49ers would ever <b>get</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the game.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{took the}} opening kickoff and stormed down the field. James gained 39 {{yards on the}} first five plays of the drive, and then Manning {{finished}} it with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Stokley. Denver responded on their ensuing drive, advancing the ball 49 yards in 12 plays and taking 8:13 off the clock. Jason Elam capped off the drive with a 49-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3, {{but it was as}} close as Denver would ever <b>get</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the game. After the kickoff, Harrison caught three passes for 70 yards, including a pass in which he made a diving catch around three Denver players. All of them thought Harrison was down by contact and started to leave the field, but no one had actually touched him, and Harrison got back up and ran 46 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Inflation {{during the}} early 1970s {{increased}} the cost estimates for a four-lane bridge to NOK120 million in 1974, and to NOK166 million including auxiliary roads. In 1976, the Public Roads Administration proposed that the bridge be built with two lanes and a pedestrian and bicycle path which later could be converted to a third lane. On 6 June 1977, the toll company sent an application to the county asking for how much county and state grants they could <b>get</b> <b>for</b> the bridge, and {{if it would be}} possible for the county to guarantee for the loan. The company stated that they felt they should receive the same conditions as the by then completed Sotra Bridge, where they state had paid for the auxiliary roads and a third of the bridge. The company offered to advance most of the state's grants, and receive them back in a period of twelve years. The plans at the time involved connecting the bridge to the existing county road at Kjøkkelvik and use it onwards to Loddefjord.|$|E

25|$|The {{price of}} corn {{has been declining}} steadily. Currently, {{the price of one}} bushel of corn is about one dollar less than the cost of growing it. In 2005, Iowa grain {{elevators}} were paying $1.45 per bushel ($57.10 per metric ton), while it was costing the farmer about $2.50/bu ($98/t) to grow it. This is a benefit for everyone except the corn farmer. While commodity prices are falling, the cost of production is rising. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, production costs increased $22 billion in 2007, and they are expected to keep rising this year. Unfortunately, commodity corn farmers have little control over the price they receive for their product. In order for corn farmers to generate any profit, they basically take whatever price they can <b>get</b> <b>for</b> their crop. A working farm needs a particular amount of income to maintain itself, and with falling corn prices the only choice for the corn farmer is to grow and sell more corn. This in turn leads to overproduction and even lower prices. Government policies used to protect corn prices from collapsing by establishing a target price based on the cost of production. Whenever the market price fell below that number, farmers were given the opportunity to take out a loan from the government using the crop as collateral, in turn allowing the farmer to store the grain until the market bounced back. In the mid-1970s this structure was removed and there was no longer an established floor price for a bushel of corn. Instead, subsidies were put in place that would reimburse the farmer for the difference between the market price and a target price. This encouraged corn farmers to grow as much as possible and to sell their crop at any price. Federal payments to corn farmers account for about half of their income, which translates to about 25% of the $19 billion taxpayers pay yearly on farmer’s payments. Contrary to what many people think, the current rise in food prices is doing little if anything to increase profit for the farmer. As retail prices for food increase, the share of the food dollar that returns to the farmer has fallen. Farmers are only seeing a very small fraction (between 2 and 25% depending on the product) of the retail price. The extra cost is instead going towards production, processing, transportation and marketing, which all cost significantly more today than in the past few years. Corn farmers continue to produce an undifferentiated commodity, and the profits are shifting to those who are benefited by overproduction and low crop prices: the companies who process, package and market the final products.|$|E

The SS is recognisable from its quad exhaust outlets {{in place of}} the SV6 dual outlets. The resulting specification level is much higher than the outgoing minimalist SV8 and only missing a few cosmetic touches of the previous flagship Commodore SS. Since its release, the SS has won two consecutive (2006 and 2007) Bang For Your Bucks awards, a Motor magazine initiative.

500|$|In 1959, Johnson was {{suspended}} indefinitely by the Lions after {{he missed the}} team plane back to Detroit following a November 1 blowout loss to the 49ers.

[...] Johnson was ultimately fined $1,000. Wilson took the brunt of the blame for Detroit's struggles in 1958 and 1959, but he questioned the resolve of some of the team's higher-paid players, including Johnson. Following the season, Johnson was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for two draft picks. [...] "That's all we could <b>get</b> <b>for</b> him," [...] explained Wilson.|$|E
