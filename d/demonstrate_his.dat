5|$|Many writers {{wrote about}} the deeds of Odaenathus; Nicostratus of Trebizond {{probably}} accompanied the king on his campaigns and wrote a history of that period starting from Philip the Arab and ending shortly before the king's death. According to Potter, Nicostratus' account was meant to glorify Odaenathus and <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> superiority over Roman emperors.|$|E

5|$|After Hunyadi {{defeated}} the Ottomans in Transylvania in March 1442, the Ottoman governor of Bulgaria accused Vlad of treachery, {{according to the}} contemporaneous Ottoman historian, Neşri. Murad summoned Vlad to Edirne to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> loyalty. Before departing, Vlad made his eldest son, Mircea, the ruler of Wallachia. Soon after he came to Edirne, he was captured at the sultan's command. He was held in captivity in Gallipoli.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{to develop}} inventions he could patent and market, Tesla {{conducted}} {{a range of}} experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, {{one of the first}} ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the ceiling}} {{decoration}} are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis of which The Creation of Adam is the best known, having an iconic standing equaled only by Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, the hands of God and Adam being reproduced in countless imitations. The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and which have provided an enormously influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{re-election}} of President George W. Bush and Bayh's re-election as a Senator from Indiana, Bayh {{considered the}} possibility of running for president in 2008. Although Bush carried Bayh's home state by 20 points, Bayh won 61% of the vote, solidifying the Senator's appeal to moderate and Republican voters. After serving four years as {{the chair of the}} Democratic Leadership Council, Bayh hoped to even further <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> position as a moderate by helping to found the Third Way Political Action Committee in January 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to pilgrims, merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe. Stephen's legends refer to 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary, but {{were attacked by}} Hungarian border guards. The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> determination to preserve internal peace. Regular minting of coinage began in Hungary in the 1020s. Stephen's silver dinars bearing the inscriptions STEPHANUS REX ("King Stephen") and REGIA CIVITAS ("royal city") were popular in contemporary Europe, as demonstrated by counterfeited copies unearthed in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E

5|$|Pyrrhus {{attempted}} to goad Antigonus into fighting a pitched battle {{on the plain}} in front of Argos but the Macedonian king was unmoved. The Argives sent ambassadors to both kings, beseeching them to respect the city's neutrality. Antigonus agreed to the Argives' terms and gave his son as a hostage in order to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> sincerity. While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos, he failed to give a pledge {{and as a result}} was regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|The art {{historian}} Hans J. Böker claims that Foliot began {{the construction of}} the Bishop's Chapel at Hereford Cathedral. Böker contends that the architectural style of the chapel (which was destroyed in 1737) resembled that of the German imperial chapels, and was deliberately chosen by Foliot to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> loyalty to King Henry. However most sources credit Robert of Hereford, bishop from 1079 to 1095, as the builder of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Ivan Alexander in 1371 Ivan Sratsimir broke off ties with Tarnovo and even placed the {{archbishop}} of Vidin {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Patriarchate of Constantinople to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> independence. Due to its geographical position, Vidin was initially safe from attacks by the Ottoman Turks who were ravaging the Balkans to the south and Ivan Sratsimir made no attempts to assist Ivan Shishman in his struggle against the Ottomans. Only after the fall of Tarnovo in 1393 did his policy become more active and he eventually joined the crusade of the Hungarian king Sigismund. However, after the disastrous battle of Nicopolis in 1396, the Ottomans marched to Vidin and seized it. Ivan Sratsimir was captured and imprisoned in Bursa where he was probably strangled. Although his son Constantine II claimed the title Emperor of Bulgaria and at times controlled some parts of his father's realm, Ivan Sratsimir is generally regarded by historians as the last ruler of medieval Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E
5|$|Basset {{witnessed}} a royal charter in 1135 but was dead by 1144, when his lands were {{granted by the}} Empress Matilda and her son Henry to Richard's son Geoffrey Ridel. His other sons were Ralph Basset, who held lands near Drayton, and William Basset, who held lands near Sapcote. William became a royal justice and sheriff like his father. Richard also had two daughters: Sibil, who married Robert de Cauz, and Matilda, who married John de Stuteville. Ralph inherited the ancestral lands in Normandy. The Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote that Basset built a tower on his ancestral lands of Montreuil in Normandy purely to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> status and wealth.|$|E
5|$|In June 1139 {{a knight}} was killed during {{a fight in}} Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men {{and a group of}} noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the {{circumstances}} of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.|$|E

5|$|In the 1190s, {{however, the}} {{struggle}} for power in France began to swing in favour of Philip II, culminating in the Capetian capture of Normandy in 1204. Philip II started to construct completely circular keeps, such as the Tour Jeanne d'Arc, with most built in his newly acquired territories. The first of Philip's new keeps was begun at the Louvre in 1190 and at least another twenty followed, all built to a consistent standard and cost. The architectural idea of circular keeps {{may have come from}} Catalonia, where circular towers in castles formed a local tradition, and probably carried some military advantages, but Philip's intention in building these new keeps in a fresh style was clearly political, an attempt to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> new power and authority over his extended territories. As historian Philippe Durand suggests, these keeps provided military security and were a physical representation of the renouveau capétien, or Capetian renewal.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{left his}} boarding-house hastily {{on the morning}} of 27 September and stayed {{overnight}} at the Roxburgh Hotel in Edinburgh. He left some of his luggage there, telling the manageress that he would be away for about eight days, and travelled the next day to Liverpool, where he took a room at the London and North Western Hotel on Lime Street. He bought a ticket to Ireland and took the SS Munster to Dublin via Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire). It stopped at Holyhead in Anglesey, where an immigration official challenged Lody. His American travel documents proved sufficient to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> bona fides, and he proceeded on his way.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>his</b> point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
