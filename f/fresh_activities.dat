40|$|As a new {{semester}} begins, most faculty share {{a common}} goal. We’d like to start the semester off right with classrooms full of students who {{really want to be}} there. It helps if they are engaged and complete the semester. A common frustration for many of us is having a full class that first day—and possibly turning away students interested in adding your class—only to have empty seats later in the term. So how do we keep the students who attend class on day one engaged throughout the semester? One key component is to have a successful beginning in {{each and every one of}} your classes. We’ve all heard stories and maybe even have personal experience with bad beginnings. This past spring, I was at a professional development workshop on my campus about learning communities. The facilitator spent time discussing classroom activities for the first day of class, activities designed to increase the sense of community and to engage your students from day one.

40|$|The {{liquid phase}} {{hydrogenation}} of citral {{has been investigated}} over Pd (2. 42 %) supported on clinoptilolite rich natural zeolite catalyst for different reaction conditions. The zeolite support {{did not affect the}} active metal properties. This was attributed to the large size of Pd particles on the support. High selectivity (90 %) to citronellal was obtained at complete conversion of citral. The catalytic activity increased with reaction temperature (80, 100, 120 °C) following an Arrhenius behaviour, while selectivity remained constant for a given conversion. Selectivity to citronellal increased from 78 to 90 % with increase in the amount of catalyst in the reaction solution (Citral/Pd mole ratio 293, 176 and 105).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hydrogen can be {{produced}} for fuel cell applicationsby using methanol steam reforming reaction. In this article, a method was developed for regeneration of accelerated deactivated methanol-steam-reforming catalyst. Successive deactivation–regeneration cycles were studied in a 250 hours test {{for the first time}} including 6 regeneration cycles. It is shown that regeneration of the catalyst in diluted O 2 results in dramatic enhancements of the methanol conversion and this catalyst could be regenerated to near <b>fresh</b> <b>activity.</b> Cokes that can deactivate the catalyst will be burned out in presence of oxygen at the regeneration step. XRD, TGA/DTG, TPR, N 2 O Chemisorption, TPOand SEM techniques were used for a complete catalyst characterization. Effects of temperature, water to methanol ratio, concentration of diluted oxygen, CuO/ZnO ratio and adding oxygen along with or without the main feed were also studied by a set of six experiments with duration of 100 h for each to provide a complete know-how on the developed method of regeneration...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} find out, if additional source of carbon-sucrose affected activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC, EC 4. 1. 1. 31), NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME, EC 1. 1. 1. 40), and pyruvate, phosphate dikinase (PPDK, EC 2. 7. 9. 1). Activities of these enzymes were determined in different parts of tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L., cv.

'To be united with a person,' he had said, 'that shares our sorrows and our joys, that responds to our feelings, that moulds herself so pliantly, so closely to our humours; reposing on her calm and warm affection, to relax our spirit from a thousand distractions, a thousand wild wishes and tumultuous passions; to dream away all the bitterness of fortune, in the bosom of domestic enjoyment; this the true delight of life.'

His literary projects were proceeding as before; and, besides the enjoyment of virtuous love, he had that of intercourse with many worthy and some kindred minds.|$|R

40|$|The sulfur {{poisoning}} of a Pt/BaK-LTL catalyst {{has been}} studied with X-ray absorption spectroscopy and hydrogen chemisorption. The fresh catalyst contained highly dispersed platinum inside the zeolite pores. EXAFS analysis determined a Pt-Pt coordination number of 3. 7, suggesting an average platinum cluster size of 5 or 6 atoms, consistent with the TEM and chemisorption data (H/Pt = 1. 4). The catalyst was poisoned with H 2 S until the dehydrocyclization activity of n-hexane decreased to 30 % of <b>fresh</b> <b>activity.</b> The first-shell Pt [...] -Pt coordination number increased to 5. 5, indicating a growth of the average platinum cluster size to 13 atoms. Hydrogen chemisorption measurements of the poisoned catalyst show {{a decrease in the}} H/Pt value to 1. 0. The EXAFS data also provide evidence for the presence of sulfur adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} platinum particles with a Pt [...] -S bond distance of 2. 27 Å. The high sensitivity of the Pt/LTL catalyst to poisoning by very low levels of sulfur is attributed to the loss of active platinum surface by adsorption of sulfur and the growth of the platinum clusters. Much of the available platinum surface was found to be capable of chemisorbing hydrogen, but with no activity for dehydrocyclization. Growth of the platinum particle was sufficient to block the pore. In the sulfur-poisoned catalyst, only the sulfur-free platinum atoms exposed through the pore windows remain active. The evidence suggests the location of the sulfur was at or near the metal-zeolite interface. Since both high activity and selectivity require extremely small platinum particles, regeneration of sulfur-poisoned catalysts will require removal of the adsorpted sulfur and restoration of the original particle size...|$|R

In these he passed rapidly over the year which he must spend before it was possible for him to be qualified and dwelt on the journey to Spain on which his heart was set. He read books about that country, which he borrowed from the free library, and already he knew from photographs exactly what each city looked like. He saw himself lingering in Cordova on the bridge that spanned the Gaudalquivir; he wandered through tortuous streets in Toledo and sat in churches where he wrung from El Greco the secret which he felt the mysterious painter held for him. Athelny entered into his humour, and on Sunday afternoons they made out elaborate itineraries so that Philip should miss nothing that was noteworthy. To cheat his impatience Philip began to teach himself Spanish, and in the deserted sitting-room in Harrington Street he spent an hour every evening doing Spanish exercises and puzzling out with an English translation by his side the magnificent phrases of Don Quixote. Athelny gave him a lesson once a week, and Philip learned a few sentences to help him on his journey. Mrs. Athelny laughed at them.|$|R
