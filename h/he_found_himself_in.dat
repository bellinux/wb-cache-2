Harlan was usually joined by the other moderate members of the Court: Justices Potter Stewart, Tom Clark, and Byron White.|$|E
5|$|William Barley (1565?–1614) was an English {{bookseller}} and publisher. He {{completed an}} apprenticeship as a draper in 1587, but was soon {{working in the}} London book trade. As a freeman of the Drapers' Company, he was embroiled in a dispute {{between it and the}} Stationers' Company over the rights of drapers to function as publishers and booksellers. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> legal tangles throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Raynolds {{spent two}} months {{recovering}} from illness after the Valley Campaign, then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and VIII Corps in January 1863.

Lee's second Confederate invasion of the north during the Gettysburg Campaign. On March 31, 1863, the Corps of Topographical Engineers ceased to be an independent branch {{of the army and}} was merged into the Corps of Engineers and Raynolds served in that branch of the army for the remainder of his career. Officers from the two corps maintained their ranks based on the time at which they received their promotion.|$|E

5|$|Shankly's initial role at Huddersfield was as reserve team coach. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> {{charge of}} several {{promising}} youngsters who soon graduated {{to the first}} team after Town were relegated to the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1955–56 season. Beattie resigned in the next season and, on 5 November 1956, Shankly succeeded him as manager. On Christmas Eve, he gave a first team debut to 16-year-old prospect Denis Law. Another prospect in his team was left back Ray Wilson who went on to become Huddersfield's most capped player before joining Everton. Shankly did not gain promotion at Huddersfield, the team finishing 12th in 1956–57, ninth in 1957–58 and 14th in 1958–59.|$|E
5|$|Though the League for Social Reconstruction {{began as}} more of a {{discussion}} group than a political party, it became a force in Canadian politics by the mid-1930s. After Havelock joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, along with several other members of the League, he was pressured by his superiors at the University to curtail his political activity. He did not, continuing to act as an ally and occasional spokesman for Underhill and other leftist professors. <b>He</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> trouble again in 1937 after criticising both the government's and industry's handling of an automotive workers' strike. Despite calls from Ontario officials for his ouster, he was able to remain at Victoria College, but his public reputation was badly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the minor}} league team that last held Jim Thorpe's {{contract}} had disbanded in 1910, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the rare {{position of being}} a sought-after free agent at the major league level during {{the era of the}} reserve clause, and thus had a choice of baseball teams for which to play. In January1913, he turned down a starting position with the American League cellar-dwelling St. Louis Browns, choosing instead to join the 1912National League champion New York Giants, who, with Thorpe playing in 19 of their 151games, would repeat as the 1913National League champions. Immediately following the Giants' October loss in the 1913 World Series, Thorpe and the Giants joined the Chicago White Sox for a world tour. Barnstorming across the United States and then around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour. Thorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance and gate receipts for the tour. He met with Pope Pius X and Abbas II Hilmi Bey (the last Khedive of Egypt), and played before 20,000 people in London including King George V.|$|E

5|$|In Mumbai and Aurangabad, police {{rounded up}} more than 400MNS workers. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, MNS workers went on a rampage {{following}} the arrest of Raj, smashing windows and windscreens of eleven state buses. Thirteen rioters were arrested. They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets. He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious. When he gained consciousness the following day, <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> a hospital with both hands amputated. The injured, mainly hawkers, were treated at the Nashik Civil Hospital after they were beaten. Shops along Nashik Road closed down after the incident. Incidents of stone pelting on state-run buses were reported from the Nashik Road, Ambad, Ravivar Peth, and Gangapur areas. Bus services were severely curtailed and diverted via Nipani. In Amrawati, MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses, damaging several vehicles in the process. Though contingents of the Rapid Action Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed {{in many parts of}} the state, the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted hit-and-run methods of attack. More than 200activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik. Many activists went underground and coordinated with party activists from undisclosed locations.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 24 September 1554, Knox {{received}} {{an invitation from}} a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt {{to become one of}} their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used {{a modified version of the}} Book of Common Prayer. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the Book of Common Prayer. Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|Still {{enduring}} is {{the debate}} {{as to why}} Voss chose to fight on against clearly almost impossible odds rather than disengage from the action. However, {{it is possible that}} he wanted to close the kill gap between himself and the Red Baron, by shooting down some British aircraft, so he stayed on. Although Voss's apparent refusal to retreat is not mentioned in the contemporary English combat reports, nor in McCudden's autobiography written in June and July 1918, McCudden is credited with the observation that Voss seemingly rejected several opportunities to disengage and withdraw from the tactically grave situation in which <b>he</b> <b>found</b> <b>himself.</b> <b>In</b> 1942 Hector Bolitho and James Ira Thomas Jones received letters from both Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman concerning their recall of Voss's last stand. Bowman read and savaged the Chidlaw-Roberts account for its inaccuracies, although his own account had obvious errors. At the same time Bowman also stated that he believed Voss had an opportunity to disengage and save himself, but had deliberately chosen instead to fight in spite of the overwhelmingly unequal situation with which he was faced. This is the earliest positively identified historical source for the assertion that Voss rejected chances for a safe retreat that were open to him. The dogfight remains a subject of debate and controversy among combat aviation historians and interested parties.|$|E

25|$|The period 1918 to 1937 is also sketchy, however Sean Innes, {{the former}} warden, whose family {{occupied}} the now demolished Gate Lodge during this period, remembered that an American gentleman lived in Larch Hill {{with his mother}} during this period.

Unaware of the size of Napoleon's army, Sacken tried to smash his way east to join Blücher. The Russians managed to hold their ground for several hours, but were forced back as more and more French soldiers appeared on the battlefield. Yorck's troops belatedly arrived only to be repulsed, but the Prussians distracted the French long enough to allow Sacken's Russians to join them in a withdrawal to the north.
