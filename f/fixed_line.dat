25|$|Attempts {{to create}} {{alternative}} versions {{to the official}} London Underground map have continued. In June 2011, British Designer Mark Noad unveiled his vision for a more 'geographically accurate' London Underground map. The map {{is an attempt to}} see if it is possible to create a geographically-accurate representation of the underground system while still retaining some of the clarity of Beck's original diagram. It uses similar principles, <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> angles– in this case 30 and 60 degrees instead of 45– and shortens the extremities of the lines to make it more compact. In 2013, Dr Max Roberts, a psychology lecturer at the University of Essex with a particular interest in usability, information design and schematic mapping, issued his own version of the Tube map. His design, based on a series of concentric circles, emphasised the concept of the newly completed orbital loop surrounding Central London with radial lines.

40|$|Brassica rapa is an {{economically}} important crop {{with a wide}} range of morphologies. Developing a set of <b>fixed</b> <b>lines</b> and understanding their diversity has been challenging, but facilitates resource conservation. We investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of 238 <b>fixed</b> <b>lines</b> of leafy B. rapa with 45 new simple sequence repeat markers and 109 new NGS (next-generation sequencing) -generated single nucleotide polymorphism markers evenly distributed throughout the B. rapa genome. Phylogenetic analysis classified the vegetable <b>fixed</b> <b>lines</b> into four subgroups, with the three oil types forming a separate and relatively distant cluster. A model-based population structure analysis identified four subpopulations corresponding to geographical origins and morphological traits, and revealed extensive allelic admixture. In particular, the Chinese cabbage cluster was subdivided into three groups and showed considerable correlation with leaf- and heading-related traits (leaf and heading shape). The vegetable B. rapa <b>fixed</b> <b>lines</b> successfully developed in our study could be valuable materials for establishing a multinational Brassica rapa diversity resource. Understanding the genetic diversity and population structure could be useful for utilization of the representative genetic variation and further genomic analysis...|$|R
