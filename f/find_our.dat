25|$|In 2012, Merkerson {{became the}} host of the show <b>Find</b> <b>Our</b> Missing which {{highlights}} the search for missing people of color. It is designed to put names and faces to people of color who have disappeared without a trace. Each episode {{tells the story of the}} missing person or persons, beginning with the day they vanished and the frantic searches by loved ones and investigators to find them. <b>Find</b> <b>Our</b> Missing provides insight into these victims’ lives–their hopes and dreams, what makes them tick, and how they have touched those around them—from the people who know them best. The episodes chronicle the investigations into their disappearances, and why the search for them so far has only turned up dead ends.|$|E

25|$|Allied {{intelligence}} did {{not fall}} for German deceptions that they might attack in Italy or the Balkans. At an Army Commanders Conference (Saturday 2 March), Cox reported that a German offensive was imminent, perhaps designed to “cut off the Cambrai salient” (Third Army sector) and draw in British reserves, although it was still expected to be prior to a bigger offensive in Flanders or Champagne. Haig privately thought the Guards Division “our only reliable reserve”. He has been criticised for writing (2 March) that he “was only afraid that the Enemy would <b>find</b> <b>our</b> front so very strong that he will hesitate to commit his Army to the attack with the almost certainty of losing very heavily”. The claim {{does not appear in}} the official minutes, which merely warn of a “prolonged” German offensive. In Sheffield's view he was in fact referring to the First, Third and Fourth (actually the former Second Army at Ypres, temporarily renumbered as it was under Rawlinson's command whilst Plumer was away commanding in Italy) Army fronts which he had spent a week inspecting, and which were well-defended – Smuts and Hankey had come to the same conclusion in January. Haig thought the Canadians “really fine disciplined soldiers now and so smart and clean” compared to the Australians.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will <b>find</b> <b>our</b> right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World {{reviewed}} it positively, {{stating that}} the film was [...] "pleasingly melodramatic in which we <b>find</b> <b>our</b> old friends, hero, heroine and villain, who always entertain us when they really {{live up to their}} characters. ...

500|$|Nora Ephron {{wrote the}} {{introduction}} to Beckerman's eponymous 1995 book, which she immediately thought had dramatic possibilities. [...] She identified with the stories in Love, Loss, and What I Wore because the book [...] "is not about fashion; it is about what clothes really are to us, those moments when we are constantly trying to <b>find</b> <b>our</b> identity through them". [...] Soon after its publication, Ephron gave the book to eight of her friends for Christmas. She became interested in writing her {{own version of the}} book.

500|$|IPC {{president}} Philip Craven was {{vocal about}} NBC's reluctance to air coverage in 2012, expressing his disappointment for American athletes and viewers who would miss the [...] "amazing images" [...] the games would bring, and remarking that [...] "some {{people think that}} North America always lead on everything, and on this they don't. It's about time they caught up." [...] Following the closing ceremonies, Craven hinted that the IPC might put greater scrutiny on broadcasters at future editions of the Paralympics (or may strip NBC of its broadcast rights), by stating that [...] "if we <b>find</b> <b>our</b> values don’t fit, we’ll have to go somewhere else."

500|$|In criticism, Johnson had {{a lasting}} influence, {{although}} not everyone viewed him favourably. Some, like Macaulay, regarded Johnson as an idiot savant who produced some respectable works, and others, like the Romantic poets, were completely opposed to Johnson's views on poetry and literature, {{especially with regard}} to Milton. However, some of their contemporaries disagreed: Stendhal's Racine et Shakespeare is based in part on Johnson's views of Shakespeare, and Johnson influenced Jane Austen's writing style and philosophy. Later, Johnson's works came into favour, and Matthew Arnold, in his Six Chief Lives from Johnson's [...] "Lives of the Poets", considered the Lives of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Addison, Swift, and Gray as [...] "points which stand as so many natural centres, and by returning to which we can always <b>find</b> <b>our</b> way again".|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{despite the}} novel's {{thematic}} focus on racial injustice, its black characters {{are not fully}} examined. In its use of racial epithets, stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks, and Calpurnia, who to some critics is {{an updated version of}} the [...] "contented slave" [...] motif and to others simply unexplored, the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters. One writer asserts that the use of Scout's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout's voice [...] "functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us—black and white, male and female—to <b>find</b> <b>our</b> relative position in society". A teaching guide for the novel published by The English Journal cautions, [...] "what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another". A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students, but that black students found it [...] "demoralizing". Another criticism, articulated by Michael Lind, is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural [...] "white trash".|$|E
500|$|NBC's lack of {{coverage}} drew {{the ire of}} American disability rights groups and IPC president Philip Craven, who expressed his disappointment for American athletes and viewers who were unable to fully experience the games on television. Craven remarked that [...] "some people think that North America always [...] on everything, and on this they don't. It's about time they caught up." [...] Following the closing ceremonies, Craven hinted that the IPC might exercise greater scrutiny on broadcasters at future Paralympics by stating that [...] "if we <b>find</b> <b>our</b> values don't fit, we'll have to go somewhere else." [...] NBC acquired {{the rights to the}} 2014 and 2016 Paralympic Games in September 2013; the broadcaster vowed to air a relatively larger amount of Paralympic coverage from Sochi and Rio de Janeiro respectively—in particular, NBC and NBCSN were to air at least 66 hours from Rio. Craven praised NBC's decision to devote a relatively larger amount of airtime to future Paralympics, sharing his hope that U.S. audiences would be [...] "as captivated and emotionally enthralled as the billions around the world who tuned in to London 2012 last summer." ...|$|E
