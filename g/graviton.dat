5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the <b>graviton,</b> a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

25|$|In the {{framework}} of quantum field theory, the <b>graviton</b> is the name given to a hypothetical elementary particle speculated to be the force carrier that mediates gravity. However the <b>graviton</b> is not yet proven to exist, and no scientific model yet exists that successfully reconciles general relativity which describes gravity, and the Standard Model which describes all other fundamental forces. Attempts, such as quantum gravity, have been made, but are not yet accepted.|$|E
5000|$|A {{feature of}} <b>gravitons</b> in string theory is that, as closed strings without endpoints, {{they would not}} be bound to branes and could move freely between them. If we live on a brane (as {{hypothesized}} by brane theories) this [...] "leakage" [...] of <b>gravitons</b> from the brane into higher-dimensional space could explain why gravitation is such a weak force, and <b>gravitons</b> from other branes adjacent to our own could provide a potential explanation for dark matter. However, if <b>gravitons</b> were to move completely freely between branes this would dilute gravity too much, causing a violation of Newton's inverse square law. To combat this, Lisa Randall found that a three-brane (such as ours) would have a gravitational pull of its own, preventing <b>gravitons</b> from drifting freely, possibly resulting in the diluted gravity we observe while roughly maintaining Newton's inverse square law. See brane cosmology.|$|R
40|$|Gauge {{theory of}} gravity is {{formulated}} based on principle of local gauge invariance. Because the model has strict local gravitational gauge symmetry, gauge theory of gravity is a perturbatively renormalizable quantum model. However, {{in the original}} model, all gauge <b>gravitons</b> are massless. We want to ask that whether there exists massive <b>gravitons</b> in Nature? In this paper, we will propose a gauge model with massive <b>gravitons.</b> The mass term of gravitational gauge field is introduced into the theory without violating the strict local gravitational gauge symmetry.

By a complicated series of events, at the end of the trip to Counter-Earth, Zemo's consciousness ended up in Fixer's tech-pac. By threatening to disable it and leave him quadriplegic, Zemo managed to force Fixer to transfer the Baron's consciousness to his Counter-Earth counterpart's body.|$|E

25|$|Elementary bosons {{responsible}} for the four fundamental forces of nature are called force particles (gauge bosons). Strong interaction is mediated by the gluon, weak interaction is mediated by the W and Z bosons, and it is sometimes hypothetized that gravitation is mediated by the <b>graviton,</b> {{although it is not}} predicted by the Standard Model but by other theories in the framework of quantum field theory.|$|E
50|$|Particles with a spin of 0, 1, or 2 move {{force from}} one {{particle}} to another. Some {{examples of these}} particles are virtual <b>gravitons</b> and virtual photons. Virtual <b>gravitons</b> have a spin of 2 and they represent the force of gravity. This means that when gravity affects two things, <b>gravitons</b> move {{to and from the}} two things. Virtual photons have a spin of 1 and represent electromagnetic forces (or the force that holds atoms together).|$|R
50|$|Theories which {{postulate}} that {{gravity is}} quantized introduce <b>gravitons</b> â€” massless tensor bosons (with a spin 2) which mediate gravitational interaction. There is no direct experimental evidence supporting their existence. However indirect evidence of <b>gravitons</b> can be asserted by gravitational waves.|$|R

25|$|The model {{does not}} explain gravitation, {{although}} physical confirmation of a theoretical particle known as a <b>graviton</b> would account for it to a degree. Though it addresses strong and electroweak interactions, the Standard Model does not consistently explain the canonical theory of gravitation, general relativity, in terms of quantum field theory. The reason for this is, among other things, that quantum field theories of gravity generally break down before reaching the Planck scale. As a consequence, we have no reliable theory for the very early universe.|$|E
25|$|Hawkeye remains {{with the}} Avengers for {{numerous}} adventures. He aids Avenger trainees Justice and Firestar {{to defeat the}} Taskmaster and Albino. Hawkeye later resigns the Avengers to assume leadership {{of the first generation}} of the Thunderbolts, who had broken away from the influence of Baron Helmut Zemo. Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former teammate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. The Thunderbolts take on threats like the Masters of Evil, <b>Graviton,</b> and the Scourge of the Underworld. Hawkeye begins a romantic relationship with fellow Thunderbolts member Moonstone, who Hawkeye is proving to be a good influence on. Later, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts travel to Hell to save the soul of Mockingbird. They defeat the demonic Mephisto, but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife. To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place. The Thunderbolts' past crimes are erased on the condition that they retire from costumed heroics. The team reluctantly agrees. Later, when Hawkeye had gotten out of prison, the team comes back together to defeat <b>Graviton</b> once again. Convinced that they are ready to be heroes in their own right, Hawkeye hands leadership of the Thunderbolts to Citizen V (whose mind was actually under the control of Baron Helmut Zemo) and leaves the team.|$|E

40|$|Camanho, Edelstein, Maldacena and Zhiboedov {{have shown}} that <b>gravitons</b> can {{experience}} a negative Shapiro time delay, i. e. a time advance, in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. They studied <b>gravitons</b> propagating in singular "shock-wave" geometries. We study this effect for <b>gravitons</b> propagating in smooth black hole spacetimes. For a small enough black hole, we find that <b>gravitons</b> of appropriate polarisation, and small impact parameter, can experience time advance. Such <b>gravitons</b> can also exhibit a deflection angle less than Ï€, characteristic of a repulsive short-distance gravitational interaction. We discuss problems with {{the suggestion that the}} time advance can be used to build a "time machine". In particular, we argue that a small black hole cannot be boosted to a speed arbitrarily close to the speed of light, as would be required in such a construction. Comment: v 2 : Typos corrected.

25|$|If such a {{particle}} exists, {{it is expected}} to be massless (because the gravitational force appears to have unlimited range) and must be a spin-2 boson. It can be shown that any massless spin-2 field would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, because a massless spin-2 field must couple to (interact with) the stressâ€“energy tensor {{in the same way that}} the gravitational field does; therefore if a massless spin-2 particle were ever discovered, it would be likely to be the <b>graviton</b> without further distinction from other massless spin-2 particles. Such a discovery would unite quantum theory with gravity.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Tamiaki Yoneya {{discovered}} {{that all the}} known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a <b>graviton.</b> John Schwarz and Joel Scherk came {{to the same conclusion}} and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced Kaluzaâ€“Klein theory as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions. At the same time, quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the dustbin of history.|$|E
25|$|Presently, no semiclassical limit {{recovering}} {{general relativity}} {{has been shown}} to exist. This means it remains unproven that LQG's description of spacetime at the Planck scale has the right continuum limit (described by general relativity with possible quantum corrections). Specifically, the dynamics of the theory is encoded in the Hamiltonian constraint, but there is no candidate Hamiltonian. Other technical problems include finding off-shell closure of the constraint algebra and physical inner product vector space, coupling to matter fields of Quantum field theory, fate of the renormalization of the <b>graviton</b> in perturbation theory that lead to ultraviolet divergence beyond 2-loops (see One-loop Feynman diagram in Feynman diagram).|$|E

Our results, valid in the low-energy regime, show a vector radiation dominance for every value of n. The calculated low-energy emission rate, {{for all types of}} degrees of freedom, is found to decrease with the number of extra dimensions n, as in the previously studied case of a bulk scalar field.
