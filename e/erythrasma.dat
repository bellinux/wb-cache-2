40|$|Background: Corynebacterial {{infection}} {{is a common}} condition in soldiers. Pitted keratolysis (PK), a bacterial infection confined to the plantar stratum corneum, does not severely impede patient activity but can be unpleasant and embarrassing because of its ‘‘rotten’’ odor. The incidence of PK in soldiers {{has been reported to}} be between 1, 5 % and 77. 1 %. <b>Erythrasma</b> is a superficial infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum and affects the major skin folds and the interdigital regions of the feet. It is characterized by erythematous, brown, scaly patches and maceration, and exhibits coral-red fluorescence under Wood light. Trichomycosis axillaris (TMA) is caused by the Corynebacterium tenuis. Patients affected by trichomycosis axillaris present with complaints of a disagreeable underarm odor and a history of hyperhidrosis and poor hygiene. Examination reveals the underarm hair to be coated with black, yellow-white or reddish deposits. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the frequency corynebacterium triad in soldiers (pitted keratolysis, <b>erythrasma,</b> trichomycosis axillaris) Methods: The study involved 1694 men, soldiers in age about 23 years, (in period 5 months (- 8 - 12. 2008)). 103 persons, whose dermatologic symptoms/changes were analysed, were qualified for the research. Reconnaissance put on base of characteristic clinical sign and under Wood light. Results: Incidence of PK observed at 103 patients (which make up 6, 08 % of 1694 soldiers). EA diagnosed at 15 soldiers (14, 56 % of 103 patients), and TMA was diagnosed of 3 patients (2, 91 % of 103 patients). The coexistence are summarized as follows: <b>erythrasma</b> and PK; 15 of 103 patients (14, 56 %), TMA and PK in 3 of 103 patients (2, 91 %). The coexistence of rythrasma, TMA, and PK was noted in 1 patients (0, 97 %). Conclusions: Corynebacterial {{infection is}} a common condition in soldiers. In most cases/most often development of PK is observed. Our results demonstrate that either <b>erythrasma</b> or TMA can be associated with PK. We suggest that a closer, wider inspection is required to rule out the coexistence of the other. corynebacterial infections (<b>Erythrasma,</b> TMN) when a dermatologist encounters PK...|$|E
40|$|Background: Skin infections {{caused by}} coryneform {{bacteria}} are common dermatological conditions. However, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, no studies are available on the clinical characteristics and epidemiological features of this group of disorders as one entity from India and abroad. Aims: To study the clinical and epidemiological features of coryneform skin infections Methods: A total of 75 patients presenting with clinically distinctive lesions of pitted keratolysis, <b>erythrasma</b> and trichobacteriosis to our hospital were included in the study. Cases were interviewed with particular emphasis on epidemiological features and the various clinical findings were recorded. Investigations like Gram's stain, Wood's light examination, 10 % KOH scrapings, were done in selected cases to ascertain the diagnosis. Results: Pitted keratolysis was more common in the age group of 31 - 40 years (40 %) with a male preponderance (76. 7 %), most commonly affecting pressure bearing areas of the soles with malodour (86. 7 %) and frequent contact with water (58. 3 %) constituting the most important presenting symptom and provocating factor respectively. <b>Erythrasma</b> affected both male and female patients equally and was more commonly detected in patients with a BMI > 23 kg/m 2 (62. 5 %) and in diabetics (50 %). All patients with trichobacteriosis presented with yellow coloured concretions in the axillae. Bromhidrosis (71. 4 %) and failure to regularly use an axillary deodorant (71. 4 %) were the most common presenting symptom and predisposing factor respectively. Conclusion: Coryneform skin infections are common dermatological conditions, though epidemiological data are fragmentary. Hyperhidrosis is a common predisposing factor to all three coryneform skin infections. Asymmetrical distribution of pits has been reported in our study. Diabetic status needs to be evaluated in all patients with <b>erythrasma.</b> Woods lamp examination forms an indispensible tool to diagnose <b>erythrasma</b> and trichobacteriosis...|$|E

40|$|Interdigital foot {{infections are}} mostly caused {{initially}} by dermatophytes, yeasts and less frequently by bacteria. <b>Erythrasma</b> caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum can {{be confused with}} superficial mycoses. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the prevalence of the etiologic agents of superficial mycoses and the frequency of Corynebacterium minutissimum in interdigital foot infections. All the samples obtained from the 121 patients with interdigital foot infections were examined directly with the use of 20 % potassium hydroxide mounts and Gram stain under the microscope and cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar plates. In identification of superficial mycoses, the rate was found to be 14 % with the cultural method and 14 % with direct microscopic examination. Using a combination of direct microscopic examination and culture, a 33. 8 % ratio was achieved. In the culture of these samples, the most isolated factor was Trichophyton rubrum (33. 7 %). In 24 of the patients (19. 8 %) Corynebacterium minutissimum was detected by Gram staining, in 6 of these patients Trichophyton rubrum was found, Trichophyton mentagrophytes was found in 2 and Trichosporon spp. was found in 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium spp. are diphtheroid {{bacteria}} {{responsible for}} pitted keratolysis, a common plantar infection {{confined to the}} thick stratum corneum. AIM: To study a series of demographic features of patients suffering from pitted keratolysis, and to present {{a review of the}} Corynebacterium-associated infections, including pitted keratolysis, <b>erythrasma,</b> and trichobacteriosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 2 -year, two-center, prospective survey assessed the demographics of pitted keratolysis, including age, gender, site of infection, symptoms, patients' complaints, the use of protective and/or occlusive shoes, seasonality of diagnosis, drug intake, associated skin signs (including dyshidrosis, <b>erythrasma,</b> and trichobacteriosis), recurrences, and previous diagnoses and treatments. RESULTS: The mean age of the 53 patients with pitted keratolysis was 24. 9 years (range, 10 - 57 years). The male to female ratio was 7. 8 : 1. The soles of both feet were commonly involved (92. 4 %). Pressure-bearing areas were the usual sites of infection, ranging from restricted involvement of the toes (12 / 53, 22. 6 %) to spreading to the entire plantar surface (15 / 53, 28. 3 %). A total of 36 (68 %) of the 53 patients complained of hyperhidrosis. An unpleasant smell and pain were noted by 35 (66 %) and 25 (47 %) of the 53 patients, respectively. Occlusive and protective shoes were worn in 51 (96. 2 %) and 31 (58. 4 %) of the 53 cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pitted keratolysis commonly affects young male patients wearing protective shoes for professional reasons, inducing a moist and warm environment. Hyperhidrosis, an unpleasant smell, and pain are the main clinical complaints. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Under {{specific}} light illumination, particularly ultraviolet (UV) and near-UV light stimulation, {{the skin}} produces both specular light reflectance and, possibly, specific fluorescent emission. These properties offer diagnostic clues and disclose some peculiar {{functions of the}} skin. A series of superficial infections (<b>erythrasma,</b> some tinea capitis types, tinea/pityriasis versicolor, dermatophytoses, etc.) and pilosebaceous follicles enriched in Propionibacterium spp show fluorescence. This latter characteristic is downgraded or lost while on some anti-acne treatments. A quenching effect of fluorescence is observed following the application of sunscreens. The (pre) neoplastic areas prepared for methylaminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) show reddish fluorescence following drug metabolisation producing porphyrins by the abnormal activated cells. Of note, when using a recording sensitive CCD camera instead of casual visual observation, skin fluorescence may be superimposed on the specular reflectance of the incident light. With the current technology, these situations are not distinguished with confidence. Any harsh and scaly lesion appears brighter following yellowish specular light reflectance. Stratum corneum samplings collected on clear self-adhesive discs or cyanoacrylate skin surface strippings are conveniently examined ex vivo, {{taking advantage of the}} same optical properties.

40|$|The {{geriatric}} {{population is}} continuously growing, {{which leads to}} more aged patients being admitted to dermatology clinics. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the dermatological complaints of the elderly attending a dermatology outpatient clinic. All of the patients aged 65 years and older admitted to our dermatology outpatient clinic over a 1 -year period were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their ages as group I (65 - 74 years) and group II (≥ 75 years). The patients were asked about their dermatologic complaints. A total of 240 geriatric patients attended to the dermatology outpatient clinic over a 1 -year period. Overall, the five most frequent dermatologic complaints of the patients were eczematous dermatitis (21. 7 %), pruritus (19. 6 %), fungal infections (16. 7 %), precancerous and malignant lesions (9. 6 %), and bacterial infections (7. 1 %). The most frequent types of eczematous dermatitis were asteatotic eczema (26. 9 %), neurodermatitis (26. 9 %), and stasis dermatitis (17. 3 %). Among fungal infections, the most frequent was tinea pedis (62. 5 %), followed by onychomycosis (32. 5 %) and tinea versicolor (5. 0 %). The most common precancerous lesion was actinic keratosis (78. 3 %). Bacterial infections encountered were pyoderma (58. 8 %), cellulitis (23. 5 %), and <b>erythrasma</b> (17. 6 %).
