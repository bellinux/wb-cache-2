5|$|For their part, Donahue and Mitchell spread {{rumors that}} the band was <b>indeed</b> from the UK, and had the band dress in Beatlesque suits.|$|E
5|$|From the {{conflicting}} {{accounts of the}} sources, historians have tried to reconstruct the most likely sequence of {{events leading up to}} the battle. It is probable that Olaf Tryggvason was <b>indeed</b> sailing from Wendland to Norway when he was ambushed, though the kings' sagas probably play up the importance of Thyri and her marriages. While it is possible that Olaf was collecting dowry, it seems more probable that he was expecting war and seeking allies in Wendland, but met with little success. The character of Sigvaldi remains enigmatic, though there is evidence from skaldic poetry that he did <b>indeed</b> betray Olaf.|$|E

5|$|If Mac Scelling was <b>indeed</b> {{a member}} of the Meic Somairlethe {{descendants}} of Somairlethis relationship may cast light upon Somairle's struggles in the Isles. For instance, Mac Scelling's cooperation with Muirchertach could be evidence that Guðrøðr faced united opposition from Somairle and Muirchertach. In fact, there is evidence indicating that Guðrøðr and Muirchertach were <b>indeed</b> at odds {{at some point in the}} 1150s or 1160s, as the former appears to have briefly gained the kingship of Dublin at the expense of Muirchertach's authority as overlord.|$|E
5|$|<b>Indeed,</b> all Shigella {{species were}} placed {{within a single}} {{subspecies}} of E. coli in a phylogenomic study that included the type strain, {{and for this reason}} an according reclassification is difficult.|$|E
5|$|It {{turned out}} later that Fresnel's {{dragging}} coefficient is <b>indeed</b> {{in accordance with the}} relativistic velocity addition formula, see the section Derivation in special relativity.|$|E
5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern with the {{business}} of opera, which <b>indeed</b> had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. <b>Indeed,</b> he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and <b>indeed</b> engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E

5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot see such a lovely thing every day, to which he replies: <b>Indeed!</b> <b>indeed!</b> clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly behind the screen.|$|E
5|$|The sleepwalking {{scene is}} one of the more celebrated scenes from Macbeth, and, <b>indeed,</b> in all of Shakespeare. It has no {{counterpart}} in Holinshed's Chronicles, Shakespeare's source material for the play, but is solely the bard's invention.|$|E
5|$|The war, <b>indeed,</b> was {{altogether}} premature: had the cuirassed {{ships and}} Whitworths {{ordered by the}} Marshal-President begun the campaign, he might now have supplied the place of Mexico with a third great Latin empire.|$|E
5|$|Verner's {{arguments}} {{together with}} the scarcity of artefacts attributable to Shepseskare have now convinced many Egyptologists, such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung, that Shepseskare's reign was <b>indeed</b> ephemeral.|$|E

25|$|Justice Byron White wrote a {{concurring opinion}} raising a {{question}} that, {{he agreed with}} Marshall, was not before the Court {{in this particular case}} but was ancillary to it. <b>Indeed,</b> he noted, it had been raised in another case a decade earlier, where it was also not before the Court.
