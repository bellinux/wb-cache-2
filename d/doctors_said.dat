A hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment and, when diagnosed in 1984, was given six months to live.

5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. <b>Doctors</b> <b>said</b> he posed no risk to other students, but AIDS was poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer.
