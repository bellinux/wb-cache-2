500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> was writing that book." ...|$|E
500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had something in reserve.|$|E
60|$|Yet what {{followed}} enchained my attention so deeply that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> remained.|$|E
60|$|MARION. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> like her. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> that <b>I</b> {{have met}} you.|$|R
60|$|THE FEMALE FIGURE [collapsing] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dying. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{afraid to}} live.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will? Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad.</b> <b>I</b> thought—you—you <b>were</b> too fond—. But you're not—of {{yourself}} <b>I</b> meant. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so <b>glad.</b> Yes—do marry!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had {{not been}} too impetuous. My reply evidently pleased her. She chuckled all over.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{had sent}} that cable to his mother. I {{was going to}} need her. The thing had got beyond me.|$|E
60|$|He {{was indeed}} an {{exceptionally}} inefficient captain. On the whole <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had come {{even at the}} eleventh hour to see to things.|$|E
60|$|Sir John. O ho, then {{it seems}} the cudgelling and turning away <b>were</b> pure invention; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} it.|$|R
60|$|CHR. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{have with}} me a merciful brother; but we must not stand thus: let us try to go back again.|$|R
6000|$|His emotion moved Andre-Louis. He took Leandre's arm. [...] "You're a good fellow, Leandre. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> intervened to {{save you}} from your fate." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{left and}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad.</b> <b>I</b> {{did not care}} whither they went, so they went. I was willing they should visit Welch, and the sooner the better.|$|E
60|$|Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> was not dead, for {{now that}} all was over I trembled and felt afraid, which I had never done during the fighting, even when my hour seemed very near.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not. When you {{are dead}} you're not there, you know. Our bodies are but {{senseless}} clay." [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> remembered that line. I {{tried to think}} of the next one, which was about food for worms; but it evaded me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> didn't forget them, anyway," [...] said Sam bravely. But he {{wondered}} how it was Grace could treat him so shabbily.|$|R
6000|$|Mill. That's well; for though I begin not to {{love this}} fool, yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> rid of him. [...] [Exeunt MILL. and ROSE.|$|R
6000|$|... "Euphemia," [...] said I, in as {{composed}} a tone as possible, although my whole frame was trembling with emotion, [...] "Euphemia, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> married you!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> {{was not his}} lawyer. I re-read the correspondence, {{notably the}} letter which {{recommended}} him--almost tenderly, I fancied--to build a fourteen-foot brick wall {{at the end of}} his garden, and half-way through it a thought struck me which filled me with pure joy.|$|E
60|$|Down {{went the}} bright gold head upon dimpled, clasped {{hands on the}} table. Such a {{beautiful}} April storm! Unrestrainedly she sobbed. I wished I could have comforted her. But I was not George. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> was not Hiram--and yet I was sorry, too.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{paddling}} off, {{all in a}} {{sweat to}} tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> started or whether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Luna {{sank into}} the nearest chair, with a groan, {{covering}} {{her face with her}} hands. [...] "Heaven help me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to Europe!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{many of the}} O'Mores {{have made}} game of it?' asked Sophy, bitterly. 'No, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> know of it, <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> deceived any more.' ...|$|R
60|$|Franc. Nay, if that be your humour, husband, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> know it, that I may {{please you}} the better another time, as they say. [Exit FRANCES.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had {{not gone}} on a visit that day. Had I done so Mr. Stillwell would have {{received}} my letter, and I do not doubt but {{that he would have}} opened it. As it was, he knew nothing of the communication, and I did not intend that he should until I was ready to disclose it to him.|$|E
6000|$|They come in {{and shut}} the door; {{and the first thing}} the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> hadn't found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to {{anything}} private. They sets down then, and the king says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Halt!" [...] cried a voice I recognized; {{and there}} was a jingle of steel as two skin-wrapped troopers of the Northwest Police wheeled their horses on either side of me, while another, who spoke with authority, grasped my bridle. Even in that {{darkness}} I could see the ready carbines, and, knowing what manner of men these riders were, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> could meet them peaceably.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> have come,' said Mr Pecksniff, 'if <b>I</b> can <b>be</b> of service. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> have come. What <b>is</b> the matter, Mrs Lupin?' ...|$|R
60|$|Phil. Dear Celadon! most happily arrived.-- <b>I</b> hear you've <b>been</b> an honour to {{your country}} In the Calabrian wars; and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> have some {{interest}} in it.|$|R
60|$|CHR. Yes, and {{a dreadful}} one it <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> thought {{it made my}} heart ache as he was telling of it; but yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> heard it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{did think}} of one thing--rather odd--of a girl at Cambridge that I might have--you know; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> hadn't got her on my mind. Anyhow, old chap, I owe it to you that I'm here; I {{should have been in}} the big dark by now. No more bed, or baccy; no more anything. I say, what d'you suppose happens to us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The captain muttered some {{order to}} his men, which I didn't hear; but I guessed {{it was to}} leave us alone, for the present. I had no doubt what they {{intended}} {{to do was to}} catch us off our guard, and wrench the pistols from us; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> had the knife hidden away, for if they did carry us off, I was sure {{to be able to find}} some opportunity for using that.|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] {{his host}} concluded, as his fingers strayed towards the {{dismissal}} bell, [...] "you made rather a mistake, Tallente, years ago, in dabbling {{at all with}} the Labour Party. At first, I must admit that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>glad.</b> <b>I</b> felt that you created, as it were, a link between my Government and a very troublesome Opposition. To-day things have altered. Labour has shown its hand and it demands what no sane man could give. We've finished with compromise. We have to fight Socialism or go under." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the whole}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> did not marry into the family, as I {{could not have}} endured that girl to stay in my house as a sister-in-law.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{is a good}} {{all-around}} fellow," [...] {{answered the}} ranch owner. [...] "I <b>am</b> mighty <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> have him,--and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> got rid of that Hank Snogger," [...] he added.|$|R
60|$|CHRIS. Yes, and {{a dreadful}} one it <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> thought {{it made my}} heart ache as he was telling of it; but yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>I</b> heard of it.|$|R
