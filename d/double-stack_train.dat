High car is placed anywhere an excess height car could be routed onto a low clearance line. Shifted load is mainly found on railroads where <b>double-stack</b> <b>trains</b> are prevalent as the containers may become misaligned and present a hazard to bridge trusses or tunnel walls.|$|R

50|$|The {{tracks and}} {{junctions}} in the Chicago area have grown with little coordination between the railroads {{and the city}} since the first railroads arrived in the 1830s. There are {{a large number of}} at-grade crossings, sometimes not located a train length apart which is a problem as train lengths have grown. Some flyovers exist but do not always have sufficient clearance for tall or <b>double-stack</b> <b>trains.</b> Some connections that would create short cuts for traffic are missing. There are also many highway crossings at grades.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIntermodalism {{is seen by}} some shippers as a new industry emerging within the transportation industry. This thesis provides {{a basic understanding of}} the intermodal industry and investigates how the advent of containerization, especially the double-stack container system, has affected the shipper's perception of domestic intermodal transportation. As the double-stack network spreads there are signs that this new industry may be able to resolve the problem of fragmentation which has prevented intermodal service from becoming cost-competitive. In addition, containerization and the use of <b>double-stack</b> <b>trains</b> can help streamline the rapid mobilization of military cargo. Lieutenant, US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

50|$|In 1980, {{the state}} of New Jersey {{approached}} Walter Rich {{and asked him to}} take over operation of the nearly-dead New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYSW). In 1982, Conrail petitioned to abandon the former EL branches from Binghamton to Syracuse and Utica. DO acquired these lines and organized them as the Northern Division of the NYS&W. Soon after, portions of the former Lehigh and Hudson River Railway between Warwick, New York, and Sparta Jct., New Jersey, were purchased, and the western end of the NYSW was re-opened. Trackage rights over Conrail from Warwick to Binghamton were secured, creating a new through route from Syracuse to the New Jersey terminal waterfront at Little Ferry. The CNYK was integrated into the Northern Division at this time. The railroad was aggressively marketed as an alternative through route to New York City markets, operating lucrative intermodal <b>double-stack</b> <b>trains</b> starting in 1986. The NYSW quickly grew to become the flagship of DO.|$|R
5000|$|India - Mundra Port and Pipavav Port operate <b>double-stacked</b> diesel <b>trains</b> on [...] gauge using flat wagons.

India is building Dedicated Freight Corridor, economical and environmental friendly electrical traction based double-stack freight railway network which can transport international standard containers, a first in the world.|$|R
50|$|The Mundra Special Economic Zone was {{incorporated}} in 2003. It became India’s first multi-product port-based special economic zone.Two new berths at Terminal II became operational to handle bulk cargo. A <b>double-stack</b> container <b>train</b> began to operate. The Mundra Special Economic Zone Ltd. and Adani Chemicals Limited were merged with Gujarat Adani Port Ltd., {{and the company}} name was changed to Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone Limited (MPSEZ) in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Daylighting {{a tunnel}} {{is to remove}} its [...] "roof" [...] or {{overlying}} rock and soil, thus exposing the railway or roadway to daylight. This could {{also be seen as}} converting the tunnel to a railway or roadway cut. Tunnels are often daylighted to improve vertical or horizontal clearances, for example to accommodate <b>double-stack</b> container <b>trains</b> or electrifying rail lines, where increasing the size of the tunnel bore would be impractical.|$|R
50|$|Originally a two-tracked {{electrified}} rail line, the {{catenary wire}} over the tracks was dismantled to provide greater overhead clearance for <b>double-stack</b> container <b>trains.</b> The high voltage transmission lines {{running along the}} Trenton Cutoff from Norristown, where the Trenton Cutoff crosses over the abandoned Pennsylvania Railroad Schuylkill Branch, to Glenloch are part of Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system, used to power trains on the Northeast Corridor and the Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line.|$|R
50|$|The $150 million {{plan was}} {{developed}} to facilitate more efficient travel on NS rail lines between the Norfolk, Virginia port region and two Midwest destinations - Chicago, Illinois and Columbus, Ohio. One of the project goals was to increase clearances in tunnels to permit the operation of <b>double-stack</b> intermodal <b>trains,</b> increasing the capacity of rail lines, shortening rail journeys and reducing tractor-trailer traffic. New shipping terminals for intermodal connections are also planned for key locations.|$|R
2500|$|The route {{runs through}} Niles Canyon, {{parallel}} to the Niles Canyon Railway, Highway 84, and the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct. The line passes through a [...] long tunnel which cuts {{off one of the}} canyon's horseshoes. This tunnel was modified from its original configuration to accommodate intermodal <b>double-stack</b> freight <b>trains.</b> However, this left the track in poor condition, reducing speeds from [...] to [...] in the summer and as low as [...] during the rainy season. [...] The San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission plans to rehabilitate the tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|Strings of 5-10 {{of these}} [...] "HOGX" [...] cars were, until the mid 1990s, hauled twice-weekly {{at the front}} of <b>double-stack</b> {{intermodal}} freight <b>trains.</b> However, this service was terminated when Farmer John Meats shifted to hogs produced locally in California. The units have since been scrapped.|$|R
25|$|Double-stacked rail transport, where {{containers}} {{are stacked}} two high on railway cars, {{was introduced in}} the United States. The concept was developed by Sea-Land and the Southern Pacific railroad. The first standalone double-stack container car (or single-unit 40-ft COFC well car) was delivered in July 1977. The 5-unit well car, the industry standard, appeared {{for the first time in}} 1981. Initially, these double-stack railway cars were deployed in regular train service. Ever since American President Lines initiated in 1984 a dedicated <b>double-stack</b> container <b>train</b> service between Los Angeles and Chicago, transport volumes increased rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Oman {{does not}} {{currently}} have any rail infrastructure. Oman Rail {{will be responsible}} for developing the rail network in the country. Currently, Oman Rail intends to link Buraimi on the UAE border with Sohar, as part of the proposed Gulf Railway. The proposed line will be a 207 km, double-track, standard-gauge line with 32.4 km axle loads and a loading gauge sufficient to accommodate <b>double-stack</b> container <b>trains.</b> The line will utilise ERTMS Level 2. Diesel locomotives will run on the line initially, but the plans will provide an option for future electrification.|$|R
50|$|The route {{runs through}} Niles Canyon, {{parallel}} to the Niles Canyon Railway, Highway 84, and the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct. The line passes through a 0.75 mi long tunnel which cuts {{off one of the}} canyon's horseshoes. This tunnel was modified from its original configuration to accommodate intermodal <b>double-stack</b> freight <b>trains.</b> However, this left the track in poor condition, reducing speeds from 45 mi/h km/h to 25 mi/h km/h in the summer and as low as 10 mi/h km/h during the rainy season. The San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission plans to rehabilitate the tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The Superliners {{resembled the}} Hi-Levels but {{differed}} in several ways. The most obvious difference was the height: at 16 ft the Superliners are 8 in taller. The Superliners also used 480 volt head-end power (HEP), which Amtrak had just adopted as its standard. The Hi-Levels, which used steam heating and diesel generators, would {{be converted to}} match this standard. Initially the cars could not be worked east of Chicago because of limited overhead clearances, but by the 1980s many eastern railroads had raised clearances on their tracks to permit tri-level auto carriers and <b>double-stack</b> container <b>trains,</b> which also permitted {{the operation of the}} Superliners.|$|R
