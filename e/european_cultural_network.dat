40|$|The idea of {{a common}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently {{referred to in the}} political discourses and practices of the EU. The {{idea of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage elevates the ideas of ownership and inheritance beyond the local, regional, or national frameworks and transforms the heritage sites and objects into a ‘common good’ belonging to all Europeans and into a source of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> identity. Scholars have debated the possibility of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, and in case such could exist, what it could be grounded upon. Critical scholars have asked what might be the trans-border European dimension of heritage that goes beyond the mere sum of national, regional, or local icons, or questioned the possibility of common European heritage practices {{due to the lack of}} a singular European people. Some scholars have, however, found a possible common ground for a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage for example in urbanity, European cities and their historical environment, and the styles and movements of art and architecture. Functions and uses of the idea of <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and the contexts in which it becomes important and meaningful have changed over the course of time and are constantly transforming. The recent societal, political, and cultural changes in Europe have influenced the notions on heritage and made the concept of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage more problematic. What is a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and how has it been approached in recent scholarly discussions? How can a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage be made sense of in relation to the ideas of universalism, cosmopolitanism, particularism, transnationalism, translocalism, transculturalism, and pan-Europeanism?

40|$|The vague {{concept of}} a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently referred to – but rarely explicitly defined – in scholarly discussion. The use of the concept in academia constructs a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage as a category in research and explicitly and implicitly produces its focuses and outlines. Thus, {{the use of the}} concept can be considered as scholarly engineering of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. To {{be able to have a}} scholarly discussion about a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, the meanings and uses of the concept need to be clarified. This article examines the meanings and uses of the concept in recent scholarly articles published in various disciplines. In the study, the concept analysis by Walker and Avant is applied and expanded with a discourse theoretical aspect: different recurring characteristics brought to the fore in the use of the concept are perceived as varying discourses on a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage...|$|R
40|$|Cultural {{heritage}} {{is an idea}} and a concept repeatedly brought up in current EU policy discourse. In recent years the European Commission has launched several initiatives which aim to foster {{the idea of a}} common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. The idea is also often referred to in scholarly discussion. There has been vivid discussion in academia {{about the possibility of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and what it could be grounded upon. What is a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage? How has it been explicated and defined in recent EU policy discourse and scholarly discussion? Through qualitative content analysis of diverse EU policy documents and selected scholarly publications, the article clarifies the multifaceted meanings of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, compares the similarities and differences between the political and scholarly notions of it, and discusses the interaction and interrelatedness of political and scholarly discussions about a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. As a result, the article brings out diverse phenomena, such as values, events, personalities, styles, architecture, urbanity, borders, a conflicting past, and the EU integration process, through which a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage has been defined and presents these definitions categorized on the basis of the tangible, intangible, communal, and spatial dimensions of heritage...|$|R

40|$|The EU has {{recently}} launched several initiatives that aim {{to foster the}} idea of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. The notion of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage in EU policy discourse is extremely abstract, referring to various ideas and values detached from physical locations or places. Nevertheless the EU initiatives put the abstract policy discourse into practice and concretize its notions about a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. A common strategy in this practice is ‘placing heritage’ – affixing {{the idea of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage to certain places in order to turn them into specific European heritage sites. The materialisation of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and the production of physical European heritage sites are crucial elements in the policy through which the EU seeks to govern both the actors and the meanings of heritage. On the basis of a qualitative content analysis of diverse policy documents and informational and promotional material, this article presents five strategies of ‘placing heritage’ used in the EU initiatives. In addition, the article presents a theoretical model of circulation of the tangible and intangible dimensions of heritage in the EU heritage policy discourse and discusses the EU’s political intents included in the practices of ‘placing heritage’...|$|R

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the shift from}} the identity-marking heritage of European nation states to a contemporary migrating heritage across Europe and beyond, drawing on interdisciplinary source material. The author argues that European migrating heritage encompasses not only the migration and mobility of post-colonial artefacts, but also the migration of people, technologies and disciplines, crossing boundaries and joining forces in <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> and partnerships to address new emerging challenges of social inclusion and cultural dialogue, new models of cultural identity, citizenship and national belonging. The book highlights the strengths and benefits from new cultural networking practices but also the challenges and issues that arise, how these could be addressed and what lessons can be learnt. It also sets out {{to answer the questions}} ‘how’. How can we leverage the power of cross-border <b>cultural</b> <b>networks</b> in a contested place such as Europe today? How can <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> institutions elaborate the necessary approaches and strategies to achieve a type of cultural cooperation that is truly based on cultural practice? How can the actions of the European Commission and relevant cultural bodies in Europe be strengthened, adapted or extended to meet these goals? The book will be of interest to scholars and students in museum and cultural heritage studies, visual studies, sociology of organizations, cultural heritage management and information studies. It will also be relevant to practitioners and policymakers from museums, libraries, NGOs and cultural institutions at large...|$|R
