50|$|An <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> {{shifts the}} LM curve to the right. This {{directly}} reduces the local interest rate {{relative to the}} global interest rate.

5000|$|The term [...] "inflation" [...] {{originally}} {{referred to}} <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> {{the amount of}} <b>money</b> <b>in</b> circulation. However, most economists today use the term [...] "inflation" [...] {{to refer to a}} rise in the price level. An <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> may be called monetary inflation, to distinguish it from rising prices, which may also for clarity be called [...] "price inflation". Economists generally agree that in the long run, inflation is caused by <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Finally, Keynes {{suggested}} that, {{because of}} fear of capital losses on assets besides money, {{there may be a}} [...] "liquidity trap" [...] setting a floor under which interest rates cannot fall. While in this trap, interest rates are so low that any <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> will cause bond-holders (fearing rises in interest rates and hence capital losses on their bonds) to sell their bonds to attain money (liquidity).|$|E
50|$|Theories of {{hyperinflation}} generally {{look for}} a relationship between seigniorage and the inflation tax. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping point occurs when the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> or the drop in the monetary base {{makes it impossible for}} a government to improve its financial position. Thus when fiat money is printed, government obligations that are not denominated in money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a central}} bank is [...] "easing", it {{triggers}} an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> by purchasing government securities {{on the open market}} thus increasing available funds for private banks to lend out through fractional-reserve banking (the issue of new money through loans) and thus the amount of bank reserves and the monetary base rise. By purchasing government bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasury bills), this bids up their prices, so that interest rates fall {{at the same time that}} the monetary base increases.|$|E

50|$|In addition, those economists {{seeing the}} central bank's {{control over the}} <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> as feeble {{say that there are}} two weak links between the growth of the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> and the {{inflation}} rate. First, {{in the aftermath of a}} recession, when many resources are underutilized, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> can cause a sustained <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> real production instead of inflation. Second, if the velocity of money (i.e., the ratio between nominal GDP and <b>money</b> <b>supply)</b> changes, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> could have either no effect, an exaggerated effect, or an unpredictable effect on the growth of nominal GDP.|$|R
50|$|The {{deflation}} of the Great Depression occurred {{partly because}} there was an enormous contraction of credit (money), bankruptcies creating an environment where cash was in frantic demand, and when the Federal Reserve was supposed to accommodate that demand, it instead contracted the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> by 30% <b>in</b> enforcement of its new real bills doctrine, so banks toppled one-by-one (because {{they were unable to}} meet the sudden demand for cash see fractional-reserve banking). From the standpoint of the Fisher equation (see above), there was a concomitant drop both <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> (credit) and the velocity of money which was so profound that price deflation took hold despite the <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> spurred by the Federal Reserve.|$|R
50|$|In Austrian {{business}} cycle theory, malinvestments are badly allocated business investments, due to artificially low {{cost of credit}} and an unsustainable <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply.</b> Central banks are often blamed for causing malinvestments, such as the dot-com bubble, and the United States housing bubble. Austrian economists such as Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek advocate the idea that malinvestment occurs due to the combination of fractional reserve banking and artificially low interest rates misleading relative price signals which eventually necessitate a corrective contraction—a boom followed by a bust.|$|E

In the former model applied to a small economy with flexible exchange rates, an unanticipated <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> <b>increases</b> output of both traded and nontraded goods, lowers the relative price of nontraded goods, and inducesa current-account surplus.

50|$|Prior to {{the work}} of Sargent and Wallace, {{macroeconomic}} models were largely based on the adaptive expectations assumption. Many economists found this unsatisfactory since it assumes that agents may repeatedly make systematic errors and can only revise their expectations in a backward-looking way. Under adaptive expectations, agents do not revise their expectations even if the government announces a policy that involves increasing money supply beyond its expected growth level. Revisions would only be made after the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> has occurred, and even then agents would react only gradually. In each period that agents found their expectations of inflation to be wrong, a certain proportion of agents' forecasting error would be incorporated into their initial expectations. Therefore, equilibrium in the economy would only be converged upon and never reached. The government would be able to maintain employment above its natural level and easily manipulate the economy.|$|E
50|$|Whatever the cause, {{hyperinflation}} involves {{both the}} supply and velocity of money. Which comes {{first is a}} matter of debate, and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by whichever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable loss of purchasing power. As a result, no one holds currency, which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, the Indian economy had {{numerous}} {{issues relating to}} {{the functioning of the}} monetary system. The government borrowing program was increasing rapidly. These increasing requirements from the government could be met by a) Increasing credit from the Reserve Bank of India to the government and b) Increasing the Statutory Liquidity Ratio that was meant to be maintained by the banks. As a result, the reserves of the government were increasing and this led to an increase in the Money Supply which in turn, resulted in inflationary pressures in the economy. [...] The Reserve Requirement was increased {{from time to time to}} counter the effect of this <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> due to the Reserve Bank of India's decision to finance the deficit of the government. These were the most prominent reasons for the appointment of the Chakravarty Committee for reviewing the monetary system.

50|$|Rothbard {{argues that}} {{the claim that the}} Federal Reserve is {{designed}} to fight inflation is sophistry, that price inflation is caused only by an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply,</b> and that since only banks increase the <b>money</b> <b>supply,</b> then banks, including the Federal Reserve, are the only source of inflation.|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} between {{changes in the}} nation's total <b>supply</b> of <b>money</b> and subsequent changes in real output has led some people to infer that policymakers, by changing the <b>money</b> <b>supply,</b> can stimulate or moderate the nation's real output.; Scott Freeman argues that this conclusion may be inappropriate. Freeman distinguishes inside money, the money created by banks through their lending, from outside money, the money the Federal Reserve prints. He shows that anticipatory <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> bank lending {{may account for the}} rise <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> that often precedes an expansion in real output. Under this interpretation, <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> that are due to Federal Reserve action result in higher prices, with no <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> real output.

5000|$|In Mises's definition, {{inflation}} {{is an increase}} in the supply of money:In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression Inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader sense of the term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader sense of the term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur.Hayek pointed out that inflationary stimulation exploits the lag between an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> and the consequent increase in the prices of goods and services:And since any inflation, however modest at first, can help employment only so long as it accelerates, adopted as a means of reducing unemployment, it will do so {{for any length of time}} only while it accelerates. [...] "Mild" [...] steady inflation cannot help—it can lead only to outright inflation.

5000|$|Bryan, the eloquent {{champion}} of the cause, gave the famous [...] "Cross of Gold" [...] speech at the National Democratic Convention on July 9, 1896 asserting that [...] "The gold standard has slain tens of thousands." [...] He referred to [...] "a struggle between 'the idle holders of idle capital’ and 'the struggling masses, who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country;’ and, my friends, the question we are to decide is: Upon which side will the Democratic party fight?" [...] At the peroration, he said [...] "You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." [...] However, his presidential campaign was ultimately unsuccessful; this can be partially attributed {{to the discovery of}} the cyanide process by which gold could be extracted from low grade ore. This process and the discoveries of large gold deposits in South Africa (Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1887 - with large-scale production starting in 1898) and the Klondike Gold Rush (1896) increased the world gold supply and the subsequent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> that free coinage of silver was supposed to bring. The McKinley campaign was effective at persuading voters in the business East that poor economic progress and unemployment would be exacerbated by adoption of the Bryan platform. 1896 saw the election of McKinley. The direct link to gold was abandoned in 1934 in FDR’s New Deal program and later the link was broken by Nixon when he closed the gold window.|$|E

40|$|Considered as an axiomatic {{basis of}} classical, neoclassical, and {{monetarist}} theories, the long-run money neutrality assumption {{does not always}} seem to be verified.

Thus, this paper examines the long-term relationship among <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> (M 2), income (GDP), and prices (CPI). The subprime crisis in 2007 has shown that the demand for money does not only meet motives of transaction, precaution, and speculation but also of fictional or quasi-fictional future demands {{due to the fact that}} they are created without real counterparts. The capacity of production systems in developed countries to respond to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> by creating more wealth, involves the assumption of <b>money</b> neutrality <b>in</b> the long-run.

5000|$|Since {{hyperinflation}} {{is visible}} as a monetary effect, models of hyperinflation {{center on the}} demand for money.

Either one, or both of these together are {{the root causes of}} inflation and hyperinflation. A dramatic <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the [...] "crisis of confidence" [...] model of hyperinflation, where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper currency over the nominal value grows rapidly. The second theory is that there is first a radical <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the amount of circulating medium, which can be called the [...] "monetary model" [...] of hyperinflation. In either model, the second effect then follows from the first—either too little confidence forcing an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>money</b> <b>supply,</b> or too much money destroying confidence.|$|R
