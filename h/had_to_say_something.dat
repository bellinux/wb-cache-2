2500|$|As {{a result}} of Douglas's stroke the {{previous}} summer, however, in which he lost most of his speaking ability, his close friends and family were concerned about whether he should try to speak, or what he should say. Both his son, Michael, and his long-time friend, Jack Valenti, urged him to only say [...] "Thank you", and leave the stage. Douglas agreed. But when {{standing in front of}} the audience, he had second thoughts: [...] "I intended to just say 'thank you,' but I saw 1,000 people, and felt I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more, and I did." [...] Valenti remembers that after Douglas held up the Oscar, addressed his sons, and told his wife how much he loved her, everyone was astonished at his voice's improvement: ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the lead}} authors, Dennis L. Hartmann, {{subsequently}} said; [...] "Going into the IPCC this time, I would have said that, well, the trend over a 15-year record is not really very meaningful, because of the natural interannual variability of the climate system. But as the IPCC evolved, it {{became more and more}} of a public issue, so we felt we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about it, even though from an observational perspective, it's not a very reliable measure of long-term warming." [...] He said [...] "the apparent reduction in the observed warming rate" [...] was [...] "interesting on purely scientific grounds, but it does not have a huge impact on the scientific assessment and does not alter the basic facts." [...] Research cited in the report had to be published by 15 March, excluding work such as a paper by NCAR scientists including Kevin E. Trenberth indicating that increased heat was going into ocean depths.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, a Tumblr post from user virjn {{generated}} media controversy, as it claimed Green is [...] "a creep who panders to {{teenage girls}} {{so that he}} can amass some weird cult-like following." [...] Other users commented on the post, criticizing his writing and tagging Green to bring the post to his attention. Green responded to the post, defending himself, stating, [...] "Throwing that kind of accusation around is sick and libelous and most importantly damages the discourse around the actual sexual abuse of children." [...] Green added that he would use the social media website less often, stating, [...] "I'm not angry or anything like that. I just need some distance for my well-being." [...] Fellow young-adult authors, Rainbow Rowell and Maggie Stiefvater came to Green's defense. Stiefvater wrote on Tumblr, [...] "You can have your own opinions on Green's books and Internet presence, {{but the fact remains that}} he is a very real positive influence on thousands of teens. You're not just making sure you can't have nice things. You're taking away other people's nice things." [...] In a subsequent email to USA Today, Stiefvater stated, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> Not because of the nature of the posts, although they were distasteful and borderline libel. But because the grotesquerie was being force-fed to the author." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{contrast}} to hermeneutic interpretation or social-scientific reconstruction, phenomenological description aims at keeping different epistemological levels apart; the visible and the utterable, the implicit and the explicit. With regards to research practice, {{the difference of}} <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> which cannot be said, but which shows itself and in showing shows itself as something, becomes thematic. At this point, the respect for the matter in question and for the different perspectives on the matter becomes manifest (Brinkmann 2016 a, b).|$|R
