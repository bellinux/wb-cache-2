A major challenge in this respect is the VN embedding problem that deals with the efficient mapping of virtual resources on InP network resources. Previous research focused on heuristic algorithms for the VN embedding problem assuming that the InP network remains operational at all times.

The policies dictate whether retransmissions {{are sent to}} the same peer IP address as the original transmission, or sent to an alternate peer IP address.

We find that sending all retransmissions to an alternate peer IP address is useful when the primary IP address becomes unreachable, but often degrades performance in non-failure scenarios. On the other hand, sending all retransmissions to the same peer IP address as the original transmission reverses the tradeoffs. We balance the tradeoffs by proposing a <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy</b> that sends fast retransmissions to the same peer IP address as the original transmission, and sends timeout retransmissions to an alternate peer IP address.

40|$|Uncertainty about {{compliance}} costs causes otherwise equivalent {{price and}} quantity controls to behave differently. Price controls � {{in the form}} of taxes � fix the marginal cost of compliance and lead to uncertain levels of compliance. Meanwhile quantity controls � {{in the form of}} tradable permits or quotas � fix the level of compliance but result in uncertain marginal costs. This fundamental difference in the face of cost uncertainty leads to different welfare outcomes for the two policy instruments. Seminal work by Weitzman (1974) clarified this point and derived theoretical conditions under which one policy is preferred to the other. This paper applies this principal to the issue of worldwide greenhouse gas (GHG) control, using a global integrated climate economy model to simulate the consequences of uncertainty and to compare the efficiency of taxes and permits empirically. The results indicate that an optimal tax policy generates gains which are five times higher than the optimal permit policy � a $ 337 billion dollar gain versus $ 69 billion at the global level. This result follows from Weitzman’s original intuition that relatively flat marginal benefits/damages favor taxes, a feature that drops out of standard assumptions about the nature of climate damages. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy,</b> suggested by Roberts and Spence (1976), is also explored. Such a policy uses an initial distribution of tradeable permits to set a target emission level, but then allows additional permits to be purchased at a fixed "trigger" price. The optimal <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy</b> leads to welfare benefits only slightly higher than the optimal tax policy. Relative to the tax policy, however, the hybrid preserves the ability to flexibly distribute the rents associated with the right to emit. Perhaps more importantly for policy discussions, a sub-optimal <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy,</b> based on a stringent target and high trigger price (e. g., 1990 emissions and a $ 100 /tC trigger), generates much better welfare outcomes than a straight permit system with the same target. Both of these features suggest that a <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy</b> is a more attractive alternative to either a straight tax or permit system. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Customer order {{acceptance}} is {{an important}} process in make-to-order industries. Acceptance policies should operate such that a pre-specified delivery reliability is achieved, while maximizing resource utilization. By selecting orders with specific characteristics that maximize resource utilization, an important and often unforeseen effect occurs: the mix of orders changes such that the expected delivery reliability is no longer met. This paper investigates the selectivity of an aggregate and a detailed acceptance procedure, for batch process industries featuring complex job and resource structures. We found that the detailed policy maximizes resource utilization but underestimates the consequences on the realized makespan of significantly changing the job mix. The aggregate policy, while being selective, performs much better {{with respect to the}} delivery reliability, but achieves a lower capacity utilization. We propose a third procedure, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy,</b> which combines the strengths of both the detailed and aggregate acceptance procedures. Simulation experiments show that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy</b> successfully controls the delivery reliability, without loosing much of the beneficial effect of the selectivity on utilization...|$|E

40|$|To reduce energy {{consumption}} of lightly loaded routers, operators are increasingly incentivized to use Adaptive Link Rate (ALR) policies and techniques. These techniques typically save energy by adapting link service rates or by identifying opportune times to put interfaces into low-power sleep/idle modes. In this paper, {{we present a}} trace-based analysis of the impact that a router implementing these techniques has on the neighboring routers. We show that policies adapting the service rate at larger time scales, either by changing the service rate of the link interface itself or by changing which redundant heterogeneous link is active, typically have large positive effects on neighboring routers, with the downstream routers being able to achieve up-to 30 % additional energy savings due to the upstream routers implementing ALR policies. Policies that save energy by temporarily placing the interface in a low-power sleep/idle mode, typically has smaller, but positive, impact on neighboring routers. Best are <b>hybrid</b> <b>policies</b> that {{use a combination of}} these two techniques. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>policies</b> consistently achieve the biggest energy savings, and have positive cascading effects on surrounding routers.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{scheduling}} problem in multi-channel wireless networks, e. g., the downlink of a single cell in fourth generation (4 G) OFDM-based cellular networks. Our goal is to design practical scheduling policies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput and delay, at a low complexity. While a class of O(n^ 2. 5 n) -complexity <b>hybrid</b> scheduling <b>policies</b> are recently developed to guarantee both rate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic regime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting), their practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop a simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a complexity 2 n^ 2 + 2 n, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves throughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay performance. Specifically, we show that the rate-function attained by D-SSG for any delay-violation threshold b, is no smaller than the maximum achievable rate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold b- 1. Thus, we are able to achieve a reduction in complexity (from O(n^ 2. 5 n) of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>policies</b> to 2 n^ 2 + 2 n) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More importantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity than the <b>hybrid</b> <b>policies</b> that typically have a large constant factor hidden in the O(·) notation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that D-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically is virtually indistinguishable from delay-optimal policies.

40|$|Abstract. When {{dealing with}} {{dynamically}} evolving datasets, users are often {{interested in the}} state of affairs on previous versions of the dataset, and would like to execute queries on such previous versions, as well as queries that compare the state of affairs across different versions. This is especially true for datasets stored in the Web, where the interlinking as-pect, combined with the lack of central control, do not allow synchronized evolution of interlinked datasets. To address this requirement the obvious solution is to store all previous versions, but this could quickly increase the space requirements; an alternative solution is to store adequate deltas between versions, which are generally smaller, but this would create the overhead of generating versions at query time. This paper studies the trade-offs involved in these approaches, {{in the context of a}}rchiving dy-namic RDF datasets over the Web. Our main message is that a <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy</b> would work better than any of the above approaches, and describe our proposed methodology for establishing a cost model that would allow determining when each of the two standard methods (version-based or delta-based storage) should be used in the context of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a hybrid maintenance policy {{for a simple}} system comprising a single component that arises from a heterogeneous population. This population of components consists of two sub-populations that possess different failure characteristics. There are {{a substantial number of}} papers that deal with appropriate mixture distributions for the lifetime of a component from such a population. However, the study of maintenance policies for a system with this type of component is limited. By supposing that a component may be in a defective but operating state, so that there exists a delay time between defect arrival and failure, we consider a novel maintenance policy that is a hybrid of inspection and replacement policies. There are similarities in this approach with the concept of “burn-in” maintenance. The policies are investigated in the context of traction motor bearing failures. Under certain circumstances, particularly when the mixture parameter is large and the distribution of lifetimes for the two component types are well separated, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy</b> has significant cost savings over the standard age-based replacement policy and over the pure inspection policy. In addition to the cost metric, the mean time between operational failures of the system under the <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy</b> can be used to guide decision-making.

There is significant and continuing interest {{in the concept of}} charging city vehicle users, although apart from the use of parking charges actual operational schemes are few and far between. In this paper, we compare three alternative charging policies using a simplified model of travel demand and supply, which we combine with cost benefit techniques. The charging policies are area-based charging in which users pay to locate in or enter an area, terminal-charging based on supplementary parking fees in residential and non-residential locations and distance-based charging which is a charge related to how far users travel. The model allows for behavioural effects resulting from trip diversion and demand suppression, as well as capacity restraint (speed-flow feedback effects based on limited route capacity). In the case study, we parameterize the model using data and geographical dimensions based on London. We show that area based charging delivers the least benefits whilst a <b>hybrid</b> <b>policy</b> based on terminal and distance-based charges delivers the most. Because it is of topical interest, we compare our results and predictions with the Mayor's strategy for London, which is an area-based scheme.
