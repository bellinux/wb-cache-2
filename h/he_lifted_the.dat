5|$|League {{football}} was suspended in September 1939 with {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War, and team affairs in wartime competitions were handled by director and acting manager Arthur Wright, before his resignation from illness midway through the 1942–43 season. He was replaced by Tom Lockie, who carried on until after the 1945–46 FA Cup, when Mitchell returned for the 1946–47 Football League season. Mitchell resigned in February 1950 to concentrate on his business interests, and was succeeded in April by Birmingham City northern scout and former York player Dick Duckworth. <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> club {{from the bottom of the}} table to a top four position, but left in October 1952 to take over at Stockport County. Former Grimsby Town manager Charlie Spencer took over in November 1952, but his health declined and died in February 1953, after less than three months in charge. Sheffield United assistant manager Jimmy McCormick was appointed in June 1953, before he resigned in September 1954 over a dispute with the board regarding team selection. York went the next 18 months without an official manager, with team matters handled by trainer Lockie and secretary Sherrington. This was a successful period for the club; York reached the semi-final of the 1954–55 FA Cup, and were beaten by Newcastle United in a replay.|$|E

However, Mark Roberts and Barry Corr scored for Cambridge in the last 19 minutes, and the match {{finished}} a 2–2 draw. York knocked League One team Doncaster Rovers out of the Football League Trophy {{in the second round}} with a 2–0 home win.

York ended Luton Town's four-match winning streak with a 1–1 away draw; Lowe scored late into the first half with a shot into the top of the goal, before Luton equalised in the second half from a Cameron McGeehan penalty. Turner's loan was extended for a second month. York were beaten 3–1 away by Barnet, who had been on a three-match losing streak. After going behind to John Akinde's goal, Coulson equalised for York in the 80th minute with a drilled shot, but goals in the last 10 minutes from Michael Gash and Josh Clarke secured a win for the home team.|$|E
