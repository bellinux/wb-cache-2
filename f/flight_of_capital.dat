25|$|In 1968 the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) {{published}} {{a series of}} reports, known simply as the HUD reports, that described the problems in modern cities due to {{the rapid expansion of}} suburbs in the 1950s.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s the {{problems}} with urban sprawl were becoming evident in the United States. When cities improved roads and the transit times were lowered, suburbs developed at ever increasing distances from the city cores, and people {{moved out of the}} downtown areas. Lacking pollution control systems, the rapid rise in car ownership and the longer trips to and from work were causing significant air quality problems. Additionally, movement to the suburbs led to a <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from the downtown areas, one cause of the rapid urban decay seen in the US.|$|E

Also, the criminalisation of politics during this time created a business unfriendly climate {{and contributed to the}} economic collapse. The biggest crisis business faced was with organised kidnapping, which the local BJP leaders claimed was linked to the ruling RJD. The resulting crisis led to a <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> middle class professionals, and business leaders to other parts of India. The flight of business and capital increased unemployment and this led to the mass migration of Bihari farmers and unemployed youth to more developed states of India.|$|E

40|$|A {{feature of}} the inter-war period was the {{increased}} importance of financial questions in international relations. Co-operation between France, Great Britain and the United States was made difficult by differences over reparations and war debts — differences which reflected, and were reinforced by, public opinion. Public opinion in liberal democracies also {{made it difficult to}} raise taxes to match German rearmament, while financial opinion could cause <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> — which further limited Anglo-French defensive preparations.

25|$|During {{the early}} 1960s there was growing {{concern in the}} United States {{about the effects of}} urban sprawl and the {{resulting}} urban decay that followed. Major cities across the country were watching their downtown cores turn into ghost towns as the suburbs expanded and caused a <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> out of the cities. The only cities that were combatting this were the ones with effective mass transit systems, cities like New York City and Boston, where the utility of the subway was greater than a car. However, these solutions were extremely expensive to develop, well beyond the budgets of smaller cities or the suburbs of larger ones. Through the 1960s there was a growing movement in urban planning circles that the solution was the personal rapid transit system, small automated vehicles that were much less expensive to develop.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s, Toronto {{experienced}} {{the same sort}} of urban sprawl that was sweeping through the United States. This caused enormous traffic problems within the city, and a network of new highways to address the problem became part of the Official Plan in 1959. By the mid-1960s, there was a growing awareness that the growth of the suburbs led to a <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from the city cores, resulting in the urban decay being seen throughout the US leading to a Freeway Revolts across North America. Activists such as Jane Jacobs successfully rallied local groups to oppose development of the Spadina Expressway project. The government reconsidered and cancelled the construction of the Spadina Expressway and other planned expressways. Instead of expressways, Davis and his new Minister of Transport, William Goodfellow, outlined the [...] "GO-Urban" [...] plan. GO-Urban called for a system of three advanced mass transit lines that would be run by the newly formed GO Transit. The idea was to select a system with low capital costs, one that would be cost effective in low-density areas where a traditional subway would be too expensive to build and operate. Designed to have a design capacity half-way between buses and subways, the new system was referred to as the Intermediate Capacity Transit System or ICTS. The space age automated guideway transit (AGT) systems being designed in the late 1960s seemed like the right solution.|$|E

For example, the demand for skilled labourers in the UK, US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia has led to active recruitment programs by those countries in South Africa. These countries accounted for 75% (by volume) of recent skilled emigration with the UK receiving approximately half of annual skilled South African emigration from 1990 to 1996.

40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{substantial}} recent {{increase in capital}} flows to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the sub-continent remains largely marginalized in financial globalization and chronically dependent on official development aid. The current debate on resource mobilization for development financing in Africa has overlooked the problem <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>flight,</b> which constitutes an important untapped source of funds. This paper argues that repatriation <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> <b>capital</b> deserves more attention on economic as well as moral grounds. On the moral side, {{the argument is that}} a large proportion <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> legitimately belongs to the African people and therefore must be restituted to the legitimate claimants. The economic argument is that repatriation <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> <b>capital</b> will contribute to propelling the sub-continent on a higher sustainable growth path while preserving its financial stability and independence and without mortgaging the welfare of its future generations through external borrowing. The anticipated gains from capital repatriation are large. In particular, this paper estimates that if only a quarter of the stock of capita...|$|R
