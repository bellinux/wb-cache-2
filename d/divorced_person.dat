40|$|The {{research}} {{used the}} Berger and Luckmann (1966) treatment of alternations [...] radical life changes [...] to examine divorce. The relationship between present adjustment of <b>divorced</b> <b>persons</b> and retrospective assessments {{of their former}} marriage was examined. It was hypothesized that <b>divorced</b> <b>persons</b> make negative assessments of their former marriage, and these assessments are related to adjustment. It further proposed that associational relationships provide support for these assessments. The model indicated that retrospective assessments are related to abandonment of the former spouse and involvement with a new intimate, which is related to adjustment;The respondents included 87 <b>divorced</b> <b>persons,</b> whose <b>divorces</b> were granted between January 1, 1979, and August 17, 1981, in Custer County, Oklahoma, who replied to a mailed questionnaire.

The Marriage Assessment Scale was created to measure the extent of positive and negative assessments made regarding the former marriage;The findings indicate that <b>divorced</b> <b>persons</b> make negative assessments of their former marriage (e. g., they make negative rather than positive responses on the Marriage Assessment Scale), and that some of these are related to adjustment. Since the model was not supported by the data, an alternative model, which proposed that associational relationships are related to retrospective assessments of the former marriage and these are related to adjustment, was tested. Some support was found for this model, especially regarding the former spouse relationship. <b>Divorced</b> <b>persons</b> with low contact with the former spouse at present {{are more likely to have}} negative assessments of the past, and have better adjustment. Having a new intimate at present is highly correlated with adjustment, although negative assessments of the former marriage do not serve as intervening variables as proposed by the model. Apparently the new intimate relationship is oriented toward the here and now, and less likely to be involved with any assessment of the past. It was concluded that divorce represents a radical life change, but it lacks the supportive associational relationships which provide negative assessments of the past and consequences for adjustment;Reference;Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann. 1966.

40|$|Introduction. This study {{produced}} and evaluated a mass media campaign {{designed to promote}} emotional adjustment to divorce. Hypotheses. (a) Sending a promotional newsletter to <b>divorced</b> <b>persons</b> will increase their reported utilization of the campaign. (b) <b>Divorced</b> <b>persons</b> who report heavy utilization of the campaign will report greater emotional improvement than <b>divorced</b> <b>persons</b> who report light or no utilization of the campaign. Method. A field experiment was conducted in rural northern Utah. The names of all recently (less than 12 months) <b>divorced</b> <b>persons</b> {{were obtained from the}} county clerk and randomly divided into an experimental group, who received a newsletter promoting the media campaign, and a control group. The five-week media campaign included 10 radio shows, 16 newspaper articles, and 29 television shows. After the campaign, 101 subjects were interviewed regarding their media use. They also completed a posttest and retrospective pretest of anxiety, depression, hostility (measured by the Symptom Check List 90 -R), and attachment. Results. The campaign was reportedly used by 77. 2 % of the subjects. Hypothesis 1 was weakly supported. Subjects who received the newsletter reported using statistically significantly more media events (X = 4. 95) than subjects who did not receive the newsletter (X = 3. 12). However, the percentage of variance in media use associated with newsletter receipt was only 3. 2 %. Hypothesis 2 was partially supported. Heavy campaign users (3 + events) reported statistically significantly greater improvements in anxiety, depression, and hostility (but not attachment) than light users (0 - 2 events). The percentage of variance in emotional improvements associated with media use ranged from 1 to 5 %. Those who reportedly spent time with significant others after the divorce reported significantly greater emotional improvements {{than those who did not}} spend time with others. The highest degree of reported emotional improvement was reported by those who reported both heavy media use and time spent with significant others, while the lowest degree of emotional improvement was reported by subjects who reported little or no media use and no time spent with confidants...|$|R

50|$|All Christian {{denominations}} {{affirm that}} marriage is intended as a lifelong covenant {{between a man and}} a woman, but vary in their response to its dissolubility through divorce. The Roman Catholic Church treats all consummated sacramental marriages as permanent during the life of the spouses, and therefore does not allow remarriage after a divorce if the other spouse still lives and the marriage has not been annulled. However, divorced Catholics are still welcome to participate fully in the life of the church so long as they have not remarried against church law, and the Catholic Church generally requires civil divorce or annulment procedures to have been completed before it will consider annulment cases. Annulment is not the same as divorce - it is a declaration that the marriage was never valid to begin with. Other Christian denominations, including the Eastern Orthodox Church and many Protestant churches, will allow both divorce and remarriage even with a surviving former spouse, at least under certain conditions. In societies that practised Puritanism, divorce was allowed if one partner in the marriage was not completely satisfied with the other, and remarriage was also allowed. The Church of England also took an indissolublist line until 2002, when it agreed to allow a <b>divorced</b> <b>person</b> to remarry in church under exceptional circumstances.|$|E
30|$|Note {{that if a}} <b>divorced</b> <b>person</b> {{comes from}} a {{religious}} marriage, Catholic norms exclude {{the possibility of a}} second religious marriage, while this is not true {{in the case of a}} first civil marriage (i.e. a <b>divorced</b> <b>person</b> from a former civil marriage could in principle celebrate his/her second marriage with a Catholic rite).|$|E

2500|$|Anne married Timothy Laurence, then a {{commander}} in the Royal Navy, at Crathie Kirk, near Balmoral Castle, on 12 December 1992.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{was designed to}} assess the behavior patterns of divorced persons as they acted and reacted to the crisis experience. ^ In the study, five hypotheses were developed to measure coping patterns of behavior and their relatedness to religiosity, loneliness, and reported well-being. ^ Individual attempts to cope with divorce were reflected in intrapersonal and interpersonal perceptions expressed on the Family Coping Inventory (FCI). The FCI {{was one of four}} instruments used to gather data volunteered by 293 legally divorced individuals in the United States. A second instrument, the religiosity scale, measured individualistic reports of religious belief, activity, and practices. The religiosity scale was a self-reporting instrument comprised of closed and open-ended questions. The third instrument utilized was a loneliness scale that attempted to evaluate the individual 2 ̆ 7 s perceived degree of loneliness. The fourth instrument was a well-being scale designed to solicit the <b>divorced</b> <b>person</b> 2 ̆ 7 s feelings relative to life satisfaction. ^ The expressed behaviors measured by the FCI clearly demonstrated that coping with divorce is a personal experience influenced by peers, family, beliefs, and the environment. Essentially the coping patterns of divorced individuals describe a subjective selection of behaviors that the individual perceives to be adjustment oriented and stress reducing. ^ Five coping patterns were determined to be descriptive of the 91 behavior choices that individuals rated on a scale from helpful to not helpful. The five coping patterns reflect attempts at; (1) maintaining family stability and integrity, (2) developing interpersonal relationships and social support, (3) managing psychological tension and strain, (4) maintaining an optimistic definition of the situation, and (5) developing self-reliance and self-esteem. ^ A later re-evaluation of the five coping patterns revealed that individuals express behaviors that focus upon family interests, social and religious activities, expressing personal feelings, and developing self-esteem. ^ The hypothesized relationships were tested by using the Pearson Product-moment Correlation and the results are as follows: (1) Analysis of the hypothesis relating coping behavior patterns and religiosity revealed that Coping Patterns I, II, and IV were negatively significant at the. 05 level. (2) Analysis of the hypothesized relationship between coping behavior patterns and reported loneliness revealed that Coping Patterns II and III were negatively significant at the. 05 level of confidence.
