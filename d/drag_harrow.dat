50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: disc harrows, tine harrows (including spring-tooth <b>harrows,</b> <b>drag</b> <b>harrows,</b> and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of the agriculturalrly cultivated ground in Beskydy and Podbeskydí is formed by permanent grasslands, which are located in less favoured areas (LFA), often in high slopes. The aim of this thesis was to describe the grazing development in the Beskydy area, the methods and procedures of grasslands maintenance and also the characteristics of pasture growth and to describe subsidy titles in grassland management in LFA. Grazing is a classic instrument in grassland management. In was spread in Beskydy between in 15 th and 16 th century by the migration of herders from Romania. Cattle breeding spread between 18 th - 19 th. Nowadays mostly extensive grazing is implemen-ted in Beskydy. Meadows and pastures in Beskydy have rich flora often protected by law. Restoration or regeneration of vegetation, fertilazing and liming may be applied where it is possible. In spring pastures and meadows are <b>dragging.</b> <b>Harrowing</b> and rol-ling are less frequent...|$|R
50|$|A <b>drag</b> <b>harrow</b> is used {{to loosen}} and even out soil {{after it has been}} plowed and packed. It pulls up large rocks which may then be picked up {{manually}} and put in the tractor's stone box to remove from the field. The <b>drag</b> <b>harrow</b> also kills some weeds that may be present, but it is not very efficient in doing so due to its highly flexible teeth, hence it is not one of its primary functions.|$|E
5000|$|Drag harrows {{can be a}} name {{used for}} several {{different}} types of equipment. A spike tooth harrow or flex harrow is often called a <b>drag</b> <b>harrow</b> and is in use extensively throughout the US for seedbed preparation and for grooming grassland pastures. See also: ...|$|E
50|$|A spring-tooth harrow, {{sometimes}} called a <b>drag</b> <b>harrow,</b> {{is a type}} of harrow, and specifically a type of tine harrow. It is a largely outdated piece of farm equipment. It uses many flexible iron teeth mounted in rows to loosen the soil before planting. It is set in the ground and raised manually and cannot be backed up; this is why it has been replaced by more modern equipment such as the chisel plow and field cultivator.|$|E
25|$|Secrecy was an {{essential}} part, {{as it had}} been at the Battle of Beersheba the preceding year. It was feared that the Ottomans could thwart the preparations for the attack by making a withdrawal in the coastal sector. Laborious efforts were therefore made to prevent the Ottomans discerning Allenby's intentions and to persuade them that the next Entente attack would be made in the Jordan Valley. All westward movements of personnel and vehicles from the Jordan Valley towards the Mediterranean coast were made during the night while all movements eastwards were made during daytime. The detached Anzac Mounted Division in the Jordan Valley simulated the activity of the entire mounted corps. Troops marched openly down to the valley by day, and were secretly taken back by lorry at night to repeat the process the next day. Vehicles or mules <b>dragged</b> <b>harrows</b> along tracks to raise dust clouds, simulating other troop movements. Dummy camps and horse lines were constructed and a hotel in Jerusalem was ostentatiously commandeered for an Expeditionary Force headquarters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1856 by Arthur Wallis and Charles Haslam in newly built {{premises}} which they named The North Hants Ironworks. The works were sited on Station Hill in Basingstoke and the company began trading as Wallis & Haslam. Shortly afterwards the company was highly commended for its hand-worked bench drilling machine at the 1857 Royal Agricultural show in Salisbury. Even at this early stage, the company was producing {{a wide variety of}} agricultural equipment, and alongside the bench drill were corn drills, turnip drills, four types of horse hoe, <b>drag</b> <b>harrows,</b> a 3 hp threshing machine, a barley hummeller and sundry other devices. In 1862 a third partner, Charles James Steevens, joined the company and when Charles Haslam retired in 1869 the company became Wallis & Steevens.The date of production for the company's first Portable steam engine is not known although the earliest surviving drawing is dated 1866. The first traction engine, an 8 hp single, was built in 1877 from drawings by Arthur Herbert Wallis (son of the company founder) and this vehicle made its trial run on 21 June that year. The vehicle, named [...] "Success" [...] on the strength of its performance during the test, was given the works number T250.|$|R
50|$|Hand sowing or (planting) is {{the process}} of casting handfuls of seed over {{prepared}} ground, or broadcasting (from which the technological term is derived). Usually, a <b>drag</b> or <b>harrow</b> is employed to incorporate the seed into the soil. Though labor-intensive for any but small areas, this method is still used in some situations. Practice is required to sow evenly and at the desired rate. A hand seeder can be used for sowing, though it is less of a help than it is for the smaller seeds of grasses and legumes.|$|R
50|$|A <b>drag</b> <b>harrow,</b> {{a type of}} spring-tooth harrow, is {{a largely}} {{outdated}} type of soil cultivation implement {{that is used to}} smooth the ground as well as loosen it after it has been plowed and packed. It uses many flexible iron teeth usually arranged into three rows. It has no hydraulic functionality and has to be raised/adjusted with one or multiple manual levers. It is a largely outdated piece of farm equipment, having been replaced by more modern disc harrows and hydraulically operated field cultivators.|$|E
50|$|The <b>drag</b> <b>harrow</b> is {{not often}} used in modern farming as other harrows {{have proven to be}} more suitable, such as the disc harrow. Another reason they are not often used is because they cannot be {{controlled}} hydraulically, meaning that the operator is required to dismount from the tractor to adjust it or unclog it. However it is used as a drag behind several other implements such as a rod weeder. Due to their low cost and simplicity, drag harrows are still used widely by small farmers.|$|E

50|$|Puddling is the tillage of {{rice paddies}} while flooded, an ancient {{practice}} {{that is used}} to prepare for rice cultivation. Historically, this has been accomplished by <b>dragging</b> a weighted <b>harrow</b> across a flooded paddy field behind a buffalo or ox, and is now accomplished using mechanized approaches, often using a walking tractor.|$|R

5000|$|Not {{only did}} hurricanes destroy the settlements, but {{engineers}} started working early {{to try to}} improve entry at the river mouth.

[...] The main ship passage is again in the Southwest Pass.|$|R
60|$|I had the honour {{of writing}} to your Lordship from Lucerne, 19th of August, giving {{an account of}} our movements. We have visited, since, those parts of Switzerland usually deemed most worthy of notice, and the Italian lakes, having stopped four days at Milan, and as many at Geneva. With the {{exception}} of a couple of days on the Lake of Geneva, the weather has been most favourable, though frequently during the last fortnight extremely cold. We have had no detention from illness, nor any bad accident, for which we feel more grateful, on account of some of our fellow travellers, who accidentally joined us for a few days. Of these, one, an American gentleman, was drowned in the Lake of Zurich, by the upsetting of a boat in a storm, two or three days after he parted with us; and two others, near the summit of Mount Jura, {{and in the middle of}} a tempestuous night, were precipitated, they scarcely knew how far, along with one of those frightful and ponderous vehicles, a continental diligence. We have been in Paris since Sunday last, and think of staying about a fortnight longer, as scarcely less will suffice for even a hasty view of the town and neighbourhood. We took Fontainebleau in our way, and intend giving a day to Versailles. The day we entered Paris we passed a well-drest young man and woman, <b>dragging</b> a <b>harrow</b> through a field, like cattle; nevertheless, working in the fields on the sabbath day does not appear to be general in France. On the same day a wretched-looking person begged of us, as the carriage was climbing a hill. Nothing could exceed his transport in receiving a pair of old pantaloons which were handed out of the carriage. This poor mendicant, the postilion told us, was an ancien Curé. The churches seem generally falling into decay in the country. We passed one which had been recently repaired. I have noticed, however, several young persons, men as well as women, earnestly employed in their devotions, in different churches, both in Paris and elsewhere. Nothing which I have seen in this city has interested me at all like the Jardin des Plantes, with the living animals, and the Museum of Natural History which it includes. Scarcely could I refrain from tears of admiration at the sight of this apparently boundless exhibition of the wonders of the creation. The statues and pictures of the Louvre affect me feebly in comparison. The exterior of Paris is much changed since I last visited it in 1792. I miss many ancient buildings, particularly the Temple, where the poor king and his family were so long confined. That memorable spot, where the Jacobin Club was held, has also disappeared. Nor are the additional buildings always improvements; the Pont des Arts, in particular, injures the view from the Pont Neuf greatly; but in these things public convenience is the main point.|$|R
