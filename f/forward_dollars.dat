40|$|This paper applies a {{relatively}} new but generalised concept of fractional cointegration to {{shed some light on}} the validity of a long-run relationship between high frequency daily spot and the lagged <b>forward</b> Australian-US <b>dollar</b> exchange rate. An investigation of the stochastic properties of these rates reveals that, while the relationship is not cointegrated in their logs, they appear to be fractionally cointegrated if we allow for mean reverting processes that are "CI"(1, "d") with 0 >"d"> 1. The paper demonstrates that relaxing the condition that the residual from the cointegration equation must be a "I"(0) process, captures a much wider class of mean-reversion behaviour. This result is interpreted {{in the context of the}} speculative EMH between the spot and forward exchanges rates, as having some empirical support. Furthermore, an analysis of the short-run dynamics propelling the long-run relationship tends to imply that in both the short- and long-term, the forward rate is led by the spot rate. In the longer term, the spot rate is found to be the initial receptor of any exogenous shock to the equilibrium and it is the forward exchange rate that bears the brunt of short-run adjustment to re-establish the long-run equilibrium relationship. The approach illustrated in this paper is shown to hold enormous potential for tests of mean reversion involving hypotheses popular to financial econometrics in general, where the dynamics of high frequency data are under scrutiny.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{applies the}} seminonparametric {{nonlinear}} impulse response analysis proposed by Gallant, Rossi and Tauchen to weekly spot and <b>forward</b> Swiss franc/US <b>dollar</b> exchange rate. Five empirical regularities are found: (i) symmetric mean and volatility reaction {{pattern of the}} spot rate to pure spot shocks; (ii) symmetric mean, but asymmetric volatility responses of the forward rate to pure forward premium shocks; (iii) weak feedback from the forward to the spot rates; (iv) a forward premium shock triggers off a four-week cyclical impulse response, which is transmitted to a similar response cycle of the spot rate; (v) the volatility responses are neither monotone nor highly persistent as reported by numerous applications of ARCH models. Our finding offers a strong empirical support to the exchange rate model suggested recently by McCallum in which the monetary policy authorities systematically manage interest rate differentials so as to resist changes in exchange rates but also to smooth interest-rate movements. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} intervention on the level and volatility of the exchange rate in Mexico and Turkey, two emerging countries that have floating exchange rate regimes. The paper finds mixed evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} intervention. In Mexico, foreign exchange sales have a small impact on the exchange rate level and raise short-term volatility, while in Turkey, intervention does not appear to affect the exchange rate level but reduces its shortterm volatility. In both cases, the findings are consistent with officially stated policy objectives, which aim to minimize the effect of intervention on the exchange rate, but cast doubt on claims that intervention is a useful tool for smoothing volatility. Although these findings cannot be generalized to other emerging markets, intervention''s apparently limited effectiveness highlights the need for central banks to use their scarce foreign reserves selectively and parsimoniously.

40|$|Forward {{exchange}} rates convey {{information about the}} risk premiums of the currency exposures of the investors. The extraction of these risk premiums provides market information for the expected future values of a currency, which may be useful for policymakers in their market surveillance and monitoring. This study utilises a state-space model and the Kalman-filtering technique to estimate risk premiums of Hong Kong <b>dollar</b> from the <b>forward</b> exchange market from 1996 to 2005. The estimated risk premiums of the 12 -month forward contract were as high as 3. 4 % of the spot exchange rate during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. The study also finds that the risk premiums have reverted from a discount in late 2004 to close to zero in mid- 2005, reflecting that the appreciation pressure on the Hong Kong dollar along with the speculation on the revaluation of the renminbi in early 2005 has subsided after {{the introduction of the}} three refinements to the operation of the Linked Exchange Rate system in May 2005 and the reform of the renminbi exchange rate regime in July 2005. The forward {{exchange rates}}, after taking the estimated risk premiums into account, do not have a good forecasting capability for the future spot exchange rates. Between the two financial factors that drive the risk premiums in the Hong Kong <b>dollar</b> <b>forward</b> rates, the renminbi non-deliverable forward rates appear to have a larger impact than the Aggregate Balance of the banking system. Nonetheless, both factors are important for monitoring the risk premiums of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. ...|$|R
40|$|I. 1 Motivation Exchange {{rates are}} a key issue in {{international}} economics and politics. While the determinants of exchange rates have been extensively studied in previous works, this dissertation {{contributes to the literature}} by deriving exchange rate expectations from stock market (ADR) data and analyzing their determinants. This exercise is done for three cases where one has to resort to exchange rate expectations since the national exchange rate is either manipulated by the central bank (the first paper in Chapter II), fixed in pegged exchange rate regimes (the second paper in Chapter III), or not existent as the considered country is part of a currency union and therefore has no national currency (the third paper in Chapter IV). The first paper presented in Chapter II analyzes exchange rate expectations for the case of China in the period 1998 - 2009 in order to test standard exchange rate theories. American officials repeatedly accused China of systematically undervaluing its currency against the U. S. dollar, which produces political tensions between both countries. A recent climax in this dispute was reached on September 28, 2010, when the House of Representatives passed the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, which would allow the imposition of import duties for countries with undervalued currencies, namely China. Although this bill did not pass the Senate, Chinese officials clearly opposed the bill arguing against significant undervaluation of the yuan and in favor of political opportunism of U. S. officials. As the assessments of a fair exchange rate significantly differ among officials of both countries, the Chinese-American exchange rate dispute continues. Measuring the development of market determined exchange rate expectations may help to find a compromise in this international political dispute and knowing the determinants of these expectations may help to identify macroeconomic policies necessary to influence future exchange rates. The second paper presented in Chapter III investigates the development of exchange rate expectations and their determinants for the currency crisis episodes in Argentina (2001 - 2002), Malaysia (1998 - 1999), and Venezuela (1994 - 1996 and 2003 - 2007). Large devaluations of Southeast Asian and Latin American currencies were to be observed during the currency crises in the 1990 ’s and {{at the beginning of the}} last decade. Due to an appreciation of foreign currency denominated debt, capital withdrawals, and bank runs, for example, currency crises typically lead to significant output losses in the affected economies (Hutchison and Noy, 2002). Avoiding currency crisis outbreaks has therefore become one of the major policy goals in many developing countries, which may explain the rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves aimed to fend off speculative attacks in these countries. The costs of this currency crisis prevention policy are however often overseen. Since foreign exchange reserves are typically invested in U. S. Treasuries, they yield a relatively low return compared to the high cost of domestic capital in these countries. Moreover, foreign exchange reserves may lose in value as the domestic currency appreciates against the U. S. dollar (Rodrik, 2006). An alternative way to avoid the outbreak of currency crises may be to regularly adjust the official exchange rate (typically managed by the domestic central bank) to levels in line with market expectations. Knowing market-based exchange rate expectations and their determinants may therefore be a cheaper way to avoid currency crises than holding excess amounts of foreign exchange reserves. The third paper presented in Chapter IV uses daily ADR data to analyze the determinants of the risk of withdrawals from the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) for the five vulnerable member countries Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain for the period 2007 - 2009. The subprime lending crisis has triggered significant financial turmoil in the EMU. Banking systems were destabilized and the governments of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal had to be bailed out. Reasserting national authority over monetary policy may help domestic policymakers to address the problems caused by banking and sovereign debt crises or an overvalued euro at national discretion. While the abandonment of fixed exchange rate regimes has so far been analyzed for countries with national currencies, the financial vulnerabilities in the EMU offer a new case to study the possibility of withdrawals from a monetary union. Although a country’s membership in the EMU is typically considered irreversible, many authors agree that sovereign states can choose to leave the EMU (Cohen, 1993; Scott, 1998; Buiter, 1999; Eichengreen, 2007). The new Treaty of Lisbon now includes a provision outlining voluntary withdrawal from the Union, which may cause the members to re-think the pros and cons of remaining in the EMU. Although the European Central Bank (ECB) has implemented measures meant to support the banking sectors and governments in the EMU, autonomous national central banks would probably pursue more expansionary monetary policies. By analyzing the determinants of exchange rate expectations in the monetary union one may therefore analyze the drivers of the risk of withdrawal from the EMU. I. 2 Deriving exchange rate expectations from prices of American Depositary Receipts Measuring movements in exchange rate expectations is a relatively easy task for currencies in which a liquid and free forward exchange market exists. For the cases considered in this dissertation, however, the forward exchange market either produces bad forecasts or does not even exist. For the case of China, the yuan/U. S. <b>dollar</b> <b>forward</b> exchange rate is most likely managed by the Chinese central bank in the course of its foreign exchange market intervention policies, which hampers its ability to provide good signals for the future spot market exchange rate (see, for example, Wang, 2010). For the considered member countries of the EMU, no national currencies exist and consequently forward exchange rates cannot be used. For the case of the currency crisis episodes studied in this dissertation, one could use regression-based forecasting models that employ data on macroeconomic variables in order to produce currency crisis signals (see, among others, Eichengreen et al., 1995; Frankel and Rose, 1996; Kaminsky et al., 1998; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; Karmann et al., 2002). The drawback of these approaches is the nature of macroeconomic data used, which enables one to create only monthly or quarterly crisis signals based on backward-looking data. In this dissertation I use stock market data to derive exchange rate expectations, which has several advantages compared to existing approaches. First of all, the prices of the considered stocks are most probably not manipulated by central bank interventions since these stocks are traded in the United States, which enables the derivation of exchange rate expectations formed under free market conditions (also for China). The used stock market data is available for the considered EMU member countries, which facilitates the analysis of the risk of withdrawals from the EMU. Moreover, stock market data is forward-looking and available on a daily basis, which enables the derivation of more accurate and up-to-date currency crisis signals for the considered crisis episodes. In order to derive exchange rate expectations I use data on a particular type of stock called American Depositary Receipt (ADR). An ADR is a financial instrument for foreign companies to list their shares at stock exchanges in the Unites States. An ADR represents the ownership of a specific number of underlying shares of a company in the home market on which the ADR is written. While the underlying stock is denominated in the currency and traded at the stock exchange of the home market, the ADR is denominated in U. S. dollars and traded at a U. S. stock exchange. Since both types of stocks of the same company generate identical cash flows and incorporate equivalent rights and dividend claims, cross-border arbitrage implies that the ADR and its underlying stock have the same price when adjusted for the current exchange rate. When capital controls or ownership restrictions are implemented, cross-border arbitrage is not possible and the law of one price is not binding. In such an environment, information efficiency suggests that the relative prices of ADRs and their underlying stocks – which only differ with respect to the currency they are denominated in – will signal exchange rate expectations of stock market investors. Using data on relative prices (or returns) of ADRs and their underlying stocks and the current exchange rate I can calculate measures for exchange rate expectations of stock market investors. Although the papers presented in this dissertation differ with respect to the considered companies, countries, and time periods, each paper uses the same kind of data and a similar methodology to derive exchange rate expectations – relative prices or returns of ADRs and their corresponding underlying stocks. In each paper I use a panel regression framework in order to analyze the determinants of exchange rate expectations. Each of the included papers focuses on a distinct facet of exchange rate expectations. The first paper focuses on standard exchange rate theories such as the relative purchasing power parity or the uncovered interest rate parity in order to analyze the factors that drive exchange rate expectations in general. The second paper studies the determinants of currency crisis expectations. The third paper analyzes the determinants of the risk of withdrawals from the EMU as expected by ADR market investors. I. 3 Contribution to the literature This dissertation adds to two strands of the literature. First, it contributes to a literature that studies the determinants of exchange rates,|$|R
