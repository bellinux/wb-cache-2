In {{the design of}} bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such mixtures, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, {{in which case the}} feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using response surface methodology, and then a local maximum can be computed using a nonlinear programming method, such as sequential quadratic programming.|$|E

Molly Maguireism and full-fledged trade unionism represented fundamentally different modes of organization and protest. Kenny noted that one contemporary organization, the Pennsylvania Bureau of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Statistics,</b> clearly distinguished between the union and the violence attributed to the Molly Maguires. Their reports indicate that violence could {{be traced to the}} time of the Civil War, but that in the five-year existence of the WBA, [...] "the relations existing between employers and employees" [...] had greatly improved. The Bureau concluded that the union had brought an end to the [...] "carnival of crime". Kenny notes the leaders of the WBA were [...] "always unequivocally opposed" [...] to the Molly Maguires.|$|E
