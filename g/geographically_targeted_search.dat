MTES is able to detect the closed directions around the agent and determines the estimated best direction to capture a moving target avoiding the obstacles nearby. We have also developed a new prey algorithm (Prey-A*) to test the existing and our predator algorithms in our experiments.

40|$|The <b>Targeted</b> <b>Search</b> Element (TSE) {{performs}} {{one of two}} complimentary search {{strategies of}} the NASA-SETI Microwave Observing Project (MOP) : the <b>targeted</b> <b>search.</b> The principle objective of the <b>targeted</b> <b>search</b> strategy is to scan the microwave window between the frequencies of one and three gigahertz for narrowband microwave emissions eminating {{from the direction of}} 773 specifically targeted stars. The scanning process is accomplished at a minimum resolution of one or two Hertz at very high sensitivity. Detectable signals will be of a continuous wave or pulsed form and may also drift in frequency. The TSE will possess extensive radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation and verification capability as the majority of signals detected by the TSE will be of local origin. Any signal passing through RFI classification and classifiable as an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) candidate will be further validated at non-MOP observatories using established protocol. The <b>targeted</b> <b>search</b> will be conducted using the capability provided by the TSE. The TSE provides six <b>Targeted</b> <b>Search</b> Systems (TSS) which independently or cooperatively perform automated collection, analysis, storage, and archive of signal data. Data is collected in 10 megahertz chunks and signal processing is performed at a rate of 160 megabits per second. Signal data is obtained utilizing the largest radio telescopes available for the <b>Targeted</b> <b>Search</b> such as those at Arecibo and Nancay or at the dedicated NASA-SETI facility.

The social experiment we use was carried out to evaluate a <b>geographically</b> <b>targeted</b> conditional cash transfer antipoverty program in Nicaragua. The outcomes we assess include several components of household expenditure and a variety of children's health outcomes, including breast-feeding, vaccinations, and morbidity. We find that using each of the following improves performance of matching for these outcomes: (1) geographically proximate comparison samples, (2) stringent common support requirements, and (3) both geographic- and household-level matching variables. Even for a <b>geographically</b> <b>targeted</b> program, in which the selection is at the geographic, rather than at the individual or household level, and in which {{it is not possible to}} find comparison individuals or households in the program locales, matching can perform reasonably well. The results also suggest that the techniques may be more promising for evaluating the more easily measured individual-level binary outcomes than for outcomes that are more difficult to measure, such as expenditure.

40|$|Abstract- Persistent {{surveillance}} and reconnaissance tasks in mobile cooperative sensor networks {{are key to}} constructing recognized domain pictures over a variety of civilian and military problem instances. However, efficient information gathering for a task such as <b>target</b> <b>search</b> {{by a team of}} autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) still remains a major challenge to achieve system-wide performance objective. Given problem complexity, most proposed distributed <b>target</b> <b>search</b> solutions so far consider simplifying assumptions such as predetermined path planning coordination strategy with implicit communication and ad hoc heuristics, and severely constrained resources. In this paper, we extend previous work reported on multi-UAV <b>target</b> <b>search</b> by learning resource-bounded multi-agent coordination, involving explicit action control coordination. The approach first relies on a new information-theoretic co-evolutionary algorithm to solve cooperative search path planning over receding horizons, providing agents with mutually adaptive and self-organizing behavior. The anytime algorithm is coupled to an extended information-sharing policy to periodically exchange world-state information and projected agent intents.
