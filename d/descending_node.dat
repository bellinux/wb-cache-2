5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or <b>descending</b> <b>node</b> {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|The Moon crosses {{from south}} to {{north of the}} {{ecliptic}} at its ascending node, and vice versa at its <b>descending</b> <b>node.</b> However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion, due to {{the action of the}} Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.|$|E

However, the {{ascending}} node (December transits) of the orbit of Venus moves backwards after each 243 years so the transit of 2854 is the last member of series #3 instead of series #1. The <b>descending</b> <b>node</b> (June transits) moves forwards, so the transit of 3705 is the last member of #2.|$|E

5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or <b>descending</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eclipses only {{occur in}} the eclipse season, when the Sun is close to either the {{ascending}} or <b>descending</b> <b>node</b> of the Moon. Each eclipse is separated by one, five or six lunations (synodic months), and the midpoint of each season is separated by 173.3 days, which is the mean time for the Sun to travel from one node to the next. The period is {{a little less than}} half a calendar year because the lunar nodes slowly regress. Because 223 synodic months is roughly equal to 239 anomalistic months and 242 draconic months, eclipses with similar geometry recur 223 synodic months (about 6,585.3 days) apart. This period (18 years 11.3 days) is a saros. Because 223 synodic months is not identical to 239 anomalistic months or 242 draconic months, saros cycles do not endlessly repeat. Each cycle begins with the Moon's shadow crossing the earth near the north or south pole, and subsequent events progress toward the other pole until the Moon's shadow misses the earth and the series ends. Saros cycles are numbered; currently, cycles 117 to 156 are active. The next solar eclipse will occur on February 15, 2018. It will be a partial solar eclipse visible from Antarctica and south South America.|$|E
25|$|Saros {{series are}} {{numbered}} {{according to the}} type of eclipse (solar or lunar) and whether they occur at the Moon's ascending or <b>descending</b> <b>node.</b> Odd numbers are used for solar eclipses occurring near the ascending node, whereas even numbers are given to <b>descending</b> <b>node</b> solar eclipses. For lunar eclipses, this numbering scheme is somewhat random. The ordering of these series is determined by the time at which each series peaks, which corresponds to when an eclipse is closest to one of the lunar nodes. For solar eclipses, the 40 series numbered between 117 and 156 are active, whereas for lunar eclipses, there are now 41 active saros series.|$|E

25|$|Also {{important}} in astrology are the moon's nodes. The nodes are where the moon's path crosses the ecliptic.

While Lunar nodes are not considered by Western astrologers to be as important a factor as each of the planets, they are thought to mark sensitive areas that are worth taking into account.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of a single saros series, this table gives the dates of some of the 72 lunar eclipses for saros series 138. This eclipse series began in AD 1427 with a partial eclipse at the {{southern}} edge of the Earth's shadow when the Moon was close to its <b>descending</b> <b>node.</b> In each successive saros, the Moon's orbital path is shifted northward with respect to the Earth's shadow, with the first total eclipse occurring in 1950. For the following 252 years, total eclipses occur, with the central eclipse in 2078. The first partial eclipse after this will occur in the year 2220, and the final partial eclipse of the series will occur in 2707. The total lifetime of lunar saros series 138 is 1280 years.|$|E

However, in order to compute an accurate estimate of coseismic deformation, multiple interferograms are required. Unfortunately, ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometric analysis using PALSAR- 2 was only possible (available) for <b>descending</b> <b>nodes</b> for this earthquake.

25|$|Transits of Earth from Mars usually {{occur in}} pairs, with one {{following}} the other after 79 years; rarely, {{there are three}} in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its ascending node are in May, those at <b>descending</b> <b>node</b> happen in November.

25|$|Each saros series {{starts with}} a partial eclipse (Sun first enters {{the end of the}} node), and each {{successive}} saros the path of the Moon is shifted either northward (when near the <b>descending</b> <b>node)</b> or southward (when near the ascending node) {{due to the fact that}} the saros is not an exact integer of draconic months (about one hour short). At some point, eclipses are no longer possible and the series terminates (Sun leaves the beginning of the node). Arbitrary dates were established by compilers of eclipse statistics. These extreme dates are 2000 BCE and 3000 CE. Saros series, of course, went on before and will continue after these dates. Since the first eclipse of 2000 BCE was not the first in its saros, it is necessary to extend the saros series numbers backwards beyond 0 to negative numbers to accommodate eclipses occurring in the years following 2000 BCE. The saros -13 is the first saros to appear in these data. For solar eclipses the statistics for the complete saros series within the era between 2000 BCE and 3000 CE are given in this article's references. It takes between 1226 and 1550 years for the members of a saros series to traverse the Earth's surface from north to south (or vice versa). These extremes allow from 69 to 87 eclipses in each series (most series have 71 or 72 eclipses). From 39 to 59 (mostly about 43) eclipses in a given series will be central (that is, total, annular, or hybrid annular-total). At any given time, approximately 40 different saros series will be in progress.|$|E

The [...] "seasons" [...] on the moon fit into this period. For about half of this draconic year, the sun is north of the lunar equator (but at most 1.543°), and for the other half it is south of the lunar equator.

[...] "Up" [...] here means that the centre of the sun is above the horizon. The sunrise and sunset at the poles each take about 18 days. These polar sunrises and sunsets occur around the time of eclipses (solar or lunar). For example, at the Solar eclipse of March 9, 2016, the moon was near its <b>descending</b> <b>node,</b> and the sun was near the point in the sky where the equator of the moon crosses the ecliptic.

Three periodicities related to lunar orbit, the synodic month, the draconic month, and the anomalistic month coincide almost perfectly each saros cycle. For an eclipse to occur, either the Moon must be located between the Earth and Sun (for a solar eclipse) or the Earth must be located between the Sun and Moon (for a lunar eclipse). This can happen only when the Moon is new or full, respectively, and repeat occurrences of these lunar phases result from solar and lunar orbits producing the Moon's synodic period of 29.53059 days. During most full and new moons, however, {{the shadow of the}} Earth or Moon falls to the north or south of the other body. Eclipses occur when the three bodies form a nearly straight line. [...] Because the plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to that of the earth, this condition occurs only when a full or new Moon is near or in the ecliptic plane, that is when the moon is at one of the two nodes (the ascending or <b>descending</b> <b>node).</b> The period of time for two successive lunar passes through the ecliptic plane (returning to the same node) is termed the draconic month, a 27.21222 day period. [...] The three-dimensional geometry of an eclipse, when the new or full moon is near one of the nodes, occurs every 5 or 6 months when the Sun is in conjunction or opposition to the Moon and coincidentally also near a node of the Moon's orbit at that time, or twice per eclipse year. Two Saros eclipses have the same appearance and duration due to the distance between the Earth and Moon being nearly the same for each event because the Saros eclipse cycle is also an integer of the anomalistic month, the period of the eccentricity of lunar orbit, 27.5545 days.|$|E
