40|$|The {{effects of}} hepatic microsomal enzyme {{inducing}} (phenobarbitone and <b>flumecinol),</b> and inhibiting (cimetidine) drugs, and placebo treatment on insulin mediated glucose metabolism (M) were investigated in 29 healthy volunteers. Phenobarbitone (50 mg for 10 days) increased M (30 %), metabolic clearance rate of glucose (MCRg), and antipyrine clearance rate (33 %). Fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI) decreased while {{fasting blood glucose}} (BG) remained unaltered. <b>Flumecinol,</b> another inducer, tested in two doses (200 mg and 600 mg for 6 days), did not alter glucose or antipyrine metabolism. Fasting IRI reduced on treatment with 600 mg of <b>flumecinol,</b> {{but not with the}} smaller dose. Cimetidine (600 mg for 6 days) decreased M (19. 5 %), MCRg (26 %), and antipyrine clearance rate (20 %). The placebo did not alter glucose or antipyrine metabolism. The results indicate that the insulin mediated glucose disposal rate can be altered by drugs influencing hepatic microsomal enzyme activity...|$|E
