Twenty-two seconds after the lights went off, the emergency generator jumped in and restored the runway lights. The pilot elected to remain VFR under an altitude of 240 m. At 18:43, the crew asked for permission to land while positioning for another approach. However, because another aircraft, a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747, was about to take off, air traffic control ordered the crew of Flight 345 to fly an <b>extended</b> <b>downwind</b> leg.

50|$|These dunes {{often occur}} in {{semiarid}} {{areas where the}} precipitation is retained in the lower parts of the dune and underlying soils. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as {{the main source of}} parabolic dune stability. The vegetation that covers them—grasses, shrubs, and trees—help anchor the trailing arms. In inland deserts, parabolic dunes commonly originate and <b>extend</b> <b>downwind</b> from blowouts in sand sheets only partly anchored by vegetation. They can also originate from beach sands and extend inland into vegetated areas in coastal zones and on shores of large lakes.|$|R

H 2 v = 1 - 0 S(1) images are compared with high-quality optical [S II] λλ 6716, 6731, Hα, and I-band images; {{we find that}} H 2 line emission "envelopes" the HH 32 A bow shock, <b>extending</b> <b>downwind</b> beyond its western edge. The H 2 v = 1 - 0 S(1) line profiles in HH 32 are all single peaked and Gaussian or triangular in shape. The lines are rather narrow, typically 20 - 30 km s- 1 (including instrumental smoothing), with peaks that are redshifted by ∼ 8 - 25 km s- 1 relative to the source radial velocity. Although the H 2 data infer low velocities, we nevertheless find that the data {{are consistent with the}} high-velocity bow shock models (V ∼ 300 - 350 km s- 1; 0 ∼ 15 °- 30 ° to the line of sight) used to interpret earlier optical data. We also report the discovery of three new Herbig-Haro objects. Designated HH 332, these features are evident only in our [S II] and Hα images and not in our I-band image (they are not detected in H 2). They are therefore regarded as bona fide HH objects associated with a previously unknown outflow...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{weathering}} and aeolian processes a fine-grained dark material {{can be found on}} both Martian hemispheres. It is characterized by a much lower albedo than the surrounding terrain and accumulates in patches and dune fields. Analysis of near infrared spectra from the OMEGA spectrometer yields a higher content of mafic unoxidized minerals such as high and low Ca-pyroxenes and olivine. On impact crater floors, the material is frequently accumulated into barchan or transverse dune fields. HRSC data show that the material is blown into and out of craters, indicating that such depressions can act as traps or as sources. In some cases, dark layers in crater walls with dark streaks running down slope seem to be an additional supply for the dark material. We measured the dune volume using HRSC-DTMs and estimated the total amount of material inside the craters to verify the proportion of the dark layers as a source mechanism for the material inside. So far, no significant relation between crater degradation stage and dune volume could be recognized. Dark streaks <b>extending</b> <b>downwind</b> from the dune on to the surrounding terrain indicate an unconsolidated characteristic of the material and erosion by aeolian scour. However, not every dune suggests a grain release. This poses the question regarding the ages of active dunes, in which some could be "paleo" features. A comparison of modeled wind fields with the morphology related to wind direction suggests that both wind directions do not coincide in every case. For more detailed information concerning the surface properties, we analyzed the night-time brightness temperatures (from THEMIS data) and the thermal inertia (from TES data) of the dune surfaces. If the dune surfaces have warmer brightness temperatures at night with respect to the surrounding, it can be supposed that the surface is consolidated. The dune fields studied show significant differences in night-time brightness temperatures and thermal inertia due to varieties in the physical structure and the grain size of the surface material. The results show that some dune surfaces consist of unconsolidated sandy material that is recently eroded and moved. These dunes are inferred to be active. We assume that dunes with high thermal inertia values, high night-time brightness temperatures and the absence of interaction with the current blowing wind have consolidated surfaces consisting of cemented particles...|$|R

However, the dynamics and potential range of barchan morphologies emerging under each specific scenario that leads to dune asymmetry are far from being understood. In the present work, we use dune modeling in order to investigate the formation and evolution of asymmetric barchans.

40|$|A {{technique}} for nowcasting turbulent mountain waves over the Front Range {{of the state}} of Colorado is investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) water vapor (6. 7 �m) channel imagery. Pilot reports of turbulence were examined to determine the probability of turbulence occurring when wave features were observed in the satellite imagery. Analysis of MODIS water vapor imagery indicated that mountain wave signatures were present for approximately 25 % of the days during 2004. Approximately 75 % of the severely turbulent days, as indicated by pilot reports, had wave signatures in the water vapor imagery. The wave signatures on the severely turbulent days had different characteristics in the imagery than the signatures on days that were less turbulent. The reports of severe turbulence were associated with complex patterns, the appearance of interference, or crossing wave fronts that <b>extended</b> <b>downwind</b> from the mountain ridge for a significant distance. The days that were less turbulent, as reported by pilots, had wave signatures with a simpler pattern, such as linear features orthogonal to the wind flow oriented parallel to one another. 1...|$|E
40|$|Mountain, or lee waves {{originate}} when {{air flows}} over mountain ridges within a stably stratified atmosphere. Turbulence generated by mountain waves {{can be an}} aviation hazard due to strong vertical motions generated by small scale vorticity maxima in large scale atmospheric rotors (Doyle, 2002). Satellite water vapor imagery has indicated the presence of wave structures over and downwind of mountain ranges for many years. Research has been conducted to categorize the wave structure by using frequency of pilot turbulence reports, often occurring within a cloud-free atmosphere (Uhlenbrock et al., 2007). The reports of severe turbulence were associated with complex water vapor patterns, the appearance of interference or crossing wave fronts that <b>extended</b> <b>downwind</b> from the mountain ridge for a significant distance. The events that were less turbulent, as reported by pilots, had wave signatures with simpler patterns such as straight/parallel features orthogonal to the wind flow.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in fossil fuel CO 2 (FFCO 2) emission inventories enable sensitivity tests of simulated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations to sub-annual variations in FFCO 2 emissions {{and what this}} implies for the interpretation of observed CO 2. Six experiments are conducted to investigate {{the potential impact of}} three cycles of FFCO 2 emission variability (diurnal, weekly and monthly) using a global tracer transport model. Results show an annual FFCO 2 rectification varying from − 1. 35 to + 0. 13 ppm from the combination of all three cycles. This rectification is driven by a large negative diurnal FFCO 2 rectification due to the covariation of diurnal FFCO 2 emissions and diurnal vertical mixing, as well as a smaller positive seasonal FFCO 2 rectification driven by the covariation of monthly FFCO 2 emissions and monthly atmospheric transport. The diurnal FFCO 2 emissions are responsible for a diurnal FFCO 2 concentration amplitude of up to 9. 12 ppm at the grid cell scale. Similarly, the monthly FFCO 2 emissions are responsible for a simulated seasonal CO 2 amplitude of up to 6. 11 ppm at the grid cell scale. The impact of the diurnal FFCO 2 emissions, when only sampled in the local afternoon, is also important, causing an increase of + 1. 13 ppmv at the grid cell scale. The simulated CO 2 concentration impacts from the diurnally and seasonally varying FFCO 2 emissions are centered over large source regions in the Northern Hemisphere, <b>extending</b> to <b>downwind</b> regions. This study demonstrates the influence of sub-annual variations in FFCO 2 emissions on simulated CO 2 concentration and suggests that inversion studies must take account of these variations in the affected regions...|$|R
40|$|An {{iterative}} method is {{developed by which}} one can calculate approximately the boundary of a magnetic field confined by a plasma. This method consists essentially of varying an assumed surface until the magnetic multipole moments of the currents, which would flow on that surface to balance the plasma pressure, cancel the corresponding moments of the magnetic sources within the surface. The method is applied to two problems. For a dipole source of moment M emu in a plasma of uniform pressure p dynes/cm^ 2 that does not penetrate the magnetic field, the approximate equation of the surface is r = 0. 82615 M^(1 / 3) p^(- 1 / 6) (1 - 0. 120039 α^ 2 -. 004180 α^ 4 -. 001085 α^ 6 +. 000200 α^ 8 -. 000597 α^(10) +. 000326 α^(12) -. 000094 α^(14)) cm, where α is the latitude in radians from the plane normal to M.

40|$|Seed {{dispersal}} by wind is {{a critical}} yet poorly understood process in tropical forest trees. How tree size and fecundity affect this process at the population level remains largely unknown because of insufficient replication across adults. We measured seed dispersal by the endangered neotropical timber species big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King, Meliaceae) in the Brazilian Amazon at 25 relatively isolated trees using multiple 1 -m wide belt transects <b>extended</b> 100 m <b>downwind.</b> Tree diameter and fecundity correlated positively with increased seed shadow extent; but in combination large, high fecundity trees contributed disproportionately to longer-distance dispersal events (. 60 m). Among three empirical models fitted to seed density vs. distance in one dimension, the Student-t (2 Dt) generally fit best (compared to the negative exponential and inverse power). When seedfall downwind was modelled in two dimensions using a normalised sample, it peaked furthest downwind (c. 25 m) for large, high-fecundity trees; with the inverse Gaussian and Weibull functions providing comparable fits that were slightly better than the lognormal. Although most seeds fell within 30 m of parent trees, relatively few juveniles were found within this distance, resulting in juvenile-to-seed ratios peaking at c. 35 – 45 m. Using the 2 Dt model fits to predict seed densities downwind, coupled with known fecundity data for 2000 – 2009, we evaluated potential Swietenia regeneration near adults (# 30 m dispersal) and beyond 30 m.

40|$|Abstract. Winter {{precipitation}} data from selected locations within the States of Utah and Nevada were analyzed {{to determine if}} there were any indications of reductions in mountainous precipitation when compared with upwind valley precipitation. This work followed the approached utilized in a comprehensive study of precipitation in Israel and California that indicated the orographic component of precipitation was declining at precipitation stations at mountain locations which were downwind of major cities. The authors of that study theorized that these reductions were due to the transport of air pollution from the cities into winter storms at these downwind mountainous locations leading to microphysical changes within the affected clouds resulting in reductions in observed precipitation. The work which we performed in Utah and Nevada indicated similar reductions in mountainous precipitation downwind of the Salt Lake City/Provo metropolitan complex. These indicated reductions in precipitation <b>extended</b> <b>downwind</b> of the first mountain barrier into a mountain valley location and into the upwind slope of a second mountain barrier some 80 km downwind. Reductions in precipitation at other mountain stations in Utah and Nevada were not indicated. These stations were located in more rural settings which may suggest that air pollution from major cities may in fact be related to the reductions in precipitation that are indicated downwind of the Salt Lake City/Provo metropolitan complex...|$|E

However, the dynamics and potential range of barchan morphologies emerging under each specific scenario that leads to dune asymmetry are far from being understood. In the present work, we use dune modeling in order to investigate the formation and evolution of asymmetric barchans. We find that a bimodal wind regime causes limb extension when the divergenceangle between primary and secondary winds is largerthan 90 ◦, whereas the extended limb evolves into a seif dune if the ratio between secondary and primary transport rates is larger than 25 %. Calculations of dune formation on an inclined surface under constant wind direction also lead to barchan asymmetry, however no seif dune is obtained from surface tilting alone. Asymmetric barchans migrating along a tilted surface move laterally, with transverse migration velocity proportional to the slope of the terrain. Limb elongation induced by topography can occur when a barchan crosses a topographic rise. Furthermore, transient asymmetric barchan shapes with extended limb also emerge during collisions between dunes or due to an asymmetric influx. Our findings can be useful for making quantitative inference on local wind regimes or spatial heterogeneities in transport conditions of planetary dune field...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{and model}} studies suggest a {{significant}} but highly non-linear role for halogens, primarily Cl and Br, in multiphase atmospheric processes relevant to tropospheric chemistry and composition, aerosol evolution, radiative transfer, weather, and climate. The sensitivity of global atmospheric chemistry {{to the production}} of marine aerosol and the associated activation and cycling of inorganic Cl and Br was tested using a size-resolved multiphase coupled chemistry/global climate model (National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Atmosphere Model (CAM); v 3. 6. 33). Simulation results showed strong meridional and vertical gradients in Cl and Br species. The simulation reproduced most available observations with reasonable confidence permitting the formulation of potential mechanisms for several previously unexplained halogen phenomena including the enrichment of Br − in submicron aerosol, and the presence of a BrO maximum in the polar free troposphere. However, simulated total volatile Br mixing ratios were generally high in the troposphere. Br in the stratosphere was lower than observed {{due to the lack of}} long-lived organobromine species in the simulation. Comparing simulations using chemical mechanisms with and without reactive Cl and Br species demonstrated a significant temporal and spatial sensitivity of primary atmospheric oxidants (O 3, HO x, NO x), CH 4, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC's) to halogen cycling. Simulated O 3 and NO x were globally lower (65 % and 35 %, respectively, less in the planetary boundary layer based on median values) in simulations that included halogens. Globally, little impact was seen in SO 2 and non-sea-salt SO 4 2 − processing due to halogens. Significant regional differences were evident: the lifetime of nss-SO 4 2 − was <b>extended</b> <b>downwind</b> of large sources of SO 2. The burden and lifetime of DMS (and its oxidation products) were lower by a factor of 5 in simulations that included halogens, versus those without, leading to a 20 % reduction in nss-SO 4 2 − in the Southern Hemisphere planetary boundary layer based on median values...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{persistent}} {{evidence of}} health impacts of roadway aerosols requires extensive information for urban planning to avoid putting populations at risk, especially in-fill projects. The required information must cover both highway aerosol sources {{as well as}} transport into residential areas {{under a variety of}} roadway configurations, traffic conditions, downwind vegetation, and meteorology. Such studies are difficult and expensive to do, but were easier in the past when there was a robust fine aerosol tracer uniquely tied to traffic – lead. In this report we propose and test a modern alternative, highway safety flare aerosols. Roadway safety flares on vehicles in traffic can provide very fine and ultra-fine aerosols of unique composition that can be detected quantitatively far downwind of roadways {{due to a lack of}} upwind interferences. The collection method uses inexpensive portable aerosol collection hardware and x-ray analysis protocols. The time required for each transect is typically 1  h. Side by side tests showed precision at ± 4 %. We have evaluated this technique both by aerosol removal in vegetation in a wind tunnel and by tracking aerosols downwind of freeways as a function of season, highway configuration and vegetation coverage. The results show that sound walls for at-grade freeways cause freeway pollution to <b>extend</b> much farther <b>downwind</b> than standard models predict. The elevated or fill section freeway on a berm projected essentially undiluted roadway aerosols at distances well beyond 325  m, deep into residential neighborhoods. Canopy vegetation with roughly 70 % cover reduced very fine and ultra-fine aerosols by up to a factor of 2  at distances up to 200  m downwind...|$|R
40|$|Developers of onshore, {{utility-scale}} {{wind farms}} seek to purchase or lease parcels on which commercial wind turbines will be sited, carefully selecting each particular parcel {{based on its}} access to high wind speeds and unobstructed wind flowing across it in the free stream. Accordingly, a wind farm developer’s purchase or lease of a tract of land generally entails a large monetary investment and carries with it an investment-backed expectation that such land {{will be used for}} its originally intended purpose. Wind wakes, which disrupt the wind velocity in the free stream, cause downwind turbines to encounter diminished wind speeds and turbulence, as well as experience structural fatigue and stress. Collectively, these factors can substantially reduce these downwind turbines’ originally projected energy output over the course of their operational lives. When wind wakes generated from wind turbines on an immediately adjacent neighbor’s property <b>extend</b> over a <b>downwind</b> neighbor’s land, that land will experience wake-related adverse impacts. As a result, wind turbines that are already in place, or which are scheduled to be erected, on the downwind parcel may experience wake effects from its neighbor’s upwind turbines. Purchasing or leasing land that experiences wake-related adverse impacts can deprive a wind farm developer of the opportunity to realize its investment-backed expectation, translate into millions of dollars of future lost income, and render the parcel at issue effectively useless in terms of the original purpose for which it was obtained. This Paper provides an overview of wake effect–related matters wind farm developers and other prospective purchasers should consider in their respective decisions regarding land purchasing and leasing, wind turbine siting and placement, rights associated with wind flow across a particular parcel, and measures that can be taken to legally protect such rights. First, it presents a brief scientific overview about wind wakes and describes why they are important considerations with respect to land purchasing or leasing, particularly with respect to legally mandated setback requirements. Second, it provides background about other countries’ legal precedent and U. S. precedent for whether a federally recognized property right to unobstructed wind flow over a landowner’s parcel exists. Third, it discusses how safety concerns, not generally accepted scientific concepts relating to wind wakes and wake effects, are used to establish setback limits for commercial wind turbines from shared property lines. Fourth, it provides an overview of notice requirements and the establishment of entitlements under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, including why a right to wind flow across one’s property may be deemed an entitlement. Fifth, it discusses legal rights that may be protected between parties by such parties entering into legal contracts. Additionally, it uses a recently litigated California case, Wind Energy Partnership et al. v. NextEra Energy Resources LLC et al., to illustrate real-world issues associated with wind wakes. These issues include due process and public policy considerations, such as why it may be financially detrimental to downwind landowners or downwind developers if they do not consider adequately the types of actions that may constitute adequate notice, the timing of government hearings for actions impacting the land at issue and these hearings’ significance, the temporal significance of land ownership, as well as the short-term and long-term goals of the local community. Finally, it suggests measures that landowners and developers should take as a matter of best practices to establish and secure legal protection of their wind rights...|$|R
