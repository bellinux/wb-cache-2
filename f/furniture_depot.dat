He also created innovative industrial buildings, including a warehouse in Casablanca covered with a think veil of concrete (1915) and an extraordinary concrete church, Notre Dame du Raincy (1922-23), where the interior columns were left undecorated and the concrete vaults of the ceiling became the most prominent decorative feature. He experimented with concrete forms to achieve the best acoustics for the concert hall of the École Normale de Musique de Paris in Paris. (1929) ...|$|E
40|$|Zbirka muzičkih instrumenata iz fundusa Muzeja za umjetnost i obrt jedina je cjelovita zbirka ovog tipa u zagrebačkim muzejima, ujedno i najznačajnija takva zbirka u Hrvatskoj. Unutar nje nalazi se nevelika, ali raznovrsna skupina instrumenata s tipkama: klavikord, tri stolna klavira, prenosivi putni klavir, fortepiano, pozitiv, fisharmonika, harmonij, uspravni klavir, dva pijanina te pet klavira. Zbog nedostatka prostora dio instrumenata smješten je u depou namještaja. Rad donosi njihov opis kao i pokušaj smještanja u povijesni i društveni kontekst budući da su osobe koje su posjedovale te instrumente većinom pripadale građanstvu, a neke od njih zaslućile su istaknuto mjesto u kulturnom i umjetničkom životu Zagreba i Hrvatske. Materijalno u povoljnim prilikama, redovito su njegovale kućnu glazbu, a zahvaljujući dostatnoj glazbenoj naobrazbi i same su muzicirale. The {{collection}} of musical instruments from the holdings of the Museum of Arts and Crafts {{is the only}} complete {{collection of}} this type in the museums of Zagreb, and also the most important such collection in Croatia. Within that collection is a modest but diverse group of keyboard instruments: a clavichord, three square pianos, a portable travel piano, fortepiano, positive, physharmonica, harmonium, an upright piano, two pianos, and five pianos. Because {{of the lack of}} space, some instruments are located in the <b>furniture</b> <b>depot.</b> The instruments date from {{the second half of the}} 18 th century until the turn from the 19 th to the 20 th century. Most of them originate from Austria, largely Vienna, thus confirming its musical influence on Zagreb. The paper gives a description of these instruments and attempts to find their place in the historical and social context since their owners mostly belonged to the citizenry, some of them having earned a prominent place in the cultural and artistic life of Zagreb and Croatia. Economically well-situated, they regularly cherished home music-making and, thanks to their music education, were able to play themselves. Some of the exhibited instruments are in poor condition. They would reach their full value and beauty only if they were restored and well tuned, so their repair is necessary. At least one part of the instruments, especially those that are well preserved, should be made playable because that is their primary and undeniable function...|$|E

In 1863 an article in The Illustrated London News described the living and working conditions in the Old Nichol: [...] "In the neighbourhoods where the inhabitants follow poor trades the condition is but little better: a few streets where there is a more cleanly appearance do but lead to a repetition of the horrors just witnessed; and from garret to cellar whole families occupy single rooms, or, if they can find a corner of available space, take a lodger or two. In some wretched cul de sac, partly inhabited by costers, the fetid yards are devoted to the donkeys, while fish are cured and dried in places which cannot be mentioned without loathing. Bandbox and lucifer-box makers, cane workers, clothespeg makers, shoemakers, and tailors, mostly earning only just enough to keep them from absolute starvation, swarm from roof to basement; and, as the owners of such houses have frequently bought the leases cheaply and spend nothing for repairs, the profits to the landlords are greater in proportion than those on a middle-class dwelling." ...|$|R
