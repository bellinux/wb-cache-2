Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the distribution of C. trachomatis genovars in such cases. Methods: A total of 522 urogenital specimens, 403 from women and 119 from men, were analyzed for C. trachomatis by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting of the ompA gene. Positive specimens were genotyped by DNA sequencing of the amplicons. Results: Sixty-two (11. 9 %) specimens were positive. Of these, 43 (69. 4 %) were collected from men and 19 (30. 6 %) from women (p < 0. 0001). Eight genovars were identified in men and seven in women. <b>Genovar</b> E was the most common in both men and women, followed by <b>genovar</b> Da in men, and F in women. Together these three genovars accounted for 84 % of infections. <b>Genovar</b> D was the third most common <b>genovar</b> (n = 4). <b>Genovar</b> G was detected in two samples, and sequences of genovars Ba, H, and Ja were each found in single samples. One sample (1. 6 %) contained mixed sequences. No association was found between gender and specific genovars. Fifty-six (92 %) sequences were identical to those reported for the respective reference genovars and the other two have been described in several regions. Conclusions: Our findings add to the results of most studies, which indicate that genovars E, F, and D/Da are the most frequent. No association was found between gender and specific genovars. Despite the heterogeneous population of genovars, most ompA sequences were conserved...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} and validated a nested real-time PCR (NRT-PCR) for the genotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis {{and used it}} specifically for the typing of either eight <b>genovars</b> from D to K or three <b>genovars</b> of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). The 11 probes used in the NRT-PCR correctly identified the DNA from D to K and LGV reference strains and did not cross-react with the DNA from 26 strains representing the bacterial pathogens and commensals of the oropharynx, genital tract, and rectum. The NRT-PCR had a 95 % probability of detection at four genome copies (confidence interval, three to six copies) of C. trachomatis per reaction. One hundred cervical and urethral swab specimens containing C. trachomatis DNA from 63 women and 37 men were used to validate the method. The results from the NRT-PCR and the DNA sequencing of amplicons generated from the omp 1 gene showed 100 % correlation for these samples. The assay also identified the LGV-II genotype in 24 of 48 rectal swab specimens containing C. trachomatis DNA that were obtained from men having sex with men. The Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory, London, independently confirmed these results using group-specific LGV real-time PCR and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis. Compared with the NRT-PCR, non-NRT-PCR was found to be less sensitive: it typed C. trachomatis DNA in only 80 % of the genital samples and 90 % of the rectal swab samples. This is the first successful demonstration of the use of real-time PCR for the genotype-specific typing of C. trachomatis strains that cause sexually transmitted diseases...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate {{intracellular}} prokaryotic {{human pathogen}} that causes community-acquired respiratory infection {{and has been}} associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Unexpected results from genomic sequencing indicate that significant intrastrain polymorphism exists for some C. pneumoniae isolates.

A definitive means to test this hypothesis is to obtain genetically homogeneous clonal populations of the pathogen and test them in models of infection and disease. To date, methods for cloning C. pneumoniae have not been reported. In this study, we describe the isolation of clonal variants with genetic differences in the tyrP locus from a polymorphic respiratory isolate, using a novel focus-forming assay.

METHODS: Urogenital isolates (n = 240) derived from attenders of various clinics in the Lisbon area were differentiated into <b>genovars</b> by genotyping with {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis of the PCR amplified omp 1 gene. RESULTS: Genotype E was the most common for both men (47. 9 %) and women (43. 8 %). Genotypes D and F were the second most prevalent for men (11. 3 %) and genotype H was the second most prevalent for women (19. 5 %). Genotypes F, G, D, in women and H, G, I, in men, were found in a lower percentage of cases. Genotypes B, Ba, J, K, L 1 and L 2 were very rarely detected. CONCLUSIONS: With one exception, the overall distribution of Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes in our study is similar to what has been observed in other western countries.

We focused our MLVA scheme on <b>genovar</b> E which predominates in most populations worldwide. This system does not require culture and therefore can be performed directly on DNA extracted from positive clinical specimens. Our method was based on GeneScan analysis of five VNTR loci labelled with fluorescent dyes by multiplex PCR and capillary electrophoresis. This MLVA, called MLVA- 5, was applied to a collection of 220 <b>genovar</b> E and 94 non-E <b>genovar</b> C. trachomatis isolates and specimens obtained from 251 patients and resulted in 38 MLVA- 5 types. The genetic stability of the MLVA- 5 scheme was assessed for results obtained both in vitro by serial passage culturing and in vivo using concomitant and sequential isolates and specimens. All anorectal <b>genovar</b> E isolates from {{men who have sex}} with men exhibited the same MLVA- 5 type, suggesting clonal spread. In the same way, we confirmed the clonal origin of the Swedish new variant of C. trachomatis. The MLVA- 5 assay was compared to three other molecular typing methods, ompA gene sequencing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and a previous MLVA method called MLVA- 3, on 43 <b>genovar</b> E isolates. The discriminatory index was 0. 913 for MLVA- 5, 0. 860 for MLST and 0. 622 for MLVA- 3.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{epidemiological}} study {{was carried out}} in Sfax (south of Tunisia) and focused on genital Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) <b>genovar</b> distribution. Methods One hundred and thirty seven genital samples from 4067 patients (4. 2 %) attending the Habib Bourguiba University hospital of Sfax over 12 years (from 2000 to 2011) were found to be C. trachomatis PCR positive by the Cobas Amplicor system. These samples were genotyped by an in house reverse hybridization method. Results One hundred and eight (78. 8 %) samples contained only one <b>genovar</b> and 29 (21. 2 %) samples contained two or three genovars. <b>Genovar</b> E was the most prevalent (70. 8 %) single <b>genovar</b> and it was detected in 90. 6 % of all the cases. Genovars J, C and L 1 -L 3 were not detected in our samples whereas ocular genovars A and B were in 5 cases. All the five cases were mixed infections. Men had more mixed infections than women (p = 0. 02) and were more frequently infected by genovars F and K (p Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also significantly more frequently infected with mixed genovars (p = 0. 04). Conclusions In conclusion, we have reported a high prevalence of <b>genovar</b> E and of mixed infections in our study population.

40|$|Abstract Background Along {{with single}} {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variation (CNV) is considered {{an important source of}} genetic variation associated with disease susceptibility. Despite the importance of CNV, the tools currently available for its analysis often produce false positive results due to limitations such as low resolution of array platforms, platform specificity, and the type of CNV. To resolve this problem, spurious signals must be separated from true signals by visual inspection. None of the previously reported CNV analysis tools support this function and the simultaneous visualization of comparative genomic hybridization arrays (aCGH) and sequence alignment. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to develop a useful program for the efficient detection and visualization of CNV regions that enables the manual exclusion of erroneous signals. Results A JAVA-based stand-alone program called <b>Genovar</b> was developed. To ascertain whether a detected CNV region is a novel variant, <b>Genovar</b> compares the detected CNV regions with previously reported CNV regions using the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV, [URL]) and the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP). The current version of <b>Genovar</b> is capable of visualizing genomic data from sources such as the aCGH data file and sequence alignment format files. Conclusions <b>Genovar</b> is freely accessible and provides a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) to facilitate the detection of CNV regions. The program also provides comprehensive information to help in the elimination of spurious signals by visual inspection, making <b>Genovar</b> a valuable tool for reducing false positive CNV results.

40|$|A multistate {{listeriosis}} outbreak {{associated with}} cantaloupe consumption {{was reported in}} the United States in September, 2011. The outbreak investigation recorded a total of 146 invasive illnesses, 30 deaths and one miscarriage. Subtyping of the outbreak associated clinical, food and environmental isolates revealed two serotypes (1 / 2 a and 1 / 2 b) and four pulsed-field gel electrophoresis two-enzyme pattern combinations I, II, III, and IV, including one rarely seen before this outbreak. A DNA-microarray, Listeria GeneChip®, developed by FDA from 24 Listeria monocytogenes genome sequences, was used to further characterize a representative sample of the outbreak isolates. The microarray data (in the form of present or absent calls of specific DNA sequences) separated the isolates into two distinct groups as per their serotypes. The gene content of the outbreak-associated isolates was distinct from that of the previously-reported outbreak strains belonging to the same serotypes. Although the 1 / 2 b outbreak associated isolates are closely related to each other, the 1 / 2 a isolates could be further divided into two distinct genomic groups, one represented by pattern combination I strains and the other represented by highly similar pattern combinations III and IV strains. Gene content analysis of these groups revealed unique genomic sequences associated with these two 1 / 2 a <b>genovars.</b> This work underscores the utility of multiple approaches, such as serotyping, PFGE and DNA microarray analysis to characterize the composition of complex polyclonal listeriosis outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|A multitarget {{real-time}} PCR (MRT-PCR) for {{detection of}} Chlamydia trachomatis DNA {{was developed and}} validated. There were three targets for amplification in a single reaction: the cryptic plasmid (CP), the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) gene, and an internal control. The assay had the following characteristics: (i) detection and confirmation {{of the presence of}} C. trachomatis DNA in a single reaction, (ii) detection of all <b>genovars</b> of C. trachomatis without any cross-reactivity with pathogenic bacteria or commensal organisms of the oropharynx and genital tract, (iii) a 95 % probability of detection with three copies of MOMP and one copy of CP per reaction mixture, (iv) identification of the inhibition of amplification, (v) a quantitative dynamic range of 25 to 250, 000 genome copies per reaction mixture, (vi) high intra- and interassay reproducibilities, and (vii) correct identification of all samples in the validation panel. There were 146 COBAS Amplicor PCR (Amplicor PCR) -positive samples and 122 Amplicor PCR-negative samples in the panel. MRT-PCR detected CP DNA alone in 6 (4 %) Amplicor PCR-positive samples and both CP and MOMP DNAs in 140 (96 %) of 146 Amplicor PCR-positive samples. The quantity of MOMP DNA in 95 (68 %) of 140 samples was within the dynamic range of the assay. The median C. trachomatis load in these samples was 321 genome copies per reaction mixture (range, 26 to 40, 137 genome copies per reaction mixture). Due to the inclusion of two different C. trachomatis-specific targets, the assay confirmed 259 (97 %) of 268 results in a single reaction. This assay could be used in the qualitative format for the routine detection of C. trachomatis and in the quantitative format for study of the pathogenesis of C. trachomatis-associated diseases. The assay demonstrated the potential to eliminate the need for confirmatory testing in almost all samples, thus reducing the turnaround time and the workload...|$|R
40|$|Six {{species and}} six {{additional}} <b>genovars</b> are combined within the so-called Enterobacter cloacae complex, {{with one of}} them being the species Enterobacter hormaechei. In a recent population genetic study, two genetic clusters were found in close phylogenetic proximity to the genetic cluster of E. hormaechei. In order to prove the hypothesis that these three genetic clusters belong to the same species, we performed cross-hybridization experiments in microplates with DNAs of representatives of each genetic cluster. The close phylogenetic relationship among the clusters was reflected by their relatively low ΔTm values, ranging from 0. 3 to 4. 8, confirming the hypothesis that the clusters are parts of the same species. These clusters can be distinguished from the other species of the E. cloacae complex, which have ΔTm values of 5. 6 to 10. 3. Forty-eight E. hormaechei strains from the different genetic clusters were phenotypically characterized with 129 biochemical tests. In this way, E. hormaechei could be differentiated from the other species of the E. cloacae complex because it tests negative in the 3 -hydroxy-butyrate test. The three genetic clusters of E. hormaechei could also be differentiated from each other by using phenotypic tests. Hence, we propose three new subspecies of E. hormaechei corresponding to genetic clusters VI, VII, and VIII of the E. cloacae complex. E. hormaechei subsp. hormaechei comb. nov. corresponds to the original species description, as it gives negative results for the adonitol, d-arabitol, d-sorbitol, and d-melibiose tests and a positive result for the dulcitol test. E. hormaechei subsp. oharae subsp. nov. gives negative results for the dulcitol, adonitol, and d-arabitol tests and positive results for the d-sorbitol and d-melibiose tests. E. hormaechei subsp. steigerwaltii subsp. nov. gives a negative result for the dulcitol test and positive results for the adonitol, d-arabitol, d-sorbitol, and d-melibiose tests. Among the members of the E. cloacae complex, E. hormaechei seems to be the species most frequently recovered from clinical specimens...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Repeated infections of Chlamydia trachomatis may be new infections or {{persistent}} infections due {{to treatment}} failure or due to unresolved infections in sexual partners. We aimed {{to establish the}} value of using high-resolution multilocus sequence typing (CT-MLST) to discriminate repeated C trachomatis infections. Methods Paired C trachomatis positive samples (baseline (T 0) and after 6 months (T 1)) were selected from two Dutch screening implementation studies among young heterosexual people. Typing with six CT-MLST loci included the ompA gene. The uniqueness of strains was assessed using 256 reference CT-MLST profiles. Results In 27 out of 34 paired cases, full sequence types were obtained. A multilocus (13 cases) or single locus variant (4 cases) was seen, indicating 17 new C trachomatis infections at T 1. The ompA <b>genovar</b> was identical for 5 of 17 discordant cases. The 10 cases with concordant typing results were categorised as treatment failure (5 cases) versus persistent or recurrent infections (5 cases). Surprisingly, these concordant cases had C trachomatis strains that were either unique or found in small clusters. The median time between T 0 and T 1 did not differ between the concordant and discordant cases.

OBJECTIVES: To characterise N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis and M genitalium samples from Guinea-Bissau and to define bacterial populations, possible transmission chains and for N gonorrhoeae spread of antibiotic-resistant isolates. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two sexual health {{and family planning}} clinics, Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. PARTICIPANTS: Positive samples from 711 women and 27 men. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Positive samples for N gonorrhoeae (n= 31), C trachomatis (n= 60) and M genitalium (n= 30) were examined. The gonococcal isolates were characterised with antibiograms, serovar determination and N gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST). The C trachomatis ompA gene and the M genitalium mgpB gene were sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: For N gonorrhoeae, the levels of resistance (intermediate susceptibility) to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, rifampicin, ampicillin, tetracycline, penicillin G and cefuroxime were 10 % (0 %), 6 % (10 %), 13 % (10 %), 68 % (0 %), 74 % (0 %), 68 % (16 %) and 0 % (84 %), respectively. All isolates were susceptible to cefixime, ceftriaxone, spectinomycin and azithromycin, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations of kanamycin (range: 8 - 32 mg/l) and gentamicin (range: 0. 75 - 6 mg/l) were low (no resistance breakpoints exist for these antimicrobials). 19 NG-MAST sequence types (STs) (84 % novel STs) were identified. Phylogenetic analysis of the C trachomatis ompA gene revealed <b>genovar</b> G as most prevalent (37 %), followed by <b>genovar</b> D (19 %). 23 mgpB STs were found among the M genitalium isolates, and 67 % of isolates had unique STs.

C. trachomatis positive samples were collected at the STI outpatient clinic in Amsterdam between 2008 and 2010 and genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. Clusters were assigned using minimum spanning trees and these were combined with epidemiological data of the hosts. We typed 526 C. trachomatis positive samples: 270 from MSM and 256 from heterosexuals. Eight clusters, containing 10 - 128 samples were identified of which 4 consisted of samples from MSM (90 %- 100 %), with genovars D, G, J, and L 2 b. The other 4 clusters consisted mainly of samples from heterosexuals (87 %- 100 %) with genovars D, E, F, I, and J. Genetic diversity was much lower in the MSM clusters than in heterosexual clusters. Significant differences in number of sexual partners and HIV-serostatus were observed for MSM-associated clusters. C. trachomatis transmission patterns among MSM and heterosexuals were largely distinct. We hypothesize that these differences are due to sexual host behavior, but bacterial factors may play a role as wel...|$|E

We report a rare clinical case of LGV primary stage called ‘‘bubonulus’ ’ with penile adenopathy and secondary local acute lymphoedema in an MSM seropositive man. This is the first case described of this clinical presentation with a L 2 b <b>genovar</b> strain, occurring immediately after use of a sex toy. It suggests that this presentation is favoured by host immunity and behavioural factors. These factors may also play a part in the new outbreak of LGV.

40|$|Background: Trachoma, {{caused by}} Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), {{is the leading}} {{infectious}} cause of blindness. Sequence-based analysis of the multiple strains typically present in endemic communities may be informative for epidemiology, transmission, response to treatment, and understanding the host response. Methods: Conjunctival and nasal samples from a Gambian community were evaluated before and 2 months after mass azithromycin treatment. Samples were tested for Ct by Amplicor, with infection load determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). ompA sequences were determined and their diversity analysed using frequency-based tests of neutrality. Results: Ninety-five of 1, 319 (7. 2 %) individuals from 14 villages were infected with Ct at baseline. Two genovars (A and B) and 10 distinct ompA genotypes were detected. Two <b>genovar</b> A variants (A 1 and A 2) accounted for most infections. There was an excess of rare ompA mutations, not sustained in the population. Post-treatment, 76 (5. 7 %) individuals had Ct infection with only three ompA genotypes present. In 12 of 14 villages, infection had cleared, while in two it increased, probably due to mass migration. Infection qPCR loads associated with infection were significantly greater for A 1 than for A 2. Seven individuals had concurrent ocular and nasal infection, with divergent genotypes in five. Conclusions: The number of strains was substantially reduced after mass treatment. One common strain was associated with higher infection loads. Discordant genotypes in concurrent infection may indicate distinct infections at ocular an...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} compare {{conventional}} ompA typing of Chlamydia trachomatis with multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA). Previously used MLST and MLVA systems {{were compared to}} modified versions that used shorter target regions and nested PCR. Heterosexual couples were selected from among persons with urogenital C. trachomatis infections visiting the sexually transmitted infection outpatient clinic in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We identified 30 couples {{with a total of}} 65 C. trachomatis-positive samples on which MLST and MLVA for eight target regions were performed. All regions were successfully sequenced in 52 samples, resulting in a complete profile for 18 couples and 12 individuals. Nine ompA genovars from D to K, with two variants of <b>genovar</b> G, were found. The numbers of sequence type and MLVA type profiles were 20 for MLST and 21 for MLVA, and a combination of MLST and MLVA yielded 28 profiles, with discriminatory indexes (D) ranging from 0. 95 to 0. 99. Partners in 17 couples shared identical profiles, while partners in 1 couple had completely different profiles. Three persons had infections at multiple anatomical locations, and within each of these three individuals, all profiles were identical. The discriminatory capacity of all MLST and MLVA methods is much higher than that of ompA genotyping (D = 0. 78). No genotype variation was found within the samples of the same person or from heterosexual couples with a putative single transmission. This shows that the chlamydial genome in clinical specimens has an appropriate polymorphism to enable epidemiological cluster analysis using MLST and MLV...|$|E
40|$|For {{prevention}} {{and control of}} gonorrhea, an objective, highly discriminating, and reproducible molecular epidemiological characterization of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is essential. In the present study, in pursuance of providing such qualities, pyrosequencing technology, a fast real-time DNA sequence analysis, was applied to six short, highly polymorphic porB gene segments, with subsequent genetic variant (<b>genovar)</b> determination of the bacterial isolates. The sequencing templates were obtained by real-time PCR amplification, which also included fluorescence melting curve analysis of the entire porB gene {{in order to determine}} the genogroup (porB 1 a or porB 1 b allele) prior to pyrosequencing analysis. The PSQ 96 MA system used allowed rapid (in approximately 1. 5 h) determination of 96 sequences of 20 to 65 correct nucleotides each. The results were reproducible and mostly in concordance with the results of conventional Sanger dideoxy sequencing, with the exception of shorter read lengths and some uncertainty in determining the correct number of identical nucleotides in homopolymeric segments. The number of sequence variants identified in each of the six highly polymorphic segments of the porB 1 a and porB 1 b alleles (encoding surface-exposed amino acid loops of the mature PorB protein) ranged from 5 to 11 and from 8 to 39, respectively. Among porB 1 a isolates (n = 22) and porB 1 b isolates (n = 65), 22 and 64 unique genovars, respectively, were identified. All isolates were typeable. The present results provide evidence of a high discriminatory ability, practically the same as that for sequencing of the entire porB gene. In conclusion, the fast and high-throughput pyrosequencing technology can be used for molecular epidemiological characterization of N. gonorrhoeae...|$|E

40|$|The Chlamydia trachomatis {{incidence}} rate in Finnmark, the most northern and sparsely populated county in Norway, has been twice the national average.

Eighty chlamydia specimens from adolescents aged 15 – 20 years in Finnmark were collected in five high schools (n = 60) and from routine clinical samples in the laboratory (n = 20). These were compared to routine clinical samples from adolescents in Tromsø (n = 80) and Trondheim (n = 88), capitals of North and Central Norway, respectively. ompA sequencing detected 11 genotypes in 248 specimens from all three areas. MLST displayed 50 STs providing a five-fold higher resolution. Two-thirds of all STs were novel. The common ompA E/Bour genotype comprised 46 % and resolved into 24 different STs. MLST identified the Swedish new variant of C. trachomatis not discriminated by ompA sequencing. Simpson's discriminatory index (D) was 0. 93 for MLST, while a corrected Dc was 0. 97.

40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis is {{the most}} {{commonly}} reported curable sexually transmitted infection in Western high-income countries and can cause severe female reproductive tract morbidity. Despite extensive control efforts, chlamydia rates have increased in most countries since the mid- 1990 s. Young persons and especially adolescent girls have the highest infection rates. In general, girls are tested far more frequently than boys. High-resolution genotyping provides detailed information on the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of C. trachomatis. In this thesis, we investigated; i) C. trachomatis genotype distribution and genetic diversity using MLST (multilocus sequence typing) and ompA genotyping in Finnmark, a high-incidence area in Norway, ii) associations between early sexual behaviour and prevalent chlamydia infection, and iii) demographic and sexual behaviour factors associated with chlamydia testing {{in a high school}} based screening and previous clinic based testing, among girls and boys aged 15 - 20 years who participated in the Finnmark High School Study conducted from September to November 2009. We detected a large genetic diversity, multiple novel sequence types and alleles by MLST, and an atypical <b>genovar</b> distribution with predominance of G in a previously unmapped area. C. trachomatis genetic diversity in rural Finnmark and two other urban areas was similar. Chlamydia prevalence in sexually active girls was 7. 3 % and in boys 3. 9 %. Girls started their sexual career and were more sexually active at an earlier age and thus had a different risk profile from boys which may contribute to higher prevalence. Threefold more girls than boys reported previous clinic based testing which was associated with known chlamydia risk factors. School based screening reached 93 % of participants and was associated with factors unknown to increase risk thus suggesting other motives. Half of infections were detected in those only tested at school. We confirmed the efficiency of school based screening to increase testing and detect hidden infections and we thus suggest this approach to be tried as a complement to other chlamydia control strategies in selected high-morbidity areas in Norway...|$|E
