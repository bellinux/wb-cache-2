500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Verdict, Bryan Pope wrote that [...] "the show's charm {{lies in the}} vast world of {{nautical}} nonsense" [...] and that the show is [...] "a world of aquanaut squirrels, clarinet-playing squids, underwater campfires, retired superheroes, plankton obsessed with world domination, and the most head-scratching family units I've ever come across (a crab and a puffer fish are parents to a teenage whale, while pint-sized Plankton {{is married to a}} no-nonsense computer named Karen)." [...] Pope pointed out that the season [...] "remains the high point for the series" [...] as it had produced [...] "classic" [...] episodes such as [...] "No Weenies Allowed", [...] "SpongeBob Meets the Strangler", and [...] "Krusty Krab Training Video". However, Pope described [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] as a [...] "misstep" [...] that [...] "veers too far away from Bikini Bottom and into unfunny live-action territory." [...] Furthermore, various celebrities—including Justin Timberlake, Kelly Osbourne, Britney Spears, Bruce Willis, Noel Gallagher, rapper Dr. Dre, and Mike Myers—were reported to be fans of the show. American actor Rob Lowe said, [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> a sponge in tightie whities." [...] In 2002, fans of the show formed a [...] "new religion"—the Church of SpongeBob SquarePants. The organization has more than 700 members. Its manifesto said it wanted to push [...] "simple things like having fun and using your imagination", and even offered study courses on the show. A Nickelodeon spokesman said [...] "SpongeBob's appeal is extraordinary." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1959 King {{got to know}} Sonny Thompson, a pianist, producer, and A man for Cincinnati's King Records. King's owner, Syd Nathan, signed King to the {{subsidiary}} Federal Records in 1960. King {{recorded his}} debut single for the label on August 26, 1960: [...] "Have You Ever Loved a Woman" [...] backed with [...] "You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Love</b> Her with a Feeling" [...] (again credited as [...] "Freddy" [...] King). From the same recording session at the King Studios in Cincinnati, Ohio, King cut the instrumental [...] "Hide Away," [...] which the next year reached number 5 on the R chart and number 29 on the Pop chart, an unprecedented accomplishment for a blues instrumental {{at a time when}} the genre was still largely unknown to white audiences. It was originally released as the B-side of [...] "I Love the Woman". [...] "Hide Away" [...] was King's melange of a theme by Hound Dog Taylor and parts by others, such as [...] "The Walk", by Jimmy McCracklin, and [...] "Peter Gunn", as credited by King. The title of the tune refers to Mel's Hide Away Lounge, a popular blues club on the West Side of Chicago. Willie Dixon later claimed that he had recorded King performing [...] "Hide Away" [...] for Cobra Records in the late 1950s, but such a version has never surfaced. [...] "Hide Away" [...] became a blues standard.|$|E

I did not exactly flirt with you; but that inborn craving which {{undermines}} some women's morals almost more than unbridled passion--the craving to attract and captivate, regardless of the injury it may do the man--was in me; and when I found I had caught you, I was frightened. And then--I don't know how it was--I couldn't bear to let you go--possibly to Arabella again--and so I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> you, Jude.

60|$|This {{was such}} an entirely new way of {{regarding}} life to a woman of Baptista's nature, that her attention, from being first arrested by it, became deeply interested. By imperceptible pulses her heart expanded in sympathy with theirs. The sentences of her tragi-comedy, her life, confused till now, became clearer daily. That in humanity, as exemplified by these girls, {{there was nothing to}} dislike, but infinitely much to pity, she learnt with the lapse of each week in their company. She grew to like the girls of unpromising exterior, and from liking she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> them; till they formed an unexpected point of junction between her own and her husband's interests, generating a sterling friendship at least, between a pair in whose existence there had threatened to be neither friendship nor love.|$|E

If she had been true, I would have gone through fire and water to be an honest man worthy of her; but when I found how she had deceived me, it went hard with me to cut myself off from the wild mountain life that I'd <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>love,</b> and my poor niggers, that will hardly have so kind a master set over them.' ...|$|E

"You must know, Mabel," [...] said he, [...] "that the Sergeant and I are old friends, {{and have}} stood side by side--or, if not {{actually}} side by side, I {{a little in}} advance, as became a scout, and your father with his own men, as better suited a soldier of the king--on many a hard fi't and bloody day. It's the way of us skirmishers to think little of the fight when the rifle has done cracking; and at night, around our fires, or on our marches, we talk {{of the things we}} love, just as you young women convarse about your fancies and opinions when you get together to laugh over your idees. Now it was natural that the Sergeant, having such a daughter as you, should love her better than anything else, and that he should talk of her oftener than of anything else,--while I, having neither daughter, nor sister, nor mother, nor kith, nor kin, nor anything but the Delawares to love, I naturally chimed in, as it were, and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> you, Mabel, before I ever saw you--yes, I did--just by talking about you so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|The wretched Emperor refused comfort, food, help, {{tore the}} {{bandages}} from his wounds, {{and died in}} two days. He had been a bad man, a cannibal, and a butcher, blood-thirsty and covetous, a ravisher of virgins, and a tyrant to his people. But the Spaniards had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> him in spite of all; for a true friend {{he had been to}} them, and a fearful loss to them just now. The battle went on worse than ever. The great idol temple commanded the palace, and was covered with Mexican warriors. And next day Cortez sent a party to storm it. They tried to get up the winding stairs, and were driven back three times with fearful loss. Cortez, though he had but one hand to fight with, sallied out and cleared the pyramid himself, after a fearful hand-to-hand fight of three hours, up the winding stairs, along the platforms, and at last upon the great square on the top, an acre in breadth. Every Mexican was either killed, or hurled down the sides. The idol, the war god, with its gold disc of bleeding hearts smoking before it, was hurled down and the whole accursed place set on fire and destroyed. Three hundred houses round were also burnt that night; but of what use? ...|$|E
6000|$|Madam, {{that there}} should be no mistake, puts her head out of the chair, and cries out [...] "God save the King" [...] as loud as she can. The people cried [...] "God save the King," [...] too. Everybody cried [...] "God save the King" [...] in those days. On the night of that entertainment, my poor Harry, as a Burgess of the House, and one of the givers of the feast, donned his uniform red coat of Wolfe's (which he so soon was to {{exchange}} for another colour), and went off with Madam Fanny to the ball. My Lady Warrington and her humble servant, as being strangers in the country, and English people as it were, were permitted by Madam to attend the assembly from which she of course absented herself. I had the honour to dance a country-dance with the lady of Mount Vernon, whom I found a most lively, pretty, and amiable partner; but am bound to say that my wife's praises of her were received with a very grim acceptance by my mother, when Lady Warrington came to recount the events of the evening. Could not Sir George Warrington have danced with my Lady Dunmore or her daughters, or with anybody but Mrs. Washington; to be sure the Colonel thought so well of himself and his wife, that no doubt he considered her the grandest lady in the room; and she who remembered him a road-surveyor at a guinea a day! Well, indeed! there was no measuring the pride of these provincial upstarts, and as for this gentleman, my Lord Dunmore's partiality for him had evidently turned his head. I do not know about Mr. Washington's pride, I know that my good mother never could be <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> him or anything that was his.|$|E
