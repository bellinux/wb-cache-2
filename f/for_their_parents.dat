5|$|Both of the World Wars had a {{major impact}} on Stroma, which was only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, Japanese {{military}} personnel and civilians were repatriated to Japan between 1945 and 1946, although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau's infrastructure. However, offspring of Japanese-Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain, although a few migrated to Japan with their fathers. In the 1950s, Japanese-Palauans formed an organisation, Sakura-kai to assist Japanese-Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned by their parents to search <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> and kinsmen who were forcibly separated {{as a result of}} forced repatriation of Japanese settlers back to Japan. The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards, as most Japanese-Palauans had reunited with their Japanese families or voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were.|$|E

25|$|The {{words of}} Jesus and the {{teaching}} of Paul indicate that adult children remain obligated to honour their parents by providing for material needs.

25|$|The Mohist {{philosophers}} {{believed that}} the purpose of life was universal, impartial love. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring - a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her. The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the Confucians who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> than for random strangers.|$|E
25|$|Thailand has {{observed}} global patterns of an enlarging elderly class: as fertility control is encouraged and medical advances are made, births shrink and lives age. The Thai government is noticing {{and concerned about}} this trend, but tends to let families care for their elderly members rather than create extraneous policies for them. As of 2011, there are only 25 state sponsored homes for the elderly, {{with no more than}} a few thousand members of each home. Such programs are largely run by volunteers and are questionable by quality of care, considering there is not always a guarantee care will be available. Private care is tough to follow, often based on assumptions. Because children are less likely to care <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> private caretakers are in demand. Volunteer NGOs are available but in very limited quantities.|$|E

25|$|Many {{countries}} have a smoking age. In many countries, including the United States, most European Union member states, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, Israel, India, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Australia, {{it is illegal}} to sell tobacco products to minors and in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and South Africa {{it is illegal to}} sell tobacco products to people under the age of 16. On 1 September 2007 the minimum age to buy tobacco products in Germany rose from 16 to 18, {{as well as in the}} United Kingdom where on 1 October 2007 it rose from 16 to 18. Underlying such laws is the belief that people should make an informed decision regarding the risks of tobacco use. These laws have a lax enforcement in some nations and states. In China, Turkey, and many other countries usually a child will have little problem buying tobacco products, because they are often told to go to the store to buy tobacco <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the shootout, police {{continued}} to fire dozens of tear-gas grenades into the home, trying {{to flush out}} the SLA members. About two hours into the shootout, the house caught fire, probably due to an exploding tear gas canister. As the house began to burn, two women left {{from the rear of}} the house and one came out the front (she had come in drunk the previous night, passed out, and woken up in the middle of the siege); all were taken into custody, but were found not to be SLA members. Automatic weapons fire continued from the house. At this point, Nancy Ling Perry and Camilla Hall came out of the house. Investigators working <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> would claim that they walked out intending to surrender and that they were unarmed but police later stated that Hall was shot in the head by police as she aimed a weapon towards them while Perry was providing covering fire. After Hall's body fell to the ground, it was pulled back inside the burning house by Angela Atwood. Perry followed Hall out of the house, firing a pistol at officers as she emerged, and was shot twice in the back. Her body remained outside the house.|$|E

500|$|In 1967, {{following}} {{disagreements over}} {{who should be}} invited to their wedding, Dibnah and 19-year-old hairdresser Alison Mary Foster eloped to Gretna Green, to get married. Dibnah had first spotted Alison {{from the top of}} a chimney and, when one day she walked into the pub where he was drinking, he asked her out; six weeks later, the two became engaged. They left notes <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> caught a train to Carlisle and from thereon a series of buses to Dumfries. They had initially planned to stay at the house of a friend but as he had returned to Bolton for his holidays, they stayed instead at a local farmhouse. The two had to be resident for at least 21days to be married and so Dibnah agreed to point the gable ends of a local hotel in exchange for bed and board. On 19May, the two married at the church at Gretna Green and returned to live at Dibnah's mother's house. They later moved into a Victorian gatehouse on the Earl of Bradford's estate, just outside Bolton. Dibnah spent years restoring the property, including building an extension. [...] The house was a listed building and so he had to source appropriately aged bricks for the extension. A vicar offered him some of the old gravestones from the church graveyard, which Dibnah then used to create the stone lintels and mullions, though he later expressed his fear that his property would now be haunted. The couple later purchased the house for £5,000, although it required major repairs to stabilize the rear wall.|$|E

50|$|Building Self-Esteem - The AAMFT {{says that}} the family {{environment}} surrounding an alcoholic may be characterized by tension, fear, and shame, and these feelings can become connected with the child’s sense of self. It is common for a child with an alcoholic parent to {{have little or no}} confidence, as their repeated neglect and abuse causes them to believe that they are not worthy of love, affection, or trust. Some children blame themselves <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parent’s</b> addiction or further believe that their lives are not important enough a reason <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> to overcome addiction. However, the equine therapy provide affection and attention from both the horse as well as the volunteers, thus boosting the confidence of the COA. As the child grows in his or her experience with the program, their knowledge of and familiarity with the horse and {{how to take care of}} it can also increase self-esteem, as well as their success through the exercises. As exercises are completed and milestones are reached, the children feel better about themselves, accordingly.|$|R
