We demonstrate that the non-form-closure grasps consist of two convex polytopes in the space of n parameters representing grasp points on sides of the polygon. The proposed algorithm works efficiently for n ≤ 3 and takes O(n 3 n/ 2) time for n> 3, where n denotes the number of the fingers.

40|$|The <b>form-closure</b> and force-closure {{properties}} of robotic grasp ing are investigated. Loosely speaking, these properties {{are related to}} the capability of the robot to inhibit motions of the workpiece in spite of externally applied forces. In this article, <b>form-closure</b> is considered as a purely geometric property of a set of unilateral (contact) constraints, such as those applied on a workpiece by a mechanical fixture, while force-closure is related to the capability of the particular robotic device being considered to apply forces through contacts. The concepts of partial form- and force-closure properties are introduced and discussed, and an algorithm is proposed to obtain a synthetic geometric description of partial <b>form-closure</b> constraints. Al though the literature abounds with <b>form-closure</b> tests, proposed algorithms for testing force-closure are either approximate or computationally expensive. This article proves the equiva lence of force-closure analysis with the study of the equilibria of an ordinary differential equation, to which Lyapunov's di rect method is applied. This observation leads to an efficient algorithm for assessing the force-closure property of the grasp...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} simple and eÆ-cient {{algorithm}} for computing a <b>form-closure</b> grasp on a 3 D polyhedral object. This algorithm searches for a <b>form-closure</b> grasp from a " initial grasp in a promising search direction that pulls the convex hull of the primitive contact wrenches towards {{the origin of the}} wrench space. The " initial grasp is a set of contact points that minimizes the distance between the origin and the centroid of the primi-tive contact wrenches, and can be calculated by the quadratic programming. The local promising search direction at every step is readily determined by the ray-shooting based qualitative test algorithm devel-oped in our early work. By using the " initial grasp, the iteration times of search can be signi-cantly reduced so that a <b>form-closure</b> grasp can be found more eÆciently. Since the algorithm adopts a local search strategy, its computational cost is less dependent on the complexity of the object surface. Finally, the algorithm has been implemented and its eÆciency has been ascertained by three examples. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{property}} of <b>form-closure</b> of a grasp, as generally {{defined in the}} literature, {{is based on the}} assumption that contact points between the hand and the object are fixed in space. However, this assumption is false when considering a grasp exerted by an underactuated hand, since in this case, it is not possible to control the position of each phalanx independently. In spite of researchers' interest in studying <b>form-closure,</b> none of the available published work on this subject takes into consideration the particular kinematics of underactuated hands. Actually, there are few available tools to qualify or quantify the stability of a grasp exerted by an underactuated hand, thus the design of underactuated hands mostly results from an intuitive approach. This paper aims to reduce this gap. A classification of underactuated hands is proposed, based on the expression of contact forces. This highlights the influence of non-backdrivable mechanisms introduced in the transmission of the closing motion of the hand on the stability of the grasp. The way to extend the original definition of <b>form-closure</b> to underactuated grasps is illustrated.

40|$|Assembly line {{reliability}} can {{be increased}} if grippers are carefully designed to capture and align parts. Jaw design depends on the geometric and mechanical properties of the part {{as well as its}} desired orientation. In this paper we propose a class of modular jaws based on rapidly machineable trapezoidal modules. An optimal jaw design is an arrangement of trapezoidal jaw modules that maximizes contacts between the gripper and the part at its desired final orientation over the constraints that: the jaws will capture and rotate the part to its desired orientation and achieve a <b>form-closure</b> grasp. Given the n-sided 2 D convex projection of an extruded polygonal part, we develop an implemented O(n 5) algorithm to find the optimal jaw design.

40|$|A {{familiar}} task {{in industrial}} applications is grasping an object to constrain its motions.

40|$|This thesis about {{immobilization}} of two- and three-dimensional objects. Immobilization {{is crucial}} to fixturing in manufacturing processes and to robot hand grasping. There are many types of immobility depending on the finger types and the analyses, such as form closure, force closure and second-order immobility. Among these, form closure {{is the basis of}} immobility. Form closure was formulated by Reuleaux in 1876. He defined a rigid body to be in form closure if a set of fingers along its boundary constrained all finite and infinitesimal motions of the body. Chater 1 and 2 introduce the background and the concepts of immobility of various types. Chater 3 to Chapter 8 are about efficiently identifying all these immobilizing grasps. For efficient synthesis of all <b>form-closure</b> grasps of planar objects, we use the geometric formulation of form closure in three-dimensional wrench space. Our problem in the formulation in wrench space states as follows: Given a set of shapes in three-dimensional space, report all sets of shapes, such that each set has four points whose convex hull contains the origin inside. We transform this geometric problem into intersection search problems on planes, which can be handled with techniques in Computational Geometry. In Chapter 3 and 4, we propose efficient algorithms to enumerate all combinations of concave vertices and edges or arcs of a polygon and a semi-algebraic set that allow at least one <b>form-closure</b> grasp with at most four frictionless point fingers. In Chapter 5, we efficiently identify all immobilizing grasps (called force-closure grasps) of a polygon and a semi-algebraic set with two or three frictional point fingers. In Chapter 6, we propose efficient output-sensitive algorithms to enumerate all immobilizing grasps called second-order immobility grasps, with two and three frictionless point fingers for a polygon. Chapter 7 is about grasps that are tolerant to misplacements of fingers. We first divide the edges into small pieces of length varepsilon. Then we compute all sets of concave vertices and edges of a polygon, such that any placement of three or four frictionless point fingers inside these edges will put the polygon in form closure. We call such a combination of concave vertices and edges an independent <b>form-closure</b> grasp region. Chapter 8 is on efficiently computing all combinations of faces, concave edges and concave vertices, such that four to seven frictionless point fingers on each of these combinations allow at least one <b>form-closure</b> grasp. In Chapter 9, we study the problem of immobilizing a serial chain of hinged polygons in a given placement with frictionless point fingers. We define new notions of immobility and robust immobility, which are comparable to second-order immobility and to form closure for a single rigid object. For each case, we show how many fingers can immobilize or robustly immobilize a given serial chain of hinged polygons, by constructing a grasp...|$|E

40|$|One goal of grasp {{selection}} for robotics {{is to choose}} contact points that guarantee properties such as force- or <b>form-closure.</b> Many efficient algorithms {{have been developed to}} address this problem, but most of these algorithms focus on grasps having a minimal number of contact points. Increasing the number of contacts can dramatically improve the quality and flexibility of grasps that are constructed. However, computation time becomes a problem, as grasp synthesis algorithms that can be generalized to an arbitrary number of contacts typically require time exponential in the number of contacts. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for synthesis of manycontact grasps. The key idea is to geometrically construct families of grasps around a single example such that all grasps within a family meet user-specified design goals.

The actual contact point may deviate from the desired position but not farther than ρ ·ρ S, the supremum of ρ without loss of force-closure, indicates the grasp tolerance to contact position uncertainty. For investigating the above uncertainties systematically, we propose three new problems in force-closure: whether a grasp with given κ and ρ achieves forceclosure, what value ρ S equals if κ is given, and how ρ S varies versus κ. To facilitate their solutions, we extend the scope of the infinitesimal motion approach from <b>form-closure</b> analysis to force-closure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new pneumatically driven underactuated hand with two fingers and 3 phalanxes per finger. Two evidences {{have led the}} design of this hand. Firstly, the use of pneumatic energy facilitates the underactuation of the hand, indeed a single T-connector suffices to share out one input among two outputs. Secondly, non-backdrivable mechanisms have {{to be used in}} the transmission of phalanx’s motion so that the hand is capable of producing form-closed grasps. This latter design principle is justified using a newly developed method that permits to study the <b>form-closure</b> property of a grasp exerted by an underactuated hand. Moreover, the intriguing ejection phenomenon is avoided thanks to non-backdrivable mechanisms that prohibit any backward motion of phalanxes when correctly positioned. An original mechanism called the “pneumatic parallelogram ” is described, it enables the hand to perform fine pinch grasps. Finally, the optimal design of both fingers is addressed with respect to the force-isotropy of the finger and the positiveness of phalanx forces...|$|E

The analysis of human hand motion is essential for collecting information about human hand movements useful for generalizing reaching and grasping actions on a robotic system. This paper focuses on the definition and extraction of quantitative indicators for describing optimal hand grasping postures and replicating them on an anthropomorphic robotic hand. A motion analysis {{has been carried out}} on six healthy human subjects performing a transverse volar grasp. The extracted indicators point to invariant grasping behaviours between the involved subjects, thus providing some constraints for identifying the optimal grasping configuration. Hence, an optimization algorithm based on the Nelder-Mead simplex method has been developed for determining the optimal grasp configuration of a robotic hand, grounded on the aforementioned constraints. It is characterized by a reduced computational cost. The grasp stability has been tested by introducing a quality index that satisfies the <b>form-closure</b> property. The grasping strategy has been validated by means of simulation tests and experimental trials on an arm-hand robotic system. The obtained results have shown the effectiveness of the extracted indicators to reduce the non-linear optimization problem complexity and lead to the synthesis of a grasping posture able to replicate the human behaviour while ensuring grasp stability.
