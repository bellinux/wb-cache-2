25|$|One Dilophosaurus wetherilli {{specimen}} bears {{a damaged}} vertebra {{that may have}} been injured during life and a potential abscess on the individual's upper arm bone. Another specimen has an unusually small left humerus compared to a very robust right arm, a possible example of fluctuating asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry results from developmental disturbances and is more common in populations under stress and can therefore be <b>informative</b> <b>about</b> the quality of conditions a dinosaur lived under. A specimen of Dilophosaurus from the University of California Museum of Paleontology labelled as UCMP 37302 displays eight different pathologies to its pectoral girdle and forelimb bones, including three bone tumors, broken and re-healed bones on both arms, deformed digits and an inability to utilize one forelimb. Though it is not certain, it is believed that most or all of the injuries on this specimen were acquired in a fight or an accident and that the theropod would have been in severe pain as it healed. The pathologies of this specimen were documented in the journal PLOS One.|$|E

500|$|Bernard Perusse of The Gazette {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than the 2006 biography [...] by Johnny Rogan. In {{a review of the}} book for The Palm Beach Post, Lisa McDonough wrote [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late To Stop Now is not the final answer on Morrison – only Morrison could give that – but he does provide insights and updates as well as a solid background on Morrison's early life." [...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very <b>informative</b> <b>about</b> the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is well worth the asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To Stop Now is more suited to the coffee table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold the pictures in place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E

50|$|People usually intend {{socially}} desirable outcomes, hence {{socially desirable}} outcomes are not <b>informative</b> <b>about</b> a person's intention or disposition.

5000|$|One may {{compare this}} to the [...] "category utility hypothesis" [...] {{proposed}} by : [...] "A category is useful {{to the extent that}} it can be expected to improve the ability of a person to accurately predict the features of instances of that category." [...] Mill here seems to be suggesting that the best category structure is one in which object features (properties) are maximally <b>informative</b> <b>about</b> the object's class, and, simultaneously, the object class is maximally <b>informative</b> <b>about</b> the object's features. In other words, a useful classification scheme is one in which we can use category knowledge to accurately infer object properties, and we can use property knowledge to accurately infer object classes. One may also compare this idea to Aristotle's criterion of counter-predication for definitional predicates, as well as to the notion of concepts described in formal concept analysis.|$|E
