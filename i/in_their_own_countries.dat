5|$|The pound {{sterling}} is {{the currency used}} in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue {{to have the right}} to issue banknotes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries,</b> the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. The Commercial Bank of Wales, established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. The Royal Mint, who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. Since decimalisation, in 1971, at least one of the coins in UK circulation has depicted a Welsh design, e.g. the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). However, Wales has not been represented on any coin minted from 2008.|$|E

For example, some firms that did business with Arab countries officially complied with the boycott, but in practice subcontracted their trade with Israel to companies already blacklisted by the Arab states, while others did business with Israel through divisions or affiliates whose links to the company were disguised. Others strove to cultivate good personal relationships with Arab leaders, who {{would allow them to}} trade with Israel without economic repercussions <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries</b> as a favor.

25|$|Some {{groups of}} Celtic fans express {{their support for}} Irish republicanism and the Irish Republican Army by singing or {{chanting}} about them at matches. IRA chanting {{has been described as}} being offensive, but opinion is divided on whether they are sectarian. UEFA head of communications William Gaillard, when talking about the matter in 2006, said that IRA chanting was a nationalist issue and was similar to fans of other clubs, such as Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, who support nationalist movements <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries.</b> He also stated that only in Balkan countries, where some fans show support for organisations that had engaged in ethnic cleansing, was the situation different because these organisations were by their nature discriminatory. He said that this did not apply to the IRA.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} noted the {{connection}} of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. The implication of this connection is that attachment-related experiences (and perhaps attachment itself) may alter as young children's experience of care change historically. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers and being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also {{made it more difficult}} for childless people to adopt infants <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries,</b> and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and even gained some legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.|$|E
25|$|The UN {{held the}} third global women's conference in Nairobi. During the conference, Maathai {{arranged}} {{seminars and presentations}} to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and Helvi Sipilä, the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement {{and led to the}} movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya {{over the next three years}} to learn how to set up similar programs <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries</b> to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairman of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organization.|$|E

25|$|The tournament {{began on}} 1 October 1999 {{in the newly}} built Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, with Wales beating Argentina in a hard fought game 23–18 to get their {{campaign}} off to a positive start. The Pool stage of the tournament played out as was widely expected with the Tri Nations teams of New Zealand (who inflected a massive 101–3 win against Italy at the McAlpine Stadium in Huddersfield), South Africa and Australia all winning their pools easily without losing a single game. For the then Five Nations Championship teams who all played their pool matches <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries</b> {{it was a case}} of mixed fortunes with France winning their pool without losing a game. Host Wales also won their pool, though they suffered 31–38 defeat at the hands of Samoa in front of a home crowd at the Millennium Stadium. However, as expected England, Ireland and Scotland all finished second in their pools and were forced to try to qualify for the quarter-finals via the play-offs alongside fellow runners-up Samoa and Fiji, and Argentina as the best third placed side from all five pools.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the World Congress, the line of the International Leadership was {{generally}} accepted by groups around the world, including the U.S. SWP whose leader, James P. Cannon, corresponded with the French majority to support the tactic of entrism sui generis. At the same time, however, Cannon, Healy and Mandel were deeply concerned by Pablo's political evolution. Cannon and Healy were also alarmed by Pablo's intervention into the French section, and by suggestions that Pablo might use the International's authority in this way in other sections of the Fourth International that felt entrism [...] "sui generis" [...] was not a suitable tactic <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries.</b> In particular, minority tendencies, exemplified in Britain by John Lawrence and in the U.S. by Bert Cochran, to support entrism [...] "sui generis" [...] hinted that Pablo's support for their views indicated that the International might also demand Trotskyists in those countries adopt that tactic.|$|E
500|$|Authors {{considering}} attachment in non-Western {{cultures have}} noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time.

For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers or being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change has {{made it more difficult}} for childless people to adopt infants <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>countries.</b> There has been {{an increase in the number}} of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources in first-world countries. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and gained legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time. Issues have been raised to the effect that the [...] model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences, as infants often have multiple relationships within the family and in child care settings. It is suggested these multiple relationships influence one another reciprocally, at least within a family.|$|E
