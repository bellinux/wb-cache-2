500|$|A pearl {{is created}} in the mantle of a mollusk when an {{irritant}} particle is surrounded by layers of nacre. Although most bivalves can create pearls, oysters in the family Pteriidae and freshwater mussels in the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae are {{the main source of}} commercially available pearls because the calcareous concretions produced by most other species have no lustre. Finding pearls inside oysters is a very chancy business as hundreds of shells may need to be pried open before a single pearl can be found. Most pearls are now obtained from cultured shells where an <b>irritant</b> <b>substance</b> has been purposefully introduced to induce the formation of a pearl. A [...] "mabe" [...] (irregular) pearl can be grown by the insertion of an implant, usually made of plastic, under a flap of the mantle and next to the mother-of-pearl interior of the shell. A more difficult procedure is the grafting of a piece of oyster mantle into the gonad of an adult specimen together with the insertion of a shell bead nucleus. This produces a superior, spherical pearl. The animal can be opened to extract the pearl after about two years and reseeded so that it produces another pearl. Pearl oyster farming and pearl culture is an important industry in Japan and many other countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
40|$|The {{anti-inflammatory}} effect of various substances {{was measured in}} rats implanted with cotton wool pellets. Injection or implantation of irritant materials decreased the deposition of granulation tissue on the pellets. As the amount of irritant material increased there was a corresponding decrease {{in the amount of}} tissue deposited on the pellets. There is evidence that this could not be explained by a limit to the amount of granulation tissue available within the body, and competition for it between the cotton pellets and the implanted substances. An alternative hypothesis that an anti-inflammatory substance is produced at the site of irritation (the site of implantation of the <b>irritant</b> <b>substance,</b> such as polyester sponges) was investigated. The evidence obtained supports this hypothesis. Inflammatory exudate, squeezed from polyester sponges which had been implanted subcutaneously in the backs of adrenalectomized rats. The substance responsible for this effect is probably not a steroid, and is not normally present in the plasma of adrenalectomized animals. There is, however, some (although not conclusive) evidence that it is present in the plasma of animals in which sponges have been implanted. It {{does not appear to be}} produced by incubation in vitro of plasma with sponge. The significance of these observations is discussed...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the relationship between irritant substances exposure with irritant contact dermatitis to sanding workers in PT X Jepara. The type and design of this study was an observational study using cross sectional approach. The instruments of this research are clinical examination by medical personnel, Personal Dust Sampler, questionnaires and observation. The population which used in this study were 139 with a sample of 60 sanding workers. The sampling technique that was use is proportionate stratified random sampling, and the data were analyzed using Chi Square test. The measurement results of respirable wood dust level showed the wood dust level exceed the Threshold Limit Value (TLV), which is 5 mg/m 3. The result of this study indicates there are 21, 7 % of workers who had irritant contact dermatitis. Based on correlation test, researcher concluded that age is not associated with iritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 368), there is no correlation between years of service with the occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 182), there is no correlation between personal hygiene with the occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 689), and wood dust exposure is associated with iritant contact dermatitis (p-value = 0, 005).

The effect of working as a gas station operator and the duration of work on the nasal mucociliary transport system is not yet known. Aim : Knowing the difference between nasal mucociliary transport time with a job as a gas station operator and duration of work. Methods : This study was an observational study with age matched case control design. Samples were 18 gas station officers around Tembalang Semarang and 18 students and officials at FK Undip Tembalang Semarang as the control group. Nasal mucociliary transport times were measured using saccharin test. Normality of the data was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk. Data were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test. Results : The mean nasal mucociliary transport time on gas station officers was 1222. 56 seconds while on non gas station officers was 892. 33 seconds. The Mann-Whitney test nasal mucociliary transport time on officers and non officers showed a significant difference (p = 0. 001), whereas {{there was no significant difference}} (p = 0. 075) when compared to the duration of work.

40|$|MHC class II {{molecules}} play {{an important}} role during tile sensitization phase of allergic contact dermatitis. To Study the influence of contact allergens on the expression of these molecules by murine epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), we performed a flow-cytofluorometric analysis of the Ia-antigen expression after in vivo application of contact allergens. A distinct decrease in the Ia-antigen expression of the entire LC population was noticed 3 h after in vivo application of the contact allergen 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene(DNFB). This decrease was transient and balanced 24 h after in vivo application of DNFB. A downregulation was also detectable after in vivo application of the contact allergens 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (DNCB), oxazolone, K 2 Cr 2 O 7, 2, 4, 6 -trinitrochlorobenzene (TNCB), and toxic concentrations of the irritant compound sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In vitro studies showed that freshly prepared as well as 3 -d cultured LC downregulated their Ia-antigen expression in the presence of DNFB, which was used as a model compound. This decrease was not inhibited by the MHC class II molecule transport-inhibitor brefeldin A nor by the ionophore monensin. The inhibition of receptor-mediated end 0 cytosis with hypertonic media (0. 45 M sucrose) abolished the DNFB-mediated downregulation of Ia-antigen expression. An accelerated clearance of cell-surface-expressed antibody-labeled IA molecules was detectable in the presence of DNFB. Internalization studies carried out with peroxidase-labeled anti-IA-antibody complexes showed remarkable alterations in the intracellular distribution of endocytosed material under the influence of subtoxic concentrations of DNFB, DNCB, K 2 Cr 2 O 7, and TNCB. The <b>irritant</b> <b>substance</b> sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) influenced the intracellular distribution pattern of internalized material only when used in toxic concentrations. An augmented participation of MHC class II molecules in endocytotic processes is mediated by reactive substances like contact allergens and might contribute to the processing and presentation of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|The skin is {{the largest}} organ {{in the body and}} one of its main {{functions}} is to protect the body from noxious substances, whether they are ultraviolet radiation, toxic chemicals or prolonged/repeated exposure to water. It is the level of exposure that determines if damage to the organism will result. The harm that can occur to the skin with sufficient exposure will be considered. Contact dermatitis, halogen acne, chemical depigmentation, connective tissue diseases and skin cancer are the conditions that will be covered in this chapter, as environmental exposure is important in their aetiologies. Systemic absorption will not be dealt with. Most environmental exposure to harmful substances will occur at work, but exposure may occur at home or during normal day-to-day activities. Dermatitis Contact dermatitis is an eczematous eruption caused by external agents. The causes can be broadly divided into irritant substances that have a direct toxic effect on the skin, and allergic chemicals where immune hypersensitivity reactions occur. Irritant contact dermatitis Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is caused by direct damage of the skin by the <b>irritant</b> <b>substance.</b> It develops if the exposure of the substance or substances is sufficient or the skin is particularly susceptible as is found in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. The commonest irritants found in the environment are: soaps, detergents, water, solvents and a dry atmosphere. The occurrence of irritant contact dermatitis depends upon the degree of exposure. Most of us do not develop ICD when washing our own hair but an apprentice hairdresser is at high risk of developing dermatitis because the exposure to shampoo and water is so great. Irritant contact dermatitis is very common with at least 10 % of the population suffering from hand dermatitis 1. An infant’s skin is more susceptible to irritant damage than adult skin...|$|E
40|$|Acute skin {{irritation}} is the reversible inflammatory {{response of the}} epidermis to a topically applied <b>irritant</b> <b>substance.</b> A tissue engineered model of the epidermis is used to test chemicals. The degree of development of the model needs to be carefully judged {{in order to get}} the correct proportion of proliferating through to differentiated phenotypes for normal function. This judgement typically necessitates over sensitive models with an underdeveloped barrier functionality, as opposed to an insensitive model due to terminal differentiation and low numbers of basal keratinocytes. It has been reported that the lack of proliferative epidermal cells in cultures may be due to the absence of fibroblasts. Paracrine signalling in response to potential irritants is required for propagating an acute inflammatory response. The aim of this thesis is to develop a skin model using a Three Dimensional scaffold that accurately mimics the micro-environment at the DEJ, for supporting keratinocyte and fibroblast self-organisation. We hypothesise that it takes a full thickness skin model with a complete cascade of inflammatory stimuli and cytokine signalling to provide a real indication of irritation. Initial studies focused on Alvetex® (Reinnervate Ltd.), a highly porous polystyrene scaffold, with the aim of developing a skin model using the immortalised cell line HaCaT (human adult low calcium high temperature) keratinocytes or NhKs, in co-culture with dermal fibroblasts. Skin models using electrospun biodegradable polymer scaffolds made of Poly L-lactide (PLLA) and a Poly L-lactide/Polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate/Poly L-lactide (PLLA/PHBV/PLLA) composites were then developed. Issues with achieving epidermal-dermal separation in the Alvetex® scaffold due to keratinocyte entrapment lead to an Alvetex®-PHBV Bilayer. Concentration of the SDS needed to illicit an irritant response was deduced at 2 D to be 0. 1 - 0. 15 mM, 3 D submerged to be 0. 33 - 0. 5 mM and for 3 D air-liquid models were at best unaffected by 8 mM SDS with a Bilayer scaffold of PHBV-PLLA...|$|E

40|$|Skin {{reactions}} to 40 % nonanoic acid in propanol (NON) and to 4 % hydrochloric acid {{were evaluated by}} image analysis of 20 MHz B scan recordings (Dermascan C, Cortex Technology). 18 women, aged 18 to 45, were patch tested with 24 -h application time, and clinical and instrumental evaluations were performed {{at the beginning of}} the experiment, and 24 and 48 h after patch testing. To check possible regional variations in reactivity to NON and HCl, both substances were applied 2 x on the same forearm. As control tests, saline solution, propanol and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) 3 % were applied. Echographic images were processed by a program enabling numerical representation of picture data, based on attribution of fictional values to the echoes' amplitudes, selection of amplitude bands of interest, binary transformation of the image, and calculation of the extension of areas reflecting within the same amplitude range. Sonographic recordings were evaluated by an amplitude interval marking hyporeflecting parts of the dermis (corresponding to edema and inflammatory infiltration), and by a band highlighting the entrance echo (epidermis). Our evaluations showed that extension of the hypoechogenic area of the dermis increases according to intensity of inflammatory reaction for all <b>irritant</b> <b>substances.</b> A clear decrease in reflectivity of the epidermis echo at 24 h was visible at SLS patch test test sites, whereas at patch test sites performed with NON and HCl, there was a trend towards an increase in values of hyperreflecting pixels. No significant variations between data recorded at proximal compared to distal skin sites were observed for NON and HCl. In conclusion, the echographic technique provides a method for quantification of the dermal inflammatory reaction, and also for description of skin reactions induced by <b>irritant</b> <b>substances,</b> according to their specific epidermal effects...|$|R

The impacts of improvement in other aspects of burn care have not been mirrored in treatment of smoke inhalation. Smoke is heterogeneous and unique to each fire; it comprises particulates, respiratory irritants and systemic toxins as well as heat, all contributing to the pathological insult. Thermal injury below the vocal cords is rare because of effective heat dissipation in the upper airway. Particulate matter is the chief contributor to the pathophysiology of smoke inhalation injury, which has been extensively described.

Avoiding unnecessary animal testing is a central aim of the EU REACH chemicals legislation; therefore we sought to verify the profile using additional data. The OECD’s eChemPortal was searched for substances that had both a 28 -day and a 90 -day study and their robust study summaries were then examined from the ECHA CHEM database. Out of 182 substances with high quality 28 -day and 90 -day study results, only 18 reported no toxicity of any kind in the (sub) acute tests. However, for 16 of these there were also no reported signs of toxicity at or close to the limit dose (1000 mg/kgbw/d) in the 90 -day study.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{respiratory tract}} is densely innervated by autonomic and sensory nerves around airways and blood vessels. Subsets of these nerves contain {{a number of}} putative neurotransmitter peptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in sensory nerves and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), possibly serving autonomic functions. CGRP {{is also found in}} endocrine cells in rat airway epithelium. These peptides are all pharmacologically potent effectors of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle and bronchial secretion. Their functions in vivo are less well established. We have therefore examined the effects of inhaled acrolein, a sensory irritant, on three pulmonary neuropeptides: CGRP, substance P, and VIEP. Groups of rats (n = 3 each) were exposed for 10 min to acrolein in air (Ct = 510, 1858, and 5693 mg. min/m 3) or to air alone. Fifteen minutes later they were killed (pentabarbitone IP) and their respiratory tracts were dissected and fixed in 0. 4 % p-benzoquinone solution. Cryostat sections were stained by indirect immunofluorescence for a general nerve marker (PGP 9. 5) and neuropeptides. The acrolein-treated animals had a dose-related decrease in tracheal substance P- and CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers compared with controls. No change was seen in total nerve flber distribution and number (PGP 9. 5) or VIP immunoreactivity, nor in CGRP-immunoreactive epithelial endocrine cells. It is concluded that the rat tracheal peptidergic nerves are a sensitive indicator of inhaled <b>irritant</b> <b>substances.</b> Their reduced immunoreactivity may be because of a release of sensory neuropeptides that could {{play a role in the}} physiological response to irritant or toxic compounds...|$|R

The intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of either capsaicin or AITC (0. 03 – 10 mg/kg) induced short-term (up to 20 min) and dose-dependent abdominal nociception, and also produced c-fos expression in spinal afferents of the dorsal horn. TRPV 1 antagonism prevented (94 ± 4 % inhibition) nociception induced by capsaicin but not by AITC. In contrast, the TRPA 1 antagonism almost abolished AITC-induced nociception (95 ± 2 % inhibition) without altering the capsaicin response. Moreover, nociception induced by either capsaicin or AITC was reduced by the desensitisation of TRPV 1 -positive sensory fibres with resiniferatoxin (73 ± 18 and 76 ± 15 % inhibitions, respectively) and by the NK 1 receptor antagonist aprepitant (56 ± 5 and 53 ± 8 % inhibitions, respectively). Likewise, the i. p. injections of capsaicin or AITC increased the content of substance P in the peritoneal fluid. Nevertheless, neither the mast cell membrane stabiliser cromoglycate, nor the H 1 antagonist promethazine, nor depletion of peritoneal macrophages affected abdominal nociception induced either by capsaicin or AITC. Accordingly, neither capsaicin nor AITC increased the histamine content in the peritoneal fluid or provoked peritoneal mast cell degranulation in vitro. Collectively, our findings suggest that TRPV 1 and TRPA 1 stimulation in the peritoneum produces abdominal nociception that is mediated by sensory fibres activation...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at preparing, characterising and {{evaluating}} in situ gel formulations based on a blend of two hydrophilic polymers i. e. poloxamer 407 (P 407) and poloxamer 188 (P 188) for a sustained ocular delivery of ketorolac tromethamine (KT). Drug-polymer interaction studies were performed using {DSC} and FT-IR. The gelation temperature (Tsol-gel), gelation time, rheological behaviour, mucoadhesive characteristics of these gels, transcorneal permeation and ocular irritation as well as toxicity was investigated. {DSC} and FT-IR studies revealed {{that there may be}} electrostatic interactions between the drug and the polymers used. {P 188 } modified the Tsol/gel of {P 407 } bringing it close to eye temperature (35 °C) compared with the formulation containing {P 407 } alone. Moreover, gels that comprised {P 407 } and {P 188 } exhibited a pseudoplastic behaviour at different concentrations. Furthermore, mucoadhesion study using mucin discs showed that in situ gel formulations have good mucoadhesive characteristics upon increasing the concentration of P 407. When comparing formulations {PP 11 } and PP 12, the work of adhesion decreased significantly (P < 0. 001) from 377. 9 ± 7. 79 mN. mm to 272. 3 ± 6. 11 mN. mm. In vitro release and ex vivo permeation experiments indicated that the in situ gels were able to prolong and control {KT} release as only 48 of the {KT} released within 12 h. In addition, the HET-CAM and {BCOP} tests confirmed the non-irritancy of {KT} loaded in situ gels, and HET-CAM test demonstrated the ability of ocular protection against strongly <b>irritant</b> <b>substances.</b> {MTT} assay on primary corneal epithelial cells revealed that in situ gel formulations loaded with {KT} showed reasonable and acceptable percent cell viability compared with control samples...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco consumption, {{that leads}} to three million deaths every year of which about one million occur in {{developing}} countries is a social evil(1). Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture {{of as many as}} 4700 individual constituents including carcinogens, <b>irritants,</b> ciliotoxic <b>substances</b> and poisonous gases. There is no dearth of information about the health hazards to smokers. it has been implicated as a major risk factor in a variety of chronic diseases including cardiac, cerebrovascular, malignant, respiratory and other diseases (2), Most of the smoking related lung diseases (e. g. chronic obstructive lung disease and lung carcinoma) are dose dependent. it is often the cumulative dose of smoking which determines the risk. Parameters like pack-year (PY) have been used to express exposure to tobacco smoke. One PY implies one packet of cigarettes (or 20 gms. tobacco) smoked each day over a course of one year (3). In India the number of cigarettes and bidis per packet is quite variable. A standard packet of cigarette and bidis per packet is quite variable...|$|R
30|$|The {{traditional}} in vivo Draize irritation {{test for}} skin and eyes, {{in which a}} restrained, conscious animal is exposed (dermal and ocular, respectively) to a test substance for a set {{amount of time to}} determine toxicological effects, has long since been criticized for the limitations in species differences, subjective scoring, and experimental variability. The replacement of the Draize test for skin irritation was historically one of the first steps towards the full replacement of animal testing. BASF, and similar chemical companies, use two methods suitable to provide data for classification as corrosive (Epiderm™ skin corrosion test) or irritant (Epiderm™ skin irritation test) to the skin. These tests are employed {{within the context of a}} simple testing strategy described elsewhere [47 – 50]. In brief, a test substance is applied topically to a reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) that closely mimics the biochemical and physiological properties of the upper parts of the human skin using human derived non-transformed keratinocytes as cell sources. The indication of corrosive and <b>irritant</b> test <b>substances</b> is determined by their ability to decease cell viability (cytotoxicity) below defined threshold levels as measured via the MTT-assay.|$|R
40|$|However, the creams which {{contained}} no perfumes showed no fluorescent reactions, so I assumed the fluorescent substances {{might be in}} the combined perfumes. I investigated the intensity of fluorescent grade of 59 sort of natural or artificial oils of perfumes by fluorescent electrophotometer and recorded its colour by using 2 ̆ 2 International Colour degree Table 2 ̆ 2. Its result showed that the most strong fluorescent were noticed in Bergamott group than another. In animal experiments, I applied the patch test with absorptions ointment mixture of various percent of isolated fluorescent substances on the pinnes of rabbits, and irradiated the ultravioletaays. The animal experiment result showed apparently the causative significance compaired with contrast group. As I mentioned above, I assumed that one of the causative agents of cosmetic dermatitis were the photodynamic action of fluorescent suabstance in cosmetic cream, so I advice to the makers, it is necessary to select the perfume {{in order to avoid the}} cosmetsc dermatitis. I had attention in our clinic for several years that higt rate of woman face dermatitis would be of cosmetic origin. I attempt to clear up the causes of cosmetic dermatitis and examined some etiological factor in cosmetic cream. I studied 101 cases which supposed the cosmetic causes in their history. The main site of predilection were cheek, eyelid and neck, but also seldom appears on the dorsal surface of the hand and forearm. Most of them showed further sharply bounded fresh red erythema (25 cases); erythema, edematous papules, slight desquamation (67 cases); erythema, papules, vesicules, exudation and crusts (7 cases); pigmentation (2 cases), and all cases were usually acompanied with pruritus. The age of the patients were uaually in young woman, especially at 16 - 30 years, and the beginning of the disease were approximately 60 percent of cases at March to August. Such seasonable distribution may suggested the relation this disorder and ultraviolet wavelength. The patch test were performed in those patients with suspected cosmetics, its results showed 16. 4 percent positive in cosmetic creams and 6. 3 percent positive in cosmetic lotions. Three typical cases were presented in more detail. In some cosmetics, which were called medicated cosmetic cream, contained <b>irritant</b> <b>substances</b> such as Bismut or Mercury, and apparently this substances causes the contact dermatitis in some individuals, but at another cosmetic cream (except the speciality of contained Vitamins, Hormons or Proteins), these specific character would be considered upon the combined perfumes. It is prolable that some relation may present between cosmetic injury and ultraviolet ray of sunlight. I isolated the fluorescent substances with 10 percent hydrochrolic acid dilution and ether from each marketly creams, and estimated the intensity of fluorescent. All marketly creams showed the presence of more or less fluorescent substances, but its component were uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco {{smoke is}} one of the {{greatest}} threats to human health and the leading cause of preventable death in the industrialized society. Among tobacco-containing products, cigarette represents the most commonly used. After cigarette combustion, a waste portion, defined as cigarette butt, is discarded. It consists of a filter, which retains in the matrix toxic smoke components, among which carcinogens and <b>irritant</b> <b>substances.</b> In spite of their benefits to smokers, cigarette filter pose a serious litter and toxic waste disposal problem, due to their not biodegradability and the persistence of many toxic chemicals. Therefore, cigarette butts need to be manipulated as special waste, with potential risks to human and environmental health. In present study, the genotoxicity risk of the cigarette butts was evaluated in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. Then, the ability of the natural sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene (CRY) and β-caryophyllene oxide (CRYO) to inhibit their mutagenicity was studied, as a possible prevention strategy. A methanolic extract from the smoked Marlboro Silver cigarette residues (CBE, cigarette butt extract) was used as butt sample. The mutagenic effect of CBE was evaluated on Salmonella tiphymurium TA 98 and TA 100 and Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA strains, both in the absence and presence of an exogenous CYP 450 -enriched metabolic activator (S 9) (Di Sotto et al., 2014). Thereafter, the antimutagenicity of CRY and CRYO was studied against CBE. In order to study the potential mechanism involved in the antimutagenicity of the extracts, three different protocols (pre-, co- and post-treatment) were applied. Results obtained showed that CBE produced mutagenic effects (increasing about twice the number of revertant colonies) in all the strains tested but only in the presence of the exogenous metabolic activator S 9. The concentration of 0. 3 mg/ml produced a sub-maximal mutagenic effect in all strains and was used in the antimutagenicity assay. Both sesquiterpenes (CRY 0. 43 - 1. 7 mg/m and CRYO 0. 09 - 0. 34 mg/ml) significantly reduced the CBE-induced revertant colonies, although with different potency and specificity. Antimutagenicity of CRY and CRYO was similar in S. tiphymurium strains, in all treatments. In contrast, CRYO was the most active compound in E. coli WP 2 uvrA, being the antimutagenic effect strong at all concentrations and protocols, while the CBE-mutagenicity inhibition produced by CRY was mostly moderate. In cell survival experiments, test compounds never produced cytotoxic effects in the presence of CBE. Present results allow hypothesize the involvement of multiple mechanisms (both desmutagenic and bioantimutagenic) in the antimutagenicity of the sesquiterpenes tested. Taking into account the potential toxicity due to cigarette butt exposure, also considering the mutagenic power here highlighted, CRY and CRYO appear to be possible further candidates as environmental decontaminants against this hazardous waste...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} European Respiratory Society work-related asthma {{guidelines}} is {{to present}} the management and prevention options of work-related asthma and their effectiveness. Work-related asthma accounts for 5 - 25 % of all adult asthma cases and is responsible for a significant socioeconomic burden. Several hundred occupational agents, mainly allergens but also <b>irritants</b> and <b>substances</b> with unknown pathological mechanisms, {{have been identified as}} causing work-related asthma. The essential message of these guidelines is that the management of work-related asthma can be considerably optimised based on the present knowledge of causes, risk factors, pathomechanisms, and realistic and effective interventions. To reach this goal we urgently require greatly intensified primary preventive measures and improved case management. There is now a substantial body of evidence supporting the implementation of comprehensive medical surveillance programmes for workers at risk. Those workers who fail surveillance programmes need to be referred to a clinician who can confirm or exclude an occupational cause. Once work-related asthma is confirmed, a revised risk assessment in the workplace is needed to prevent further cases. These new guidelines confirm and extend already existing statements and recommendations. We hope that these guidelines will initiate the much-needed research that is required to fill the gaps in our knowledge and to initiate substantial improvements in preventative measures. © ERS 2012...|$|R
40|$|Irritants – in {{this article}} to be {{understood}} as being chemical <b>irritants</b> – are <b>substances</b> that may cause injuries to the skin, the eyes or the airways after a single exposure. These injuries may range from small, initially invisible injuries after exposure to weak irritants up to chemical burns after exposure to very strong irritants (i. e. corrosive substances). Prolonged or repeated exposure to weak irritants or a single exposure to stronger irritants may result in lasting health effects such as (irritative) eczema or asthma. Irritants are present in very many sectors and occupations. Irritants and the products containing them may be identified by means of their classification and labelling Labelling of chemicals as well as by using various existing lists. Prevention should include combinations of measures at source, technical and organisational measures, personal protection and hygiene, and early warning...|$|R
30|$|Most {{cosmetic}} products contain fragrances, {{many of which}} are sensitizers [11 – 14]. It seems to be rather difficult to produce scented personal care products with fragrances that are not labelled. I found that out of 111 fragrances frequently applied in cosmetics and washing and cleansing products 106 were classified in the C&L Inventory. Most of them are skin sensitizers or eye <b>irritants.</b> Also natural <b>substances</b> can be sensitizers and irritants, e.g. essential oils. Some products consist of a large fraction of fragrances, for example aftershave lotion contains 10 % fragrances. Normally, mixtures which are not classified as sensitizing but contain at least one sensitizing substance in a concentration equal or greater than 0.1 % must bear the supplemental label EUH 208 ‘Contains (name of sensitizing substance) … May produce an allergic reaction.’ ([1] Annex II Part 2 2.8) Table 1 (C). This supplemental label element would be relevant for most {{cosmetic products}}, but it is again not applied to them because they are excluded from the CLP Regulation in general.|$|R
